An Afghan journalist working for CTV has been designated an " unlawful enemy combatant " by the U.S. military , after being held for four months without charge .
Jawed Ahmad , also known as Jojo Yazemi , went before an enemy combatant review board , which determined there was " credible information " to detain him further as a danger to foreign troops and the Afghan government , a U.S. spokesperson said yesterday .
He is being held at Bagram , north of Kabul .
Maj .
Chris Belcher , spokesperson for the U.S. - led coalition , told the Associated Press Ahmad was allowed to make a statement to the review board , and " was in no way targeted because of his work as a journalist . "
It was unclear if he was represented by a lawyer .
CTV
News president Robert Hurst said his company " continues to be deeply concerned about Ahmad 's well - being .
We are continuing to work all diplomatic channels available to find out additional information and get Jojo his due process . "
Ahmad , who is in his early 20s , had also worked as a freelance fixer for the Star .
" It is distressing to hear allegations such as these without being shown a single piece of supporting evidence , " said Star Europe bureau chief Mitch Potter , for whom Ahmad did freelance translation and field work in Kandahar in 2006 .
Earlier this week , the New York - based Committee to Protect Journalists issued a statement asking U.S. authorities to disclose evidence and specify charges against Ahmad , after holding him since Oct. 26 .
" We urge military officials to either charge ( Ahmad ) with a recognizable criminal offence , or if they have no intention of doing so , to release him immediately , " said CPJ executive director Joe Simon .
Ahmad 's brother , Siddique Ahmad , told reporters the military accused Jawed of having contact with local Taliban fighters .
Journalists ' organizations note that Afghan journalists often have contact with the Taliban , in order to get information for stories they are assigned .
Ahmad was detained in Kandahar , the southern area where Canadian troops are based – and one of the most Taliban - infiltrated areas .
Potter described him as a " diminutive man who probably weighs 120 lbs. and could find it difficult to withstand a lot of pressure . "
Human rights groups have protested reports of ill - treatment of prisoners at the Bagram base .
Ahmad is one of the latest local journalists to be detained by the U.S. in Afghanistan or Iraq .
AP 's Iraqi photographer Bilal Hussein has been held without charge in Iraq for 22 months .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Complaints about potential mortgage fraud are up during the subprime mortgage crisis , and the FBI has opened criminal investigations of 14 companies related to subprime mortgage loans , the agency said Tuesday .
The FBI is examining 14 companies for possible fraud in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis .
The FBI did not identify the companies .
Neil Power , chief of the FBI economic crimes unit , attributed the increase " to good old - fashioned greed . "
" On insider trading , we 're looking in some cases at whether executives were aware that the value of their holdings would be going down and the executives traded on that information , " said Power .
" On accounting fraud , we 're looking at housing developers who may have reported cash reserve accounts to reflect falsely inflated values , " he told CNN .
Power and other senior officials said the number of suspicious activity reports they review for potential investigation skyrocketed from 3,000 in fiscal year 2003 to about 35,000 in 2006 , to 48,000 in 2007 .
And in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 , Power said , officials have already received 15,000 such reports , putting them on pace to receive 60,000 complaints this year .
The FBI said it investigates only cases involving losses of $ 500,000 or more , and last year 56 percent of all cases had losses of more than $ 1 million .
The number of pending cases swelled from 800 in fiscal year 2006 to 1,200 in 2007 .
Kenneth Kaiser , FBI assistant director for the Criminal Investigative Division , said the FBI has developed an initiative focused on subprime mortgage loan fraud and is working with investigators from other federal agencies .
Officials identified the states that are the " top 10 mortgage fraud hot spots " as California , New York , Texas , Florida , Georgia , Utah , Illinois , Indiana , Ohio and Michigan .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama would be marginally more active in enforcing anti-monopoly laws while Republicans Mike Huckabee and John McCain were harder to predict , antitrust experts said .
Overall , none of the leading presidential candidates is considered an antitrust maverick although Democrats have had a reputation for being more aggressive than Republicans in challenging mergers .
This party difference may even be disappearing .
“ This is about incremental changes for the most part , not a revolution , ” said Bert Foer , president of the American Antitrust Institute .
Of the leading presidential candidates , most is known about Hillary Clinton ’s views on antitrust because of her work as a senator and her role in her husband ’s presidency .
If she is elected , “ there ’ll be a return to the Clinton era of antitrust , which was actually more centrist , ” said attorney Mike Keeley of Axinn , Veltrop and Harkrider LLP .
Clinton is also one of the few candidates who has directly weighed in on an antitrust issue .
In October she co-sponsored a Senate bill to undo a Supreme Court decision that tossed out a 96 - year - old law barring manufacturers from dictating minimum prices -- a practice that hurts discounters .
CLINTON , OBAMA SEEN SIMILAR
Ben Sharp of Perkins Coie said he expected a Clinton administration would have a competition policy that was “ serious and vigorous with a new emphasis on antitrust . ”
Sharp ’s firm is counsel to the Obama campaign but he is not involved in the campaign work .
For example , the current Justice Department will likely approve a joint venture by SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Co , the second - and third - largest U.S. beer makers , said Sharp .
“ I doubt very much that it would have got approval under the Clinton administration , ” he said .
Clinton and Obama likely hold similar views on enforcing anti-monopoly statutes , opposing price - fixing and other competition issues , according to several lawyers .
Obama ’s time teaching law at the University of Chicago , where pro-market emphasis is strong , would affect his antitrust views , Sharp said .
But Hamilton Loeb of Paul , Hastings LLP disagreed , saying Obama had studied law at Harvard Law School , where “ the prevalent antitrust theory was more moderate . ”
“ I do n’t think that people see a real difference between Obama and Clinton ” in competition policy , added Loeb .
Of the Democrats , former Sen. John Edwards , who is struggling after defeats in Iowa and New Hampshire , was the “ most likely to be aggressive on antitrust , ” said Keeley .
Edwards has campaigned on a populist , anti-corporate greed theme .
The administration of President George W. Bush has been perceived as more relaxed , approving , for example , the controversial 2006 merger of Whirlpool Corp and Maytag Corp , despite estimates they made about 70 percent of U.S. washers and dryers .
One of the big antitrust cases of the past 20 years arose out of the Clinton administration ’s decision to join with a group of states in 1998 to accuse Microsoft Corp of abusing its dominant position in computer operating systems .
“ And then when a new administration ( Bush ) came in , they not only settled the case but excluded the staff who had worked on it , ” said Foer of the American Antitrust Institute .
The Justice Department argues the remedy agreement was well - crafted and successful in addressing the court findings .
Loeb contends there has been considerable continuity over the past 20 years .
Presidents George H. W. Bush , Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were all “ pretty similar ” in their enforcement policy , he said .
REPUBLICAN WILD CARD
Turning to the Republican race , former Arkansas Governor Huckabee , who won the Republican caucuses in Iowa and is one of the few non-lawyers in the race , is “ the biggest wild card , ” said Keeley .
“ There ’s really no track record there . ”
Sharp , of Perkins Coie , agreed .
“ He ’s a relative unknown .
I ’d be reasonably surprised if he ’d ever given it ( antitrust ) any thought , ” he said .
McCain , who won the Republican primary in New Hampshire last week , talks tough on business issues but experts said he is more opposed to wrongdoing than to big business itself .
“ With McCain , his emphasis on attacking business appears to be based more on ( concern about ) fraud and waste , ” said Keeley .
And Loeb , while calling McCain the hardest to predict , pointed to the senator ’s role in getting Orson Swindle named to the Federal Trade Commission , the other U.S. entity that enforces competition law .
Swindle , commissioner from 1997 - 2005 , fought in Vietnam and was a prisoner of war -- like McCain .
“ He turned out to be a moderate , ‘ facts and circumstances ’ kind of guy , ” said Loeb .
WHEN two undersea cables were damaged , apparently by ships ' anchors , five miles north of Alexandria on January 30th , it seemed like a reminder of the fragility of the internet .
The cables — one owned by FLAG Telecom , a subsidiary of India 's Reliance Group , the other ( SEA - ME - WE 4 ) by a consortium of 16 telecoms firms — carry almost 90 % of the data traffic that goes through the Suez canal .
When the connections failed , they took with them almost all internet links between Europe and the Gulf and South Asia .
Egypt lost 70 % of its internet connectivity immediately .
More than half of western India 's outbound capacity crashed , messing up the country 's outsourcing industry .
Over the next few days , as cable operators sought new routes , 75 m people from Algeria to Bangladesh saw internet links disrupted or cut off .
But when , on February 1st , another of FLAG Telecom 's cables was damaged , this time on the other side of the Arabian peninsula , west of Dubai , the story started to change .
As an internet user known as spyd3rweb wrote on digg.com , “ 1 cable = an accident ; 2 cables = a possible accident ; 3 cables = deliberately sabotaged . ”
The conspiracy theories started to take wing .
“ We need to ponder the possibility ” , declared a posting on defensetech.org , “ that these cable cuts were intentional malicious acts .
And even if the first incident was just an innocent but important accident , the second could well be a terrorist copycat event . ”
Or American villainy , said others .
A user called Blakey Rat reported that “ the US navy was at one point technically able to tap into undersea fibre - optic cables using a special chamber mounted on a support submarine . ”
A website called the Galloping Beaver asked , “ where is the USS Jimmy Carter ? ” — a nuclear attack submarine which had apparently vanished .
The notion that something spookier than ships ' anchors was to blame gained ground when Egypt 's transport ministry said it had studied video footage of the sea lanes where the cables had been , and no ships had crossed the line of the breakage for 12 hours before and after the accident ( the area is , in fact , off limits to shipping ) .
Suspicion spread when yet another cable — between Qatar and the United Arab Emirates — went down on February 3rd .
“ Beyond the realm of coincidence ! ” said a user of ArabianBusiness.com .
In fact , the fourth break was unsuspicious : the network was taken down by its operator because of a power failure .
But by that time the conspiracists were in overdrive .
Slashdot.org , a discussion board , said Iran had lost all internet access on February 1st .
“ A communications disruption can mean only one thing — invasion , ” said bigdavex , quoting a line from a “ Star Wars ” film .
Bloggers in Pakistan , having recovered from their disruption , returned with a vengeance .
The broken cables , they said , forced a delay in the opening of an oil bourse in Tehran ; this would have led , claimed pkpolitics.com , to the mass selling of dollars “ which would have instantly crashed [ the American ] economy ” .
Marcus Salek of New World Order 101.com ( nwo101.com ) added that “ President Putin ordered the Russian air force to take immediate action to protect the Russian nation 's vital undersea cables . ”
There is just one small problem : Iran 's internet connectivity was never lost .
Todd Underwood and Earl Zmijewski of Renesys , an internet - monitoring firm , reported that four - fifths of the 695 networks with connections in Iran were unaffected .
Most of the other theories dissolve under analysis , too .
Perhaps the American navy can bug fibre - optic cables but it 's not clear how .
A report for the European Parliament found in 2000 that “ optical - fibre cables do not leak radio frequency signals and cannot be tapped using inductive loops .
[ Intelligence agencies ] have spent a great deal of money on research into tapping optical fibres , reportedly with little success . ”
It may be rare for several cables to go down in a week , but it can happen .
Global Marine Systems , a firm that repairs marine cables , says more than 50 cables were cut or damaged in the Atlantic last year ; big oceans are criss - crossed by so many cables that a single break has little impact .
What was unusual about the damage in the Suez canal was that it took place at a point where two continents ' traffic is borne along only three cables .
More are being laid .
For the moment , there is only one fair conclusion : the internet is vulnerable , in places , but getting more robust .
Clintons Continue To Take As Many Political Risks As Possible
It 's the kind of thing our embassies abroad have come to dread : a British stag - do reveller arrested for gross behaviour in a historic European capital ; angry condemnation of " those English pigs " by interior ministers ; " shock " expressed by the reveller 's friends ; and , often , a less than sympathetic reaction from the courts of the country in question .
It is also an embarrassingly common occurrence .
This week it happened in Riga , capital of Latvia and one of the most popular destinations for British stags abroad , where an unnamed 34 - year - old was caught urinating on a revered monument and was given a custodial sentence .
It may not make much difference , but it has shone yet another uncomfortable light on the behaviour of Brits abroad .
Gone are the days when a stag - do was a session at the local pub the night before the big day .
They have now evolved into stag trips ; Nottingham and Brighton have been superseded by more far - flung destinations ; and one night of excess has morphed into a weekend – or more – of bingeing .
A combination of cheap flights and cheap alcohol has made the pre-marital overseas jaunt an accepted rite of passage for Britons of all backgrounds .

The Foreign Office estimates that 70 per cent of British stag and hen parties are now held abroad .
It adds that one in four of these run into some sort of trouble , ranging from lost money and passports to arrest and even prison .
The most recent survey on stag spending habits , by Morgan Stanley , suggested that the industry is now worth £ 532 m a year .
Most of this is spent by men : a survey from Teletext Holidays showed stags spend twice as much as hens on their pre-marital parties and are far more likely to travel abroad .
According to Matthew Mavir , owner of lastnightoffreedom.com , the two most popular destinations for stag weekends are currently Krakow and Riga .
" These two cities are both easy to navigate , there are flights going from all over the UK and British men generally believe that Polish and Latvian women are fit . "
1. Amsterdam
The Dutch city has long had something of a love - hate relationship with the hordes of British stags who descend upon it for its sleazy sex shows and pot -laced coffee houses .
New plans to eradicate most of the city 's infamous red - light district may well simplify that relationship , by wiping out Amsterdam 's chief allure for stag parties .
The city 's new deputy mayor , Lodewijk Asscher , has pledged to clean up the $ 100 m ( £ 51 m ) a year industry , much to the consternation of hotels and tour operators that thrive off the back of the legalised sex shows and prostitution .
HELL - RAISING RATING : 2
2. Dublin
One of the first famous overseas stag destinations , Dublin has for several years been regarded as something of a no - go area for large and loud stag parties .
The backlash began in 1997 after two revellers – from a stag group numbering more than 60 – attacked two policemen in the city 's famous Temple Bar area .
A year later large stag groups were banned and the city brought in a number of measures to empower bar staff and landlords to refuse to serve customers who look like they 've had enough .
Civilised stag parties are still accepted but do n't expect the Garda to look kindly on the type of barbarian hordes that head east .
HELL - RAISING RATING : 1
3. Cork
After Dublin cracked down on the craic ( see above ) , stags and hens wanting to celebrate their last days of freedom in Ireland began to head to the south - west instead .
But things soon started to go wrong .
In 2001 , an Oxfordshire reveller narrowly escaped jail when he admitted manslaughter after attacking a Cork resident with a golf club and pushing him into the river Lee , where he drowned .
Smaller towns such as Killarney and Kilkenny soon got in on the act – the later opened its first strip club in 2006 , but both have since imposed blanket bans on stag - dos or serving alcohol after 1.30 am .
HELL - RAISING RATING : 2
4. Barcelona
One of the few European cities equally popular with both hen and stag parties ( women tend to be less keen on the colder climes of central and Eastern Europe ) , Barcelona received a royal seal of approval in January last year when Freddie Windsor joined well - heeled friends for the stag - do of Lord Beaverbrook 's son Rory Aitken .
( The jaunt included visiting a sex show on Barcelona 's notoriously seedy Las Ramblas strip . )
But there has been a backlash from the Catalan government – in 2005 the city introduced a raft of measures to clamp down on drunken groups , with heavy on - the - spot fines for antisocial behaviour and a ban on drinking in the street .

5. Brussels

With 90 breweries making 400 different types of beer , it 's no surprise that Brussels is a top stag destination for beer - loving Brits .
So far , there have been relatively few reports of revellers getting into trouble .
Sadly the same cannot be said of Ostend , where , in 2002 , a British best man went missing during a stag weekend .
His body washed up two weeks later .
The other advantage of Brussels is that it is accessible by train – a plus for the environmentally - conscious .

6. Riga
Easy to navigate , with cheap beer and a plethora of low - cost flights to take you there , Riga has become one of the most popular stag - weekend destinations .
But the relationship between the Baltic city and British soon - to - be- weds has been a precarious one .
Leaving aside this week 's incident , a number of other Brits were arrested in Riga year , including a Scot was caught climbing on the same city - centre monument at the heart of the recent scandal .
Meanwhile , some British stags have complained of being frequently scammed by the Russian mafia , who own many of the city 's nightclubs and strip joints .
HELL - RAISING RATING : 4
7. Tallinn
Attractions offered by tour operators to visitors to the historic Estonian capital now include medieval lesbian strip shows ( apparently a tradition since " 1600 and phwoar " ) .
In 2003 and 2004 , Brits headed to the Estonian capital in their thousands , but the relationship has since soured a bit .
In recent years police have begun cracking down on lewd behaviour , and many bars and hotels have now banned stags parties altogether .
HELL - RAISING RATING : 4
8. Bratislava
The Slovakian capital 's Gothic spires and famous castle have endured a fairly tumultuous history .
Today the city faces a new kind of invader – marauding British stags .
The recent influx of rowdy but free - spending Brits was initially welcomed as a significant boon to a fragile economy .
In the past few months , however , authorities have moved to quell the disruption they cause .
In June last year Steven Mullone from Worcester was arrested for skinny - dipping in a fountain .
He was sentenced to two months in jail and only made it back home in time for his wedding after British diplomats lobbied hard on his behalf .
HELL - RAISING RATING : 3
9. Prague
Was once seen as the ultimate stag destination , but latest trends suggest that Prague may now be losing out to other central European cities and to the Baltic states .
According to the Foreign Office , more people lose their passports in the Czech Republic than in Greece , even though only a third as many Brits visit .
In 2004 , the Czech tourism board even went as far as to say that 20 per cent of all weekend crime in Prague was caused by British men on stag weekends .
HELL - RAISING RATING : 2
10 . Wroclaw
All but destroyed by the Battle of Breslau in 1945 , Wroclaw was painstakingly restored before a huge flood in 1997 left most of the city underwater .
Police have recently cracked down on public nudity and many bars and clubs have banned kilts .
A local newspaper , Dziennik , succinctly summed up the problem with kilt - wearers : " [ They ] leave behind broken tables and chairs in bars ... Then they stop people and lift up their kilts to show what 's underneath . "
HELL - RAISING RATING : 3
11 . Krakow
There was a time when most visitors to Krakow came to to explore its charming cobbled streets or to make an emotional visit to the nearby Auschwitz - Birkenau concentration camps .
Now it 's the cheap beer and abundant strip clubs that lure hordes of British stag parties each year .
Krakow is now one of the most popular stag and hen destinations in Europe .
It is especially popular with the Scots – so much so that last year many bars and clubs in the city , like in Wroclaw , introduced a ban on kilts after a spate of flashing incidents .
In 2005 , tragedy struck when Michael Forrester was left in a coma after being hit by a tram while celebrating his stag weekend .
HELL - RAISING RATING : 2
12 . Budapest
Budapest was where bon viveur Andrew Flintoff took his friends before his marriage last year .
( He lost his phone in the river . )
In 2000 the website BudapestPissup.com was launched , while Budapest - based airline AirWhizz has expanded its fleet , partly to cater for demand from stags and hens .

The FTC has a problem .
As the federal agency with the most responsibility for combating spyware , FTC Commissioners would love the power to slap down spyware vendors with massive fines or perhaps even toss them in jail for a while ( where they would be shown a computer screen covered with pop - up ads , one hopes ) .
Sadly , FTC commissioners are instead reduced to pleading their case at Congressional hearings and nonprofit luncheons while little action is taken .
In the meantime , spyware vendors continue to get slapped on the wrist with a wet noodle .
We pointed out the problem back in April , when the FTC Commissioners trudged up Capitol Hill to tell the Senate Commerce Committee just how badly it needs " civil penalty authority . "
Currently , the FTC has trouble imposing large fines because it can only do so in cases where 1 ) consumers suffer economic harm or 2 ) the company in question has profited from unlawful activity .
Quantifying consumer harm from spyware is so difficult as to be often impossible , while figuring out exactly what percentage of a company 's revenue has been earned from illicit sources can also be a nightmare .
Essentially , the FTC wants the ability to impose fines that are not directly tied to consumer loss or company profit .
The House has already passed a bill called the SPY ACT ( Securely Protect Yourself Against Cyber Trespass Act ) back in June , a bill that provides for much higher penalties against spyware vendors .
Despite the FTC's Senate appearance earlier in the year , however , the Senate has yet to take action on the measure .
( The House has also passed the competing I - SPY Act , which is more limited , and the Senate has n't acted on it , either . )
The Commissioners are therefore still schlepping themselves around DC , trying to drum up support for stiffer penalties .
Anne Broache over at CNet mentions that Commissioner Jon Leibowitz pitched the idea again yesterday at a lunch discussion hosted in part by the Stop Badware Project and the Center for Democracy & Technology .
He hit all the same notes as those sounded at the Senate hearing : it 's tough to impose large fines , and that makes FTC enforcement less effective .
Are the new bills going anywhere ?
It 's hard to know .
The House has passed similar legislation to the SPY ACT during both the 108th and 109th Congresses , but the Senate has refused to act on the measures .
While the FTC has pursued a few high - profile spyware vendors , government has been hard - pressed to cure the malware scourge in general .
Given the nature of the Internet , moving servers out of reach of any particular government has proven remarkably easy , and additional FTC enforcement powers wo n't change that .
But the agency can make a dent in the major spyware firms , since many of them are now keen to work with traditional advertisers and to be seen as legitimate companies .
Such firms could well run into difficulties if they relocate , say , to Uzbekistan .
But given that the FTC had only investigated 11 spyware vendors as of April 2007 , government enforcement needs to carry the threat of substantial penalties in order to have a real effect on the spyware industry , since the odds of a prosecution are low .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Pentagon on Wednesday said it was not worried about the security of Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons amid the political crisis there , rolling back from comments made by a senior U.S. general who called the issue a “ primary concern . ”
An army Chinook helicopter carries military supplies as it arrives in a temporary military base in Baluchi pass in Uruzgan province , November 2 , 2007 .
The U.S. military is looking at alternate routes to send supplies to troops in Afghanistan in case the political crisis in Pakistan makes current supply lines unavailable , the Pentagon said on Wednesday .
REUTERS / Goran Tomasevic
“ At this point , we have no concerns , ” said Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell .
“ We believe that they are under the appropriate control . ”
Last week , Lt. Gen. Carter Ham , director of operations for the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , said the military was concerned about the security of Pakistan ’s nuclear arsenal after President Pervez Musharraf imposed emergency rule and arrested thousands .
“ Any time there is a nation that has nuclear weapons that has experienced a situation such as Pakistan is at present , that is a primary concern , ” Ham said .
But U.S. defense and military officials have since backpedaled , saying the weapons are controlled by Pakistan ’s military and that the military is a responsible steward of the arsenal .
Pakistan carried out its first nuclear test in 1998 and experts estimate it has material for as many as 90 weapons .
Washington considers Pakistan an important ally in the U.S. - declared war on terrorism .
The U.S. military in particular works closely with Pakistani forces , especially along the Afghan border .
While the United States is reviewing all aid to Pakistan , which has received about $ 10 billion in U.S. funding since 2001 , the Pentagon has been careful to say the Defense Department did not want to “ punish ” Pakistan for Musharraf ’s declaration of emergency rule .
Still , Morrell said the U.S. military had begun looking at alternate routes to send supplies to its troops in Afghanistan in case the political crisis in Pakistan makes current supply lines unavailable .
The U.S. military sends 75 percent of its supplies for the Afghanistan war through or over Pakistan , including 40 percent of the fuel sent to troops , the Defense Department said .
“ There are efforts under way right now to figure out contingency supply lines to our troops in Afghanistan if it becomes necessary to alter the way we now support our troops in Afghanistan , ” Morrell said .
“ In light of the fact that there is civil unrest in Pakistan , in light of the fact that there is a state of emergency in Pakistan , we feel it is responsible , given the importance of the Pakistani supply lines to our operations in Afghanistan , to have a contingency plan . ”
Six years into the " global war on terror , " the Bush administration , Congress , and federal agencies are scrambling to address the health needs of battlefield veterans back from Iraq and Afghanistan .
President Bush acknowledges that the current means of caring for wounded and traumatized vets is " an antiquated system that needs to be changed . "
A bipartisan commission says the need for fundamental improvements in care management and the disability system " requires a sense of urgency and strong leadership . "
As a result , Mr. Bush has proposed administrative action and legislation that would streamline the system for providing postwar medical services and disability compensation to wounded veterans and their families .
The numbers are daunting :
• Of the more than 1.4 million service men and women who have served in the two war zones , nearly 700,000 have become eligible for Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) medical care , of whom about 230,000 have sought such care since 2002 .
• Depending on future force deployments , VA medical costs associated with Iraq and Afghanistan could total between $ 7 billion and $ 9 billion over the next decade , according to Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) projections .
Disability compensation and survivors ' benefits could add another $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion .
• A total of about 30,000 troops have been wounded in action .
The survival rate of those wounded is higher than it was in Vietnam and much higher than World War II , due to body armor , advances in battlefield medical procedures , and more rapid evacuation .
Put another way , this means the number of those killed is a relatively smaller portion of overall casualties .
It also means concern is growing about injuries and ailments that have come to mark this war : amputations , traumatic brain injuries ( TBI ) , and the mental and emotional shock of combat .
" Of the [ Iraq / Afghanistan ] veterans who sought care from VA , about 38 percent have received at least a preliminary diagnosis of a mental health condition , and 18 percent have received a preliminary diagnosis for PTSD [ post - traumatic stress disorder ] , making it the most common , but by no means , the only mental health condition related to the stress of deployment , " Michael Kussman , undersecretary of the Veterans Health Administration , told a House Committee on Veterans '
Affairs hearing last week .
According to the Congressional Research Service , between 2003 and 2007 about 60,000 troops were diagnosed with either PTSD or TBI .
The VA is one of the largest federal bureaucracies , operating more than 1,500 facilities providing help for veterans and their families and employing about 200,000 people , including some 13,000 doctors and nearly 55,000 nurses .
Despite this , one concern is the growing need for medical specialists to help war veterans .
In recent congressional testimony , Joseph Wilson of the American Legion cited federal studies showing that by 2020 , projected retirements will create a shortage of about 24,000 physicians and almost 1 million nurses nationwide .
" Another challenge [ is ] acquiring staff trained in certain specialty fields … physical medicine and rehabilitation , blind rehabilitation , speech and language pathology , physical therapy , and certified rehabilitation nursing , " warned Mr. Wilson .
" Given the special rehabilitative and long - term care needs of combat wounded veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan – especially those residing in rural areas – shortages in these specialty fields will have a lasting impact on these veterans as they attempt to resume independent functioning . "
Linda Bilmes , who teaches at of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University , estimates that the long - term costs of disability compensation and medical care to veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan could be as high as $ 700 billion .
" The cost of providing such care and paying disability compensation is a significant long - term entitlement cost that the US will be paying for the next forty years , " professor Bilmes wrote in a research paper earlier this year .
Reports early this year of inferior treatment and bureaucratic bungling at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center highlighted problems that still have not been fully solved despite steps to reform the massive and complicated system .
The Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) last week cited " fundamental system weaknesses " on the part of both the Defense Department ( DOD ) and the VA in how they treat wounded vets – including not enough staff and staff training .
" Delayed decisions , confusing policies , and the perception that DOD and VA disability ratings result in inequitable outcomes have eroded the credibility of the system , " the GAO reported .
It is these criticisms that Bush addressed last week in meeting with the " Wounded Warriors " commission headed by former Sen. Bob Dole and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala .
The President 's proposals include :
• New procedures for evaluating disabilities and compensating injured military personnel , including pensions for those who cannot return to active duty .
• Greater emphasis on diagnosing and treating PTSD – especially addressing any stigma associated with the disorder .
• Assignment of patient advocates to monitor progress , guide wounded vets through government bureaucracies , and help in the transition to civilian life .
• Providing six months unpaid leave for family members who want to help aid the recovery of wounded GIs .
As the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan continues , policy makers – like most Americans – say it 's vital to separate a divisive war from those who fought .
" No matter where we stand on the war in Iraq , we all stand together in our desire to make sure that our returning service members get the healthcare they need , and the benefits they have earned , " says Rep. Bob Filner ( D ) of California , who chairs the veterans ' affairs committee .
" We cannot fund the war , but fail to fund the warriors . "
So you ’ve decided to do it .
You have a friend or family member who can store your belongings for an undetermined period of time , you ’ve tied up loose ends , and your bags are packed .
It ’s time to start traveling long - term !
Vagabondish is reader - supported .
When you buy through links on our site , we may earn an affiliate commission .
Read our disclosure .
But now what ?
You have a few family members and distant friends who have offered up a couch if you ’re in their neck of the woods , but surely they wo n’t appreciate your arrival on their doorstep with no planned departure date in sight .
How then , do you travel long - term and not run out of money , while staying safe ?
Hotels are expensive over time , and finding rental accommodation in every city you visit is impractical .
Heck — you do n’t even want to pay rent at all !
Hostels are a great option as they are much cheaper and it ’s a great place to meet others on the road .
Here are eight handy resources to help you get started on your long - term travel adventure :
Caretaker ’s Gazette
( http://www.caretaker.org)
By joining this service ( annual membership is approximately US$ 30 ) , you will gain access to a classified system of people looking for caretakers in exchange for rent - free living .
The opportunities vary widely in scope from ranch hands , to organic farm workers , campground hosting , motel management , nursing for the elderly , to just plain house sitting .
Locales for your next potential gig could be anywhere in the world , from numerous U.S. locations , to Australia , to Europe and even Micronesia .
Some are paying opportunities , while others are simply work - trade arrangements for accommodation .
Others yet will supply an additional stipend depending on your experience and the work entailed .
This is what TIME Magazine had to say about the Caretaker ’s Gazette .
Woofing
( http://wwoof.net/)
WWOOF is an acronym for a number of different phrases , the most apt of which in my mind is “ World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms ” .
It is an international organization ( located in over 70 countries ) of organic farms , gardens , businesses , ranches , ( you name it ) where you can exchange your services for accommodations , food , and training .
Required services include basic garden and farm maintenance , as well as cooking , teaching , caring for children , and handy work .
There is usually some work suitable for anybody willing to adopt this lifestyle .
Whilst surfing Wwoofing opportunities , you will likely also find links to volunteer organizations , and other similar work exchange opportunities .
It ’s a great way to gain valuable experience , friendships , and to cover your living expenses in a constructive manner .
Most countries require a subscription to gain access to their full listings and contact information of the hosts , and the subscription prices vary from area to area but are not over - priced for the value received .
House Carers
( https://www.housecarers.com/)
If you are happy to spend your vacation house - sitting for somebody else , you may find the right opportunity here .
You will find lists upon lists of people requesting house sitters for periods of time from a few days to a few months , anywhere in the world .
In many cases there are a few hoops to jump through in order to gain the opportunity with liability and bonding issues , and already living or traveling in the same country carries an added advantage .
You can choose from the limited free membership options or the full US $ 45 one year membership , depending on your needs .
Organic Volunteers
( http://www.organicvolunteers.com)
Much like Caretaker ’s Gazette and woofing , you will find many worldwide opportunities to proverbially “ pick blueberries for a living ” .
The prospects are n’t limited to organic farms though ; you will find hostel management jobs , artist retreat internships , in addition to various agricultural and permaculture settings .
For US $ 20 / year , membership will help you gain access to many great listings and a user - friendly system of contacting hosts and searching for opportunities .
Couch Surfing
( http://www.couchsurfing.com)
Couch Surfers are a network of people who are willing to open up their homes and hearts to frugal travelers , as well as be those travelers when they are not hosting guests .
The site prides itself on referrals and having only high quality members , and has a comprehensive program in place to ensure the safety of both traveler and host .
But as with any chance to stay at a stranger ’s place for free , a prudent amount of caution should be exercised .
Global Freeloaders
( http://www.globalfreeloaders.com)
Similar to Couch Surfing , Global Freeloaders is a cultural exchange program for hosts and travelers .
Registration is free , but members are required to be able to host as well as travel , so unless you expect to be able to offer up your digs as a host within six months of signing up , you are politely requested to wait .
Servas
( http://servas.org/)
This is the original Couch Surfers and Global Freeloaders .
Servas ( meaning “ serve ” in Esperanto ) , is a non-profit non-denominational non-ethnic organization of good - will and cultural exchanges .
It ’s been around for at least 50 years , and is recognized by the United Nations .
In addition to being a network to connect people and places , volunteers around the world work in relief camps and advocate for peace through various projects .
Hosts offer their homes and dinner tables for two nights ( or more , at the discretion of the host ) to travelers who contact them and who meet with their approval .
Travelers must go through an exhaustive process which includes an in - person interview before being accepted to the program , as a way of screening for quality candidates .
Once travelers are interviewed and accepted into the program , they are given printed lists or booklets of the hosts in their destination country ( Servas is moving towards an online platform , but is not there yet ) .
There are also membership fees which vary from country to country .
Hospitality Club
( http://www.hospitalityclub.org/)
Free to join and internet - based , it appears to be the Servas of the online world .
It is kept “ safe ” through a series of passport checks and online feedback systems with checks and balances .
These are just a few opportunities in the world of long - term travel , as you will discover with a little research .
I do n’t vouch for any of the services or programs , and a healthy amount of caution should always be exercised when accepting hospitality from strangers .
However I think Servas says it best when they say : “ We are all friends .
We just have n’t met yet ! ”
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexico ’s human rights commission is investigating a shooting in which troops on an anti-drug mission near the U.S. border killed a man and wounded an American , the organization said on Wednesday .
The commission said soldiers opened fire on the two men’s car when they tried to skirt an army checkpoint last week in the border city of Reynosa , where troops patrol the streets as part of a crackdown on drug trafficking gangs .
One of the victims , Sergio Meza , died on the scene .
His brother - in - law , Jose Antonio Barbosa , who said he was a U.S. citizen but lived in Reynosa , was shot in the shoulder and hospitalized .
Mexicans living near the U.S. border often have close ties to the United States , and many have dual citizenship .
Barbosa said he and Meza had been drinking beer , smoking marijuana and snorting cocaine before they went out for a ride in their car before dawn last Saturday , the rights commission said in a statement .
President Felipe Calderon has sent 25,000 soldiers and police to smuggling hot spots in the past year , putting thousands of people linked to the drug trade behind bars .
Reynosa , just south of McAllen , Texas , is considered a major smuggling route for drug traffickers and is dominated by the country ’s powerful Gulf cartel .
More than 2,500 people were killed in drug violence in Mexico last year and at least 320 people have died so far this year .
Radley Balko : Artificial Standards
Monday , March 24 , 2008
By Radley Balko
ADVERTISEMENT
Earlier this month , a bullying , cartel - like professional group met in New Orleans for its annual conference .
One of the top items on the agenda was to discus new lobbying strategies to scare off the lowly folks who attempt to enter this particular profession without first paying the proper deference and dues to the industry 's old guard .
I 'm speaking of course of the American Society of Interior Designers ( ASID ) .
I 'm not kidding .
Did you know that in Nevada it is illegal to move a large piece of furniture for someone else under the title of " interior designer " ?
In fact , 21 states and the District of Columbia have enacted " titling " regulations or registration requirements for people who want to arrange other people 's furniture for a fee .
Under titling laws , you can still design someone else 's house for payment , you just are n't permitted to advertise yourself as an " interior designer , " which of course effectively kills any chance of starting an actual business .
But , titling laws are just a foot in the door .
In a 2006 report , the indispensable organization the Institute for Justice explained that ASID pushes for titling requirements only " as a first step toward lobbying for far more restrictive licensing laws . "
A Forbes article in February reported that in some states , ASID is lobbying for states to pass laws stating that interior decorating can only be done by someone with a " four - year college degree , " " a two - year apprenticeship , " and who pays " a $ 720 fee to take an exam that only 49 percent now pass . "
IJ reports that of the four states that now require full - blown licensing for interior design , " three began with titling laws that , after industry pressure , evolved into licensing . "
But it is n't just the pillow tossers ( they hate it when you call them that ) .
According to a recent study from the Competitive Enterprise Institute , the professional florist 's lobby ( yes , there is one ) has succeeded in enacting legislation in Louisiana that makes it illegal " for anybody to arrange two or more types of flowers without passing a largely subjective state licensing exam . "
The failure rate for the florist 's exam is actually higher than that of the state bar exam .
The CEI study warns that in theory , " a child could face a fine for picking a bouquet of flowers and selling it at a roadside stand . "
The Economist reports that in Texas , veterinary groups are pushing to require " horse floaters " to obtain a veterinarian 's license .
Floaters specialize in filing down the teeth of horses .
That 's all they do .
Requiring a vet 's license would mean spending hundreds of thousands of dollars and several years in vet school .
In other words , it would put floaters out of business .
But that 's the point — more tooth - filing fees for the state 's veterinarians .
This sort of cartelish behavior is everywhere .
The funeral home industry is notorious for it .
As are taxi and limousine services .
IJ has been successful defeating laws in several states that would require African - American hair - braiders to obtain a beautician 's license , which generally means thousands of dollars on cosmotology school , and accumulating hundreds of hours of training they do n't need .
If you want to hang wallpaper in Georgia , you 'll first need a state license .
Want to become a manicurist ?
If you live in California , be prepared to first sit through 600 hours of classroom training .
These laws tend to hit the poor especially hard .
They put up expensive barriers to entry for people who want to start small businesses braiding hair , doing home repair , or offering manicures from their homes .
They also drive up the costs of regulated services .
When cities grant taxi or limousine licenses to only a select few companies , the value of those licenses soars .
In large cities like New York or Washington , D.C. , a taxi medallion can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars .
That not only makes it difficult for low - income people to enter the market , it also limits competition , and drives up fares ( though local governments often regulate fares , too ) .
Groups like ASID defend this nonsense with grandiose claims about upholding the integrity of the profession .
They argue that legislation is necessary to protect consumers form fraudulent or amateurish decorators .
But the occasional episode of MTV's Cribs not withstanding , there 's simply little evidence that bad interior design is much of a problem .
The Institute for Justice found no statistically significant difference in the number of complaints to the Better Business Bureau in states that have adopted ASID recommendations versus states that had n't .
In fact , there were actually more complaints filed in the regulated states .
IJ also points out that five state agencies have studied the need for design regulation , and all five determined ASID - proposed regulation would produce no benefit to the public .
It 's understandable why these groups would seek protection from state legislatures .
They 're becoming increasingly irrelevant .
In his book " An Army of Davids , " Tennessee law professor and renowned blogger Glenn Reynolds shows how affordable technology , more leisure time , and the abundance of information available on the Internet are threatening increasingly anachronistic professions .
Hobbyists can learn the tricks of many trades in weeks .
The gap between amateur and professional is closing .
The Internet can eradicate old barriers like startup costs and overhead , and it can sharply reduce the cost of advertising and promotion .
With a few clicks , a few weeks of study , and an avid interest , just about anyone can learn how to create an attractive bouquet of flowers , braid hair , or place a rug in a way that " really ties a room together . "
This has the old guard running scared , so they 're seeking sanctuary in state legislatures , pushing for laws that create unnecessary , artificial standards that puff up fake professions and chase out competitors .

Click to viewA year - and - a - half ago , we showed you how to turn your $ 60 router into a highly configurable $ 600 router with DD - WRT , a free , open source firmware .
Since then there 's been a lot of development of open source firmwares , and today we 're taking a look at my new favorite , a firmware called Tomato .
Tomato does almost everything DD - WRT does — from Wi-Fi signal boosting to Quality of Service bandwidth allocation — in addition to offering a simplified interface chock - full of fancy charts and graphs .
Sound good ?
Let 's get started .
Advertisement
Check If Your Router 's Supported
Advertisement
Before you go upgrading your firmware willy - nilly , be sure to check Tomato 's list of supported devices .
The router I 'll be using is the very same router I used for the original DD - WRT guide , this Linksys WRT54GL router .
Several of the Linksys WRT54G series routers are supported , but they are n't all , so make sure you check your model number .
In addition to the pervasive Linksys router , Tomato will also install on some Buffalo , ASUS , and Microsoft routers .
Upgrade Your Router to the Tomato Firmware
So you 've either ensured that you 're current router is supported or you 've ordered a new cheap one off the internet ?
Then it 's time to upgrade that router to Tomato .
First , go download the latest Tomato firmware ( as of this writing , that 's version 1.13 ) .
You 'll download a 7 zip archive , so use your favorite unarchiver ( may I suggest 7 - Zip ) , and extract the contents to an easy - to - find folder on your desktop .
Now you 'll need to log into your current router to upgrade .
This process may vary slightly depending on what router you 're using and the firmware it 's running , but for the most part it 's very simple .
You can go through the old DD - WRT step - by - step here if you 're using a Linksys router with the default firmware ( just replace DD - WRT with Tomato and quit after step 2 ) .
Below I 'll describe the simple update process from DD - WRT to Tomato ( which is virtually the same as it would be for any other router with one small difference ) .
First , point your browser to 192.168.1.1 / , the default admin page for your router .
If your router has a username / password set , you 'll need to enter it to continue .
Next you need to navigate to the firmware upgrade section of your router 's admin panel .
In both DD - WRT and the default Linksys firmware , you 'll click the Administration tab followed by the Firmware Upgrade tab .
Now just click the Browse button and direct your router to the appropriate firmware file for your router in the folder you unzipped earlier .

See the README file included in the Tomato_1_13 folder to determine which version you 'll need to choose at this point .
If you 're using the same WRT54GL router as I am , pick the file named WRT54G_WRT54GL.bin .
Now just click the upgrade button and wait .
Be sure not to turn off your router during this upgrade .
Advertisement
When it 's finished , you 're ready to start using Tomato .
( Pretty simple , right ? )
Point your browser back to 192.168.1.1 / and log with " admin " ( without quotes ) as both your username and password .
If you upgraded from DD - WRT , this may not be working for you .
If the login is n't working off the bat , you 've got one more thing to do : Perform a hard reset on your router .
To do so , just find the little Reset button on the back of your router , then press and hold it for a few seconds .
When your router comes back online , the " admin " username and password should work .

Boost Your Wi-Fi Signal
Advertisement
There 's a lot you can do now that you 're running Tomato on your router , but let 's go straight to one of the sexiest tweaks supported by Tomato : Wi -Fi signal boosting .
Just click on Advanced ->
Wireless in the Tomato sidebar and find the entry labeled Transmit Power .
The default transmit power is 42 mW , but it 's capable of transmitting at up to 251 mW .
Tomato is a little low on documentation on this subject ( okay , so it 's low on documentation all - around ) , but the DD - WRT documentation suggests that an increase of up to 70 mW would be " suitable for most users . "
A boost much above that could cause heat issues and considerably decrease the life of your router .
Advertisement
I can't attest to the certainty of damage beyond what the DD - WRT documentation says , but here is what I can tell you : I 've been running my router with DD - WRT for over a year transmitting at 70 mW , have n't seen any hiccups in performance and so far have seen no smoke .
Even better , my Wi-Fi signal easily reaches to every corner of my apartment .
Track Your Bandwidth Usage , Set Quality of Service Rules , and More
From this point on , if there 's something you want to do with your router , chances are Tomato can do it for you .
In particular the bandwidth logging is both attractive and handy , allowing you to track bandwidth usage in real - time , over the last 24 hours , or with daily , weekly , or monthly reports .
Advertisement
A few weeks back I showed you how to set up Quality of Service rules on your DD - WRT router to ensure you do n't drop Skype calls , lag on Xbox Live , and generally get your bandwidth when and where you need it .
Tomato does all the same while providing even more granular control over how much bandwidth goes where ... and , like the bandwidth reports , it graphs it all .
Advertisement
Advertisement
If you 've assigned a domain name to your home server ( like adam - lh.homeip.net ) , Tomato can send alerts to the service if you 've got a dynamic IP address so that the domain will always point to your computer — even if your external IP address changes .
Advertisement
For a few other worthwhile uses , check out these videos for setting up Tomato 's Access Restriction rules ( allows you to set up rules to block browsing of certain topics at certain times , for example ) , using the Bandwidth Monitor , and putting your router into Wireless Client mode .
As I said above , documentation on Tomato is slim , but this Tomato wiki is a good place to start if you want to figure out a feature .

So Which Is Better , Tomato or DD - WRT ?
After reading this , you may have noticed that Tomato shares a lot of features with DD - WRT ; if you did , you 're probably wondering which is better .
Honestly , the two firmwares are both excellent — you wo n't go wrong running either .
DD - WRT has a slightly more robust feature set and a bit more polish in the layout of the admin , but most features that you 'll find in DD - WRT that are not in Tomato are features most home users will never use .
Both do Quality of Service ( in fact , we 've already gone step - by - step through how to set up QoS in DD - WRT ) , though Tomato seems to do it a bit better ; both can boost your Wi -Fi signal ; and both will transform your router into something much better than it was before you started .
At the moment I prefer Tomato for the simplicity of its layout , the excellent bandwidth monitoring tools , and of course , its attractive charts .
If you 're a DD - WRT or Tomato fan , let 's hear which you prefer and why in the comments .

We 've seen initiatives all over the globe created in an attempt to beat blindness , but researchers based at MIT are feeling fairly confident that their development is within a few years of being able to " restore partial sight to people who have slowly gone blind because of degenerative diseases of the retina . "
The bio-electronic implant , which is about the size of a pencil eraser , would actually sit behind the retina at the back of the eyeball , and images would be transmitted to the brain " via a connector the width of a human hair . "
As it stands , an FDA grant application is already in the works , and the scientists are hoping to have it implanted in an animal as early as this summer .
Still , the solution only works for folks who " were once able to see and have partially intact optic nerve cells " -- those who were blind from birth or suffer from glaucoma are unfortunately ineligible for the procedure .

A young star is speeding away from the Milky Way so fast that astronomers have been puzzled by where it came from ; based on its young age it has traveled too far to have come from our galaxy .
Now by analyzing its velocity , light intensity , and for the first time its tell - tale elemental composition , Carnegie astronomers Alceste Bonanos and Mercedes López - Morales , and collaborators Ian Hunter and Robert Ryans from Queen ’s University Belfast have determined that it came from our neighboring galaxy , the Large Magellanic Cloud ( LMC ) .
The result suggests that it was ejected from that galaxy by a yet - to - be - observed massive black hole .
The research will be published in an upcoming issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters .
The star , dubbed HE 0437 - 5439 , is an early - type star and one of ten so - called hypervelocity stars so far found speeding away from the Milky Way .
“ But this one is different from the other nine , ” commented López - Morales .
“ Their type , speed , and age make them consistent with having been ejected from the center of our galaxy , where we know there is a super - massive black hole .
This star , discovered in 2005 , initially appeared to have an elemental makeup like our Sun ’s , suggesting that it , too , came from the center of our galaxy .
But that did n’t make sense because it would have taken 100 million years to get to its location , and HE 0437 - 5439 is only 35 million years old . ”
To explain the enigma , or “ paradox of youth , ” the discoverers proposed that HE 0437 - 5439 was either a so - called blue straggler — a relatively young , massive star resulting from the merger of two low - mass stars from the Milky Way , or it originated from the Large Magellanic Cloud .
“ We were intrigued by the conundrum and decided to take up the challenge to solve this , ” stated Bonanos .
“ Stars in the LMC are known to have lower elemental abundances than most stars in our galaxy , so we could determine if its chemistry was more like that galaxy ’s or our own . ”
The team confirmed results of the previous study concerning the mass , age , and speed of the star .
It is about nine times the mass of our Sun , about 35 million years old , and it is zooming away from the Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud into intergalactic space at 1.6 million miles per hour ( 2.6 million km / hour ) .
Although the previous study was able to roughly estimate the star ’s elemental composition , the measurements were not detailed enough to determine if the elements match stars in our galaxy , or are characteristic of stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud .
These astronomers were able to measure the relative abundances of certain elements for the first time in any hypervelocity star .
The relative abundance of key elements tells them where a star originated .
“ We ’ve ruled out that the star came from the Milky Way , ” explained Bonanos .
“ The concentration of elements in Large Magellanic Cloud stars are about half those in our Sun .
Like evidence from a crime scene , the fingerprints point to an origin in the Large Magellanic Cloud . ”
Based on the speed of the star ’s rotation measured by the discoverers , and confirmed by this team , the astronomers believe that the star was originally part of a binary system .
The binary could have passed close to a black hole 1,000 the mass of the Sun .
As one star was pulled into the black hole , the other was whipped into frenzy and flung out of the galaxy .

“ We certainly know that Zeus and a female version of Zeus were worshiped in prehistoric times , ” Dr. Davis continued in an e-mail message .
“ The trick will be in defining the precise nature of the site itself before historical times . ”
Ken Dowden , director of the Institute of Archaeology and Antiquity at the University of Birmingham , in England , who was not involved in the research , said that it was not surprising to find the migrating Greeks adapting a sanctuary dedicated to gods of an earlier religion for the worship of their own gods .
“ Even Christians would on occasion reuse a pagan sanctuary in order to transfer allegiance from the preceding religion to Christianity , ” he noted .
“ You have some god being worshiped on a mountaintop , and the arriving Greeks have translated the god as ‘ Zeus , ’ their god of the sky , lightning , weather and so on , ” Dr. Dowden said .
“ It ’s going to be pretty close to what they found there , and given the site , it makes very good sense . ”
The affinities of Roman gods and goddesses to earlier Greek ones are well known .
Jupiter , for example , is a virtual stand - in for Zeus .
In antiquity it was perhaps no heresy to have different names for the same deity .
The place of Mount Lykaion in practices venerating Zeus is documented in literature and previous archaeological research .

The Greek traveler Pausanias , writing in the second century A.D. , described the sanctuary of Zeus on the mountain , 4,500 feet above the rural countryside .
“ On the highest point of the mountain is a mound of earth , forming an altar of Zeus Lykaios , and from it most of the Peloponnesus can be seen , ” Pausanias wrote .
“ Before the altar on the east stand two pillars , on which there were once gilded eagles .
On this altar they sacrifice in secret to Lykaion Zeus .
I was reluctant to pry into the details of the sacrifice ; let them be as they are and were from the beginning . ”

Outside of Brittany and the Latin District in Paris you may find only one or two pancake joints in any French town , but they are always full .
Most offer two types of pancakes : sweet pancakes from regular flour ( crêpes au froment ) and savory pancakes from buckwheat flour ( crêpes au sarrasin ) .
There are two styles of Breton buckwheat pancakes - thick and thin .
Restaurants make them thin on large electric heaters .
This is the style in the North of Brittany .
Today I 'll show you how to make them like in the South of Brittany - thick , and will give you the 4 secrets that will make your buckwheat pancakes a success .
First grind your buckwheat flour .
You could use bought buckwheat flour , but in most shops buckwheat flour is a slow seller and is invariably stale .
Grinding your own is much tastier and it takes only a 5 minutes for a pound .
All you need is a flour mills .
Even better , the flour is very fine and does not require any sifting to remove the bran , since the buckwheat bran is like a nutshell removed when harvesting .
This is definitely the easiest and nicest - looking flour you can grind at home .
I used to be a buckwheat purist and made pancakes from 100 % buckwheat flour and water .
No eggs , no oil , no milk , no nothing .
Well , not anymore .
Buckwheat has no gluten , which may be the reason you are reading this article if you are allergic to gluten .
But this means the dough is rather brittle unless you add a little regular flour .
I recommend you use at least 1 cup regular white flour for every two cups buckwheat flour - that 's the secret # 1 to a successful buckwheat crepe .
Sift the flours together , then add a cup water .
Add two eggs .
If mixing by hand you should beat the eggs before adding them to the flours .
Whisk by hand .
Why ?
Mr Hervé
This , a prominent French food scientist every bit as serious as Harold McGee and the inventor of molecular gastronomy , has tested various ways of preparing pancakes and found that hand beaten pancake dough is more elastic and tastes better .
That 's the secret # 2 .
Now you may have trouble dissolving every last flour clump in the liquid with a hand whisk .
If you do n't succeed , briefly use a plunging mixer while nobody is looking .
Tell them you whisked by hand .
Now you need to let the dough rest .
Mr
This tested various resting time and it makes an awful lot of difference on the dough - that 's our secret # 3 .
Cover and leave in the fridge for 12 hours .
If you are in a hurry leave it at the very least for 1 hour .
You need to cook crepes and pancakes on a cast iron or steel pan .
No non -stick nonsense .
That 's barely a secret but we 'll call it our secret # 4 .
Then the pan must be as flat as possible , with only the smallest and flattest sides .
That 's our secret # 5 .
It sounds very obvious but I 've been offered a number of so - called ' pancake pans ' at Mora , a very serious professional cookware shop in Paris , all deep as bathtubs .
If you want to flip your pancakes like I show below , you need a flat pan .
I must have spent 15 minutes discussing pancake pans with the guy at Mora , and finally he went down the cellar to fetch this humble iron pan that cost me only  10 .
When I moved to the checkout counter , another attendant tried to help me finalize the order but this guy pointed at me and said " Do n't speak to him - he is a curmudgeon " .
Everybody in the shop looked at me .
The two ladies standing next to me took a full step back .
Then the guy added " I 'm joking , serve him first ! " .
I knew that my keen interest for crêpes pans had won me the shopping attendant - Parisian style !
Then you need to use a little oil as possible .
When you begin cooking pancakes on cast iron pans , you fear the dough will stick and you douse the pan with oil or butter .
I used to do this and it took me well over a tablespoon of butter for each crepe , the butter turning brown because of the heat .
Do n't do like I did then - do as I tell you now .
Just lightly rub a piece of bacon on the hot pan or wet a towel with heat - resistant vegetable oil gently pad the pan .
There should be no visible fat on the pan , just a shine .
That 's our secret # 6 .
Using a ladle , pour the buckwheat dough in one go into the hot pan and move the pan about so that the dough covers the entire surface in a regular disc .
You can use a wooden paddle to help but do n't scratch the bottom where the dough starts to stick to the pan - just caress the liquid surface .
Now for our secret # 7 .
Do not touch the pancake until the top has set and the pancake is almost cooked through .
This is totally counterintuitive , so let me explain why .
You will worry that the pancake might stick to the pan and want to slide a wooden spatula between the pancake and the pan as soon as you can .
Seeing that the dough somewhat sticks to the pan , you will feel a sense of urgency and try to put your spatula all around and below the pancake , sensing that this may be the last opportunity to save your pancake - and your pan .
Doing this will do precisely the opposite .
The pancake is still brittle and weak as only the part closest to the pan will have set .
You will tear your pancake and the parts where the pancake has stuck to the pan will stick for good .
Do n't do this .
The way to go is to let the pancake set , so that when you finally use your spatula to move it , the crepe will have a much stronger structure that will resist to tearing both from the spatula and from the tiny bits that stuck to the pan .
And now for the fun part - pancake flipping !
Actually you do n't really need to flip pancakes , you could do everything with one of them large flat spatulas .
But you and your guests would be missing something .
Just make sure the pancake is rigid enough not to fold when being flipped .
Start by moving the crepe about on the pan held firmly in your strong hand .
Move it to the side furthest from the handle and quickly raise that side in one sharp move .
The crepe will start flying and slowly turn in the air , allowing you to catch it back .
Make your your have enough clearance above the pan , these things fly high .
I had this one with freshly grated Gruyère cheese and a pinch of Espelette chili .
Some days I add a few strips of crispy bacon , others I top it with caramelized onions or an egg .
But you could make this a dish fit for the worthiest monk by serving it with chives and a spoonful of sour cream .
No doubt you 'll find your favorite toppings .
Please consider that this is one way of making great buckwheat pancakes and not the one you see in most restaurants .
I 'll post another article in the future for super thin pancakes !
Government to Canadians : Struggling only makes it harder for you
This past Wednesday , I was hosting my cousin who was up visiting Ottawa from Toronto .
As a part of the sites he wanted to see , I took him to Parliament to watch Question Period since he ’d never been .
Usually , the press only covers the first few questions that Dion , Duceppe , Layton and also usually Ignatieff ask , and then uncerimoniously catch up on the fine art of sleeping with one ’s eyes open .
Thus , had I not actually been in the gallery , I ’d likely have missed this gem of a question from Conservative MP Patrick Brown ( Barrie ) directed to the Minister of Labour since it was the last question of the day .
From Hansard :
Question :
Patrick Brown ( Barrie , CPC ) : Mr. Speaker , some members of this House may be aware that a recent study found that in 2005 , Canada lost more days of work due to labour disruptions , both lockouts and strikes , than any other G - 7 country .
The big picture is that these numbers represent $ 700 million in lost annual gross domestic product .
Could the Minister of Labour inform this House how he is addressing this very serious issue ?
Answer : Hon. Jean - Pierre Blackburn ( Minister of Labour and Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec , CPC ) : Mr. Speaker , I am concerned about those numbers .
Work stoppages hurt workers , their families and their communities and they are also bad for businesses .
As Minister of Labour it is my responsibility to look for new ideas to keep the talk going on between unions and employers .
I have launched a study on the causes and impacts of work stoppages .
The study will provide an opportunity for stakeholders to reflect on ways to improve labour relations in our country .
An expert , Mr. Peter Annis , will consult with unions and employers and will submit a report to me with recommendations .
So , memo to unions :
The Minister of Labour does n’t understand what causes strikes nor does he understand the impacts of work stoppages .
I ’ll give the minister a hint : in 1905 , before any massive strikes began and struggles against capitalism began , the average worker ’s wage was pennies per hour and there was no minimum wage , no safety standards and no government assistance for the poor .

But , as for the other point about “ struggling only makes it harder for you ” , that sent a shiver down my spine .
Is this going to be the Conservatives ’ new campaign slogan ?

Have you heard about the two customers that were banned from an all you can eat buffet in England because they ate too much ?
Quite ironic , right ?
Well , 25 year old Andy Miles and 26 year old George Dalmon were both given the boot from a restaurant called Gobi , a Mongolian Barbecue place in Brighton , after , according to the British press , the manager called the two a couple of pigs .
The two customers were regulars at Gobi .
Each time they went , they were said to have scarfed down about five bowls of stir fry each .
The manager stated that all they do is come in and pig out each time .
The Gobi management put up with the two men for a little over two years , but finally came to the breaking point .
The manager also noted that , in that two year time period , the duo had never tipped or purchased any items other than the buffet and water .
He defended his actions in banning the two men by saying that the business is not a charity , but is there to make money .
The manager further stated that , since it is his restaurant , he can tell anyone he wants to not to come back again .
Even now , the Gobi website is still advertising the deal they have with the buffet .
They pull customers in with their promise of having the best meats , seafood , and fresh vegetables , all stir fried for the customer , as many times as they may want .
The cost of the buffet at Gobi ’s is around twelve pounds , which comes to about twenty dollars each .
The European commission 's latest fine - the largest ever levied against one company - brings the total amount that Brussels has extracted from Microsoft for anti-competitive behaviour to € 1.68 bn ( £ 1.27 bn ) over the past four years .
The fines relate to the commission 's original investigation , concluded in 2004 , into the way the company controlled access to its Windows operating system .
The commission demanded that Microsoft ' unbundle ' its Media Player application from Windows so that rival applications can be used to listen to music or watch videos online .
The commission also demanded that Microsoft give makers of rival software used by companies on the servers that run their internal networks enough information about Windows so they can work with desktop computers running the Microsoft operating system .
An estimated 95 % of desktop computers run on Windows worldwide while roughly four out of five corporate servers are using some form of Windows architecture , giving Microsoft a dominant position in the market .
The commission became frustrated at the company 's slowness in implementing the 2004 ruling - which was accompanied by a € 497 m fine - and in 2006 it imposed a daily fine on the company that added up to a further € 280.5 m .
While Microsoft has complied with the unbundling ruling , the company moved to charge a royalty for the information needed by developers of rival server software .
After further legal wrangling with the company the commission ruled last year that these charges were unreasonable .
Microsoft has reduced the royalty fees but the commission ruled today that it had only been charging the correct amount since October last year - three years after the original judgment .
Initially , Microsoft charged a royalty rate of 3.87 % of a licensee 's revenues for a full Windows patent licence and 2.98 % for a licence that gives access to the so - called ' interoperability information ' needed to make rival software compatible with Windows .
In May last year , Microsoft dramatically dropped its prices for rivals within the EU to 0.7 % for a patent licence and 0.5 % for the interoperability information while its worldwide prices remained the unchanged .
Finally in October Microsoft started offering a worldwide patent licence for 0.4 % and giving out its interoperability information for a flat fee of € 10,000 .
Only at that point , the commission said Wednesday , did Microsoft actually comply with the 2004 judgment .
Last month the commission announced two further formal investigations into Microsoft into alleged abuse of its dominant market position , following complaints from the European committee for interoperable systems and a Norwegian company Opera Software .
The commission is looking at whether Microsoft illegally refused to give rivals access to interoperability information from its suite of Office and .NET products .
The commission is also looking at the way Microsoft ties together Windows and its Internet Explorer browser .
America 's massive military aid package to Pakistan has come under scrutiny after allegations that as much as 70 % of $ 5.4bn in assistance has been misspent .
Since 2002 , the US has paid the operating costs of Pakistan 's military operations in the tribal belt along the Afghan border , where Taliban and al - Qaida fighters are sheltering .
Pakistan provides over 100,000 troops and directs the fight ; the US foots the bill for food , fuel , ammunition and maintenance .
The cash payments — averaging $ 80 m a month — have been a cornerstone of US support for President Pervez Musharraf .
But over the past 18 months , as militants seized vast swaths of the tribal belt and repelled a string of Pakistani offensives , the funding has come under the microscope .
American officials processing the payments at the US embassy in Islamabad have concluded that the Pakistani expense claims have been vastly inflated , two western military officials told the Guardian .
" My back of envelope guesstimate is that 30 % of the money they requested to be reimbursed was legitimate costs they expended , " said one , speaking on condition of anonymity .
The official said the US did not know what happened to the remaining 70 % - approximately $ 3.8bn - but suspected that some may have been spent on F - 16 fighter jets or a new house for an army general .
Other than that , he said , at least half the money was thought to have disappeared .
" Who knows , the roads on Constitution Avenue [ in Islamabad ] may have been paved with part of this money . "
The Pakistani military forcefully denied the accusations .
" As far as the military is concerned , I can assure you we have full account of these things , " said spokesman Major General Athar Abbas .
Gen Abbas admitted there had been some US complaints but denied serious irregularities .
" Yes there are minor issues they keep raising , but at no stage have we received any formal complaint from any official channel , " he said .
The controversy highlights not only strains in the relationship between Washington and Islamabad but also the limits of President George Bush 's " war on terror " .
Pakistani officials say they have lost over 1,000 soldiers in the tribal areas since 2002 - twice as many as the US has lost in Afghanistan - and caught or killed over 1,000 " terrorists " .
US officials , who have propped up Musharraf as militants rampaged across the tribal belt and beyond , feel they have received bad value for money .
Ordinary Pakistanis are angry with both sides .
Anti-American sentiment has touched a new high while anger towards Musharraf contributed to the thrashing his party received in last week 's election .
The scale of US military assistance was shrouded in secrecy for years .
When it became public , so did its extraordinarily lax accounting procedures .
Every month the Pakistani military submits expense claims averaging $ 80 m to the US embassy in Islamabad .
No receipts are provided , and the money is paid directly into the Ministry of Finance .
Poorly accounted claims caused the US to suspend payments for several months last spring , a second official said .
The Washington Post reported last week that a claim for " roads and tracks " from the Pakistani navy had been rejected .
Gen Abbas said the navy was " also involved in the war on terror because they have to guard against infiltration of arms and explosive from abroad . "
The scale of the problem has led US officials to share their worries with other allies in Pakistan .
US politicians have used the payments to exert pressure on Musharraf .
On the eve of last week 's vote , Senator Joe Biden , head of the Senate Foreign Relations committee , warned that funding could be slashed if there was widespread rigging .
But analysts and officials say the US is unlikely to turn off the cash tap anytime soon , given Pakistan 's importance in the hunt for Osama bin Laden and other foreign fugitives .
Over the years we ’ve received numerous inquiries about how much it costs to mint a U.S. penny , usually phrased as “ I heard it costs 8 ¢ ( or 10 ¢ or 12¢ ) to make a penny — is that true ?
It does indeed cost more than one cent to manufacture a one - cent piece , although not quite the multi-cented disparity rumor would have it .
Or , at least not yet .
( The proper name for what we all call the penny is a “ cent , ” but we ’ll adhere to popular usage in this article rather than be pedants about it . )
Each year the U.S. Mint puts millions of new pennies into circulation ( 4.9 billion in 2011 , for instance ) , and the cost of producing each of those pennies involves four components : metal , fabrication ( pre-production metal processing ) , labor / overhead and transportation .
Metal is largest component of this cost : the penny has been composed of 97.5 % zinc and 2.5 % copper since 1982 , and because the price of those metals fluctuates , so too does the cost of producing pennies .
In 2005 , the cost to the United States Mint to produce a penny was 0.97¢ , which was just a smidge under a cent .
In 2006 , that year ’s pennies each cost about 1.23 ¢ to manufacture .
Rises in metal prices , particularly of zinc , pushed the per-unit cost up to 1.7¢ in 2007 .
By 2012 , production costs had risen to 2.41 ¢ per penny .
The current price discrepancy between the value of the metals in the coins and the value of the coins themselves has sparked a growing cottage industry of melting down cents to harvest for resale the copper and zinc they contain .
The U.S. government has countered both by restricting the export of pennies and by making it illegal to melt them down .
Coin melters could spend up to five years in prison for their pains .
Various ideas have been kited as to how to address the problem of rising production costs .
Some folks have long held that single cents should be dropped from the roster of American coinage , with prices thereafter rounded up or down to the nearest nickel .
Some have advocated minting pennies ( nickels too , which also cost more to manufacture than their face value ) from cheaper metals .
And some have counseled holding course while waiting for metal prices to decline .
Were it not for the matter of the metal they contain being worth significantly more than the face value of coins ( in these last few years ) , all the furor and “ Say it ’s not so ! ” attaching to pennies ’ costing more to make than they can buy for you at the grocery store would be mere academic quibbling :
A penny that cost over 2 ¢ to make is n’t all that big of a deal once the concept of multiple use is grasped .
If pennies were used but once then thrown away , yes , of course their costing American taxpayers 2.41 ¢ apiece would be a horrible , horrible thing .
But they ’re not : pennies pass through hundreds , thousands , and maybe even millions of hands before they somehow drop out of circulation , which more than covers the additional 1.41 ¢ that went into their manufacture .
In other words , while it ’s a great “ gosh , golly , gee ” fact to fling at your friends ( “ Say , Joe , did you know it costs 2.41 ¢ to manufacture a coin that ’s worth only 1¢ ? ” ) , all the gobsmackedness of it runs right out of that conversation stopper once you pause to ponder how many times that one penny will change hands .
David Beckham helped Real Madrid win the La Liga title in 2006/ 07
Deloitte 's Football Money League , which is based on revenues generated during 2006 / 7 , was headed by United for eight years until the Spaniards deposed them .
Chelsea are fourth in Deloitte 's table , even though the Blues regularly make huge losses .
Arsenal are fifth .
In all , there are seven British clubs in the top 20 positions .
Three of the four clubs that dropped out of the list were also British - Manchester City , Rangers , and West Ham United .
And , looking ahead to next year 's report , the authors state that " 2007/08 could see England providing half the Money League clubs " .
Spanish champions
The list shows that the game 's riches continue to be monopolised by the same group of clubs , with only one change in the top 10 from the previous season .
Juventus dropped out because they played in the second - tier of Italian football in 2006 / 07 , their place in the top 10 going to Italian rivals Roma .
WORLD'S WEALTHIEST CLUBS BY REVENUE 1 ) Real Madrid : £ 236.2 m 2 ) Man Utd : £ 212.1 m 3 ) Barcelona : £ 195.3 m 4 ) Chelsea : £ 190.5 m 5 ) Arsenal : £ 177.6 m 6 ) AC Milan : £ 153 m 7 ) Bayern Munich : £ 150.3 m 8 ) Liverpool : £ 133.9 m 9 ) Inter Milan : £ 131.3 m 10 ) AS Roma : £ 106.1 m Source : Deloitte : 2006 /7
Deloitte 's figures take into account income from ticket sales , merchandising and broadcasting contracts but do not include transfer revenues and does not calculate profitability .
Between them , the collective revenue of the top 20 clubs - which are all European - grew by 11 % to £ 2.5 bn in 2006 / 07 , the highest rate of growth since 2002/03 .
Real Madrid retained its crown as the world 's wealthiest club , in terms of sales , in a season when it clinched the Spanish championship under Fabio Capello , and with David Beckham in the team .
Its revenues rose to £ 236.2 m from £ 202 m the year before .
' Close the gap '
Manchester United moved into second place , leapfrogging Barcelona and Juventus , thanks to a season in which they won the Premier League and reached both the Champions League semi-final and FA Cup final .
Real saw a 20 % increase to take their total revenue , though Manchester United 's revenue grew even more quickly , up from £ 167.8 m to £ 212 m .
Man Utd moved up to second from fourth in the Football Money League
Dan Jones , of Deloitte 's sports business group , said : " With the new Premier League television deals now online for the 2007/08 season , Manchester United have the opportunity to significantly close the gap on Real .
" A successful Champions League run may even see them challenge again for the number one position . "
Deloitte says the new TV money could help more English clubs into the top 20 in a year 's time .
Meanwhile , Arsenal , helped by increased revenues at their new Emirates Stadium , jumped from ninth place to fifth , while Chelsea 's move up to fourth spot means England are the first country to have three clubs in the top five .
The other British clubs to make it into the list were Liverpool ( 8 ) , Tottenham Hotspur ( 11 ) , Newcastle United ( 14 ) , and Celtic ( 17 ) .
Ticket increases
Harry Philp , director of sports finance and advisory firm Hermes Sports Partners , said : " The top seven or eight clubs tend to usually be the same , and generally drawn from the big English , Spanish and Italian clubs .
" Real Madrid will have been helped by the very lucrative TV deal that they have , and the fact that their stadium is pretty much sold out for every game .
" Manchester United have been helped by their success on the field but also by ticket price increases .
" They have also done a lot of renegotiation of much of its financial arrangements .
" Arsenal have clearly benefited from the move to the Emirates . "
The top 10 wealthiest clubs by revenue , in descending order , are Real Madrid , Man Utd , Barcelona , Chelsea , Arsenal , AC Milan , Bayern Munich , Liverpool , Inter Milan and AS Roma .
The £ 6 m lecture hall set partly in a hill was opened in 2006
Prince Charles ' comments on modern architecture were made about the Ivor Crewe Lecture Hall at the University of Essex 's Colchester campus .
The remark came as he joked with troops in the stainless - steel hall ahead of their deployment to Afghanistan .
In 1984 he called a planned modern extension to the National Gallery " a monstrous carbuncle " .
His comment in the lecture hall , which is set in the side of a hill , triggered laughter and applause from many of the troops , from the 2nd Battalion of the Parachute regiment .
It was just a throwaway remark
A University of Essex spokeswoman
The prince , Colonel - in - Chief of the regiment , told his audience : " I understand around 1,700 of you are crammed in what looks like a dustbin from the outside . "
The Ivor Crewe Lecture Hall is named after the university 's former Vice - chancellor , Professor Sir Ivor Crewe , and was opened in October 2006 .
A University of Essex spokeswoman said : " The Ivor Crewe Lecture Hall is regarded as a flagship building .
" It 's probably the most striking modern building on the campus .
" But I do n't think we want to make too much of what the Prince said .
It was just a throwaway remark . "
Short fiction is the " garage band " of science fiction , claims Tor Books editor Patrick Nielsen Hayden , so it 's time to step on that fuzzbox and thrash as hard as you can without knocking over your mom's weed - trimmer .
Actually , I think Nielsen Hayden was referring to the fact that you can try more crazy experiments in short SF than in novels , because of the shorter time commitment of both writer and reader .
But how can you become a super - master of the challenging form of short fiction ?
Here are a few suggestions .
Advertisement
I would n't claim to be an expert on short fiction writing , but I have written over a hundred of the little fuckers , a large proportion of which have been science fiction -y .
Here are a bunch of do's and don'ts , that I discovered the hardest way possible .
World - building should be quick and merciless .
In a novel , you can spend ten pages explaining how the 29th Galactic Congress established a Peacekeeping Force to regulate the use of interstitial jumpgates , and this Peacekeeping Force evolved over the course of a century to include A.I.s in its command structure , etc. etc .
In a short story , you really need to hang your scenery as fast as possible .
My friend and mentor d.g.k. goldberg always cited the Heinlein line : " The door dilated , " which tells you a lot about the surroundings in three words .
Little oblique references to stuff your characters take for granted can go a long way .
Advertisement
Make us believe there 's a world beyond your characters ' surroundings .
Even though you can't spend tons of time on world - building , you have to include enough little touches to make us believe there 's stuff we 're not seeing .
It 's like the difference between the fake house - fronts in a cowboy movie and actual houses .
We should glimpse little bits of your universe , that do n't necessarily relate to your characters ' obsessions .
Fuck your characters up .
A little .
Just like with worldbuilding , you can't necessarily devote pages to your characters ' childhoods and what kind of underwear they wear under their boiler suits .
Unless your story is really a character study with a bit of a science fiction plot .
I used to have a worksheet that included spaces to fill in in info about each character 's favorite music , hatiest color , etc. etc .
Never filled those out .
If I 'd tried to force myself to come up with a favorite color for every character , I would have given up writing .
But do try to spend a bit of time giving all of your characters some baggage , just enough to make them interesting .
Most science fiction readers are interested in characters who solve problems and think positively , but that does n't mean they can't have some damage .

Dive right in — but do n't sign - post your plot in big letters .
When I started writing stories , my early efforts meandered around for pages before something happened to one of the characters to make him / her freak out .
And then the rest of the story would be the character (s ) dealing with that problem .
And then , as I got more practiced , I found the foolproof map to awesome storytelling : introduce whatever it was that was freaking out my characters in the very first sentence of the story !
And then the story could be about them dealing with that problem , until they solved it in the very end .
It was so perfect , how could it fail ?
It took me another year or two to realize that plunging the characters into the story 's main conflict right away was just as boring , in its own way , as the ten pages of wandering in circles .
The best short stories I 've read are ones which start in the thick of things , but still keep you guessing and let you get to know the characters before you fully comprehend the trouble they 're in .
Experiment with form .
Short fiction is n't one form , it 's a whole bunch of forms jammed together according to their length .
Short stories include your standard 3,000 word mini-odyssey thru the psyche .
But they also include flash fiction ( sometimes defined as under 100 words , sometimes under 500 or even under 1,000 . )
And those wacky list things that McSweeney 's runs sometimes .
In fact , for a while there , postmodern short fiction was all about the list , or the footnotes , or the krazy monologue , or the story told in office memos .
Try writing super - short stories of only 10 words , or mutant essay - stories written by a fictional person .
Also , if you always write third person , try first person .
Or if you 're always doing first person , try third .

Think beyond genre .
Often the best genre fiction is the stuff that cross-germinates .
Pretend you 're actually writing your story for the New Yorker , and try to channel George Saunders or even Alice Munro .
See how far you can go towards writing a pure lit piece while still including some elements of speculation .
Or try writing your story as a romance .
Or a mystery .
Imagine it as a Sundancey indy movie .
Do n't confuse your gimmick with your plot .
You may have a great idea for a piece of future technology , or some amazing mutation that turns a whole bunch of people into musicvores who survive by eating your memories of rock concerts .
Maybe you have the most original basic premise evar — but that 's not your plot .
Your plot is how your new widget changes the people in your story , and how it affects their lives .
Or what decisions your people make as a result of this new technological breakthrough .

Do n't fall into the character - based / plot - based dichotomy .
People , especially in writing groups and workshops , will try to categorize stories as based on either plot or character .
This is a poisonous idea that will turn you into a cannibalistic freak wearing a belt made out of human spinal cords .
There 's no such thing as a character - based story or a plot - based story , because every story has both .
Even the most incident - free Ploughshares romp or the most twisty thumpy space opera tale .
If you start thinking that stories can be categorized into either pile , you 'll end up writing either eventless character studies or plot - hammer symphonies starring one - dimensional nothings .

I received an interesting email the other day from Nick Laird , the proprietor of http://www.sharelynx.com/ .
He brought to my attention an eye - catching year - end change in SLV , the silver exchange - traded fund .
According to the SLV website , 19.8 million ounces of silver were added to the fund on December 31st , but it didn�t stay there long .
The next day 17.9 million ounces were withdrawn .
That �s 555 tonnes of silver .
Did that much physical silver really move in one day and then out the next ?
Or are some games being played at SLV ?
I�ll address these questions , but first , some background .
I analyzed the SLV disclosure documents in detail last year and wrote about my conclusions .
My report , entitled � Unanswered Questions About the Silver ETF� , can be read at the following link : http://news.silverseek.com/SilverSeek/1176161794.php
I recommend that you read this report , but my basic conclusion was very clear : � If you own SLV or are planning to buy it , the guiding principal is caveat emptor . �
There were for me enough loopholes in the disclosure documentation to suggest that contrary to popular belief , SLV is not fully backed by physical silver .
This latest 555 - tonne year - end shuffle reinforces my skepticism .
I question whether that much silver really moved in and out of SLV in one day .
It is more likely that there was just some shuffling of paper .
The physical effort to move that weight of silver is considerable , and unlikely to be accomplished in only one day .
So let �s put this transfer in the best possible light .
Let�s assume that the silver was already in allocated storage at the vault , and merely transferred from the owner�s name to that of SLV .
But why ?
What is the motivation ?
I can�t think of any .
The newly issued SLV shares can�t be used for margin , given that they existed for just one day .
The only possible answer is that someone who owned physical silver ( possibly a hedge fund ) wanted to show on their balance sheet a tradeable security instead of physical silver for year - end window dressing .
But think about this for a moment .
Why redeem the SLV shares and withdraw the physical silver the next day , and incur the cost ?
Clearly , the owner wanted physical silver instead of a share purporting to be backed by physical silver .
The owner didn�t want the counterparty risk that arises from owning a share instead of physical metal , which clearly shows that SLV is not the same thing as owning physical silver .
This analysis puts SLV in the best possible light .
The worst possibility would of course be that the 555 tonnes never existed , but SLV shares were nonetheless issued for one day .
In this case , the shares were not backed by physical silver , but rather , just some paper promise by one of SLV�s so - called Authorized Participants who create and redeem shares .
The soundness of SLV rests upon their capacity to come up with the silver if it is needed to meet withdrawals .
This practice would be akin to fractional reserve banking in the days when national currencies were defined as a weight of gold .
Banks always held less gold in reserve than their total gold liabilities to their depositors .
All was fine until the depositors became concerned about the creditworthiness of the bank and demanded their gold , which inevitably was far short of the amount needed to satisfy all depositor claims .
Only time will tell whether SLV faces a similar fate .
There is one other point I would like to mention about SLV .
It recently started reporting bar lists on its website .
I could not find any explanation on SLV�s website clearly explaining what the bar list is supposed to provide .
In the absence of any explanation , readers of the bar list are left to draw their own conclusions .
Most interpretations I have seen inferred that the bars in the list are the ones owned by SLV , and more particularly , that they represent physical silver being stored in a vault .
I have problems though with this conclusion .
First , why doesn�t SLV explain exactly what this new bar list is supposed to be ?
Why let people draw their own inferences ?
Is it because most people will draw the wrong conclusion or otherwise give SLV the benefit of the doubt ?
A bar list by itself is not full disclosure .
Explanation is needed , which leads to the second point .
The bar list uses the term �allocated� , but there is no reason to believe that this term is being defined as we normally use that term .
In fact , there is good reason to believe that it does not mean �allocated � in the normal way that term is used , which is that specific bars of precious metal are stored in a vault and are not encumbered in any way .
For example , in my report referenced above I write the following about the SLV prospectus : �in the glossary � Unallocated � custodial control of silver is defined , but allocated storage is not .
Allocated is only mentioned within the definition of � Unallocated� , but allocated storage is not itself listed as a defined term , which is very odd for a fund that is supposed to own physical silver .
Does this mean that the custodian is not restricted to any predetermined definition of �allocated� , so this term can mean whatever the custodian wants it to mean ? �
My point is that the word �allocated � on the bar list posted on SLV�s website may not mean what you think it does .
To reinforce this point , consider the lawsuit brought against Morgan Stanley and its storage practices that was settled last year .
http://www.investmentnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070613/REG/70613010/-1/BreakingNews04
Morgan Stanley was selling �allocated � gold to its customers , but they had their own definition of �allocated� , which was far different from the customary use of that term .
It �s sort of like Bill Clinton telling the Grand Jury his guilt or innocence depends on what the definition of �is� is .
Third , and most importantly , the bar list is not audited .
It has been my point that in the absence of an audit by an independent third party to prove that the physical silver exists and is not encumbered in any way , SLV buyers are accepting on blind faith that there really is unencumbered physical silver backing their shares .
Being trained as a banker , I for one cannot make that leap on blind faith alone .
I need independent verification .
I cannot understand why SLV does not have the metal audited , just as we do in GoldMoney and provide that audit to customers upon request .
The absence of an audit defies reason , and therefore makes me wonder what SLV is trying to hide .
So my conclusion about SLV remains unchanged .
When you own shares in SLV , you do not own physical silver , you own an equity that gives you exposure to the silver price .
That makes SLV a trading vehicle , like a futures contract .
A futures contract is not an alternative to owning physical silver , and neither is SLV .

South African schoolchildren are so affected by crime that they play games of " rape me , rape me " and mimic robberies in the playground , according to the country 's human rights commission .
In a report on school violence published yesterday , the commission said schools were the " single most common " site of crimes against children , such as robbery and assault , including rampant sexual violence , some of it by teachers .
The commission said it had identified a number of games pupils played in response to the violence , including one in which they pretended to rape each other .
" This game demonstrates the extent and level ... brutalisation of the youth has reached , and how endemic sexual violence has become in South Africa , " it said .
The report said that a fifth of all sexual assaults on young people occurred at school .
A survey of 1,227 female students who were victims of sexual assault found that nearly 9 % of them had been attacked by teachers .
The commission also found that some boys committed what they called " corrective rape " on lesbians , justifying the assault by claiming that it would make the victims heterosexual .
" There is a growing phenomenon of corrective rape .
This refers to an instance where a male learner rapes a lesbian female learner in the belief that after such a sexual attack the learner will no longer be lesbian , " the report said .
A separate study by the Thohoyandou Victim Empowerment Programme found that a quarter of secondary school students said that forced sexual intercourse did not necessarily constitute rape .
The human rights commission report said that more than 40 % of the young people it interviewed had been victims of some form of crime .
It recommended that the education department consider introducing metal detectors and fences at schools , after the Red Cross children 's hospital in Cape Town said it commonly treated school pupils who had been assaulted with fists , knives , machetes or guns , or who had been raped .
No matter if you need apartment cleaning in the Dallas area or house cleaning in the area , you will want the cleaning done thoroughly .

Thrasher ’s Hierarchy of Business IT Needs
I recently attended an IT panel discussion where one of the attendees asked the panel what IT initiatives are strategic to the business .
There was a brief debate about what “ strategic ” means , and I came to the conclusion that it ’s impossible to tell whether or not a specific IT initiative is strategic to a particular business without understanding what ’s going on at that company .
In thinking about this further , I remembered Maslow ’s Hierarchy of Needs , and I decided that there must be an equivalent Hierarchy of Business IT Needs that determine an IT organization ’s strategic focus at any point in time .
This article describes such a hierarchy .
First , A Refresher : Maslow ’s Hierarchy of [ Human ]
Needs
If you ever took a psychology course , then you probably ran across Maslow ’s Hierarchy of Needs .
The concept is that people focus on the important things that we lack , but once certain levels of these things are achieved , then our focus shifts .
For example , if we do n’t have food and water then that ’s our focus .
Once we have food and water and everything else we need for our bodies , then we begin to think about our next level of concern : safety .
Once our safety needs are taken care of , then we focus on love , belonging and social needs .
Satisfy those needs and we focus on self - esteem .
And so on and so on .
Here ’s a diagram that shows Maslow ’s Hierarchy of Needs represented as a pyramid , with the more primitive needs at the bottom .
Thrasher ’s Hierarchy of Business IT Needs
Now think about a business instead of a human being .
In a sense , the business has the same sort of hierarchy , and depending on the maturity of IT use within the business , the “ strategic ” IT needs of the business will vary .
Here ’s a diagram that shows my Hierarchy of Business IT Needs .
Level 1 : Business Survival
At the lowest level , there is a need for the business itself to survive .
So at the lowest level of business IT need , there is a requirement for the processes in a business to work well enough to support the basic needs of that business .
I ’m using the word “ processes ” because technology is not required to fulfill this level of business need ; the business may be able to use manual processes that do n’t require technology at all .
A business achieves its Level 1 needs when processes are working well enough that the business can deal with all of the basic requirements of being in business .
This does n’t mean that everything works well – it just means that there are manual workarounds and fallback plans in place to deal with any system issues , and manual processes in place to replace IT systems that are missing or do n’t work .
Level 2 : Safety and Stability
After a business ’s Level 1 survival needs are met , the focus shifts to the next level to ensure continued survival , just as it does in Maslow ’s Hierarchy .
Level 2 provides safety and stability for a business ; this means that processes and systems work consistently and reliably , and that there is a basic level of data security .
In Level 2 the business builds solid processes around the systems that it can count on , and makes an effort to replace or repair those systems that are unreliable .
Data security is also a consideration in Level 2 ; no one should be able to get access to data that they should n’t look at .
This does n’t initially require any level of sophistication – data might be confined to a PC behind a locked door , or if the system is attached to a network then the network offers at least rudimentary protection against intrusion .
Then as systems grow in importance and complexity , data security should increase to meet the expanding need .
Level 3 : Systems Integration
Once a business has systems that are good enough to ensure continued survival , the focus shifts toward reducing unnecessary work caused by systems duplication and overlap .
Up until this point , business IT effort has been applied to build or acquire individual systems .
Now there ’s a realization that systems must be integrated to provide the business with accurate , up - to - date and consistent data and information .
In Level 3 , IT resource is used to connect different systems together , move data among various databases , and eliminate redundant data entry .
Level 4 : Simplification through Standardization
After the systems integration efforts of Level 3 , the business begins to recognize that not all of the systems duplication comes from data overlaps .
Many systems are too complicated , and there is often inconsistency in user interfaces , leading to unnecessary confusion and wasted effort .
The same thing is true within the IT organization itself , where there is wasted effort because of the need to maintain and support many different technology platforms .
In Level 4 , there is a move toward simplification .
This is accomplished by implementing standards for technologies and methods , and using those standards to reduce the number of different software and hardware platforms used by the business , while providing a user interface that is more consistent and much simpler .
Standards and simplification also lead to better controlled and tighter data security .
Level 5 : Business Effectiveness / Efficiency / Speed
Once Level 4 is achieved , the focus goes beyond optimization of existing processes and systems , and the IT organization actively contributes to making the business better in new ways that are tied to overall business objectives .
In Levels 3 and 4 , we optimized the systems we built in Levels 1 and 2 .
Now in Level 5 , technology is applied to make the business more effective , more efficient and faster .
Must Levels Be Achieved One at a Time ?
A typical business starts at Level 1 and moves upwards from level to level after the needs of the current level are satisfied .
Once a higher level is achieved , the needs of a lower level are no longer prioritized and are often forgotten .
But if the business regresses – finds that the needs of a lower level are no longer being met – then the business will temporarily reprioritize to focus attention on the unfulfilled needs of a lower level ( a data security breach is an example ) .
A business does n’t have to accomplish everything required by one level before doing any work on a higher level .
This is the same as in Maslow ’s Hierarchy , in which human beings are free to make improvements at higher levels while they ’re still working on fulfilling the needs of lower levels .
But as with Maslow ’s Hierarchy , there is less payback from work done at higher levels until you have fulfilled all of the requirements from the preceding level .
For example , security is nice , and you can lock your doors at night , but if you do n’t have enough to eat then your focus is going to be primarily on getting food ; it does n’t do you any good to starve behind a locked door .
The same thing is true for the Hierarchy of Business IT Needs : it does n’t do you a lot of good to focus on IT ’s strategic contribution to new revenue if your basic systems are n’t meeting the needs of the business .
Your credibility will be questioned , and you ’ll probably be building those new systems on a shaky foundation .
A Typical Progression
If a business follows the typical level to level progression then the work at Level 2 will include rework of some of the things done in Level 1 , Level 3 will include rework of some Level 2 work , and Level 4 will have rework of some of the work done in Level 3 .
This is unfortunate , but it reflects the difference in priorities at the different levels .
In theory you might be able to convince the business that all of your systems ought to be standardized and integrated from the start .
But reality says that you ’re not likely to be able to deliver a standardized and integrated solution in the timeframe required by your business , nor are you likely to be able to convince anyone that you should do so .
Once a business reaches Level 5 and IT goes into new areas , each of these new areas will tend to regress a bit in the Hierarchy .
Initial focus in a new area may be on a standalone system .
After the standalone system works , then there will be an effort to integrate the standalone system with other IT systems .
Eventually standards and simplification will be applied in the new area .
This cycle will be repeated again and again as IT broadens its focus on new and different benefits to the business .
More than One Hierarchy at a Time
In large companies it ’s possible for different parts of a company – for example , different divisions – to be at different levels in the Hierarchy , just as different members of a family may be at different levels on the Maslow Hierarchy .
In such a case , each part of the business should be addressed separately at its own level , with perhaps an overall focus on bringing the entire company up to certain standards .
However , too strong a corporate emphasis on standards – a Level 4 concern – will cause a conflict with a division which is still struggling to meet lower level needs .
It ’s important for each party in such a dispute to understand the motivation of the other party , and to reach a compromise which helps the division go through the lower levels more quickly .
Otherwise a premature emphasis on standards for the division will cause the division IT organization to be perceived as failing by the business when it ’s caught in the middle between corporate and divisional needs .
Conclusion
The word “ strategic ” is thrown around a lot in IT ; everyone wants to be strategic or to be doing strategic things .
But it ’s important to recognize that what ’s strategic to one business is not necessarily what ’s strategic to another business because they may be at different levels on the Hierarchy of Business IT Needs .
And even for a single business , what ’s strategic one year probably wo n’t be strategic the next year when some of those strategic goals have been accomplished .
Just as human beings have a hierarchy of needs that causes us to focus on different needs at different points in our lives , so too does a business have a hierarchy of needs that causes the business to have different IT needs at different points in time .
Success in IT comes from recognizing the level of your business in the hierarchy , and focusing on the things that are most important to your business in its current hierarchy level .
Being strategic means doing the best thing for your business in its current state .
Remember that and it will be much easier for you to focus on strategic goals for IT .
Notes :
1. Right after I wrote this newsletter , I happened to read an article in the Fall , 2007 issue of the MIT Sloan Management Review ( SMR ) entitled , “ Avoiding the Alignment Trap in IT ” ( for full text of the article , click here )
The “ Alignment Trap ” mentioned in the title of the SMR article refers to the problem that businesses have when an ineffective IT organization tries to tackle the most important business priorities of a business .
The article recommends that IT organizations focus on their own effectiveness before going after the toughest business problems .
Sound familiar ?
Using the terminology of my Hierarchy of Business IT Needs , businesses with an Alignment Trap are going after Level 5 priorities before they ’ve mastered Levels 3 and 4 .
2 . Some of you may be comparing the Hierarchy to the Capability Maturity Model ( CMM ) that was used a few years ago to describe the levels of maturity of software development organizations .
But the only thing that the Hierarchy of Business IT Needs and CMM have in common is the number 5 : each has five levels .
CMM refers to measurement of a software development organization from the inside out , and the Hierarchy of Business IT Needs refers to an assessment of Business IT from the outside in ( i.e. , from the business viewpoint ) .
The Hierarchy of Business IT Needs is intended to explain why different people in different businesses disagree on what ’s strategic for IT at any point in time – not to comment on the way that software is being developed .

February 2008
Arc 's been out for a few days now .
Everyone seems to have an opinion about it .
The low end are much the same as the low end of opinions about anything online .
There 's no high end yet , because no one has had enough time yet to be able to speak from experience about what it 's like to program in Arc .
Those are the responses I 'm really interested in .
But in the meantime , we have the medium - level responses : the opinions of people who have some understanding of the issues involved , but who are writing based on first impressions .
I 've noticed a strange pattern in these .
The main fault they find with Arc is that I do n't seem to have had to work hard enough writing it .
Ron Garret writes :
And that is my main gripe about Arc : it has been so long in the making and set such lofty goals and then it seems to pretty much punt on all the hard problems of language design .
I do n't usually refute criticisms directly .
Refutations tend to be more gratifying to write than to read .
But in this case I 'm going to , because in this case Ron & Co are mistaken in an illuminating way .
Explaining why will clarify some important issues about language design .
Ron 's right .
I did n't decide what problems to work on based on how hard they were .
Instead I used what might seem a rather mundane test : I worked on things that would make programs shorter .
Why would I do that ?
Because making programs short is what high level languages are for .
It may not be 100 % accurate to say the power of a programming language is in inverse proportion to the length of programs written in it , but it 's damned close .
Imagine how preposterous it would sound if someone said " The program is 10 lines of code in your language and 50 in my language , but my language is more powerful . "
You'd be thinking : what does he mean by power , then ?
I 'm not claiming that power is the only criterion by which to judge programming languages .
It would also be a legitimate goal , for example , to design a language to be easy for kids to learn , or to compile efficiently ( though this is less common than it used to be ) , or to limit the damage that can be done by individual bad programmers within a group .
But power is the test of languages not designed for such special purposes .
So working on what makes programs short rather than what 's hard to implement translates to : I chose what to work on based on the value to the user , rather than the cost to me .
Surely this is the right order of priorities to have in designing not just programming languages , but anything meant to be used by other people .
This is not to say none of the stuff I did was hard .
Some of it seemed hard to me .
But in language design , solving problems , whether hard or easy , is not the goal .
Making a good language is .
The real test of Arc — and any other general - purpose high level language — is not whether it contains feature x or solves problem y , but how long programs are in it .
The programs that get shorter should be the ones users actually need to write .
So my m.o. while working on Arc was to write applications in it , then comb through them line by line trying to imagine language features that would make them shorter .
Then I 'd implement those features , rewrite the program to use them , and start over .
Here 's a comment from the source of Hacker News where I occasionally kept track : ; results of ( codetree " news.arc " ) : ; 8787 , 8760 , 8738 , 8726 , 8823 , 8755 , 8703 , 8628 , 8587 , 8565 ; 8633 , 8573 , 8552 , 8520 , 8510 , 8498 , 8549 , 8515 , 8684 , 9025 ; 9573 , 12196 , 12469 , 12648 , 12373
( The numbers go up sometimes because I 'd added features to News . )
This is one reason the source code of Arc itself is so short , incidentally .
I did the same thing to it .
But my first priority was making applications shorter , not the language .
There are features , most notably Prolog - style pattern - matching , that seem to promise great savings in length , but turn out only to be useful for writing a few basic sequence operations like append , remove , and so on .
Prolog is a great language for writing append ; after that it 's all downhill .
Another goal I had while writing Arc was to continue as long as possible in the mode in which McCarthy began .
In his original 1960 paper he built Lisp up from " axioms " like car , cdr , and cons , through " theorems " like assoc and mapcar . [ 1 ]
There must be some optimal path all the way up to a complete language .
What is it ?
McCarthy did n't get very far along it in his paper .
And after that the language passed into the hands of his grad students , who at the time were more worried about the exigencies of making an interpreter run on the IBM 704 than continuing McCarthy 's axiomatic approach .
We 've been living with their hacks ever since .
Steele and Sussman tried to start over when they first began working on Scheme , but they seem to have been practically the only ones .
And they made , at least from the point of view of brevity / power , some serious mistakes early on .
This seemed a territory worth exploring .
And I hoped that with the axioms pushing from below and the demands of brevity in real applications pushing from above , I 'd be able to grow an optimal core of operators .
I 'm not claiming I have yet , just that that 's the goal : to find an optimal path from a small number of axioms up to a complete language for everyday use .
I 've made compromises for efficiency .
I 'm not using Church numerals . [ 2 ]
But I 've tried to preserve as much of the spirit of the original 1960 paper as I could .
Building up the language from axioms is not an end in itself either .
I 'm only doing it because I suspect that 's the way to get maximum expressive power .
How well does Arc deliver so far ?
Does it make programs shorter than they'd be in other languages ?
Let 's try measuring .
I 'm going to propose a simple problem as a challenge .
We 'll collect solutions in each of the popular languages , and compare their lengths .
Here it is :
Write a program that causes the url said ( e.g. http://localhost:port/said ) to produce a page with an input field and a submit button .
When the submit button is pressed , that should produce a second page with a single link saying " click here . "
When that is clicked it should lead to a third page that says " you said : ... " where ... is whatever the user typed in the original input field .
The third page must only show what the user actually typed .
I.e. the value entered in the input field must not be passed in the url , or it would be possible to change the behavior of the final page by editing the url .
Though simple , as such tests have to be , this is not a contrived example .
Web apps have to do this sort of thing all the time .
Nor does it depend on some sort of esoteric libraries that Arc has and other languages do n't ; this is all stuff that any language used to write Web apps would have to have already .
Here 's the answer in Arc : ( defop said req ( aform [ w / link ( pr " you said : " ( arg _ " foo " ) ) ( pr " click here " ) ] ( input " foo " ) ( submit ) ) )
If you 're not used to Arc you 'll have to take my word for it , but this is not code that has been compressed using coding tricks .
This would be the standard way to write it in Arc .
The most meaningful test of the length of a program is not lines or characters but the size of the codetree -- the tree you 'd need to represent the source .
The Arc example has a codetree of 23 nodes : 15 leaves / tokens + 8 interior nodes .
How long is it in your favorite language ?
( Code to import standard libraries does n't count , of course ; you can assume those are already loaded . )
I 've posted this problem on the Arc Forum at http://arclanguage.org/item?id=722.
If you have a solution in a language that 's not yet represented , or a shorter or more correct solution for a language that is , please add it .
It will be interesting to compare languages not just to Arc but to one another .
Update : May 2009
The Arc version would now be slightly shorter : ( defop said req ( aform [ onlink " click here " ( pr " you said : " ( arg _ " foo " ) ) ] ( input " foo " ) ( submit ) ) )
This is 21 nodes : 14 leaves + 7 interior .

Feb. 19 , 2008  --
It may one day be possible to walk into your doctor 's office and breathe into a small device that will tell you if you are in the earliest stage of a wide range of diseases from lung cancer to asthma to kidney failure .
Early detection is the key to survival when it comes to many medical problems , and the first place some diseases show up is in the breath .
Scientists have just revealed that they have produced a machine that can identify single molecules that are associated with specific diseases , and all that 's required is a little breath .
" It 's very noninvasive , " said physicist Jun Ye , leader of the research team that is working on the technology .
" There 's nothing to be scared of .
No blood test , just a breath test . "
Ye is a research fellow at JILA , a joint institute of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the University of Colorado at Boulder .
Ye and research assistant Michael Thorpe , doctoral student Matthew Kirchner and former graduate student David Balslev - Clausen described their work in the Feb. 18 online edition of Optics Express , published by the Optical Society of America .
It has been well established that people exhale a complex mixture of gases , including oxygen , nitrogen , carbon dioxide , and others , Ye told ABCNEWS.com .
In fact , more than 1,000 different compounds are contained in human breath .
But along with those common gases and compounds , people also exhale certain molecules that are considered " biomarkers " indicating specific conditions , such as diseases .
" If you go to the medical literature you will see tons of studies that correlate certain diseases with particular molecules found in the breath , " he said .
" One common example is nitrous oxide , which is associated with asthma . "
Recognizing that fact , scientists for some time now have been trying to develop the technology to identify those molecules in the breath , thus detecting a disease that may not show up anyplace else .
Several techniques have been advanced , but Ye said they all fall short because of the old needle - in - the - haystack problem .
Normal breath consists of trillions of molecules , only a few of which are actual biomarkers .
And finding just one is n't enough .
There needs to be a pattern consisting of several different types of biomarkers that are all associated with a particular medical problem .
What 's necessary , he said , is to create a device that will find a few molecules in a sea of background noise consisting of trillions of harmless molecules .
He calls it " seeing the forest all at once , but also seeing individual trees extremely clearly . "
And that , he said , is exactly what his team has accomplished .
The technology builds on the device that won a Nobel Prize in 2005 , called optical frequency comb .
Ye and his group applied the technology to spectroscopy , which is used to identify distinct molecules by their emission and absorption of light .
The heart of Ye's machine , which is about the size of a microwave oven , is a cavity between two curved mirrors .
Laser pulses are shot into the cavity and reflect back and forth between the mirrors tens of thousands of times , bombarding any molecules in their way , before finally escaping .
To test the device , the researchers recruited several students and had them breathe into the cavity .
The bouncing laser beam interacted with the billions of exhaled molecules , identifying the entire composition of the breath .
The findings were very precise , Ye said .
One of the participants was a smoker , and his test revealed five times the normal level of carbon monoxide .
The beauty of the system , Ye said , is the fact that it sees the entire spectrum , not just a few specific molecules .
And that 's important because a single molecule would mean little .
" If you have asthma , your breath will have nitrous oxide , but nitrous oxide does not necessarily mean you have asthma , " he said .
" But if you see several different molecules all at once , and they are associated with asthma , then you have found a real fingerprint of a certain disease . "
The technology is still in its infancy , and for now it appears to be limited to diseases that somehow involve the lungs .
But
Ye thinks that could change , and the applications could broaden , as the technology develops further .
The device can also differentiate between different isotopes , like carbon 12 and carbon 13 , and oxygen 16 and oxygen 17 , and changes in those ratios could also indicate the presence of a disease .
The idea ,
Ye said , is to build a system that will allow the earliest possible detection in the least invasive manner at a price that everyone can afford .
The technology can now identify a single molecule among billions .
The next goal will be to find a single molecule among trillions .
That would broaden its application even further .
The researchers built their machine at their institute , located on the University of Colorado campus , at an estimated cost of $ 50,000 .
That , of course , does not include the millions spent on earlier research , or the cost of their time .
" Once it 's mass produced , the cost could be quite low , " Ye said .
" It could be put into every doctor 's clinic so people could walk in and do painless breath tests and then walk away .
They would get results in a day or so . "
Of course , all of this is based on lab research , and an experiment with a few college students .
The technology has not been tested yet in the medical field .
But Ye's office phones were ringing constantly during the interview , and some of the calls were from companies interested in moving the technology from the laboratory to the marketplace .

While you may not be able to touch Wynn ’s nuts in Las Vegas , the Meadowood resort in Napa encourages you to pull the corks on the wine in the room .
Even though I wondered briefly which wine goes with Kettle chips , I managed to make it through my stay for a wine writers ’ conference last week without opening a bottle in my room .
But I was tempted since the wines were some top examples of local offerings at incredible prices .
Consider the Joseph Phelps Insignia 2001 for $ 145 in the room when it ca n’t be found for less than $ 130 in a store ( find this wine ) , if at all !
While they are not all steals ( the Sinskey Carneros Pinot Noir was $ 55 in room compared to $ 25 in a store ) there were other , lower priced wines too : Plumpjack Chardonnay for $ 65 in room and about $ 50 in a store ( find this wine ) and the sparkling Schramsberg blanc de blanc is $ 35 in the room and about $ 25 in a store ( find this wine ) .
And free in - room wi -fi to run your own price check !
I asked the affable Gilles de Chambure , Master Sommelier and Director of Wine Education at Meadowood about the pricing and quality of the wine in the rooms , he said “ we want people to pull the corks . ”
Indeed !
One negative about the beverages at Meadowood , however , was the abundant pouring in the dining room of one - liter glass bottles of Acqua Panna , a water imported from Tuscany .
With bottled water available from five miles away in Calistoga I was tempted to break out my carbon calculator …
Thursday promises to be an eventful day for the iPhone .
That 's when Apple will summon the tech press to its Cupertino , California , headquarters to hear about the company 's plans for the mobile device -- particularly in regard to applications built by third parties .
All signs point to Apple 's taking the wraps off a software development kit ( SDK ) that it had promised to deliver in February .
And when Apple does grant developers access to building native applications for the iPhone , that will mark a significant new direction for the device since Apple first previewed the iPhone at the January 2007 Macworld Expo .
Back in the days before the iPhone 's launch , Apple resisted calls to open the iPhone to third - party development , citing its desire to preserve the device 's security and stability .
By last summer 's Worldwide Developer Conference , Apple offered developers an alternative :
They could create Web - based applications that iPhone users would access through the device 's built - in Safari browser .
Though some software developers took Apple up on that offer , others built native iPhone apps anyway .
The catch was , to install these third - party apps , users had to " jailbreak " their iPhones , which works by intercepting the communication that is supposed to happen between the iPhone and iTunes - - thereby voiding the warranty and running the risk that future iPhone software updates would render the phone inoperable .
In October , Apple signaled an end to this cat - and - mouse game , promising to deliver an iPhone SDK in February .
That SDK is likely to be a major focus of the conversation when Apple kicks things off at Thursday 's event .
But the specifics of what Apple plans to say Thursday remain up in the air : How open will the iPhone be to third - party development ?
Will Apple place tight restrictions on third - party apps , as some reports have speculated , or will those restrictions apply only to paid apps , as others have claimed ?
And when third - party applications do appear -- assuming some wo n't be unveiled on Thursday to kick - start development -- what can we expect to see ?
We wo n't know the answers to the first couple of questions until Thursday , and it'll take a while longer to see what kind of native apps emerge in the wake of Apple 's likely SDK unveiling .
But we do n't have to wait to present our own wish list of iPhone applications that we want to see appear in native form .
We convened a panel of iPhone users -- editorial director Jason Snell , senior news editor Jonathan Seff , associate editor Dan Moren , and senior editors Rob Griffiths , Dan Frakes , and Christopher Breen -- and asked them to assemble a list of the applications they want third - party developers to burn the midnight oil creating .
They came up with 25 programs they want right now , which we 've ranked here in ascending order of urgency .
House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi is blocking efforts to impeach Bush and Cheney , or to take any other real steps to save America .
One of the grounds for impeachment is that the government made knowingly false claims about 9/11 Congresswoman Jane Harman chaired the hearing of the House Subcommittee on Homeland Security which pushing for the labeling 9/11 truth sites as terrorist incubators
What do these two congresswomen have in common ?
They were both part of the 9/11 cover up .
Veteran reporter Robert Scheer gives the background in his opinion piece today in the San Francisco Chronicle .
The first two lines of the piece set the stage :
" When the CIA destroyed those prisoner interrogation videotapes , were they also destroying the truth about Sept. 11 , 2001 ?
After all , according to the 9/11 Commission report , the basic narrative of what happened on that day - and the nature of the enemy in this war on terror that Bush launched in response to the tragedy - comes from the CIA 's account of what those prisoners told their torturers .
But what about those congressional leaders who were briefed on the torture program as early as 2002 ?
That includes Democrats like Nancy Pelosi . . . .
Pelosi claimed that " several months later " her successor as the ranking Democrat , Rep. Jane Harman of Los Angeles County , was advised the techniques " had in fact been employed " and wrote a classified letter to the CIA in protest , and Pelosi " concurred . "
Neither went public with her concerns .
Harman told the Washington Post " I was briefed , but the information was closely held to just the Gang of Four . . . an insider reference to the top members of the House and Senate intelligence committees . . . .
Not only did the congressional Gang of Four fail to inform the public about the use of torture by our government but they also kept the 9/11 Commission in the dark .
Pelosi testified before the commission on May 22 , 2003 but uttered not a word of caution about the methods used .
However , more than two years later on Nov. 16 , 2005 , Pelosi stated correctly that on the basis of her " many years on the intelligence committee , " she knew that " The quality of intelligence that is collected by torture is ... uncorroborated and it is worthless . "
***
As matters now stand , they not only concealed torture but , more significantly , they abetted the waterboarding of our democracy .
knew
hinted
Scheer then moves on to Pelosi and Harman ' role in the cover up : Pelosi and Harman played an instrumental role in the 9/11 cover up by keeping their knowledge about the interrogation videotapes secret from the 9/11 Commission and from the American people ( they were n't the only ones who knew ) .
This is made all the worse because Pelosithat intelligence " collected by torture " is worthless , and yet she never evento the Commission or to anyone else that the CIA 's version of events should be questioned .
They could have stopped the whole farce cold -- but they chose to go along with it .
These two congresswomen -- who are fighting against 9/11 truth -- previously aided and abetted the 9/11 cover up .
Is that why they do n't want the truth to come out ?
Nancy Boyda is n't ready to shred the Constitution :
" I am adamant about protecting the Constitution .
They 're giving nothing in return for it .
We 're not getting any more security and they 're shredding the Constitution , " said U.S. Rep.
Nancy Boyda , D - Second Dist ....
" What shocks me is how members of Congress from Kansas would so readily give up 230 years of our Constitution without gaining any additional security , " Boyda said ....
Boyda pointed out that Congress is being asked to give phone companies immunity without knowing why they need immunity .
" The question is why the president is completely unwilling to tell Congress what he did , " Boyda said .
" It seems to me it 's probably about domestic surveillance . " ....
Despite her objections to the Senate Bill , Boyda acknowledges wiretapping and conducting terrorist surveillance is " job number - one , " but can not compromise civil liberties .
She said FISA was adopted to safeguard the rights of Americans , not to protect terrorists .
" Keeping America and Americans safe is my number - one priority , " Boyda said .
She cautioned that despite many Americans having no objection to wiretapping because they have nothing to hide , the stake of American democracy is hanging in the balance .
" If you are willing to have the government come into your home and into your personal life without any probable cause and without any oversight or any warrant , then you have just given up our democracy , " Boyda said .
For me , the year ’s best reading is usually the many thoughtful answers to The Edge ‘s annual question .
This year they ask :
What have you changed your mind about ?
Why ?
I ’d love to hang out with these folks , so maybe I should audition .
My answer :
Social scientists know lots .
As a physics student and computer science researcher , I assimilated the usual “ hard science ” perception that “ social science ” is an oxymoron — no one knows much about it , so your opinion is as good as anyone ’s .
When I finally decided I needed social science credentials , to turn my institution hobby into a career , I focused on experimental economics , the only sort a hard scientist could trust , and Caltech , with impeccable hard science credentials .
But I was soon thoroughly convinced : social scientists know tons .
Why then do so many people think otherwise ?
Many say it is because social scientists are stupid , or the social world is too complex or uncontrollable .
Better answers are that social expertise conflicts with our overconfidence about familiar experience , or with our democratic ideology that everyone ’s political opinions should get equal weight .
But the best answer , I think is that most public talk by social experts reflects little social science .
That is , what social experts say in legal or congressional testimony , or in newspapers or magazines , mostly reflects what they and we want and expect to hear , instead of what expert evidence reveals .
For an analogy , consider the lives of a distant isolated group , like Al Qaeda or devil worshipers .
If most of us had strong emotional preconceptions , or if many advocates wanted us to have certain opinions about them , then we might not be able to believe much of what we heard about this group .
That is , we might not have cheap and effective ways to distinguish honest reports from those driven by other agendas .
This would not imply that no one knows anything about this distant group ; insiders there surely know , for example .
Similarly , social scientists have data and theory giving powerful insight into a great many social issues , at least to those with open minds .
Open minded social scientists talking privately can make great intellectual progress .
But powerful forces are eager to distort the messages social scientists give the public on important topics .
Academics with deserved reputations for careful accurate work on obscure academic topics tend to adopt different standards when writing editorials or advising politicians .
Even if most academics would not do this , those selected for such roles usually do .
This effect is a good reason for “ intellectual travel , ” to see many topics for yourself up close .
Also , a mechanism that could cut through this fog and tell the public what honest social scientists really think might have great social value , at least if the public could be shamed into listening to them .
This is one of my great hopes for prediction markets .

HYPERPARTISANSHIP WATCH …. Paul Krugman ’s column today is about a study by two retired professors , Donald Shields and John Cragan , who have taken a look at the partisan breakdown of corruption investigations by the Department of Justice under George Bush .
Their preliminary results , published in 2004 , showed that DOJ initiated far more investigations of Democrats than Republicans , and their followup study shows that the pattern continued through 2006 .
However , the really interesting part came in the breakdown between local cases and national cases .
In statewide and federal cases they found a total of 66 investigations .
Here ’s the breakdown :
Democrats : 36
Republicans : 30
This is roughly what you ’d expect .
Democrats are slightly overrepresented compared to their actual numbers , but only by a bit .
There ’s nothing fishy .
But the numbers for local cases paint a very different story .
They found 309 investigations , broken down as follows :
Democrats : 262
Republicans : 37
Independents : 10
Now is n’t that odd ?
At the local level , even though both parties make up about half of all elected officials , Democrats get hammered and Republicans are left alone .
Shields and Cragan offer up the following hypothesis :
We believe that this tremendous disparity is politically motivated and it occurs because the local ( non-statewide and non-Congressional ) investigations occur under the radar of a diligent national press .
Each instance is treated by a local beat reporter as an isolated case that is only of local interest ….
[ Conversely ] because the investigations of state - wide and federal elected officials and candidates occurred within the radar of the national press , there was little room for nefarious , out - of - line investigations for political purposes on the part of the Bush Justice Department .
And who does these investigations ?
Why , U.S. Attorneys , the very group that Alberto Gonzales has been busily trying to make even more partisan .
Apparently a 262-37 breakdown is n’t good enough for him .
George Bush handed his successor a major fiscal headache yesterday as he delivered the last budget of his eight - year term , a finance bill that hikes military spending , blows out the deficit to near record levels and tops $ 3tn ( £ 1.5tn ) for the first time .
The 2009 budget provides for sharp spending increases on Iraq and protects controversial tax cuts , while freezing much domestic spending and cutting $ 200 bn from healthcare over five years .
The centrepiece of the $ 3.1tn budget is a rise in military spending to its highest level in real terms since the second world war .
" Two key principles guided the development of my budget , " Bush said .
" Keeping America safe and ensuring our continued prosperity . "
The Pentagon 's budget will jump by 7.5 % , more than twice the rate of inflation , to $ 515 bn .
Bush also sought $ 70 bn more for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The projected funding represents an increase of 5 % .
Since coming to office , his administration will have increased baseline military spending - excluding extra spending on nuclear weapons - by 30 % .
One of the few other winners in the budget is the diplomatic service , which will receive a 9 % increase in funding to $ 690 m .
These spending increases coupled with Bush 's recently announced $ 150 bn - tax cut package will further reduce government receipts already hit by a sharp slowdown in the US economy .
Spending on the health and human services will fall by more than 2 % , while the health resources and services administration , which helps the poor receive medical care , will have a 15.8 % cut .
Despite such savings , the projected deficit will rise to near - record levels , reaching $ 410 bn this year and $ 407bn in 2009 .
The record deficit , in 2004 , was $ 413bn .
Bush 's budget drew criticism from Democrats and some Republicans even before it was unveiled .
With Congress controlled by the Democrats , many of the measures within are unlikely to be realised .
" Far from proposing a plan to fix the budget , the Bush administration proposes policies that worsen it , and with little compunction , leaves the consequences for the next administration and future generations , " said the house budget committee chairman , John Spratt , a Democrat .
His Senate counterpart and fellow Democrat , Kent Conrad , said : " [ Bush ] proposes more of the same failed policies he has embraced throughout his time in office . "
The leading Republican on that committee , Judd Gregg , also criticised the package , saying the defence costs were " totally understated " and the proposed savings were exaggerated " because everybody knows the cuts are n't going to survive " Democratic opposition in Congress .
The budget projects all domestic spending beyond homeland security and defence be held to an average increase of less than 1 % , an effective cut given the likely rate of inflation .
How often do we think about our http sessions implementation ?
I mean , do you know , how your currently used sessions - related code will behave when sessions number in your database will grow up to millions ( or , even , hundreds of millions ) of records ?
This is one of the things we do not think about .
But if you ’ll think about it , you ’ll notice , that 99 % of your session - related operations are read - only and 99 % of your sessions writes are not needed .
Almost all your sessions table records have the same information : session_id and serialized empty session in the data field .
Looking at this sessions - related situation we have created really simple ( and , at the same time , really useful for large Rails projects ) plugin , which replaces ActiveRecord - based session store and makes sessions much more effective .
Below you can find some information about implementation details and decisions we ’ve made in this plugin , but if you just want to try it , then check out our project site .
FastSessions is a sessions class for ActiveRecord sessions store created to work fast ( really fast ) .
It uses some techniques which are not so widely known in developers ’ community and only when they cause huge problems , performance consultants are trying to help with them .
The Problem
Original ActiveRecord sessions store is slow .
It is fine for some low traffic blogs , but it is too slow to use it on some big / large / huge sites .
First of all , it is slow because ActiveRecord is slow .
It is powerful ORM framework , but it is overkill for such simple task as a sessions management .
That is why people created SqlSession store .
It works with mysql directly with database APIs and works much faster than original AR session store .
But it is still slow because :
it creates / updates session on each hit – even dumb bots crawling your sites create thousands of thousands of useless records in your sessions table , 99 % of hits do not require any session updates !
it uses 32 - char string as a key for sessions records – all databases work with string keys MUCH slower that with integers keys , so it would be much better to use integers , but we have so long session ids and all session stores use these session ids as a key .
it uses auto_increment primary key , which causes table - level locks in InnoDB for all MySQL versions prior to 5.1.21 .
These table - level locks with unnecessary inserts cause really weird problems for large sites .
The Solution
FastSessions plugin was born as a hack created for Scribd.com ( large RoR - based web project ) , which was suffering from InnoDB auto - increment table - level locks on sessions table .
So , first of all , we removed id field from the table .
Next step was to make lookups faster and we ’ve used a following technique : instead of using ( session_id ) as a lookup key , we started using ( CRC32 ( session_id ) , session_id ) – two - columns key which really helps MySQL to find sessions faster because almost all lookups use crc32 field only to find needed record .
And last , but most powerful change we ’ve tried to make was to not create database records for empty sessions and to not save sessions data back to database if this data has not been changed during current request processing .
All of these changes were implemented and you can use them automatically after a simple plugin installation .
Controversial Decisions
Many plugin users would never think about one problem we ’ve introduced when removed that auto - increment primary key , so I ’d like to describe it here .
The problem is following .
InnoDB groups all data in tables by primary key .
This means that when we create auto - increment primary key and insert records to a table , our sessions records are grouped together and saved sequentially on the disk .
But if we ’ll make pretty random value ( like crc32 of a random session id ) a primary key , then every session record will be inserted in its own place and it will generate some random I/ O which is not so good for I /O bound servers .
So , we decided to let the user choose what primary key to use in his deployment of our plugin , so if you ’re going to use this module with MySQL 5.1.22 + , then you ’d like to set
1
CGI :: Session :: ActiveRecordStore :: FastSessions .
use_auto_increment = true
because it will provide you with consecutive data inserts in InnoDB .
Another cases when you ’d like to use it is when your MySQL server is I / O bound now and you do not want to add random I/O because of randomized primary key .
Working With Old AR Sessions Table
If you do not like to loose old sessions created with default AR sessions plugin , you could set
1
CGI :: Session :: ActiveRecordStore :: FastSessions . fallback_to_old_table = true
and then all session reads will fall back to old sessions table if some session_id was not found in default fast sessions table .
Old sessions table name could be set using
1
CGI :: Session :: ActiveRecordStore :: FastSessions . old_table_name
variable .
Installation
This plugin installation is pretty simple and described in a few steps below :
Install this plugin sources in your vendor / plugins directory ( it could be ./ script / plugin install , or piston import command – it is up to you ) from our SVN reposipory .
For example : 1
$ piston import http : // rails - fast-sessions.googlecode.com / svn / trunk / vendor / plugins / fast_sessions Enable ActiveRecord session store in your config / environment.rb file : 1
2
3
4
5
Rails : : Initializer .
run do | config |
......
config .
action_controller .
session_store = :active_record_store
......
end Create migration for your new sessions table : 1
$ . / script / generate fast_session_migration AddFastSessions
Open your newly created migration and change table_name and use_auto_increment parameters of the plugin ( if you want to ) .
Run your migration : 1
$ rake db : migrate Start your application and try to perform some actions which would definitely save some data to your session .
Then check your fast_sessions table ( if you did not renamed it ) for a records .

According to a survey , two - thirds of people think gadgets are becoming too complicated .
They 're packed with features they do n't understand , and subsequently never use .
One newspaper illustrated the story with a photograph of " a typical TV remote " featuring " 43 baffling buttons " , annotated with captions telling you what each of these buttons did , just to make it look even more complex and bewildering : " cursor up " , " cursor down " , " a / v input connector 1 " , " device mode " , and so on .
Thing is , there were n't enough buttons for my liking .
I love a complicated TV remote .
They should have more stuff on them : dials and joysticks and flashing lights .
I dream of a remote with its own mouse .
And I do n't want a manual .
I like to work out what each nubbin does through trial and error , poking it and staring at the screen .
Best of all is the " menu " button , which grants you access to a whole new array of on screen options , replete with little icons and sliding scales .
Sit me in front of a brand - new telly and it's the first thing I 'll reach for , because new tellies often come with surprising and exotic new features provided by the gods of technology .
Coo !
I can design my own font for the subtitles !
Wow !
I can flip the picture sideways so I do n't have to lift my head if I 'm lying perpendicular on the sofa !
And look !
There 's a slider for adjusting the level of regional accents !
Now I can make the Geordie guy who narrates Big Brother sound like a Cornish fisherman .
I 'll happily spend hours fine - tuning everything to my liking .
Woe betide anyone who hits the " restore default settings " button .
That 's like smashing a piece of ornate pottery I 've created .
The other day , a Sky repairman turned up and breezily started playing with my settings , adjusting the contrast and colour balance as if he owned the place .
I was outraged by the violation , as though he'd pulled my trousers down and nonchalantly examined my goolies .
I tend to assume other people share my obsessive need to examine the settings until everything is just so , and get genuinely enraged when I go to someone 's house and discover , say , that they 're watching programmes in the wrong aspect ratio .
People over 50 are the worst offenders : they 'll blithely sit through a Dad's Army repeat that is unnaturally stretched across the screen so that the entire cast look as if they had difficult births that left them with flattened skulls .
Faced with this , I get acute back - seat - driver anxiety , and end up hectoring them like an exasperated pilot trying to teach a four - year - old how to fly a helicopter .
Recently , I was on a plane , sitting beside an 80 - year - old woman who could n't comprehend how the in - flight entertainment system worked .
It had a touch - screen monitor and an additional set of controls in the armrest .
Thing is , she did n't understand the difference between my armrest and hers .
There I was , watching a movie in a bid to distract myself from the terror of being 30,000 ft up in the sky , when she patted cluelessly at my controls and switched it off .
I started it again .
Then she hit my fast - forward button .
At this point , I politely explained what was going on and attempted to help her operate her system .
She nodded and went " ooh " and " ahh " , but try as I might , she just did n't get it .
Ten minutes later , she stopped my film again , and kept doing so intermittently throughout the flight , sometimes switching my overhead light on for good measure , just to annoy me .
Her screen , meanwhile , displayed nothing but the synopsis for an episode of Everybody Hates Chris , which she 'd selected by accident but never played .
She just sat there , staring at the synopsis for about three hours .
I think she thought that was the entertainment .
Shamefully , I found myself starting to genuinely hate her - her doddering incompetence somehow rendered her less than human .
Reverse the situation - put me in a 1940s household , say , and ask me to operate a mangle , and the chances are I 'd earn her contempt with an equal display of ineptitude .
But it is n't the 1940s .
It 's now .
So snap out of it .
Hit the right buttons or get left behind , you medieval dunce .
Do you want the robots to take over ?
Because that 's what 'll happen if we do n't all keep up .
How dare you jeopardise the human race like that .
How dare you .
And if people still refuse to learn , let 's force them into it .
Replace all supermarkets with complex remote - control vending machines that dispense food only if you can successfully navigate your way through a 25 - tier menu system .
And make it illegal to pass the food to anyone else .
Before long , we 'll starve the idiots out of existence ; manufacturers will never have to simplify anything ever again , and we 'll enjoy a golden age of buttons and options and adjustable sliders and a /v input connector 1 .
Now that 's progress .

Serbia today ruled out any cooperation with a Kosovan " puppet state " on its territory , ahead of an expected unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo .
With its southern province set to make a formal break with Belgrade on Sunday , the Serbian prime minister , Vojislav Kostunica , repeated the assertion that a declaration of independence would be illegal .
Kostunica also made clear there would be no cooperation with the EU as it finalises plans to deploy 2,000 police , judges and civil administrators to take over from the UN mission that has been Kosovo since 1999 .
" There would be no greater humiliation for Serbia if it , in any way , signed or agreed in some indirect way to this puppet state , " Kostunica told the daily Glas Javnosti .
His divided government coalition closed ranks today in its refusal to accept Kosovo 's secession .
" All acts and activities of provisional authorities in Kosovo unilaterally declaring independence will be declared null and void for breaching the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia , guaranteed ... by the UN charter , " the coalition said .
Earlier , the Russian president , Vladimir Putin , launched a scathing attack on countries planning to recognise Kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence .
Recognition of Kosovo 's independence would be " immoral and illegal " , and European countries should be " ashamed " of their double standards , Putin said at a press conference in Moscow .
Russia has strongly backed Serbia on Kosovo and backed Belgrade 's call for an emergency meeting of the UN security council today .
However , western diplomats said the debate would not postpone Kosovo 's bid for independence .
Kosovo 's prime minister , Hashim Thaci , said yesterday : " The Kosovo issue has already left the security council building . "
Kosovo 's independence has been carefully choreographed .
Britain , France , Germany and the Netherlands are expected to be first to recognise Kosovo as Europe 's newest state , with the US following soon afterwards .
Other European countries will add their names in successive days , with only Cyprus likely to remain adamant in its refusal to acknowledge the new country , lining up with Serbia and Russia .
At his press conference , Putin accused the west of hypocrisy in its haste to recognise Kosovo .
" I do n't want say anything that would offend anyone , but for 40 years northern Cyprus has practically had independence , " Putin said .
" Why are n't you recognising that ?
Are n't you ashamed , Europeans , for having these double standards ? "
Dismissing the western argument that Kosovo is a special case , Putin repeated Russia 's warning that supporting the province 's independence would set a dangerous precedent for other separatist regions .
" We have Abkhazia , South Ossetia , Trans - Dniester , and they say Kosovo is a special case ? " he said , referring to three breakaway , pro-Russian regions in the ex-Soviet republics of Georgia and Moldova .
Ahead of Kosovo 's declaration of independence , the Nato - led peacekeeping force in Kosovo , Kfor , has stepped up its patrols and state of alert in case of clashes between Serbs and Albanians .
Ninety percent of Kosovo's 2 million people are ethnic Albanians , but around 120,000 Serbs remain and there are fears that Serbs in northern Kosovo might make trouble .
Undercover Serbian security forces who have moved into the area say they are ready to respond with force if Albanians move into the Serbian enclave in the north .
Kosovo 's imminent declaration of independence would come almost nine years after a Nato bombing campaign drove out Serb forces to halt a wave of killings in a two year - war against separatist rebels .
Sony's TZ series of 11.1 " subnotebooks are singled out for praise in Greenpeace 's latest guide to greener electronics , but the company itself was edged out by Samsung , Toshiba and Nokia in the overall runnings .
The TZ , newly garbage - free when it comes to pre-installed applications , is also free of another kind of garbage — beryllium — which landed it the top spot in the advocacy group 's roundup of green machines .
Sony , Dell and Lenovo shared second place in the company rankings , however , scoring 7.3 .
Samsung , Toshiba and Nokia are in joint first place as the greenest manufacturers , scoring 7.7 out of 10 .
Nokia would have won handily had it not , according to Greenpeace , been penalized a point " for corporate misbehavior as a result of Greenpeace testing of the companies ' take - back practice in the Philippines , Thailand , Russia , Argentina and India . "
Apple , called out by Greenpeace in the past , scores a respectable 6.7 , along with HP , Sony - Ericsson , Fujitsu and LG .
Faring poorly are Panasonic , Microsoft and Philips , scoring close to 4 , but this round 's Object of Hatred is Nintendo , which gets only 0.3 on the hippyometer .
Each company gets a brief blurb at Greenpeace 's home page , explaining the marks given and what they mean .
Joint winners Samsung and Nokia score well on their policies toward removing toxins from their machines , with top - placed firm Toshiba praised for its recycling initiative .
Low - placed contenders generally get a wag of the green finger for poor take - back policies .
Nintendo is singled out for excoriation , it seems , because it has n't given Greenpeace details of its policies .

カシオ計算機は2008年3月，デジタル・カメラ「EX-F1」を発売する（図1）。特徴はシャッター・チャンスを逃しにくく，H.264形式のフルHD（1080/60i）動画も撮れること。シャッター・チャンスを逃しにくいのは，連写速度が60フレーム/秒と速いため（1フレームは600万画素）。これまでは10フレーム/秒ほどが最速だった。
さらにEX-F1は，肉眼ではとらえられない画像も撮れる（サンプル動画集）。1フレームを336×96画素にすれば，フレーム速度は1200フレーム/秒に達する。高価な工業用カメラでしか成し得なかったフレーム速度である。
カシオ計算機は何を意図してEX-F1を作ったのか，商品企画を担当した中山仁氏（羽村技術センター
開発本部 QV統轄部 商品企画部 兼 第一開発部 部長）に聞いた。中山氏はカメラ業界を代表するトレンド・セッターで，「 QV-10」から一貫して同社の商品企画を引っ張っている（聞き手＝日経エレクトロニクス 大槻智洋）。
※EX- F1の詳細な特徴や仕様は，図2や同社のWebサイトを参照してください。
唯一無二だからこ そ
―― EX - F1は革新的なカメラですが，高価ともいえます。発売当初の想定価格は約13万円と，ニコンのデジタル一眼レフ機「D40x」を標準ズーム・レンズ付きで2台買えるからです。加えて，いろいろできるが故に適した用途がいま一つ分からないという声も聞きます。
中山氏 確かに価格だけを考えれば安くはありません。しかし，これは今までにないカメラです。ほかができない機能を実現しています。ここを評価し購入してくれる方は少なくないと確信しています。具体的には，高速なオートフォーカスを搭載したデジタル一眼レフ機でさえ撮れなかったものが撮れたり，肉眼ではとらえられないものが見えるたりすることに関心を持つ方々が買ってくれるはずです。
―― EX - F1に適した被写体として，スポーツをしている人や鳥などが考えられますが，民生用として群を抜く高速度撮影を可能にしただけに，もっといろいろありそうですね。
中山氏 CMOS センサが吐き出す膨大な画像データをどう活用すべきかは，これからも研究し続けねばなりません。そのためには民生機器として，ある程度の数が売れることが必要です（本誌注：月産予定台数は1万台）。13万円という想定実売価格は，こうした今後の展開を踏まえて決めました。
―― 13万円なら利益が出るのでしょうか。開発費を今後の商品でも回収したとしても，やはり相当…
中山氏 正直 「儲かります！」と言えるような値付けではありません。ただし，お金に直接換算できない効果は大きい。EX-F1を販売することで「カシオは最先端商品を作る」という印象を消費者に与えられます。
コンパクト・カメラは，どんぐりの背比べのような競争をしています。台湾メーカーでも日本勢とさほど遜色ない商品を作れる。ブランド・イメージの向上は必須です。だからEX-F1に「EXILIM」ブランドを付けました。これまでの「『EXILIM＝薄型』というイメージと違うじゃないか」という意見もありましたが，新しいもの，進化したもの，といった印象を消費者に与えるブランドにEXILIMをしていきたいです。
高速連写が第3世代デジカメを生む
中山氏 当社はEX - F1を第3世代のデジタル・カメラと位置付けています。現時点では少数のユーザーにしか響かない商品ですが，将来のカメラすべてに波及する機能を持つからです。それが高速連写であり，撮影の失敗を強く抑制できます。
デジタル・カメラの第1世代は「 QV-10」が切り開きました。そして第2世代を作ったのは「EX-S1」（初代EXILIM）でしょう。銀塩カメラでは実質不可能だったウエラブル化を実現したからです。
―― EX - S1 以上にスゴかったの が「 EX - Z3」ではないでしょうか。厚さ2cmほどの筐体に光学3倍ズームを押し込め，2型と大きな液晶パネルを搭載して，大ヒットしました。
中山氏 その通りです。ウエラブルという特徴だけに依存していたならEXILIMシリーズは続かなかったかもしれません。カメラ付き携帯電話機が急速に普及し性能を高めましたから。EX-Z3は，EX-S1の「薄型」を受け継ぎながら，本格的な撮影機能を備えた。コンパクト機のスタンダードになったと思います。
――高速連写機の分野でも，EX-Z3のような量を稼げる機種を投入しますか。
中山氏 EX - F1に実装した技術を普及価格帯の商品に展開することは，当然検討しています。ただ，それには時間がかかる。超高速CMOSセンサを使った商品は当分の間，「違いの分かる人」に向けることになります。
時間がかかるのは，いろいろな問題がからんでいるからです。例えば45nm世代の画像処理LSIを開発すれば済むわけではありません。消費者のニーズに真に合致した用途を開拓しなければなりません。本体形状や目標価格帯も見定める必要があります。
当社以外のカメラ・メーカーも高速連写機を発売する必要もあるでしょう。このジャンルの需要を喚起するためです。それに成功すればソニーを始めとした撮像素子メーカーは，一段と超高速CMOSセンサの開発に注力できます。
シャッター・ボタンが悪さをする
―― 少し話を戻します 。 第3世代のデジタル・カメラとはどんなものでしょうか。かねてより中山さんは「動画で撮った方が伝わりやすい場面は動画で撮ればいい。静止画で撮りにくければ動画で押さえればいい。動画と静止画の壁は技術の未成熟さに起因している」とおっしゃっていました。
中山氏 誰も彼もが所望の画像をスッと撮れる。これこそがカメラの理想形です。画像は，静止画でも動画でもいい。静止画は動画から取り出したものかもしれない。加えて将来のカメラは，ユーザーに「ここではこの静止画（または動画）を残してはどうでしょうか」と提案する機能も備えるでしょう。
私は 「息をひそめて決定的瞬間に合わせてシャッターを切る」という快感を否定するつもりはありません。ただ，多くの消費者にとって撮ること自体は目的でない。本当の目的は，撮影結果を自分で見て感動を再現したり，友人や家族に見せて共感してもらったりすることにあります。
もっと言えばシャッター・ボタンは失敗写真を生む元凶の一つとさえいえる。ユーザーがシャッターを切らなければ手ブレなんか起きないし，カメラ側で正しくタイミングをとらえられれば決定的瞬間も逃さずに済むからです。
カメラの自動化は着々と進んでいます。松下電器産業のデジタル・カメラが備えた自動設定機能「おまかせiAモード」も一例でしょう。ここに将来はEX-F1が備えた高速連写（シャッターの自動化）が合流していくのではないでしょうか。

The underarm incident , 1981
For many people , all trans - Tasman cricket contests are overshadowed by the unprecedented events of 1 February 1981 .
With New Zealand needing a six from the final ball to tie the match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( an unlikely prospect on one of the world 's largest grounds ) , the Australian captain , Greg Chappell , ordered his brother Trevor to bowl underarm to New Zealand 's number 10 batsman , Brian McKechnie .
Such an action was ( at the time ) within the rules , if not the spirit , of the game .
By Imogen Willcocks
Reporter , Whistleblower
Imogen Willcocks had no previous experience of child - minding
Secret filming
Every day , over a million working parents use childminders and private nurseries , believing their babies are in hands of highly qualified , strictly regulated and genuine caring people .
Terrifyingly , many of them are wrong .
Last year an inspector at Ofsted - the government agency that regulates childminders and nurseries - phoned the BBC Whistleblower programme and told me a chilling story .
Out of 700 nurseries she and colleagues had inspected , she had found only five that she would have let her own two children go to .
She told me that Ofsted inspection reports - the only thing parents have to go on when choosing a nursery - are n't worth the paper they 're printed on .
At times I was on my own with as many as 13 children
Imogen Willcocks
" We are literally skimming the surface " , my Ofsted whistleblower said .
" We are told constantly : ' if you do n't see a problem , do n't look for one .
Take a quick look and get out ' .
" The number one priority for all Ofsted inspectors is to meet their targets .
Because if they do n't they are disciplined .
Targets take priority over safeguarding children , " she said .
I decided to test her claims by going undercover and getting myself a job in a number of nurseries .
' Cursory interview '
At first I thought there might be a problem .
I was 21 .
I have never had any children and apart from a couple of babysitting stints , have no experience looking after babies and toddlers .
I need n't have worried .
None of the nurseries I worked for bothered to check my fake CV or fictitious references and even Ofsted itself , who at least checked my criminal record , registered me as a child - minder , even though the premises were totally unsuitable .
We 'd had a tip - off about the Buttons nursery in Hanwell , west London , saying its supervision of babies and toddlers was unacceptable .
After a cursory interview I was appointed as a nursery assistant .
No one checked my references and in the five weeks I was there , they never received the all clear from the Criminal Records Bureau ( CRB ) .
I could have been anyone .
Buttons is based in a rambling , 19th Century detached house and caters to the area 's professional middle classes .
It was not cheap , charging £ 1,100 a month for a child under two .
For that kind of money parents get to drop off their babies and toddlers at 8 am and pick them up at 6 pm .
I was terrified , partly because of the fear that my secret filming equipment would be discovered , but mostly because apart from a quick nappy - changing lesson with a friend 's baby , I had no idea how to look after children .
No one noticed my inexperience .
At 21 , I was actually one of the oldest nursery assistants there .
Damage limitation
Many of them were trainees and had no idea what they were supposed to be doing .
There was no on - the - job training .
Instead you were thrown in at the deep end .
At times I was on my own with as many as 13 children - although the law says carers waiting for their CRB clearance should always be closely supervised at all times .
And they should not be allowed to change nappies and take children to the toilet .
With that many children to look after , I could barely make sure they were safe , let alone care for them individually .
The care and safety of our children is of utmost importance
Satnam Parhar ,
Buttons nursery
Instead it was just damage limitation - I found myself grabbing broken glass , sticks and sharp objects from children as young as three .
One day builders were brought in to fit guards to the radiators because one little boy - weeks earlier - had badly burnt his hand on one .
The other staff told me that the owner , Satnam Parhar , had blamed the staff for not supervising him properly .
They said he was only getting the guards fitted because an Ofsted inspection was due .
While the builders were there , they left their power tools inches away from where the children were playing and no - one seemed to notice .
Safety ensured
Along with the other nursery assistants at Buttons , I was poorly supervised and very poorly paid .
I was on about £ 100 a week - nearly less than half the legal minimum wage .
It 's hardly surprising , then , that many of the staff were less than high - quality carers .
I saw two nursery assistants hauling a boy across the nursery by his arm .
Then heard a child being called a " shit - bag " , and saw a little girl 's head being shoved into the mattress because she did n't want to go to sleep .
When I complained to Mr Parhar that I had been left on my own with 13 children , he refused to accept what I was saying and called the idea crazy .
Our policy of unannounced inspections keeps most nurseries and childminders on their toes
Ofsted statement
When I contacted him about what I 'd be reporting for BBC One 's Whistleblower programme , he issued a statement saying : " Buttons day nursery is a family run nursery with a loyal following .
" The care and safety of our children is of utmost importance .
Buttons has regularly received favourable Ofsted reports one as recently as February 2008 .
" New joiners undertake a full induction programme and there are procedures in place to ensure the safety of children .
We take any allegations or criticism very seriously and will investigate these complaints and take appropriate action . "
My eight - month investigation in various establishments had uncovered a childcare culture where a new carer 's criminal records and references are never checked , yet they will immediately be left alone with young , vulnerable children .
Ofsted said in a statement that it would consider making improvements based on the things I had uncovered .
But it added : " Ours is the most intensive inspection and monitoring system in Europe .
" Our inspections of nurseries and childminders are rigorous and the vast majority of our inspectors are highly skilled professionals who do a good job .
" Our policy of unannounced inspections keeps most nurseries and childminders on their toes . "
I do n't yet have children .
When I finished my undercover work I could return to normal without worrying about where to put my children .
But now I worry about the children of my friends .
And having seen what I 've seen , I can't imagine I 'll ever have my own babies and put them into childcare .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Two widely accepted beliefs about the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting Tuesday are that the central bank is worried about the country falling into a recession and that it will again slash interest rates sharply .
But should the Fed stop worrying and love a recession ?
Several economists , including one member of the Fed 's policy - making committee , have argued that more rate cuts are the wrong solution to spur economic growth .
Some even believe a recession might be the best answer for the economy in the long term .
That 's still a minority view though .
Federal funds futures on the Chicago Board of Trade show investors betting that there is a 100 % chance of at least a three - quarter percentage point cut at Tuesday 's meeting , and a 52 % chance of a full percentage point cut .
Even most critics of the Fed 's rate cuts concede some additional cuts are certain Tuesday , especially since a report Friday morning showed that consumer prices held steady last month .
That 's not to mention the fact that the Fed cut the rate it charges financial institutions by a quarter point Sunday , to 3.25 % , as part of JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) 's proposed acquisition of Bear Stearns ( BSC , Fortune 500 ) in an effort to prevent a collapse at Bear .
That left just a quarter point difference between this rate and the 3 % fed funds rate that policy makers will consider at the meeting .
If the Fed cuts as much as some expect , that would put its key federal funds rate at 2 % , down from 5.25 % when the Fed first began lowering rates six months ago .
Yet , it 's not clear that the Fed cuts can do much to fix what ails the U.S. economy as it undergoes a credit crunch .
Too late for rate cuts to work ?
There is a growing view among leading economists that the country is likely already in a recession that the Fed 's previous rate cuts could n't stop .
" The problems the markets are facing are not due to interest rates being too high .
It 's a lack of confidence , " said Barry Ritholtz , the CEO and director of equity research for Fusion IQ .
Ritholtz and others arguing against more cuts say that only an economic slowdown can limit the inflationary pressures now building .
They say that rate cuts are causing a sharp decline in the dollar that is feeding record prices for commodities such as oil and gold .
" The bottom line is that additional rate cuts are not going to help lenders trust each other and lend more , " said Rich Yamarone , director of economic research at Argus Research .
" They are just going to throw accelerant on a heated inflationary environment . "
And perhaps more controversially , those calling for an end to rate cuts say that the business failures and other economic pain likely to accompany a recession are a necessary evil for the economy going forward .
Using low rates to try to ward off a recession is only likely to feed another asset bubble like the one in tech stocks in the 1990's or housing in the middle of this decade .
" What is this obsessive need to overturn the business cycle ? " said Ritholtz .
" You can end up preventing the market from following its normal course of clearing out the deadwood and letting healthy trees grow .
The creative destruction of capitalism , that 's what the Fed is working to prevent . "
The Fed 's inflation hawk is worried
One of the critics of Fed cuts is even on the Federal Open Market Committee that meets to decide interest rate moves .
Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher , who was the only one to vote against the rate cut in January , has continued to talk loudly about inflation fears recently .
He is widely expected to dissent against another rate cut .
In speeches in Europe last week , Fisher said talk that the Fed has adopted an " easy money " policy makes his " skin crawl " and that the Fed should n't be so afraid of a recession .
Fisher contended that he has one of the most bearish views of the economy of any member of the FOMC .
But he does n't believe that even a sputtering economy is justification to risk more inflation with further rate cuts .
" Our obligation is to prevent inflation in order to sustain long - term employment growth .
I believe that the best way to cut through the treacherous economic waves that are upon us and keep our ship steaming forward is to stick to our purpose , " Fisher told the Society of Business Economists in London on March 4 .
And while Fisher did not explicitly mention the weakening dollar , he argued in a speech in Paris two days later that the global financial markets made it more important than ever for the Fed to show that is as concerned about inflation as other central banks around the globe ..
" In today 's world , where investors can move their funds instantly from one currency to another to avoid depreciation , the price central bankers pay for high inflation is much higher than in the past , " he said .
Inflation fears growing
Tom Schlesinger , executive director Financial Markets Center , says he does n't believe that Fisher is the only member of the FOMC who is worried about inflationary pressures .
" I think there are a few bank presidents actively concerned about inflation risks and will act as a minor brake on Fed cuts , " he said .
" I think the internal debates are going to be much more pointed going forward . "
But Schlesinger said that rate cuts and other moves by the Fed to help pump liquidity into financial markets are necessary considering the weakness in the economy .
And he believes Fisher is likely to be the only FOMC member to vote against the next rate cut .
" I have a hard time picturing Fisher being persuasive when the natural and justifiable inclination is to move quickly to put out the fire and to stand with the Fed chairman , " he said .
Athena Smalltalk for embedded applications 9 November , 2007
Alexandre Bergel has just announced on the Squeak Dev mailing list his work on Athena , a new Smalltalk environment intended to be embedded in Java programs .
Athena comprises a set of tools to use the Smalltalk programming language in an embedded setting .
It offers a small ( 100 kB ) virtual machine written in Java , a shell , and a set of tools to program Athena from Squeak .
The Athena VM is based on work done by Timothy A. Budd on Smallworld , and is released under the MIT licence .
You can see a video of Alexandre ’s talk about Athena at the Squeak BOF at OOPSLA 2007 .
Dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) is a biologically active metabolite of testosterone .
It is formed primarily in the prostate gland , testes , hair follicles , and adrenal glands .
Scientific research has discovered that DHT is the primary contributing factor in male - pattern baldness .
DHT also plays a role in the development or exacerbation of benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) and prostate cancer .
Recent medical research in the area of prostate health has involved the development of drugs and supplements , which will block or at least inhibit the production of DHT .
There are a number of drugs on the market that act as DHT blockers , including finasteride ( sold under the names Proscar for BPH and Propecia for androgenic alopecia ) and dutasteride ( sold under the name Avodart ) .
There is also a natural DHT blocker Saw Palmetto , which has shown promise in the treatment of BHP and hair loss .

This is the A - 12 , a supersonic spy plane that was the precursor of the SR - 71 — and according to the CIA , even while they look similar , in some ways it was more advanced than the famous Blackbird .
It 's one of 10 planes that survived the 15 - plane OXCART program , one of which is in the USS Intrepid in Manhattan .
This one was unveiled today by our dear friends at the CIA in an official ceremony at their Langley HQs .
The story of this Mach 3.2 technological wonder starts in 1957 and , like all secret flying things full of gadgets , it 's fascinating .

The OXCART program story began in 1957 , when a contractor suggested that high - altitude supersonic flight was the only way to avoid Soviet air defenses .
The CIA 's Richard M. Bissell , who was directing the 1954 U - 2 spy plane program at the time , was concerned about their vulnerability to USSR radars and anti-air missiles .
He was right : in 1960 the Soviets shot down Francis Gary Powers ' U - 2 near Sverdlovsk .
By then the A - 12 program was already under way : after Lockheed Aircraft completed " antiradar studies , aerodynamic structural tests , and engineering designs , " the CIA gave the green light to produce the 12 aircraft on January 30th , 1960 .
It was still called the A - 11 at the time and Lockheed engineer Clarence L. Johnson was the main designer .
He also was responsible for the U - 2 but , for some reason and after months of drawings and wind - tunnel model testing , people were still not convinced this beast could fly .
It did , but only after years of tests and adjustments .
It was a difficult path .
The aircraft skin , for example , had to made out of a titanium alloy , as it had to resist 550 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures while flying at top speed .
The aircraft manufacturing process , which at that point only used aluminum frames , was an absolute nightmare .
All machinery broke trying to work the titanium and new tooling parts had to be designed and created from scratch .
As a result , each plane had to be hand - crafted .

The quest to make its radar signature was also painful .
For one year and a half , a full - scale model of the plane manufactured with new radar - absorbent materials was tested .
Sitting on a pylon in a secret base and after countless adjustments , it was discovered that adding some big metallic parts to each side of the fuselage reduced the radar footprint .
Johnson thought it was going to harm the aerodynamics but , in later flight tests , it was clear it helped the lift .
It was all part of the quest for radar invisibility but , years later , these features were used by Lockheed in other supersonic designs .
As a result of all these changes to its original design , the plane got its final designation : the A - 12 .
The interior of the plane was also quite problematic :
For reasons of weight , the plane had to be constructed without almost no thermal insulation , converting the cockpit into a true oven .
As a result , the pilot had to use an astronaut - like suit with its own refrigeration system .
And probably Clint Eastwood 's Firefoxy asbestos underpants too .

Even the runway had to be specially created for the OXCART program .
The initial test ground strip at a secret location in the Nevada desert ( the CIA document does n't mention it but it was probably Area 51 ) was only 5,000 feet long and incapable of supporting the weight of the A - 12 .
Great for for UFO landings , but it needed pouring 25,000 yards of concrete to achieve the necessary strength and 8,500 - feet length necessary for the A - 12's take - off and landing .

However , at the end everything was solved and the pilots , who had to be six feet tall , under 175 pounds and come with The Right Stuff were selected : William L. Skliar , Kenneth S. Collins , Walter Ray , Lon Walter , Mele Vojvodich , Jr. , Jack W. Weeks , Ronald " Jack " Layton , Dennis B. Sullivan , David P. Young , Francis J. Murray , and Russell Scott were the heroes ' names , chosen to test this wild beast .

On April 26th 1962 , the A - 12 took to the skies .
Louis Schack piloted it during its first 40 - minute unofficial maiden flight .
Four days later , he also took her into its official maiden flight for 59 minutes .
It was n't until May 4th that the A - 12 broke the sound barrier for the first time , reaching Mach 1.1 .
During 1962 the aircraft kept evolving during flight testing but it was n't until 1967 , after countless delays caused by political discussions and a couple of accidents , that the A - 12 was employed in real missions .
The target : Vietnam .
Advertisement
The first mission was flown on May 31st 1967 and it accomplished all objectives .
The A - 12 force kept flying successfully , but was retired in 1968 , when the SR - 71 Blackbird took its place .
Of the final 15 A - 12s produced by Lockheed , five were lost and two pilots were killed .
It may seem like not a lot was achieved , but this aircraft pushed the envelope in every way imaginable making many of the common concepts of modern supersonic aviation possible , from aerodynamic design to life support systems an specially manufacturing processes .
As Ken Collins — one of its pilots — said during the recent unveiling ceremony by the CIA at Langley : " It was a beautiful airplane , it was a beautiful airplane to land , and just technically a fantastic airplane to fly . "

[ CIA and Agence France - Presse ]
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- I hesitate to pick a fight with a two - time Pulitzer Prize - winner like New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman .
On the critical issue of developing a national energy policy to lessen our consumption of imported oil , he 's been early , smart , and right .
But Friedman whiffed in his Times column yesterday , called " Et Tu , Toyota , " by hauling out one of the hoariest of urban myths :
That forcing higher fuel economy standards on American car buyers is what 's needed to encourage more energy - efficient vehicles and make Detroit more competitive with its import competitors .
That 's wrong ... and wrong .
Forcing people to buy more efficient cars by ordering car companies to make them is like forcing people to lose weight by banning food companies from selling Big Macs and pizzas .
The reason Americans consume so much gasoline is that they like their big pickup trucks , SUVs , and V - 8 engines .
The reason the automakers make them is because people want to buy them .
Friedman 's second argument , that " Detroit 's failure to sell more energy - efficient vehicles has clearly contributed to its brush with bankruptcy " is baloney , too .
Actually the opposite is true .
Detroit is forced to sell small cars at a loss because the government already mandates stringent full economy standards .
The automakers make a lot more money on big , gas - guzzling cars whose sales are unrestricted .
Some of the points that Friedman makes to buttress his arguments are misleading .
He praises Japan and Europe for auto fleets that have much better mileage standards than the U.S. without mentioning the fact that driving conditions are different - try steering a Lincoln Navigator through a medieval village in Italy - and gasoline taxes in those countries are so high that people are willing to squeeze into small cars .
Start charging American drivers $ 8 a gallon and they 'll switch to small cars in a New York minute .
Friedman also perpetuates the far - fetched notion that Toyota ( Charts ) has a responsibility to lead the charge for higher fuel economy standards .
Toyota is successful precisely because it lets the market dictate its product offerings .
Since American buyers want big trucks , Toyota makes them .
It has left its Japanese competitor Honda in the dust precisely because Honda refuses to make a big truck or a V - 8 .
American manufacturers DO build fuel - efficient cars but Americans do n't buy them .
Ford ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) is currently offering cut-rate financing on the 2008 Escape Hybrid , while GM ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) is subsidizing the smallest car in its lineup , the Chevy Aveo .
And GM can brag all it wants about having more models - 30 of them - than any other manufacturer that get more than 30 miles per gallon on the highway , but it gets precious little credit for it in the marketplace .
If you want to really slow the progress toward more fuel - efficient vehicles , force the industry to make more of them and lose money in the process .
As Toyota spokesman Irv Miller points out , " You ca n't bankrupt the industry if you want it to invest in our environmental future . "
It has been argued here before that if the government wants to be serious about improving fuel economy , all it has to do is boost the tax on gasoline .
The revenue generated could be rebated to lower - income drivers who are truly disadvantaged or invested in mass transit .
The auto companies are n't going to argue for such a tax because it would give them a black eye with consumers .
And the government wo n't do it either , because of its anti-tax bias .
But Friedman , using his column as a bully pulpit , could argue for such a tax with impunity .
And it would be a whole lot more effective than perpetuating the old myth about the ignorant luddites in Detroit who are withholding the small , fuel - sipping cars that Americans really want to buy .
We were both silent for a while , and as I looked towards the window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn .
There seemed a strange stillness over everything .
But as I listened , I heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves .
The Count 's eyes gleamed , and he said :
" Listen to them , the children of the night .
What music they make ! "
It was , I think , his best debate in the campaign so far .
The one - on - one format elevated him instantly and he commanded the stage and the occasion .
Hillary Clinton did not do poorly .
All her strengths were on show : the policy mastery , the gaffe - free talking points , the Clinton record in the 1990s .
But that made his mastery all the more impressive .
The good natured sparring helped him .
He neutralized her on healthcare and simply cleaned up on the war in Iraq .
But most crucial : he seemed like a president .
He was already battling McCain .
She was still pivoting off Bush .
In his body language , he carefully upstaged her , without looking as if he were trying .
By the end of the debate , he was pulling her chair back for her .
I 'd say that he won the primary election tonight .
She is still a formidable candidate and her massive institutional advantage may eventually give her the nomination .
But she has n't won this primary argument or this primary battle .
If she becomes the nominee , it will be because she survived the primaries .
He won them .
You know my bias .
It 's on my sleeve .
But I 've criticized Obama 's performances in the past and could n't find a flaw tonight .
A good closer , as I 've been told for over a year now .
You can say that again .

The snowstorms currently sweeping China have wreaked havoc with millions of people 's New Year travel plans and caused $ 3 billion worth of losses , including thousands of acres of winter crops .
But the harsh weather is revealing an even deeper problem for Beijing : the difficulty of trying to manage a mixed economy , which is about 30 percent state - owned and 70 percent in private hands .
" The Chinese economy is not a real market economy , nor a real command economy , so government controls are not very effective , " says Xu Guangjian , an economist at People 's University in Beijing .
Food and power shortages affecting tens of millions of people , and tens of thousands of enterprises , have drawn attention to just how difficult a task the Chinese government faces , even when the sun is shining .
The weather and the timing have compounded underlying economic problems , says Stephen Green , senior economist with Standard Chartered Bank in Shanghai .
" This is a perfect storm , " he says .
The past month has seen several indications of how easily an economy as huge and complex as China 's can slip out of the central government 's control .
Two weeks ago , for the first time in 15 years , the authorities imposed price controls on a number of basic food items in a bid to stem inflation , which reached an 11 year high of 6.9 percent in November .
Last week , the government 's Statistics Bureau announced that the Chinese economy had grown by 11.4 percent in 2007 – the fastest rate in 13 years and a good deal faster than planners , worried by the dangers of an overheated economy , had hoped .
On Jan. 28 , as power stations ran short of fuel , the National Development and Reform Council , China 's top economic policy body , ordered provincial governments to share coal supplies , as a sign that local officials were putting their own interests ahead of national needs .
Officials insist that the new food price controls are simply an effort to overcome malfunctions in the market , not a retreat to socialist economic planning diktats .
Nor is China the only Asian country taking action in the face of rising food prices : Malaysia rationed cooking oil last month , while Indonesia is subsidizing edible oil refineries to keep retail prices down .
Beijing 's moves include curbing exports of wheat , corn , and rice powder in an effort to boost domestic supply and dampen price increases .
But with food taking up nearly half of a poor Chinese citizen 's weekly budget , and the price of pork , a local staple , rising by more than 50 percent last year , Beijing is especially worried about the danger of social unrest .
A survey released in January by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences ( CASS ) found that inflation is the No. 1 public concern among Chinese citizens , and the government has made the fight against rising food prices its top priority .
Administrative price controls , however , are hard to implement now that almost all food production , distribution , and sales are in private hands , economists say .
If farmers or shopkeepers are not allowed to raise their prices in line with their costs , they will be tempted to hold supplies back .
" In some places there will be shortages , " predicts Professor Xu .
" It is a predictable result . "
As a short - term measure to calm expectations , the price controls may have some impact , suggests Wang Cheng , an economist with CASS .
" They will work for a period of time , but not so long , " he cautions .
" Trying to use price controls to contain inflation is probably not wise ... and will be very difficult to impose , " says Andy Xie , an independent economic analyst .
The government 's plans have not been helped by the severe weather , which is expected to push food prices higher .
" The impact of the snow disaster in southern China on winter crop production is extremely serious , " Chen Xiwen , deputy head of the ruling Communist party 's leading financial team , told reporters on Jan. 31 .
He predicted that January 's inflation rate would be around 6.5 percent , roughly the same as December 's figure .
US inflation rose .3 percent in December , by comparison .
The power outages that have made the cold even harder to bear in much of central and southern China have also highlighted the complexities of running an economy that is partly state - owned and partly private .
Nowhere is the confusion greater than in the energy sector , which is " stranded between the plan and the market " in the words of Philip Andrews - Speed , director of the Centre for Energy Policy at Dundee University in Scotland .
Power stations are constrained by a freeze that the government has declared on electricity prices , which has made them increasingly unprofitable as coal prices have risen .
Though weather - related transport difficulties have clearly contributed much to current coal shortages , market distortions seem also to be playing a role :
Some power station managers have reportedly been selling their coal stocks , rather than burning them to generate electricity , in order to make more money .
The government has plans to liberalize the energy sector , which would mean lifting the freeze on electricity and gasoline prices , but while inflation is a threat , " this is not the right time to pursue such reforms " says Mr. Wang .
" The government could raise energy prices , but it fears the reaction on the street , " adds Mr. Green .
Meanwhile , China 's booming gross domestic product growth worries officials whose efforts to rein it in have not succeeded .
Repeated government moves to limit credit – such as higher interest rates and directives to banks to curb their lending – have not dampened the runaway growth , which many economists say is fueling the inflationary spiral .
The international economic downturn could help slow China 's economic growth in the coming months , given its dependence on exports to troubled economies such as America's .
But Beijing acknowledges that it has little influence over the pace of a global slowdown .
" There are uncertainties in international circumstances and the economic environment , and there are new difficulties and contradictions in the domestic economy , " Prime Minister Wen Jiabao told his cabinet last week , in somber comments published on Jan. 28 .
" We fear that 2008 will be a most difficult year for the economy , " he added .
An economic record only Bush could be proud of
Following up on the last item for a moment , there was one other part of Bush ’s speech to CPAC that warranted special attention .
“ When I took office , we inherited a recession — and then we acted .
We were guided by this principle : the best way to help our economy grow is to leave money in the hands of those responsible for our prosperity .
That , of course , would be the American people .
And so with your support , we passed one of the largest tax cuts in American history — and then we cut taxes again .
In all , we delivered nearly $ 2 trillion in tax relief over the past seven years .
Our critics wanted a different approach .
They believed that the best way to keep the economy — to help the economy was to keep taxes in Washington and expand the size and scope of the federal government … .
Despite these dire predictions , the tax cuts we passed contributed to a record 52 months of job creation .
They helped produce strong economic growth — and the increased revenues from that growth have put us on track to a balance our budget by 2012 .
Here is the bottom line : tax relief works . ”
Now , I suspect I ’m easily dismissed by Bush and his allies as part of the reality - based community , but I tend to think of the president ’s economic record as something of a disaster .
Anytime Bush wants to list his accomplishments in office , it must be a difficult challenge , but given the state of the economy , this looks like a topic to be avoided .
But not this guy ; he wants to brag about his economic record , using some of the silliest arguments imaginable .
Let ’s take these quickly , one at a time .
* “ When I took office , we inherited a recession . ”
That ’s demonstrably false .
* “ Despite these dire predictions , the tax cuts we passed contributed to a record 52 months of job creation . ”
First , the 52 - month streak ended last month .
Second , Bush has only added , on average , 369,000 private - sector jobs per year over the course of his presidency ( nearly one - fifth the total under Clinton , who raised taxes ) .
* “ [ Tax cuts ] helped produce strong economic growth . ”
Unfortunately , “ strong ” is a subjective word .
In reality , Bush has produced the worst GDP growth of any president of the last 50 years .
* “ [ I ] increased revenues from that growth have put us on track to a balance our budget by 2012 . ”
First , we ’re nowhere near “ on track ” to balance the budget by 2012 ; Bush ’s own OMB projects deficits of over $ 400 billion in each of the next two years .
Second , the increased - revenue argument sounds an awful lot like the ridiculous “ tax fairy ” nonsense Republicans are so fond of .
* “ Here is the bottom line : tax relief works . ”
Works for whom ?
The irony is , Bush not only screwed up every possible facet of the nation ’s fiscal and economic health , he was wrong in all of his predictions .
He assured the nation that if he got his tax cuts through , he could balance the budget , match ( if not , exceed ) Clinton ’s record on job growth , match ( if not , exceed ) Clinton ’s record on GDP growth , reduce poverty , and watch the stock market soar .
All of those predictions were n’t just mistakes , the opposite came to fruition .
Every number that was supposed to go down went up , and the numbers that were supposed to go up went down .
It ’s not even a matter of opinion — the guarantees of 2001 and 2003 were simply wrong .
The benefits of Bush ’s policies never materialized .
Mr. President , you might want to find something different to brag about .
This record is humiliating .
Have you ever really seen the night sky — a sky without any pollution from artificial light sources ?
Over half of Earthâ€™s population lives in urban areas , and have probably never seen a rich , dark sky full of millions thousands of stars .
Not only does light pollution make it harder for amateur and professional astronomers to observe the night sky , but it affects other living things as well .
Birds and other animals that are nocturnal can become disoriented from constant artificial light .
You can help track how light - polluted our skies have become by participating in the GLOBE at Night Program .
All you need to do is go outside and look for the constellation Orion and compare your view with sky charts provided by GLOBE and report your findings .
The programs runs from now until March 8 .
The GLOBE website provides you with information and links on how to find your latitude and longitude and how to find Orion .
You then match your nighttime sky to one of their magnitude charts and report your observation .
Then you can compare your observation to thousands around the world .
Last year about 8,500 people participated in this event .
Phil and Emily have already posted on this , but Universe Today is now joining in to help GLOBE have their night sky biggest event yet .
Also available from the GLOBE site are downloadable family activity packets and information for teachers , offered in several different languages .
Take this opportunity share the wonders of the night sky with young children while helping to track light pollution .
It will only take a few minutes .
To be fair , Anderson Cooper did n't actually say what the closed captioning stenographer thinks he did .
But , c'mon .
How many hearing - impaired Americans do you suppose are out there that think bin Laden called Senator Obama last night ?
The world may never know .
What we do know is that this is n't the first time this " mistake " has been made .

The internal workings of the White House that caused it to lose perhaps millions of internal e-mails over several years is becoming clearer , but with that sharper focus comes diminishing hopes among Democrats and open - government activists that history will ever get the full picture of how the Bush administration operated .
At a Capitol Hill hearing yesterday , a former White House computer technician outlined the administration ’s shortcomings in implementing a “ primitive ” e-mail archiving system that created a high risk the information would be lost .
Steven McDevitt , who worked for the administration from 2002 to 2006 , also doubled previously reported estimates of the number of days of missing e-mails .
Investigators for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee previously said e-mails were missing for 473 days ; McDevit said in written testimony to the committee that the number was closer to 1,000 days .
He also said at least 1 million e-mails were believed to have gone missing ; activists have estimated the number of missing e-mails is closer to 10 million .

Not Good at Math ?
Blame Your Inner Fish
New research suggests that female mosquitofish can count , but only up to four with any precision .
No word on how high male mosquitofish can count .
The research design is quite clever :
When males bother females , the females try to flee to the biggest group of nearby females .
When given the choice between two groups — one with three other fish and another with four — the females consistently choose the group with four .
When the choice is six vs. seven , they act like they ca n’t tell the difference .
( Although maybe they count that high and they just do n’t care about six vs. seven . )
They do , however , distinguish between groups that are twice as big as other groups even when the numbers are big ( e.g. eight vs. sixteen ) .
According to the article , this puts the mosquitofish on par with young children , and apparently , any human who does not have access to language as a way of helping with the counting .
As an example , Christian Agrillo , an experimental psychologist at the University of Padua in Italy , claims that the indigenous people who speak Munduruku in the Amazon do n’t have words for any number higher than five , and these folks do n’t count much better than the fish .
One needs to be a little careful with the direction of causality here , however .
Perhaps the fact that the Munduruku do n’t bother with numbers higher than five is an indicator that math is n’t really their thing to start with .
( Hat tip to the always - interesting folks at Spectre . )
The similarity between fish and humans caught my attention because I ’ve been reading a delightful little book by my University of Chicago colleague ( who I do n’t think I have ever met ) , Neil Shubin , entitled Your Inner Fish .
Shubin , a paleontologist , makes a convincing case for us being very fish - like physically and anatomically :
The same bones that make up fish fins are in our hands .
Early on , human embryos and shark embryos look a whole lot alike .
There are dozens of examples .
Perhaps this should not be surprising given that we evolved from fish , but I had never really thought about the details before .
The best thing about the book is that Shubin absolutely loves what he does with the sort of child - like innocence that often typifies the best scientists .
His enthusiasm is infectious .
Kiera Coultas will be sentenced at the end of February
Jordan Wickington , 19 , died from head injuries after he went through a red light and was struck by Kiera Coultas 's car in Southampton in February 2007 .
Coultas , 25 , of Hythe , who pleaded not guilty , was released on bail and will be sentenced at the end of February .
The judge at Southampton Crown Court warned her she may be jailed .
We are pleased with the outcome of this trial and hope Jordan 's death will prevent or deter others from using their mobile phones whilst driving
Laura Wickington
Following the crash Mr Wickington , of Netley , Hampshire , who had not been wearing a helmet , was taken to Southampton General Hospital where he later died .
His sister , Laura , said the past year had been " extremely hard " .
" The loss of Jordan is a pain that will stay with us for ever , " she said .
" He was a bright , intelligent and beautiful person who will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him .
" We are pleased with the outcome of this trial and hope Jordon 's death will prevent or deter others from using their mobile phones whilst driving . "
Sgt Alison West , of Hampshire Constabulary 's road death investigation team , recommended drivers switched off their mobile phones during journeys .
" It 's pretty routine nowadays at the scene of these serious or fatal accidents to seize drivers ' mobile phones , and to have them analysed to see if the phone has had anything to do with the driving standards involved , " she said .
" In this particular incident , it transpired from a phone analysis that there was phone use close to the time of the incident . "
France won EU approval Tuesday to give $ 152 million U.S. to several companies hoping to build a European rival to U.S. search giant Google Inc .
The potential benefits of allowing France to fund technology group Thomson SA and 22 other companies working on the Quaero multimedia search project in Europe outweigh any gain Thomson would win over rivals , the European Commission said .
Quaero — Latin for " I search " — would develop technology for working with all platforms , including desktops , mobile devices and televisions .
Its products would be sold to TV companies , filmmakers , post - production facilities and anyone who creates or uses audiovisual content .
Just under half the funding for the five - year , $ 306 million U.S. project will come from the French government .
The EU executive said the cash infusion aids an effort that might not otherwise win financial support because the companies have divergent interests and their chances of success were uncertain .
Thomson hopes the research will help it offer better distribution technology to deliver television programs or films online .
EU rules forbid governments granting money to companies if that would give them an unfair advantage over competitors .
The commission said the grant would not give Thomson market power because rivals will likely keep up their investment in research and development .
It cleared the German government to give $ 165 million U.S. to the German arm of the project , called Theseus .
That money will fund " icebreaker " companies — Siemens AG , SAP AG , Deutsche Thomson oHG and Empolis GmbH , owned by Bertelsmann AG — to kickstart research .
The aid will later spread to smaller firms .
Fragmentation of European research is a key reason cited for the region lagging behind the United States in information technology development .
There are a number of different ways to determine which countries have the highest military expenditures .
When looking just at actual dollars spent , the United States spends far more than any other nation .
The 2012 US Department of Defense budget includes $ 553 billion US Dollars ( USD ) as a base , and , when combined with recent supplemental war spending , the total is estimated at over $ 670 billion USD ; that number has dropped from 2011 , when it topped $ 700 billion USD .
Coming in a distant second is China , with an estimated $ 119 billion USD .
With combined world military spending at about $ 1,630 billion USD in 2010 , recent US military spending has made up more than 40 % of that total .
The People 's Republic of China is often near the top of the list of countries with the highest military expenditures .
Military expenditures can be looked at in other ways , however .
Looking at expenditures as a proportion of a country 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) can provide insight into how that spending compares to the country 's total economy .
When provided by this method , Oman is at the top of the list , and the US falls to 24th .
Singapore has one of the 20 highest military expenditures in the world .
Here are the top 25 countries in terms military spending as a percentage of GDP according to the CIA World Factbook .
The figures are taken from the most recent year for which information is available , 2005 and 2006 for most nations .
Rock samples from deep within Yucca Mountain , in Nevada , showed that the fault runs directly beneath the site where the US federal government planned to store 70,000 tonnes of highly radioactive waste .
More than $ 8bn ( £ 4bn ) has already been spent on the $ 58bn project , which had been due to open in 2017 , but the proposals - approved by George Bush in 2002 - may now have to be redrawn .
Samples taken from 76 metres below the surface of the mountains , which are around 90 miles north - west of Las Vegas , revealed that the Bow Ridge fault passes hundreds of metres to the east of where scientists believed it lay .
The measurements were backed up by US Geological Survey maps and a letter , the Las Vegas Review - Journal reported yesterday .
The fault is now thought to run beneath a storage pad where spent radioactive fuel canisters would be cooled before being sealed in a maze of tunnels inside the mountain .
Bob Loux , the executive director of the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects , expressed amazement that the US Department of Energy had only just carried out the " 11th hour " drilling tests .
" It certainly looks like DoE has encountered a surprise out there , and it certainly speaks to the fact they have n't done the technical work they should have done years ago , " he told the paper .
" It 's going to have to cause some change of the design in the final analysis .
It 's going to impact the safety case . "
The state of Nevada - the third most seismically unstable in the US - has long opposed the project on the grounds that earthquake activity makes the site unsafe .
Since 1976 , there have been 621 seismic events of magnitude greater than 2.5 on the Richter scale within a 50 - mile radius of Yucca Mountain .
The Department of Energy refused to comment on the claims , but project officials said they were continuing to develop repository design , construction and operating plans in preparation for applying next year for a licence from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
■ 勝手に予測 : OpenID の未来とはてなワール ド
ちょっと前にはてなが OpenID に対応したので、勝手に OpenID の未来を予測してみる。 ついでにはてなワールドの予想もやってみる 。
IdP の集約とホワイトリス ト
livedoor やはてなのようにユーザ数を抱えているサービスが
OpenID に対応しているので、近い将来にアカウント提供側 ( IdP ) は大手に集約されていく。 それに従っ て OpenID の理念とは外れるかもしれないけど、サービス提供側 ( SP ) も受け入れる IdP をホワイトリストで選ぶようになるはず。 この予想はどこかで見かけたし、実際にはてなスターも受け入れる
IdP を限定している（はてなが入っていないけど、はてな のOpenIDではてなスターは使えないんだろうか）。
Yahoo か Google が IdP サービスを開始したら、この流れは決定的になるはず。
IdP を限定する理由は、 SPAM や bot 対策が大きいと思ってる。 はてなや livedoor のアカウントなら登録時に CAPTCHA などでフィルタリングしているから、 SP は自前で CAPTCHA を用意しなくていい。 ついでにパスワードの再発行なんかも IdP 側に任せられる 。
OpenID 利用者（アカウント）の評 価
OpenID で様々なサービスが受けられるようになると、次にくるのはユーザの評価。 すでに SNS や
Twitter の follow などでユーザ間の繋がりが見えるようになっているから、それが活用されるようになってくる。 今でも、マイミク の
Twitter を自動的に follow したいっていうニーズがあるんじゃないかな 。
OpenID はユーザのアカウントを URL で表現するから、例えば PageRank の技術が応用できる。 従来の PageRank がデータを対象にしていたのに対して、人を対象にした
PageRank とかね。 まぁ、そこまで行くと気持ち悪い面もあるけど、自分の周辺 ( 1〜2Hop ) だけに適用するくらいならあるかもしれない。
これって、ユーザ管理のアウトソース化といえるかもしれない。
Google Maps が提供する WebAPI を使う時 は Google が保持している地図データを使っているように、 OpenID の IdP が提供するユーザ管理のサービスを SP が使う感じ 。
はてなワールドの予 想
思いっきり外しそうだけど。
はてなスターのサービス開始
はてなスター のOpenID対応 ( SP )
はてな のOpenID対応 ( IdP )
この流れを考えると、はてなスターを OpenID 時代の評価システムとして使おうとしているかもって思うようになった。 スターを付けることで、人と人が結び付けられる。 そして、その人は OpenID で識別できる 。
この人と人との繋がりを SNS っぽく可視化したのが、はてなワールドなんじゃないかと予想してみる。 といっても、従来の SNS のマネだと mixi と競合するので、もう少し緩いネットワークを目指すんじゃないかな。 この繋がりの情報は評価 ( Reputation ) の貴重な材料にもなるしね 。

すでにソーシャルグラフという概念があるのね。 僕の予想を一言にまとめると「ソーシャルグラフの見える化」ってことか。
DOTHAN , Ala . --
One recent morning , dozens of elderly and disabled people , some propped on walkers and canes , gathered at Small Loans Inc .
Many had borrowed money from Small Loans and turned over their Social Security benefits to pay back the high - interest lender .
Now they were waiting for their " allowance " -- their monthly check , minus Small Loans ' cut .
The crowd represents the newest twist for a fast - growing industry -- lenders that make high - interest loans , often called " payday " loans , that are secured by upcoming paychecks ....
FOR rent : 830,000 hectares of pristine tropical rainforest .
Rich in wildlife , including forest elephants and gorillas .
Provides a regionally important African green corridor .
Price : $ 1.6 m a year .
Conservationist tenant preferred , but extractive forestry also considered .
Please apply to the Cameroonian minister of forestry .
That , in essence , is what the government of Cameroon has been offering since 2001 in an attempt to make some money from a forest known as Ngoyla - Mintom .
The traditional way would be to lease the land to a logging company .
But Joseph Matta , the country 's forestry minister , would rather lease it to a conservation group .
The trouble is , he cannot find one that is prepared to take it off his hands .
The idea of conservation concessions has been around since 2000 .
It was introduced by an American charity called Conservation International , which realised the going rate for logging concessions was often so low that it could afford to outbid the foresters .
It has since leased forests in Guyana — where it has 80,000 hectares of Upper Essequibo — and in Peru , Sierra Leone , Papua New Guinea , Fiji and Mexico .
But even in 2001 it reckoned that at $ 2 a hectare Ngoyla - Mintom was too dear .
Its land in Essequibo costs a mere 37 cents a hectare .
Mr Matta , of course , thinks Ngoyla - Mintom is worth every penny .
Indeed , the price has gone up .
The government now wants additional money to compensate Cameroon for forgoing the jobs and local development that come with logging .
The forest is pristine habitat of a sort likely to contain some extremely valuable pieces of timber .
It also connects three other large protected areas ( see map ) , and thus forms an important part of a regionally important green corridor .
Mr Matta says that if one group of conservationists or another does n't cough up soon , he really will be forced to get on the phone to the loggers .
A compromise put forward by the World Wide Fund for Nature has failed to find favour .
The WWF suggested keeping an unexploited core of Ngoyla - Mintom while the rest is opened to limited “ sustainable ” hunting and forestry .
The quid pro quo would be a lower rent .
Cameroon , not surprisingly , would prefer the higher rent .
Mr Matta also points out that even a little forestry would mean building roads that will present additional threats to the area .
Ngoyla - Mintom is thus turning into an interesting test of what the conservation market will bear .
There is a willing seller , but not yet a willing buyer .
The fine words of the rich - world 's armchair conservationists butter few parsnips in the poor world .
Here is a good opportunity to spread some butter .

Shall I Smoke Dope ?
The BBC3 program is to be broadcast this summer ( picture posed by model )
The BBC has defended a new show in which a reporter takes drugs on camera to demonstrate its effects .
Should I Smoke Dope ? will be broadcast later this year on channel BBC3 , which is aimed at 16 - to 34 - year - olds .
Viewers will see journalist Nicky Taylor injected with THC - a chemical component of cannabis - in a lab at the Institute of Psychiatry .
She is also seen taking drugs in Amsterdam .
The BBC said the programme aimed to highlight the risks of cannabis use - but added that Taylor had suffered no ill effects since filming ended .
A spokeswoman said : " In the film , Nicky takes a small amount of the drug over a very short period of time in Amsterdam and also takes part in a medical trial held by the Institute of Psychiatry involving THC injections , in order to fully understand the effects of drugs on her body and reflect on this for the benefits of the audience .
" Before taking part , Nicky fully researched the subject and undertook the trials under supervision , with medical advice .
" Nicky has not suffered any ill effects since filming finished .
The film unequivocally highlights the risks of consuming the drug and will be scheduled post - watershed for a BBC3 audience . "
The spokeswoman went on : " Nicky Taylor is a critically acclaimed journalist whose approach involves becoming fully immersed in her subject , in order to highlight the risks of potentially dangerous activities .
" Her previous films for BBC3 have included investigations into plastic surgery - in which she undertook surgery - and binge drinking , in which she drank large amounts of alcohol .
" Her approach has proved successful in highlighting important health risks with a younger audience . "
Should I Smoke Dope " will investigate the most widely used and much debated illegal substance in Britain : cannabis .
" This is at a time when the Government considers re-classification and many young people do n't understand the health risks of the drug , its legal status and are not aware of recent reports of its increase in strength . "
But the programme has already attracted criticism .
Marjorie Wallace , chief executive of mental health charity Sane , told the Daily Telegraph : " It is difficult to see what can be learnt from this experiment .
Cannabis affects no two individuals in the same way .
" The majority of people may have little or no reaction , even to stronger forms of the drug .

Researchers today reported that they have made embryonic clones from donated eggs and men's skin cells .
The clone developed into hollow balls of cells ( blastocysts ) in the researchers ' lab .
This is the first time the cloning technique has been done using adult cells ( the male skin cells ) instead of embryonic cells , according to the scientists , who included Andrew French , PhD , of Stemagen , a stem cell research and development company in California .
French and colleagues call their work a " prelude " to the development of cloned human embryos to generate embryonic stem cells for stem cell research .
In other words , they 've shown that they can make embryonic clones from adult cells , but they have n't yet gotten those embryonic clones to make embryonic stem cells .
Here 's how the process worked .
Step 1 : Remove the nucleus , which contains DNA , from the donated egg .
Step 2 : Insert the skin cell 's nucleus into that egg .
Step 3 : Coax the egg to start dividing .
The basic idea is to make the egg start developing with the donor 's DNA instead of the egg 's own DNA .
French 's team reports developing five blastocysts using skin cells donated by two men .
Only one of those blastocysts was confirmed by DNA tests to be a true clone , with no genetic material from the donated egg .
Details of the experiment appear in today 's online edition of Stem Cell .

Last night , quite by accident , I found myself listening to Bill O'Reilly 's " The Radio Factor . "
This is not a habit of mine , I left work late and do n't usually catch talk shows after 6 pm .
Anyway , I became quite engrossed as I heard Bill O'Reilly make a rather generous offer to homeless veterans .
And I 'd like everyone to help spread the word .
As some of you may be aware , O'Reilly is currently involved in a feud with Presidential hopeful ( very hopeful to be honest ) John Edwards , over the plight of homeless veterans in America .
I 'm not about to get into the grizzly details of the whole fight , I have neither the time nor the research to back either side .
But the basic argument is this .
Edwards claims that the 200,000 homeless veterans sleeping on America 's streets every night are there because of our ever - declining economy .
Bill O'Reilly calls BS .
He says that most of the 200,000 homeless vets ( if indeed there are 200,000 ... that figure is also disputed by O'Reilly ) are there not because of the economy but due to drug and / or alcohol problems , mental illness and possibly a desire to stay on the streets and avoid the 9 - 5 daily routine .
I 'm paraphrasing here , but you get the picture .
Who 's right ?
That 's not actually the point of the article , although the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans has a website with some very alarming figures .
No , this article is about an offer that O'Reilly made on the air last night , 1/23/08 , that I think needs to get out to the people it was intended for .
In a moment of supreme selflessness , Mr. O'Reilly offered to get a job for any homeless veteran who wants one .
Now , that 's quite an offer , especially in this current economic climate .
But I got to thinking ... " hmm , how on Earth are any homeless veterans going to hear about the offer ? "
After all , it 's not like they make up any real portion of Bill 's regular audience .
Would they even have a radio ?
I was n't the only one who thought that way .
Someone called in with that question but Bill , sticking by his offer , said that the homeless vets could get this information through the various organizations set up to help them out .
Full - size printable flyer available here to download
Wisebread.com is obviously not one of those organizations , but I have a platform to get information out to people and I think this is an extremely important piece of news that homeless vets need to hear .
So , I 've done something about it .
Print out as many copies as you want of the flyer above and do what you can with it .
Post it in store windows , on bulletin boards , lamp posts , and give it to any homeless veteran you see collecting change .
The numbers on it are toll - free , so they wo n't need to use any of their money ( if they have any ) to make the call .
Am I doing this to spite Mr. O'Reilly ?
Absolutely not .
I 'm doing it because he made the offer and I think it 's an offer worth promoting and supporting .
It could give hope and a new life to many of these fallen heroes .
Let 's help O'Reilly stick by his word and give a whole bunch of worthy people a genuine break .
Italy faces a political crisis after an ally unexpectedly resigned from the governing coalition led by Prime Minister Romano Prodi , leaving his coalition without a parliamentary majority .
Prodi is expected to address the Italian parliament Tuesday , and may resign if he loses a confidence vote , paving the way for new elections .
Prodi took office after defeating Silvio Berlusconi , a staunch ally of the Bush administration and Italy 's richest man , in a close election in April 2006 .
His coalition 's razor - thin majority in the Senate has since been tested by scandals and policy setbacks .
Mr. Berlusconi , who leads the center - right opposition and is currently ahead in opinion polls , has called for early elections if the government falls .
The Wall Street Journal says that the crisis follows the resignation last week of Justice Minister Clemente Mastella , who is being investigated , along with his wife , in a corruption case .
Mr. Mastella , who leads a minor political party , said Monday that he was abruptly withdrawing support for Prodi 's coalition because he was n't getting enough political backing in fighting that corruption case .
While it is still possible Mr. Prodi could eke out a majority by courting new votes , it seems more likely he will have to hand in his resignation to President Giorgio Napolitano .
A collapse would raise the question of whether this government 's most important success – taming Italy 's runaway deficit – will melt away in the political pandemonium that could ensue .
Hours before the political crisis broke , Agence France - Presse reported that Prodi had planned to meet President Bush during a scheduled Feb. 3 visit to the United States , his first since taking office .
The two leaders held talks last year in Rome after Italy agreed to increase its troop commitment in Afghanistan .
Relations between the two countries had been frayed by Italy 's pullout from Iraq and the fallout from Italian judicial probes involving US military personnel , reports AFP .
One case involved the death of an Italian intelligence agent in Baghdad in 2005 after he rescued a kidnapped Italian reporter .
Their car was allegedly fired on by a US soldier at a mobile checkpoint .
A Rome court ruled last October , however , that it did n't have jurisdiction to try the accused US soldier .
In recent months , Prodi has steadily lost popular support in Italy despite delivering economic growth and cutting unemployment , Bloomberg reports .
Divisions within his government , Italy 's 61st since 1945 , have sapped his poll ratings .
A Dec. 23 survey found that 30 percent of Italians had confidence in him , down from 45 percent a year earlier .
Prodi has survived previous rifts in his coalition , and briefly tendered his resignation in 2007 , says Reuters .
The resignation resulted primarily from differences about the Afghan war and Italy 's ties to the US military , reports the CBC .
But the defection of Udeur – the Roman Catholic party led by Mastella – is the first by a major ally and potentially a fatal blow .
Prodi could still win votes in the upper house – where until now he [ has ] had a two - seat majority – with the support of seven unelected lifetime senators as he has done in the past , though their vote can not be taken for granted .
The Financial Times reports that President Napolitano is said to oppose holding new elections until lawmakers make changes to the election system .
The current system enacted in 2006 has been criticized for its bias towards small parties which yielded a weak and divided nine - party coalition .
As the leader of a minor party , Mastella would favor holding early elections before the system is reformed , the FT says .
Prodi , a former economics professor , previously led Italy from 1996 to 1998 .
His resignation may not trigger automatic elections , though , as the president can give him additional time to gather his coalition together and survive a no-confidence vote , reports The New York Times .
That was the case during the 2007 foreign - policy defeat that nearly toppled the government .
Another possible option is that Mr. Napolitano could call for an interim government of technocrats to oversee state business until elections could be called , presumably after a new election law is enacted .
A referendum on such a law was given court approval last week and , in theory , voting must take place before June 15 .
But many politicians dislike the proposed law because it would take power away from the many small parties in Italy , and it is possible that any interim government might seek to pass its own law before the referendum took place , thus negating it .
A further political challenge to Prodi 's government is the outcry over trash collection in Naples , reports Italian news agency Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata .
Environment minister Alfonso Pecoraro faces a no-confidence in parliament this week over his handling of the crisis , and may not get the support of coalition partners .
Authorities have failed to collect garbage in Naples and the surrounding region of Campania after its waste - management system broke down , prompting public protests .
The Associated Press reports that collectors in Naples stopped picking up garbage after Christmas because city dumps were full .
A former national police chief has since been tapped to take charge of the situation , which has snowballed amid allegations of mafia involvement .
The region has long been plagued by garbage crises : Dumps are overflowing and local communities have blocked efforts to build new ones or reopen old ones , citing health risks .
Officials and residents say the crises stem from the Neapolitan Mafia 's control of garbage disposal and the government 's inability to fight it or guarantee safe waste treatment .
As a result , residents angered by the uncollected trash also routinely protest attempts to open dumps , often resorting to violence .

The odds that your vote will actually affect the outcome of a given election are very , very , very slim .
This was documented by the economists Casey Mulligan and Charles Hunter , who analyzed more than 56,000 Congressional and state - legislative elections since 1898 .
For all the attention paid in the media to close elections , it turns out that they are exceedingly rare .
The median margin of victory in the Congressional elections was 22 percent ; in the state - legislature elections , it was 25 percent .
Even in the closest elections , it is almost never the case that a single vote is pivotal .
Of the more than 40,000 elections for state legislator that Mulligan and Hunter analyzed , comprising nearly 1 billion votes , only 7 elections were decided by a single vote , with 2 others tied .
Of the more than 16,000 Congressional elections , in which many more people vote , only one election in the past 100 years -- a 1910 race in Buffalo -- was decided by a single vote .
But there is a more important point : the closer an election is , the more likely that its outcome will be taken out of the voters ' hands -- most vividly exemplified , of course , by the 2000 presidential race .
It is true that the outcome of that election came down to a handful of voters ; but their names were Kennedy , O'Connor , Rehnquist , Scalia and Thomas .
And it was only the votes they cast while wearing their robes that mattered , not the ones they may have cast in their home precincts .
Still , people do continue to vote , in the millions .
Why ?
Here are three possibilities :
1. Perhaps we are just not very bright and therefore wrongly believe that our votes will affect the outcome .
2. Perhaps we vote in the same spirit in which we buy lottery tickets .
After all , your chances of winning a lottery and of affecting an election are pretty similar .
From a financial perspective , playing the lottery is a bad investment .
But it 's fun and relatively cheap : for the price of a ticket , you buy the right to fantasize how you 'd spend the winnings -- much as you get to fantasize that your vote will have some impact on policy .
3 . Perhaps we have been socialized into the voting - as - civic - duty idea , believing that it's a good thing for society if people vote , even if it 's not particularly good for the individual .
And thus we feel guilty for not voting .

STOCKHOLM ( Reuters ) -
The world 's tiger population may have halved in the past quarter of a century and at least one of the remaining five sub -species is in danger of becoming extinct , World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) experts said on Tuesday .
Chinese demand for tiger parts used in traditional medicines and habitat destruction are the two greatest perils facing the big cat , scientists and conservationists said .
Speaking in Sweden at a seminar featuring experts from Asia , Africa and Europe , they said the South China tiger could soon be extinct and the Sumatran tiger population was the next most threatened sub -species .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
But WWF officials also said with proper measures , tigers could thrive and increase their numbers by thousands , and they believed the species would survive .
" In many ways the tiger stands at a crossroads between extinction and survival , and which path it takes is totally dependent on us , " said Sujoy Banerjee , director of WWF India 's species program .
The WWF 's tiger coordinator based in Nepal , Bivash Pandav , said he believed there were some 3,500 tigers left in the world .
That compared with rough estimates of about 5,000 - 7,500 in 1982 .
Pandav said in Sumatra , Indonesia , the number of tigers had dwindled to about 400 and the situation was now critical as forest areas have been decimated .
In 1982 most of the Indonesian island 's forest land was intact .
By 2004 less than half of it was left , Pandev said .
He said estimates are that by 2050 , based on current trends , more than 90 percent of its forests may be gone due to the logging industry , a potentially disastrous outcome for Sumatran tigers which depend on the forest for their survival .
Pandav said one way conservationists had combated forest destruction was to buy up land concessions from the government .
" There is hope to save animals in this place , " he said .
ONE TIGER A DAY
In India , the tiger population has dwindled to about 1,400 , 60 percent fewer than in 2002 .
Some 40,000 tigers were thought to be in India at the start of the 20th century , but now an estimated one tiger per day is dying there .
Indian farmers , dependent on livestock for their survival , are one threat to tigers , Banerjee said .
" Whenever there is human - tiger conflict , the ultimate loser is the tiger . "
But additional pressure on governments to stop poaching , in particular from China , and other conservationist measures such as habitat protection could make a huge difference , he said .
" We can easily have 10,000 tigers , if everything goes as per our wish , " said Pandav , adding that could be achieved in as little as 10 years .
" I firmly believe that tigers will continue to survive in certain pockets .
They 're not going to become extinct , " he said .
Sarah Christie , a program manager for the Zoological Society of London , highlighted work being done by zoos to protect tigers , saying nearly a 10th of the money spent on tiger protection came from zoos .
She said in the case of Sumatra , the total was 60 percent .
Christie said the world 's focus on climate change offered a chance to help the tiger .
" Tigers are indicators of eco-system health , they are indicators of forest health .
Saving the tiger is a test .
If we pass , we get to keep the planet Earth . "

Huck 's
Army struggles to stay on the right side of campaign law Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday January 29 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This If Mike Huckabee 's presidential campaign is a David vs. Goliath story , the volunteers known as " Huck 's Army " are the former Arkansas Governor 's sling .
While Huckabee improved his fundraising totals prior to his Iowa Caucus victory , the candidate remains financially far behind his Republican competitors .
And with his cash flow still limited , Huckabee continues to cheer on the loose nationwide network of volunteers , his " secret weapon , " who are working to turn out voters in his favor .
Alex Harris , one of the 19 - year - old evangelical twin brothers credited with launching Huck 's Army , recently explained the group 's purpose in an interview with Newsweek .
" It 's not as if we 're a part of the campaign , but we 're working to complement what the campaign is doing and fill in gaps where the campaign does n't have resources to build the infrastructure that Mitt Romney can build with all his money , " he said before the South Carolina primary , where Huckabee had a second - place finish .
The major question is whether or not Huck 's Army , and other external efforts to bolster presidential candidates in this election , can avoid breaking federal election laws .
And based on some evidence , Huck 's Army may have stepped over some lines .
Phone banking may be subject to federal regulations Huck 's Army is another manifestation of " Politics 2.0 " during the 2008 presidential campaign .
Eager volunteers , with varying degrees of separation from official campaigns , have devised novel promotional tools for candidates like the pro-Barack Obama " Hillary 1984 " video and the Ron Paul Blimp .
These efforts have brought to light the difficulties of keeping independent advocacy on behalf of candidates legal .
The Federal Election Commission regulates coordination between official political campaigns and external actors .
While any kind of communication between a campaign and volunteers can be subject to federal election law , FEC regulations particularly single out groups that pay for advertising on behalf of a candidate , as the cost of such communications can easily exceed limits on individual campaign contributions .
Huck 's
Army takes pains to note that it is " not owned or operated by any candidate or political campaign " on its website .
But the volunteers and Huckabee 's campaign may find themselves in situations , accidentally or not , where the legality of their parallel activities comes into question .
For instance , a Jan. 15 account in Wired shows a Huck 's Army volunteer describing how he interacts with the Huckabee campaign .
" [ Jeffrey ] Quesnelle , a Catholic 20 - year - old software engineer in Sterling Heights , Michigan , says that the group coordinates with the Huckabee campaign to target messages to specific voters , like white , under - 30 evangelical Christian women , " the magazine 's Sarah Lai Stirland reported .
Additionally , news reports have also described Huck 's Army engaging in aggressive phone banking on behalf of Huckabee before the South Carolina primary .
It appears that there was some communication between campaign staff and volunteers regarding this effort .
" Yes , we have a list that will not be overlapped with the official campaign list , " said a volunteer who posted a message at the Huck 's Army online forums .
Other participants had worried about overlapping with the campaign 's efforts .
The Huck 's Army volunteer later thanked , " Leslie Rutledge who works with the campaign , " in an update just before the South Carolina primary goers voted .
An expert in federal campaign law said that coordination between a presidential campaign and outside volunteers on phone banking could move over the line into a federally regulated form of coordination .
" What could trigger coordination rules would be Huckabee 's people saying ' we 'd love for you to distribute this message via phone banking , ' " said Paul Ryan , the FEC Program Director and Associate Legal Counsel of the Campaign Legal Center in an interview with RAW STORY .
" Even if Huckabee were to contact Huck 's Army and say some phone banking would help us out , that would get an outside groups like Huck 's Army into coordination regulations . "
Other campaign law specialists note that volunteer groups like Huck 's Army may run afoul of the law unintentionally .
" A lot of people may be enthusiastic , " said Lawrence Noble , Counsel at Skadden Arps in Washington , DC .
" They do n't know what the law is , they assume certain things , and then they go ask the campaign what they can do . "
But some Huck 's Army volunteers do seem aware of the possible legal implications of their efforts .
" Just be sure that any expenditures to get call lists are properly reported to the FEC , " warned one volunteer in the earlier forum discussion .
Huckabee 's campaign did not respond to e-mails or phone calls from RAW STORY requesting comment .
Group makes effort to educate volunteers on law
In a phone interview with RAW STORY , a representative from the group did not believe that there was any direct coordination going on between the Huckabee campaign and the Huck 's Army volunteers .
" I do n't know of any specific interactions with the campaign other than requests to help with phone calls and to invite friends to participate in the campaign via e-mail , " said David Schmidt , a California - based National Grassroots Campaign Manager for Huck 's Army .
Schmidt also explained that the group as an organized entity hardly exists .
" We 're a communications network more than anything , " he added , noting that Huck 's Army does not collect money and does not buy advertising on Huckabee 's behalf .
" We provide information about opportunities for the campaign , but they really have no control over us . "
Huck 's
Army members are also advised to stay within the framework of campaign laws , including the requirement that they report expenditures over $ 250 to the FEC .
" We educate individuals on FEC guidelines , and make sure they 've read the citizen 's brochure , " Schmidt explained .
" We feel that we 've given people a pretty good education , but there are not a whole lot of people going out and spending large amounts of money independently . "
Schmidt also said the FEC had not contacted Huck 's Army volunteers about any of their activities , although the group 's members have contacted the FEC to seek clarification on some matters , and received responses .
If Huck 's Army has broken any election laws , only the FEC can say so .
And even if they have , the group might face very slow enforcement action from the FEC , or no action at all .
" Generally the FEC has not been that aggressive on coordination issues , " said Lawrence Noble at Skadden Arps .
" A number of commissioners have felt the investigations are intrusive , with the view that this is more independent activity than campaign activity . "
And the Campaign Legal Center 's Paul Ryan argued that FEC enforcement action would fail to serve as an effective deterrent .
Groups like the Swift Boat Veterans and POWs for Truth and the MoveOn.org Voter Fund received fines that were small relative to the amount of money they spent , and more than two years after the 2004 presidential election .
" Unfortunately in my view , the practical consequences of getting caught violating most of the campaign finance laws come so long after the campaign itself , and they seldom amount to a slap on the wrist , " Ryan said .
" That 's par for the course with FEC enforcement action , even when the law is broken , the penalty is relatively small . "
As for Huck 's Army , they 'll continue to raise their banner for Huckabee as the campaign heads for Super Duper Tuesday in February .
" We 're really focusing on targeting states that we 've got a good shot at winning , and those are states like Georgia , Alabama , Tennessee , and Arkansas where we expect to win big , " Schmidt said .
" I think there are also opportunities in places like North Dakota , and proportional states , where we can pick up a significant number of delegates . "
Home » Administer What is Bush Preparing For ?
As the congressional elections later in the year could result in the loss of Republican control of Senate and Congress , Bush is making efforts now to push through some very controversial legislation .
Federal Control of the National Guard
The National Governors Association , a bipartisan organization of American governors , has sent a
This bill is highly significant because , if passed , it will dramatically decrease the security of the US .
It will allow the federal government to unilaterally declare an emergency and take military control over America 's states .
Below is an excerpt of the NGA 's letter :
A provision in section 511 of the House - passed DoD Act would allow the President to federalize the National Guard of the states without the consent of the governor .
Specifically , this clause amends Title 10 of the United States Code to give the President the authority to take control of the Guard in case of " a serious natural or manmade disaster , accident , or catastrophe that occurs in the United States , its territories and possessions , or Puerto Rico . "
...
The possibility of the federal government pre-empting the authority of the state or governor in natural and manmade disasters is opposed by the nation 's governors .
...
We urge you to drop this provision that would usurp governor 's authority over the National Guard during emergencies . "
The Posse Comitatus Act
The Bush administration 's push for federal military control was hinted at less than a year ago , mere months after Hurricane Katrina .
In October , 2005 , George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld embarked on a short - lived media campaign against an important American law :
This federal law was passed in 1878 , after the American Civil War .
Its purpose was to stop federal troops from supervising elections in Confederate states .
The law prohibits federally controlled units of the National Guard , and the US military in general , from acting in a local law enforcement capacity .
Bush and Rumsfeld used avian flu as the rationale for their attacks on the law .
The attacks were not
According to Bush :
" I 'm concerned about what an avian flu outbreak could mean for the United States and the world , " he told reporters during a Rose Garden news conference on Tuesday .
" One option is the use of a military that 's able to plan and move , " he said .
" So that 's why I put it on the table .
I think it 's an important debate for Congress to have . "
Classified War Plans For Domestic Takeover
Shortly before the attacks against the Posse Comitatus Act , classified war plans , called CONPLAN 2002 , had been revealed that are unlike any in US history .
In these plans , the enemy is not foreign , but domestic .
A Washington Post
The war plans represent a historic shift for the Pentagon , which has been reluctant to become involved in domestic operations and is legally constrained from engaging in law enforcement .
...
But the new plans provide for what several senior officers acknowledged is the likelihood that the military will have to take charge in some situations , especially when dealing with mass - casualty attacks that could quickly overwhelm civilian resources .
The rationale for these plans to usurp local authority is not avian flu , but threats of " biological , chemical or nuclear attack " .
Dealing With Insurgency and Media
If " taking charge " of the US , the Bush administration would have to concern itself with more than just formal authorities .
Grass - roots insurgency and media criticism could also prove obstacles .
In the event of grass - roots insurgency , large numbers of insurgents and suspected insurgents would have to be detained .

The ruling , by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit , came in the case of Jose Padilla , a former gang member and U.S. citizen arrested in Chicago in 2002 and a month later designated an " enemy combatant " by President Bush .
... Padilla has been held without trial in a U.S. naval brig for more than three years .

As the congressional elections later in the year could result in the loss of Republican control of Senate and Congress , Bush is making efforts now to push through some very controversial legislation .
The National Governors Association , a bipartisan organization of American governors , has sent a letter to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees to protest an upcoming bill that would allow the federal government to usurp state control over the National Guard in " emergencies " .

In the event of grass - roots insurgency , large numbers of insurgents and suspected insurgents would have to be detained .
FEMA currently maintains a network of hundreds of camps ( here is a video tour of one ) that could be used for this purpose .
In addition , a $ 385 million no -bid contract with KBR / Halliburton provides for building , when needed , many more camps .
This sizable contract was purportedly awarded to deal with an " emergency influx of immigrants " ( a reason borrowed from the Reagan - era Rex 84 program ) and the need to " support the rapid development of new programs " .
In the realm of media concerns , Bush has issued an executive order to replace the existing Emergency Broadcast System ( EBS ) with the Emergency Alert System ( EAS ) .
The purpose of the EAS is to " ensure that under all conditions the President can communicate with the American people " .
The order provides for command - and - control of media " through cooperation with the owners and operators of communication facilities " to " maintain , protect , and , if necessary , restore communications facilities and capabilities necessary for the public alert and warning system " .
In regards to legality , the Bush government has already established that is can legally detain US citizens indefinitely , and without trial , in " wartime " : Source : Jurist Images : Prison Planet
How to Make Your Own Homemade Laundry Detergent
Laundry can take up a lot of time , money and energy .
I ’m always on the lookout for ways to save money on washing and drying clothing .
I do things like re-wear clothes before washing them , cutting dryer sheets in half , and line drying my clothes when the weather is nice outside .
I thought I was doing well .
Then I wrote a post about homemade cleaning products a few weeks ago .
Jessica , one of my readers , left the following comment :
I make my own laundry soap !
Here ’s the recipe : 1 bar bath soap
1 cup washing soda
1 cup baking soda
1 cup 20 Mule Team Borax Grind together in your food processor .
Use 2 Tablespoons for a full load .
I also use it for general housekeeping .
It costs 2 or 3 cents per use .
I also use Dawn to fight laundry stains , and white vinegar as a fabric softener .
( The smell disappears when the clothes dry . )
White vinegar is so versatile !
I love using it as a rinse aid in my dishwasher , as well as for keeping ants off my counters .
( Bugs ca n’t stand the taste of acid . )
Your blog is awesome , Lynnae–keep up the good work !
Thanks for the compliment on my blog , Jessica .
Now it ’s time for me to thank you .
I thought I ’d do a comparison between my usual laundry detergent and Jessica ’s recipe .
I was skeptical , because I ’ve made my own liquid laundry detergent before , and I was less than impressed .
It took a long time to make , too .
Still , I had to try .
Making the Detergent
I made one small adjustment to the recipe .
Instead of using bath soap , I used 1 bar of Fels Naptha .
It ’s a soap especially made for laundry , and it really cleans things .
I used the food processor to grind everything up , just like Jessica recommended , and this laundry detergent literally took me 5 minutes to make .
It was so easy !
Still , I did n’t know how it would work .
So far I ’ve used it on 4 loads of laundry , and it ’s worked really well !
I do n’t think I ’ll be going back to the commercial stuff anytime soon .
The Cost Break Down
Let ’s break down the cost .
I did n’t have any of the ingredients on hand , so I bought everything last Wednesday .
I bought one bar of Fels Naptha and used the whole bar .
Cost : $ 1.19 .
A 3.5 box of Washing Soda is 7 1/3 cups and cost me $ 2.39 .
I used 1 cup , which comes to 33 cents .
I bought 1 4 - lb box of baking soda , which contains 8 1/3 cups .
I paid $ 2.12 for the box .
The recipe uses one cup , so that comes to roughly 25 cents for the baking soda .
Finally , I bought a 4 lb 12 oz .
box of Borax for $ 2.67 .
The box contains 9.9 cups , and I used one .
Cost of one cup : 27 cents .
The total cost for one batch of homemade laundry detergent was $ 2.04 for 24 loads of laundry .
So far , very good !
The recipe made 3 cups of laundry detergent .
There are 16 tablespoons in a cup , so there were 48 tablespoons in the recipe .
At 2 tablespoons per load , that ’s 24 loads of laundry .
Total cost per load : 8 and 1/2 cents .
That ’s roughly the same as the Arm & Hammer laundry detergent I normally buy .
The Arm & Hammer came to 8 and 2/3 cents a load for a $ 6.99 box that washes 80 loads .
However , I think the homemade stuff has been cleaning better .
It ’s also not heavily scented , and I ’m not trashing the environment by continuing to buy boxes of detergent .
Plus , I can use the baking soda and borax for other cleaning tasks , so I ’m not buying lots of different products .
That saves much needed space in my cupboard .
The Verdict
Though the actual cost of the two detergents is about the same , the homemade detergent saves on both packaging and space in my home .
It ’s more natural , too .
And if you were to use regular bath soap instead of Fels Naptha , the cost would definitely be less than store bought detergent , since the Fels Naptha was by far the most expensive ingredient .
I ’ve heard Zote works well for laundry , too , but I ’ve never seen it around here .
The Winner : Jessica ’s homemade laundry detergent !
Thanks for the tip , Jessica !
Now I need to dry Dawn as a stain remover and vinegar as a fabric softener !
Update : Since this post , I ’ve cut the amount of Fels Napthala to 1 / 2 bar per batch , and it works just fine .
That brings the cost per load down to just 6 cents per load !

Mrs Merkel had been advised against the meeting , reports say
China had criticised the meeting and , shortly beforehand , cancelled talks with the German justice minister .
Germany said the meeting with the Dalai Lama , who fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising , was a private event .
But China , which governs Tibet , says the meeting was part of the Dalai Lama 's agenda for Tibetan independence .
' Conscious ' decision
German officials refused to give details of the " private exchange " , which marked the first time the Dalai Lama had been received at the chancellery .
But they said China had cancelled a meeting with German counterparts in Munich on legal and patent issues .
Wherever I go , China protests .
The Chinese are simply testing how far they can go
The Dalai Lama
China also summoned the German ambassador in Beijing to complain .
A German government spokesman , Thomas Steg , said he was confident that the meeting would " not disturb the good state of German - Chinese relations and co-operation " .
In its weekend edition , the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung said that Mrs Merkel had pursued the meeting despite advice to the contrary from senior officials .
The Dalai Lama told the same newspaper : " What I appreciate about Mrs Merkel , is her steady engagement on human rights and religious freedom ...
Perhaps that is why she wants to see me , in spite of all the pressure from China . "
The Nobel Peace Prize winner said he was not seeking independence for Tibet but autonomy .
He said Beijing was showing the " arrogance of power " .
" Wherever I go , China protests .
The Chinese are simply testing how far they can go . "
[ Editor 's note -- The National Constitution Center replies : " The video version you are looking at is actually an outside company that made a shortened version of the entire event for their purposes ( it 's more of a tourism piece ) .
Instead of using the entire one - hour ceremony , they just took highlights .
We in no way censored Bono - this piece was just edited down to a 10 minute clip that highlighted parts of the ceremony ( in fact , pieces of each part of the ceremony were edited for length - not content ) .
The National Constitution Center has not edited Bono 's speech and the entire speech is available on our website .
Mary Shaw corrected her error on her blog . " -- JT , 11 October 2007 ]
On September 27th , here in Philadelphia , the Liberty Medal for 2007 was awarded to Bono and his organization DATA ( Debt AIDS Trade Africa ) , for their work in fighting AIDS and poverty in Africa .
Each year , the National Constitution Center awards the Liberty Medal to a person or persons for outstanding work in advancing the cause of liberty around the world .
While Bono 's entire acceptance speech was quite good , I was particularly moved when he spoke out against the use of torture .
He said , " You do not have to become a monster to defeat a monster . "
Indeed .
Very well put .
And I wrote those words down right after I heard them , because I was so impressed and wanted to share the wisdom .
However , two days after the event , I downloaded the official video of Bono 's speech at www.libertymedal.org.
And I discovered that the official video had been edited so that it no longer contains the references to torture , or other portions of the speech that apparently were not acceptable to The Powers That Be.
Furthermore , the edited version seems to over - emphasize the few gratuitous positive comments that Bono made regarding the current Bush administration .
( By the way , George Bush Sr. presented the award . )
Not being a conspiracy theorist , I began to question whether I had heard it all correctly the first time .
Fortunately , I discovered that Will Bunch of the Philadelphia Daily News heard the same speech that I heard , and he wrote about it in his blog at www.attytood.com.
Bunch 's blog entry about Bono 's speech fills in some of the gaps that are missing from the official video , including the context surrounding Bono's " monster " comment .
So , thanks to Will Bunch , here is what Bono had to say about torture :
Today I read in the Economist an article reporting that over 38 percent of Americans support some type of torture in exceptional circumstances .
My country ?
No .
Your country ?
Tell me no .
Today , when I receive this great honor , I ask you , I implore you as an Irishman who has seen some of these things close up , I ask you to remember , you do not have to become a monster to defeat a monster .
Your Americaâ€™s better than that .
Yes , that is exactly what I heard .
But , in the official video , all is missing except the last two sentences .
Yes , this is America , land of the free .
Or so it once appeared to be .
Let 's face it :
When you feel you must censor the acceptance speech of a Liberty Medal recipient , something is seriously wrong .

In signing the defense spending bill , President Bush declared he would “ construe ” the bill to fit with his views , which means he will ignore legislation that Congress legally passed .
That , in Bush ’s view , is his right under the Constitution , but that is not a view that has any support outside of his administration .
Unfortunately , it has become a common practice for Bush to sign a bill and then submit what is called a signing statement , which tells federal agencies how to — or not to — apply the law .
In the signing statement he issued with the defense spending bill , Bush noted his objection to a handful of provisions , including one that would create a presidential commission to investigate fraud , waste and other wrongdoing by military contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The commission is modeled on one created at the start of World War II .
Harry Truman , then a U.S. senator , led that commission ’s successful efforts to ferret out waste and protect taxpayer money .
Considering the billions spent on the war on terror , it would only make sense to have a presidential commission trying to protect taxpayer dollars .
Bush , however , does n’t see things that way and said the provision “ could inhibit the president ’s ability to carry out his constitutional obligations , ” including that of commander in chief .
A White House spokeswoman said the president was concerned because the commission , under the law , would have the power to request and receive information from the Pentagon and the Justice Department .
The White House sees that as a potential violation of the Constitution ’s separation of powers doctrine .
Rubbish .
That is merely a ruse .
The Bush administration simply does not want to release any information or open itself up to scrutiny .
And by acting in the manner he has , Bush is trampling on the Constitution .
As any student in Civics 101 could tell him , Congress has the authority to make the laws , and he has the obligation to uphold them .
Bush , though , has shown nothing but contempt for the Constitution and the Congress , and by doing so , he is showing his contempt for the American people .

Why polls in New Hampshire were so far off 1 / 5 Back to Gallery
In the wake of a headline - grabbing win by Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday , the pundits and even the candidates were stunned .
But some pollsters and political insiders were not .
They suggest that along with some critical late - breaking campaign events , cultural factors might have been at work in the last - minute switch by female voters that resulted in a 39 - to - 36 percent victory by Clinton over Illinois Sen. Barack Obama .
And in some cases , they say , the analysts casting about for a reason might well look to themselves .
Garry South , a California Democratic political consultant , said that women - who proved crucial to Clinton 's big win in New Hampshire - might simply have said " enough is enough " as they watched a parade of cable TV pundits , mostly male , all but pronounce Clinton 's White House bid over in the final 48 hours of the campaign .
After the New York senator delivered a rare , emotional statement at a weekend campaign event , her voice nearly breaking , commentators began virtually nonstop analysis , suggesting that Clinton either was in the throes of a near - nervous breakdown or was making a shrewd bid for sympathy , he said .
" I think this is not totally a sisterhood kind of campaign , but women - whether they vill vote for her or not - know ( her campaign ) is a very historic thing , " South said .
" And to have her treated in that kind of dismissive way by a bunch of white male buffoon talking heads had women ticked off .
My gut feeling is ... they stormed to the polls .
Something happened here . "
After barely losing the women 's vote in Iowa last week , Clinton reclaimed it big - time in New Hampshire , 46 to 34 percent over Obama .
Women make up more than half those who vote for Democrats across the country .
South 's theory is echoed by Democratic grassroots activist Gloria Nieto , a blogger ( misswildthing.blogspot.com ) and president of the Silicon Valley LGBT Democratic Club , who said the blogosphere was churning after talking heads on cable TV appeared to go nonstop on Clinton 's emotional event .
" Where does ( MSNBC host ) Chris Matthews or any of these guys come off treating her like that ? " said Nieto on Wednesday .
" It was played out in high - definition in front of everybody how shrill , over the top and condescending they were .
It was a frat boy party - and as women , we were n't liking it .
And we spoke out yesterday - just look at the numbers . "
Some pollsters say they have more scientific analysis of the events of last week - and at least some clues as to why the polls were so off the mark .
Pollster Mervin Field , a dean of American polling who has been measuring public opinion for more than six decades , notes that seven public and two private polls all reported on Monday - the day before the election - that Obama was ahead of Clinton anywhere from 9 to 11 points .
Field , the founder of the California Field Poll , one of the nation 's pre-eminent public opinion surveys , said that some critical events - including a major debate Saturday night in which Clinton 's performance was generally given good marks - might have swayed female voters .
That event and the later " humanizing moment , " he said , occurred after those final polls had been taken .
Polls , he cautions , are not a predictor of any election but are simply a snapshot in time .
" Obama was ahead 48 hours , and maybe 36 hours before the voters went to the polls , " he said .
" But things change .
And what changed ?
The women 's vote . "
Field said he has particular interest in the race - related factors in New Hampshire .
He was responsible for the famed public opinion survey in 1982 that predicted a victory by Democrat Tom Bradley , an African American , over Republican George Deukmejian for the governorship of California .
That poll spawned the term " the Bradley effect " after Deukmejian squeaked out a win only after absentee ballots were counted .
Field said many fail to remember that Bradley actually won at the polls on election day .
" I ca n't see that women ( in New Hampshire ) , all of a sudden , allowed racial bias to come to the fore , " he said .
Phil Trounstine , who heads the San Jose State Survey and Policy Research Institute , agreed that " speculation about the so - called Bradley effect ... in the absence of data is totally irresponsible . "
" We 've never seen that in a Democratic primary - a racial falloff , " he said , but " it has been seen in general elections . "
But Andrew Kohut , president of the Pew Research Center , said " you ca n't rule ( race ) out as an issue . "
In an opinion piece published Wednesday , he said poorer , less - educated voters - many of whom resisted being interviewed in exit polls - might not have wanted to admit they would n't vote for a black candidate .
But pollster Mark Baldassare , who heads the Public Policy Institute of California , said he believes that " independents and late - deciders were the factor . "
He notes that " clearly , the polls on the Republican side held up well - but on the Democratic side , they missed the mark . "
His take : " Obama 's support depended on independent voters , who in New Hampshire decided their vote would matter more for ( Arizona Sen. John ) McCain and the Republican party . "
In the final tally , independents made up 4 in 10 GOP voters , he said .
Baldassare said public opinion researchers might learn some important lessons from the early 2008 races .
" Iowa and New Hampshire have told us that this is a very fluid election season with lots of ups and downs , " he said .
" Independents will play an important role and will be a real challenge for the pollster . "
Even former White House political guru Karl Rove - an acknowledged poll junkie - cautioned in an interview published Wednesday that this week 's polling , while wrong , still has lessons .
" Let 's not have Obama suffer for the mistakes of the pollsters .
If you talk to political pros , you would find that there was pretty solid agreement that it 's really tough to poll a primary , " he said .
" And particularly a primary in a state like New Hampshire where they are not just simply voters , but active players in the drama , and they know it . "
San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris , a leading supporter of Obama , also said she does n't believe race was a deciding factor in New Hampshire .
And she said the inaccurate polls simply provide a lesson for the campaign and a cautionary tale :
Take nothing for granted .
" We 've come a long way since Tom Bradley , " said Harris , the first African American female district attorney in California and the first Indian American district attorney in the United States .
" When Tom Bradley sought office in California , there was no chance that a woman , much less an African American woman , could be the elected district attorney of one of the biggest cities in this country - and look , I just started my second term . "
" I think it could be very demeaning to the campaign to suggest that race is going to be a factor .
I think Americans are going to be smarter than that . "
Special Gift for your family this ChristmasWhy not take them to the luxurious journey ?
Extending the proud tradition of providing the luxury cruise , Cunard Line has launched its much anticipated £ 300 million Queen Victoria .
At 90,000 tons , Queen Victoria is smaller than her sister ship Queen Mary 2 , but bigger than her predecessor the QE2 .
She can carry 2,000 passengers at up to 23.7 knots , and her 18 decks include seven restaurants , three swimming pools , 4,000 sq ft of shops , a casino , theatre and library .
Tickets for a world cruise will cost up to £ 210,000 for the grandest suites and 24 - hour butler service .
More than 2,000 invited guests will witness the ceremony in a specially - built auditorium next to the City Cruise Terminal where Queen Victoria will be berthed .
The vessel will join two other Cunard queens - the QE2 and the Queen Mary 2 ( QM2 ) - as part of the company 's fleet , with the three vessels meeting in New York next month .
Cunard 's president and managing director Carol Marlow said : " The naming of a Cunard queen is a very special occasion .
Fitful spring sunshine is warming the neo-gothic limestone of the Houses of Parliament , and the knots of tourists wandering round them , but in a basement cafe on Millbank it is dark , and quiet , and Joseph Stiglitz is looking as though he has n't had quite enough sleep .
For two days non -stop he has been talking - at the LSE , at Chatham House , to television crews - and then he is flying to Washington to testify before Congress on the subject of his new book .
Whatever their reservations - and there will be a few - representatives will have to listen , because not many authors with the authority of Stiglitz , a Nobel prize - winner in economics , an academic tempered by four years on Bill Clinton 's Council of Economic Advisers and another three as chief economist at the World Bank ( during which time he developed an influential critique of globalisation ) , will have written a book that so urgently redefines the terms in which to view an ongoing conflict .
The Three Trillion Dollar
War reveals the extent to which its effects have been , and will be , felt by everyone , from Wall Street to the British high street , from Iraqi civilians to African small traders , for years to come .
Some time in 2005 , Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes , who also served as an economic adviser under Clinton , noted that the official Congressional Budget Office estimate for the cost of the war so far was of the order of $ 500 bn .
The figure was so low , they did n't believe it , and decided to investigate .
The paper they wrote together , and published in January 2006 , revised the figure sharply upwards , to between $ 1 and $ 2 trillion .
Even that , Stiglitz says now , was deliberately conservative : " We did n't want to sound outlandish . "
So what did the Republicans say ?
" They had two reactions , " Stiglitz says wearily .
" One was Bush saying , ' We do n't go to war on the calculations of green eye - shaded accountants or economists . '
And our response was , ' No , you do n't decide to fight a response to Pearl Harbour on the basis of that , but when there 's a war of choice , you at least use it to make sure your timing is right , that you 've done the preparation .
And you really ought to do the calculations to see if there are alternative ways that are more effective at getting your objectives .
The second criticism - which we admit - was that we only look at the costs , not the benefits .
Now , we could n't see any benefits .
From our point of view we were n't sure what those were . "
Appetites whetted , Stiglitz and Bilmes dug deeper , and what they have discovered , after months of chasing often deliberately obscured accounts , is that in fact Bush 's Iraqi adventure will cost America - just America - a conservatively estimated $ 3 trillion .
The rest of the world , including Britain , will probably account for about the same amount again .
And in doing so they have achieved something much greater than arriving at an unimaginable figure : by describing the process , by detailing individual costs , by soberly listing the consequences of short - sighted budget decisions , they have produced a picture of comprehensive obfuscation and bad faith whose power comes from its roots in bald fact .
Some of their discoveries we have heard before , others we may have had a hunch about , but others are completely new - and together , placed in context , their impact is staggering .
There will be few who do not think that whatever the reasons for going to war , its progression has been morally disquieting ; following the money turns out to be a brilliant way of getting at exactly why that is .
Next month America will have been in Iraq for five years - longer than it spent in either world war .
Daily military operations ( not counting , for example , future care of wounded ) have already cost more than 12 years in Vietnam , and twice as much as the Korean war .
America is spending $ 16bn a month on running costs alone ( ie on top of the regular expenses of the Department of Defence ) in Iraq and Afghanistan ; that is the entire annual budget of the UN .
Large amounts of cash go missing - the well - publicised $ 8.8 bn Development Fund for Iraq under the Coalition Provisional Authority , for example ; and the less - publicised millions that fall between the cracks at the Department of Defence , which has failed every official audit of the past 10 years .
The defence department 's finances , based on an accounting system inaccurate for anything larger than a grocery store , are so inadequate , in fact , that often it is impossible to know exactly how much is being spent , or on what .
This is on top of misleading information : in January 2007 the administration estimated that the much - vaunted surge would cost $ 5.6 bn .
But this was only for combat troops , for four months - they did n't mention the 15,000 - 28,000 support troops who would also have to be paid for .
Neither do official numbers count the cost of death payments , or caring for the wounded - even though the current ratio of wounded to dead , seven to one , is the highest in US history .
Again , the Department of Defence is being secretive and misleading : official casualty records list only those wounded in combat .
There is , note Stiglitz and Bilmes in their book , " a separate , hard - to - find tally of troops wounded during ' non- combat ' operations " - helicopter crashes , training accidents , anyone who succumbs to disease ( two - thirds of medical evacuees are victims of disease ) ; those who are n't airlifted , ie are treated on the battlefield , simply are n't included .
Stiglitz and Bilmes found this partial list accidentally ; veterans ' organisations had to use the Freedom of Information
Act in order to get full figures ( at which point the ratio of injuries to fatalities rises to 15 to one ) .
The Department of Veterans Affairs , responsible for caring for these wounded , was operating , for the first few years of the war , on prewar budgets , and is ruinously overstretched ; it is still clearing a backlog of claims from the Vietnam war .
Many veterans have been forced to look for private care ; even when the government pays for treatment and benefits , the burden of proof for eligibility is on the soldier , not on the government .
The figure of $ 3 trillion includes what it will cost to pay death benefits , and to care for some of the worst - injured soldiers that army surgeons have ever seen , for the next 50 years .
By way of context , Stiglitz and Bilmes list what even one of these trillions could have paid for : 8 million housing units , or 15 million public school teachers , or healthcare for 530 million children for a year , or scholarships to university for 43 million students .
Three trillion could have fixed America 's social security problem for half a century .
America , says Stiglitz , is currently spending $ 5bn a year in Africa , and worrying about being outflanked by China there : " Five billion is roughly 10 days ' fighting , so you get a new metric of thinking about everything . "
I ask what discoveries Stiglitz found the most disturbing .
He laughs , somewhat mirthlessly .
" There were actually so many things - some of it we suspected , but there were a few things I could n't believe . "
The fact that a contractor working as a security guard gets about $ 400,000 a year , for example , as opposed to a soldier , who might get about $ 40,000 .
That there is a discrepancy we might have guessed - but not its sheer scale , or the fact that , because it is so hard to get insurance for working in Iraq , the government pays the premiums ; or the fact that , if these contractors are injured or killed , the government pays both death and injury benefits on top .
Understandably , this has forced a rise in sign - up bonuses ( as has the fact that the army is so desperate for recruits that it is signing up convicted felons ) .
" So we create a competition for ourselves .
Nobody in their right mind would have done that .
The Bush administration did that ... that I could n't believe .
And that 's not included in the cost the government talks about . "
Then there was the discovery that sign - up bonuses come with conditions : a soldier injured in the first month , for example , has to pay it back .
Or the fact that " the troops , for understandable reasons , are made responsible for their equipment .
You lose your helmet , you have to pay .
If you get blown up and you lose your helmet , they still bill you . "
One soldier was sued for $ 12,000 even though he had suffered massive brain damage .
Some families have had to buy their children body armour , saving the government costs in the short term ; those too poor to afford it sustain injuries that the government then has to pay for .
Then there 's the fact that it was not until 2006 , when Robert Gates replaced Donald Rumsfeld as secretary of defence , that the DOD agreed to replace Humvees with mine - resistant ambush - protected ( MRAP ) armoured vehicles , which are much more able to repel roadside bombs ; until that time , IEDs killed 1,500 Americans .
" This kind of penny - wise , pound - poor behaviour was just unbelievable . "
Yet on another level , Stiglitz is unsurprised , because such decisions are of a piece with the thoroughgoing intellectual inconsistency of the Bush administration .
The general approach , he says , has been a " pastiche of corporate bail - outs , corporate welfare , and free - market economics that is not based on any consistent set of ideas .
And this particular kind of pastiche actually contributed to the failures in Iraq . "
There are the well - rehearsed reasons : ignoring international democratic processes while advocating democracy ; pushing forward liberalisation before Iraq was ready .
Stiglitz 's twist on this was the emails he was receiving from the United States Agency for International Development , complaining about the Treasury being obstructive .
" They were saying , ' Can you help us ?
Because we 're trying to get businesses to work , but the US Treasury is trying to tighten credit , so there 's no money in this country . ' "
Then , of course , there is the administration 's insistence on " sole - source bidding " - awarding vast , multi- year contracts to Halliburton , for example , instead of putting them out to tender .
" An academic might say , ' How can you be a free market , yet demand single - source contracting ? ' " asks Stiglitz now , mildly - but this is not the way the current administration operates .
We know quite a lot now about contractors ' excesses , but it is their economic effect that Stiglitz and Bilmes are interested in , and this seems often to have been malign .
Free market ideals had , of course , to apply to Iraq , if not to Halliburton ( which received at least $ 19.3 bn in single - source contracts ) , so Paul Bremer , head of the Coalition Provisional Authority , abolished many tariffs on imports , and capped corporate and income tax .
Predictably , this led to general asset - stripping , and exposed Iraqi firms to free competition - meaning that many closed down , putting yet more people out of work .
( " The benefits of privatisation and free markets in transition economies are debatable , of course , " write Stiglitz and Bilmes in their book ; a model of understatement , given that Stiglitz is famous for spelling out the harm sustained by poor countries in his book Globalisation and its Discontents ( 2002 ) , and lost his job at the World Bank for outspokenly making the argument in the first place . )
Many reconstruction jobs , in alignment with US procurement law , went to expensive American firms rather than cheaper Iraqi ones - a further waste of resources ( one painting job , for example , cost $ 25 m instead of $ 5 m ) ; these American firms , looking to keep their own costs down and profit margins high , imported cheap labour from such countries as Nepal - even though , at this point , one in two Iraqi men was out of work .
This is not , then , pure neocon ideology at work , says Stiglitz : " Ideology of convenience is a better description . "
It is an ideology illustrated even more clearly in another fact that Stiglitz can't believe - that Bush put through tax cuts while going to war .
In Stiglitz and Bilmes 's reading , this was downright underhand .
Raising taxes , and resorting to the rhetoric of shared sacrifice used in the world wars , for example , would have made Americans more aware of exactly what the war was costing them , and would have provoked opposition sooner .
The solution was to borrow the money , at interest of couple of hundred billion dollars a year , which , by 2017 , will add up to another trillion dollars or so .
This government will be gone in nine months ; subsequent administrations , and generations , will have to pay it off .
At the same time , Stiglitz and Bilmes argue , the Federal Reserve colluded in this obfuscation , because it " kept interest rates lower than they otherwise might have been , and looked the other way as lending standards were lowered , thereby encouraging households to borrow more - and spend more . "
Alan Greenspan , by this account , encouraged people to take on variable - rate mortgages , even as household savings rates went negative for the first time since the Depression .
Individuals were taking on unprecedented debt at the same time as a long housing bubble made them feel wealthy ( and less concerned with derring - do abroad ) - a scenario echoed on this side of the Atlantic .
As we now know , this could n't continue - in part because of yet another effect of the war .
Whatever the much argued reasons for bombing Baghdad , cheap oil has not been the result .
In fact , the price of oil has climbed from $ 25 a barrel to $ 100 in the past five years - great for oil companies , and oil - producing countries , who , along with the contractors , are the only beneficiaries of this war , but not for anyone else .
After calculations based on futures markets , Stiglitz and Bilmes conclude that a significant proportion of this rise is directly due to the disruptions and instabilities caused by Iraq .
This price rise alone has cost the US , which imports about 5 bn barrels a year , an extra $ 25 bn per year ; projecting to 2015 brings that number to an extra $ 1.6 trillion on oil alone ( against which the recent $ 125 bn stimulus package is simply , as Stiglitz puts it , " a drop in the bucket " ) .
Higher oil prices have a direct effect on family , city and state budgets ; they also led to a drop in GDP for the US .
When interest rates finally rose in response , hundreds of thousands of home owners found that they were unable to keep up payments , triggering the toxic tsunami of defaulted mortgages that has put the US on the brink of recession and brought down Northern Rock - with all the ramifications for British home owners and banks that that has in turn entailed .
Thus , any idea that war is good for the economy , Stiglitz and Bilmes argue , is a myth .
A persuasive myth , of course , and in specific cases , such as world war two , one that has seemed to be true - but in 1939 , America and Europe were in a depression ; there was all sorts of possible supply in the market , but people did n't have the cash to buy anything .
Making armaments meant jobs , more people with more disposable income , and so on - but peacetime western economies these days operate near full employment .
As Stiglitz and Bilmes put it , " Money spent on armaments is money poured down the drain " ; far better to invest in education , infrastructure , research , health , and reap the rewards in the long term .
But any idea that war can be divorced from the economy is also naive .
" A lot of people did n't expect the economy to take over the war as the major issue [ in the American election ] , " says Stiglitz , " because people did not expect the economy to be as weak as it is .
I sort of did .
So one of the points of this book is that we do n't have two issues in this campaign - we have one issue .
Or at least , the two are very , very closely linked together . "
And it is the world economy that is at stake , not just America's .
The trillions the rest of the world has shouldered include , of course , the smashed Iraqi economy , the tens of thousands of Iraqi dead , the price , to neighbouring countries , of absorbing thousands of refugees , the coalition dead and wounded ( before the war Gordon Brown set aside £ 1bn ; as of late 2007 , direct operating costs in Iraq and Afghanistan were £ 7bn and rising ) .
But the rising price of oil has also meant , accoring to Stiglitz and Bilmes , that the cost to oil - importing industrial countries in Europe and the Far East is now about $ 1.1 trillion .
And to developing countries it has been devastating : they note a study by the International Energy Agency that looked at a sample of 13 African countries and found that rising oil prices have " had the effect of lowering the average income by 3 % - more than offsetting all of the increase in foreign aid that they had received in recent years , and setting the stage for another crisis in these countries " .
Stiglitz made his name by , among other things , criticising America 's use of globalisation as a bully pulpit ; now he says flatly , " Yes , that 's part of being in a global economy .
You make a mistake of this order , and it affects people all over the world . "
And the borrowed trillions have to come from somewhere .
Because " the saving rate [ in America ] is zero , " says Stiglitz , " that means that you have to finance [ the war ] by borrowing abroad .
So China is financing America 's war . "
The US is now operating at such a deficit , in fact , that it does n't have the money to bail out its own banks .
" When Merrill Lynch and Citibank had a problem , it was sovereign funds from abroad that bailed them out .
And we had to give up a lot of shares of our ownership .
So the largest shareowners in Citibank now are in the Middle East .
It should be called the MidEast bank , not the Citibank . "
This creates a precedent of dependence , " and whether we become dependent on Middle East oil money , or Chinese reserves - it's that dependency that people ought to worry about .
That is a big change .
The amount of borrowing in the last eight years , on top of the borrowing that began with Reagan - that has all changed the US 's economic position in the world . "
So quite apart from the war , does he think a particular kind of unfettered market has had its day ?
" Yes .
I think that anybody who believes that the banks know what they 're doing has to have their head examined .
Clearly , unfettered markets have led us to this economic downturn , and to enormous social problems . "
Combined with the war , whoever inherits the White House faces a crisis of epic proportions .
Where do they go from here ?
" The way that shapes the debate , " says Stiglitz , " is that Americans have to say , ' Even if we stay for another two years , just two years , and we 're spending $ 12bn a month up front in Iraq , and it 's costing us another 50 % in healthcare , disability , bringing it up to $ 18bn a month in Iraq , and you look at that in another 24 months , we 're talking about half a trillion dollars more for two years - forgetting about the economic cost , the ancillary costs , the social costs - just looking at the budgetary cost - not including the interest - you have to say , is this the way we want to spend a half a trillion dollars ?
Will it make America stronger ?
Will it make the Middle East safer ?
Is this the way we want to spend it ? "
Far better , he suggests , to leave rapidly and in a dignified manner , and to spend some of it on helping Iraqis reconstruct their own country - and the rest on investing in and strengthening the American economy , so that it can retain its independence , and have the wherewithal , at least , to play a responsible role in the world .
The book ends with a list of 18 specific reforms arising from Stiglitz and Bilmes 's discoveries , focusing on exactly how to fund and run a war from now on ( depend not on emergency funds and borrowing but on surtaxes , for example , so that voters know exactly what it is they are paying for , and can vote accordingly ) .
He has been approached by Barack Obama as a possible adviser should he reach the White House , although he says , " I 've gone beyond the age where I would want to be in Washington full time .
I would be interested in trying to help shape the bigger picture issues , and in particular the issues associated with America positioning itself in the new global world , and re-establishing the bonds with other countries that have been so damaged by the Bush administration . "
I suggest , as devil 's advocate , that to count costs in the way he has , and to advise retrenchment , might be seen as encouraging America to return to isolationism .
" No .
I think that 's fundamentally wrong .
The problem with Iraq was that it was the wrong war , and the wrong set of issues .
Obama was very good about this .
He said , ' I 'm not against war - I 'm just against stupid wars . '
And I feel very much the same way .
While we were worried about WMD that did not exist in Iraq , WMD did occur in North Korea .
To use an American expression , we took our eye off the ball .
And while we were fighting in Iraq , Afghanistan got worse , Pakistan got worse .
So because we were fighting battles that we could n't win , we lost battles that we could have . "
To discover that those lost battles included better healthcare for millions of Americans , a robust world economy , a healthier and more independent Africa , and a more stable Middle East , seems worth a bit of green - eye - shaded number crunching .
In figures
$ 16bn
The amount the US spends on the monthly running costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan - on top of regular defence spending
$ 138
The amount paid by every US household every month towards the current operating costs of the war
$ 19.3bn
The amount Halliburton has received in single - source contracts for work in Iraq
$ 25bn
The annual cost to the US of the rising price of oil , itself a consequence of the war
$ 3 trillion
A conservative estimate of the true cost - to America alone - of Bush 's Iraq adventure .
The rest of the world , including Britain , will shoulder about the same amount again
$ 5bn
Cost of 10 days ' fighting in Iraq
$ 1 trillion
The interest America will have paid by 2017 on the money borrowed to finance the war
3 %
The average drop in income of 13 African countries - a direct result of the rise in oil prices .
This drop has more than offset the recent increase in foreign aid to Africa

Hair removal Charlie@wciservices.org ( Charles Oakes )
( chuckle , forwarded , heard it )
All hair removal methods have tricked women with their promises of easy , painless removal - The Epilady , scissors , razors , Nair and now ... the wax .
Read on .........
My night began as any other normal weeknight .
Come home , fix dinner , play with the kids .
I then had the thought that would ring painfully in my mind for the next few hours : " Maybe I should pull the waxing kit out of the medicine cabinet . "
So I headed to the site of my demise : the bathroom .
It was one of those " cold wax " kits .
No melting a clump of hot wax , you just rub the strips together in your hand , they get warm and you peel them apart and press them to your leg ( or wherever else ) and you pull the hair right off .
No muss , no fuss .
How hard can it be ?
I mean , I 'm not a genius , but I am mechanically inclined enough to figure this out .
( YA THINK !?!)
So I pull one of the thin strips out .
Its two strips facing each other stuck together .
Instead of rubbing them together , my genius kicks in so I get out the hair dryer and heat it to 1000 degrees .
( " Cold wax , " yeah ... right ! )
I lay the strip across my thigh .
Hold the skin around it tight and pull .
It works !
OK , so it was n't the best feeling , but it was n't too bad .
I can do this !
Hair removal no longer eludes me !
I am She -rah , fighter of all wayward body hair and maker of smooth skin extraordinaire .
With my next wax strip I move north .
After checking on the kids , I sneak back into the bathroom , for the ultimate hair fighting championship .
I drop my panties and place one foot on the toilet .
Using the same procedure , I apply the wax strip across the right side of my bikini line , covering the right half of my hoo - ha and stretching down to the inside of my butt cheek ( it was a long strip )
I inhale deeply and brace myself ....
RRRRRRIIIIPPP !!!!
I 'm blind !!!
Blinded from pain !!!!...
OH MY GAWD !!!!!!!!!
Vision returning , I notice that I 've only managed to pull off half the strip .
CRAP !
Another deep breath and RIPP !
Everything is spinning and spotted .
I think I may pass out ... must stay conscious ... must stay conscious .
Do I hear crashing drums ???
Breathe , breathe .................. OK , back to normal .
I want to see my trophy - a wax covered strip , the one that has caused me so much pain , with my hairy pelt sticking to it .
I want to revel in the glory that is my triumph over body hair .
I hold up the strip !
There 's no hair on it .
Where is the hair ???
WHERE IS THE WAX ???
Slowly I ease my head down , foot still perched on the toilet .
I see the hair .
The hair that should be on the strip ... it 's not !
I touch .
I am touching wax .
I run my fingers over the most sensitive part of my body , which is now covered in cold wax and matted hair .
Then I make the next BIG mistake ... remember my foot is still propped upon the toilet ?
I know I need to do something .
So I put my foot down .
Sealed shut !
My butt is sealed shut .
Sealed shut !
I penguin walk around the bathroom trying to figure out what to do and think to myself " Please do n't let me get the urge to poop .
My head may pop off ! "
What can I do to melt the wax ?
Hot water !!
Hot water melts wax !!
I 'll run the hottest water I can stand into the bathtub , get in , immerse the wax - covered bits and the wax should melt and I can gently wipe it off , right ???
* WRONG !!!!!!!*
I get in the tub -
The water is slightly hotter than that used to torture prisoners of war or sterilize surgical equipment - I sit .
Now , the only thing worse than having your nether regions glued together , is having them glued together and then glued to the bottom of the tub ... in scalding hot water .
Which , by the way , does n't melt cold wax .
So , now I 'm stuck to the bottom of the tub as though I had cemented myself to the porcelain !!
God bless the man who had convinced me a few months ago to have a phone put in the bathroom !!!!!
I call my friend , thinking surely she has waxed before and has some secret of how to get me undone .
It 's a very good conversation starter " So , my butt and hoo - ha are glued together to the bottom of the tub ! "
There is a slight pause .
She does n't know any secret tricks for removal but she does try to hide her laughter from me .
She wants to know exactly where the wax is located , " Are we talking cheeks or hole or hoo - ha ? "
She 's laughing out loud by now ... I can hear her .
I give her the rundown and she suggests I call the number on the side of the box .
YEAH !!!!!
Right !!
I should be the joke of someone else 's night .
While we go through various solutions I resort to trying to scrape the wax off with a razor .
Nothing feels better than to have your girlie goodies covered in hot wax , glued shut , stuck to the tub in super hot water and then dry - shaving the sticky wax off !!
By now the brain is not working , dignity has taken a major hike and I 'm pretty sure I 'm going to need Post - Traumatic Stress counseling for this event .
My friend is still talking with me when I finally see my saving grace .... the lotion they give you to remove the excess wax .
What do I really have to lose at this point ?
I rub some on and OH MY GOD !!!!!!!
The scream probably woke the kids and scared the dickens out of my friend .
It 's sooo painful , but I really do n't care .
" IT WORKS !!
It works !! "
I get a hearty congratulation from my friend and she hangs up .
I successfully remove the remainder of the wax and then notice to my grief and despair ....
THE HAIR IS STILL THERE ....... ALL OF IT !
So I recklessly shave it off .
Heck , I 'm numb by now .
Nothing hurts .
I could have amputated my own leg at this point .
Next week I 'm going to try hair color ......

Full - time book critics approach recreational reading with a head start .
We ’re already reading for pleasure .
We are immersed in books we find appealing , since the nearly 300 books chosen for the daily reviews in The New York Times have been culled from tens of thousands of volumes published each year .
Some are chosen for their self - evident importance .
Some are terrific sleepers .
Even if a book ’s foremost quality is its awfulness , a review in these pages means there ’s something about it that one of us found noteworthy .
But we have favorites .
And they meet criteria that any reader will recognize .
These are the books that are disappointing only because they have to end .
They ’re the ones we mention to friends .
They ’re the ones worth taking on vacation , and they are well executed , whatever their genre or subject matter .
They are what we ’d read even if Michiko Kakutani , William Grimes and I were n’t designated readers .
The 10 - favorite lists that follow are not 10 - best lists .
They ’re not based strictly on merit .
They do n’t cite books we admired in the abstract but did n’t particularly like .
Nor are they based on comprehensiveness ; with so many books afoot , none of us can hope to have a complete overview .
Each of us has stayed within the confines of our own reviews published in 2007 and picked the 10 books we covered most avidly  though there is one exception .
Because Times critics do not review the work of their Times colleagues , Michiko Kakutani did not review Tim Weiner ’s “ Legacy of Ashes . ”
She recommends it nonetheless .
Think of these as lists that leave off the broccoli , figuratively speaking  though we have nothing against broccoli at all .
( Michael Pollan ’s new pro-vegetable manifesto , “ In Defense of Food , ” might be on my list were it not for a technicality : Its publication date is Jan. 1 , 2008 . )
Bill Clinton : Texas Could Be Hillary 's Last Stand Former president tells Lone Star crowd his wife needs a win in Texas and Ohio .
Feb. 20 , 2008  --
There 's a Texas - sized stumbling block on Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton 's comeback trail .
Even Clinton 's most devoted surrogate -- her husband , Bill Clinton -- acknowledged the do - or - die stakes on Wednesday in Beaumont , Texas , conceding that a loss in Texas or Ohio would likely doom her candidacy .
" If she wins Texas and Ohio I think she will be the nominee .
If you do n't deliver for her , I do n't think she can be .
It 's all on you , " the former president told the audience at the beginning of his speech .
A series of demographic and organizational challenges are coming together to make the Lone Star State an extraordinarily difficult venue for Clinton , with her campaign needing a decisive win to overcome Sen.
Barack Obama 's growing edge in convention delegates .
With polls showing the race essentially tied , several independent political analysts say that even if Clinton takes an overwhelming share of Latino voters , she will be hard - pressed to carry the state , much less capture a large share of delegates .
And the unique way that Texas awards delegates could force Clinton to take as much as 55 percent of the state 's vote just to break even in the battle for delegates , said Richard Murray , director of the University of Houston 's Center for Public Policy .
" They 've gotten some bad breaks here , " Murray said .
" Texas is not well set - up for her , and the Obama people have figured that out .
It 's tough — but they 've got no choice .
They must win down here , and win convincingly . "
Must - Win for Clinton
Texas is the biggest prize remaining on the Democrats ' schedule .
It 's a virtual must - win for Clinton , D - N.Y. , who has dropped 10 contests in a row to Obama , D - Ill .
March 4 voting in the Texas primary — which will allocate 193 convention delegates — provides Clinton 's best opportunity to jump back into the race , with the state 's large Hispanic population providing an apparent edge to Clinton .
But a few significant quirks could frustrate the Clinton campaign .
For starters , Texas has a one - of - a - kind primary / caucus system , where two - thirds of the state 's delegates will be awarded in the March 4 primary , while the remaining third will depend on the results of caucuses later that evening .
Voters are permitted — and , in fact , are encouraged by campaigns — to attend both events .
But Obama has demonstrated organizational strength in other caucus states , leaving him favored to emerge with the larger share of the 67 delegates at stake in the caucuses , regardless of what happens in the primary earlier in the day .
Obama 's Independent Voter Edge
Another factor in Obama 's favor is the open nature of the primary .
Texas — like Ohio , the other big state that votes March 4 — allows independents to vote in the Democratic primary , a dynamic that has significantly favored Obama in other states , including Wisconsin , which voted on Tuesday .
In addition , Texas Democrats have designed a system of delegate allocation that rewards parts of the state that have voted heavily Democratic in previous elections .
This means that many of the areas the Clinton campaign is most heavily targeting — particularly the Latino - heavy communities in the Rio Grande Valley — carry less weight than some of the urban areas that favor Obama .
For instance , voters in three urban state senate districts — overwhelmingly black districts in Dallas and Houston , and a white liberal enclave of Austin — will choose 21 convention delegates between them .
But because of low Latino turnout for Democrats in the 2004 and 2006 elections , some state senate districts choose as few as two delegates each .
" Clinton could win the statewide vote , but she could still just break even or end up behind in the delegate count , " said Martin Frost , a former congressman from Dallas who is neutral in the presidential race .
" The press is playing attention to who wins the delegates , so that will be important . "
Texas ' odd system of allocating delegates has flummoxed the Clinton campaign .
Clinton told reporters over the weekend that her aides were still struggling to understand how the state operates .
" I 've got people trying to understand it as we speak , " she said .
" Grown men are crying as we speak .
I had no idea it was so bizarre . "
Asked by ABC News how the Clinton campaign would define success in Texas , Clinton communications director Howard Wolfson said he was n't sure .
" I think all of you will be looking at a lot of different data points to determine who wins the night , " Wolfson said .
" I think obviously , the delegate counts in this state is one of them , but I 'm not going to presume to tell ABC News how to determine the outcome from a rhetorical standpoint .
But I think we 're going to do very , very well . "
Clinton Courts Hispanic Voters
A CNN poll released this week had the race statistically tied , with Clinton up 50 - 48 over Obama .
Clinton is focusing her efforts on Texas ' Hispanic communities .
She reminds crowds of her work in South Texas on behalf of George McGovern 's 1972 presidential campaign , and she 's pumping resources into the Democratic - leaning counties that line the border with Mexico , and setting up field offices in Hispanic neighborhoods in the big cities .
" The Latino voter , from Dallas all the way to the Rio Grande Valley , they 've heard they 're going to be the difference , and they 're going to show up for her , " said Marc Campos , a veteran Houston - based Latino Democratic consultant who is not aligned in the presidential race .
" There 's a historical link between the Clintons and the community — they 've been here , and everybody knows their history , " Campos said .
" The Latino community feels , they 've inspired us , they think we 're important for them .
They do n't want to be the ones who end her political career . "
Independent observers expect Latinos to comprise roughly one - third of Democratic primary voters — though the Clinton campaign hopes to nudge that figure above 40 percent .
Exit poll data from 2004 suggests that the Latino population is roughly similar in socioeconomic status to Latino voters in other Southern and Western states , with more than 70 percent lacking college degrees and a similar portion earning less than $ 50,000 a year .
If Texas Latinos vote as they have in other states , Clinton could expect to receive about two - thirds of the Latino vote .
But that edge could be essentially nullified by the African - American vote , which is expected to make up one - fourth of the primary vote , and is energized on behalf of Obama .
In other states , black voters have been favoring Obama by as much as 80 and 90 percent .
' It 's Going to Be Close '
That leaves the battleground to the state 's white voters , a diverse group that could represent as much as 40 percent of the voters on March 4 .
White independents have favored Obama in other states , though their support is unlikely to be monolithic for any one candidate in Texas , said Linda Curtis , founder and director of Independent Texans , an advocacy group that represents independent voters .
She noted that many of the state 's independent voters are conservative by inclination , and could support home - state candidate Rep.
Ron Paul , R - Texas , or former governor Mike Huckabee , R - Ark. , who has made a broad populist appeal to voters .
" Obama 's making a big play for independents , and they 're very attracted to him , " Curtis said .
" But I do n't think they 're going to coalesce around any one candidate . "
White Democrats in Texas are a fast - changing demographic group that look less like traditional Southern white voters every year , Frost said .
Younger white voters tend to be more liberal and clustered around the urban areas of Dallas , Houston , Austin , and San Antonio — and could support Obama , who has grown stronger among white voters as the campaign has progressed .
" The white vote in Texas has gotten more and more liberal as time goes on , " Frost said .
" Texas has never mattered up until now . …
It 's going to be close . "

P2P is for piracy ... and we 're going to use it
Rick Cotton , NBC Universal 's top lawyer , is sitting across the table from me at a Midtown restaurant only blocks from Cotton 's base at Rockefeller Center .
Apparently , media moguls do not breakfast on a diet of puppies and children , as some consumers seem to think ; bagels , toast , and oatmeal are the order of the day .
George Kliavkoff , NBC 's first " Chief Digital Officer , " has also joined us to talk policy .
" I 'm curious if you necessarily equate peer - to - peer protocols like BitTorrent with piracy ? " I ask after the orange juice arrives .
Cotton 's opinion on that question matters .
As general counsel for NBC Universal , he has been one of the strongest US backers of the idea that ISPs have some duty to start filtering the undeniably massive volume of illicit P2P traffic that passes through their networks .
AT&T has already publicly committed to take up the challenge , and Cotton hopes to see more action from other ISPs .
" Well , I think the answer today is yes , " he says .
" It 's obvious that peer - to - peer is capable , and in fact may in the future be a significant mode of efficient transport of legitimate content .
But today , in terms of that consumption of bandwidth , it 's overwhelmingly pirated content .
There 's probably a percentage of pornography mixed in , but one is not talking about legitimate content . "
Cotton and Kliavkoff are affable , intelligent , and interesting to chat with — but they also inhabit a conflicted world , and it shows as we talk .
Take our discussion of peer - to - peer , for instance , with its lack of " legitimate content . "
Rick Cotton ,
NBC Universal's
General Counsel
I ask about the current FCC hearing on Comcast 's BitTorrent " delaying , " where a company called Vuze is in fact offering just such legitimate content using BitTorrent ( to say nothing of BitTorrent , the company , which is doing the same thing ) .
" You have to start with the first proposition , " Cotton says , " which is : should we collectively be concerned about the fact that 50 to 75 percent of the total bandwidth of broadband ISPs is today taken up by P2P traffic which is in fact overwhelmingly pirated ?
I have to tell you , I think the answer to that is yes . "
George Kliavkoff ,
NBC Universal's
Chief Digital Officer
He goes further ; P2P protocols themselves disrupt the Internet by passing bandwidth costs from content owners onto ISPs .
Cotton told the FCC in a recent filing , " P2P applications shift the costs of centralized storage and distribution to end users and their broadband network providers . "
In addition , installing P2P apps " can slow down the processing speed of [ consumers ' ] computers , open up the contents of their hard drives to third parties and expose them to potential copyright liability , " the NBC filing noted .
Worse , P2P protocols " exacerbate the congestion " that Comcast 's RST packet solution attempts to solve .
Fair enough : P2P is a hotbed of piracy , it 's bad for ISPs , it disrupts the Internet , it can bog down computers , and it harms corn farmers in Iowa .
It seems safe to say that NBC wo n't be using BitTorrent any time soon .
So it comes as a complete surprise when , at the end of our wide - ranging conversation , Kliavkoff drops a casual bombshell .
" We 're coming up on an announcement of using some peer - to - peer technology for distribution of some of our own content , " he says .
" We generally think that peer - to - peer technologies are very useful for distributing large files , they can significantly reduce bandwidth costs , and generally they are technologies today without a business model .
We think the distribution of legitimate content using that technology saves us a lot of costs and we 're happy to share some of that savings . "
I beg your pardon ?
NBC : Old media no longer
It 's not that NBC is hypocritical , stupid , or worse ; it's that the transition currently engulfing media businesses is both terrifying and the source of bold new opportunities .
NBC hopes to transform itself from old media giant into a new media pioneer that makes its content available through MySpace , AOL , and Comcast , allows embedding and clipping , and fully supports the emerging world of widgets and web apps .
With NBC's
Hulu officially launching today , Kliavkoff estimates that its video content will reach more than 95 percent of the US Internet audience through its major portal partners .
It 's a " groundbreaking thing for big , old , traditional media to do , " he says , and he 's right .
Instead of ceding Internet video to distributors like YouTube , NBC and News Corp. have partnered on a bold plan to do the digital distribution themselves .
The site was n't coded up over the weekend by a team of hackers slaving away in the basement , either ; Hulu cost " tens of millions of dollars . "
Both Cotton and Kliavkoff face " a lot of concern reaching up to the board level that the material that 's on Hulu is not available next door on a pirated basis , " and it 's easy to see why with that kind of money at stake .
This is the concern that drives Cotton 's crusade against illicit file - swapping .
He 's convinced that the pirate problem is costing NBC Universal real revenue and that the scale of the problem is so vast as to discourage investment in the " carrots , " positive solutions like Hulu .
" With all that pirated material available , it creates tremendous disincentives to content owners who need to invest in new content , " Cotton says , " and that just hurts consumers over time . "
After all , if two video stores sit next to each other at the local mall and one charges for DVDs while the other hands free , illegal copies out without penalty , what incentive does the legitimate video owner have to invest any money in buying new DVDs ?
It 's a fair question , so I ask Cotton why NBC has , in fact , just invested millions in a service like Hulu .
File - swapping , though rampant , is obviously not enough of a problem to stop this kind of investment yet , but Cotton suggests that if large projects like Hulu fail to show returns , there may not be many more attempts in the future .
He fully recognizes the need to use both carrots and sticks , to " compete with free " while trying to shut down the illegal distribution channel , and he sees both efforts as complementary ; " hand in glove , " he calls them .
Which brings us to the stick : ISP filtering .
For the sake of that 5 percent , this will be the sourest spring .
About a fifth of Clinton and Obama supporters now say they would n’t vote for the other candidate in the general election .
Meanwhile , on the other side , voters get an unobstructed view of the Republican nominee .
John McCain ’s approval ratings have soared 11 points .
He is now viewed positively by 67 percent of Americans .
A month ago , McCain was losing to Obama among independents by double digits in a general election matchup .
Now McCain has a lead among this group .
For three more months , Clinton is likely to hurt Obama even more against McCain , without hurting him against herself .
And all this is happening so she can preserve that 5 percent chance .
When you step back and think about it , she is amazing .
She possesses the audacity of hopelessness .
Why does she go on like this ?
Does Clinton privately believe that Obama is so incompetent that only she can deliver the policies they both support ?
Is she simply selfish , and willing to put her party through agony for the sake of her slender chance ?
Are leading Democrats so narcissistic that they would create bitter stagnation even if they were granted one - party rule ?
The better answer is that Clinton ’s long rear - guard action is the logical extension of her relentlessly political life .
For nearly 20 years , she has been encased in the apparatus of political celebrity .
Look at her schedule as first lady and ever since .
Think of the thousands of staged events , the tens of thousands of times she has pretended to be delighted to see someone she does n’t know , the hundreds of thousands times she has recited empty clichés and exhortatory banalities , the millions of photos she has posed for in which she is supposed to appear empathetic or tough , the billions of politically opportune half - truths that have bounced around her head .
No wonder the Clinton campaign feels impersonal .
It ’s like a machine for the production of politics .
It plows ahead from event to event following its own iron logic .
The only question is whether Clinton herself can step outside the apparatus long enough to turn it off and withdraw voluntarily or whether she will force the rest of her party to intervene and jam the gears .
If she does the former , she would surprise everybody with a display of self - sacrifice .
Her campaign would cruise along at a lower register until North Carolina , then use that as an occasion to withdraw .
If she does not , she would soldier on doggedly , taking down as many allies as necessary .
Jenny Holzer is an American artist whose main focus " is the use of words and ideas in [ a ] public space . "
Above is a compilation of her Truisms .
She 's got a way with words .
Before you can save the world , you 'd better write a to - do list so nothing gets overlooked .
Some of the world 's brightest minds have done just that by laying out this century 's greatest engineering challenges .
The panel of 18 engineers , technologists and futurists included Google co-founder Larry Page and genomics pioneer J. Craig Venter .
They spent more than a year pondering how best to improve life on Earth and came up with 14 Grand Engineering Challenges , a list the National Academy of Engineering deemed so momentous it should be capitalized .
The list , announced this afternoon , addresses four themes the committee considered " essential for humanity to flourish " - environmental sustainability , health , reducing our vulnerability and adding to the joy of living .
" We chose engineering challenges that we feel can , through creativity and committment , be realistically met , most of them early in this century , " said committee chair William J. Perry , the former Secretary of Defense who teaches engineering at Stanford University .
" Some can be , and should be , achieved as soon as possible . "
What are they ?
Make solar energy affordable .
Provide energy from fusion .
Develop carbon sequestration methods .
Manage the nitrogen cycle .
Provide access to clean water .
Restore and improve urban infrastructure .
Advance health informatics .
Engineer better medicines .
Reverse - engineer the brain .
Prevent nuclear terror .
Secure cyberspace .
Enhance virtual reality .
Advance personalized learning .
Engineer the tools for scientific discovery .
The committee , which also included such luminaries as futurist Ray Kurzweil and robotics guru Dean Kamen , decided not to make any predictions or focus on gee - whiz gadgets .
They felt it more important to outline broad objectives that might influence research funding and governmental policy .
The 14 challenges they laid out were culled from hundreds of suggestions from engineers , scientists , policymakers and ordinary people around the world .
" Meeting these challenges would be game changing , " said Charles M. Vest , president of the NAE .
" Success with any of them could dramatically improve life for everyone . "
So ... what should we check off first ?

When passion takes a grip , a kiss locks two humans together in an exchange of scents , tastes , textures , secrets and emotions .
We kiss furtively , lasciviously , gently , shyly , hungrily and exuberantly .
We kiss in broad daylight and in the dead of night .
We give ceremonial kisses , affectionate kisses , Hollywood air kisses , kisses of death and , at least in fairytales , pecks that revive princesses .
Lips may have evolved first for food and later applied themselves to speech , but in kissing they satisfy different kinds of hungers .
In the body , a kiss triggers a cascade of neural messages and chemicals that transmit tactile sensations , sexual excitement , feelings of closeness , motivation and even euphoria .
Not all the messages are internal .
After all , kissing is a communal affair .
The fusion of two bodies dispatches communiqués to your partner as powerful as the data you stream to yourself .
Kisses can convey important information about the status and future of a relationship .
So much , in fact , that , according to recent research , if a first kiss goes bad , it can stop an otherwise promising relationship dead in its tracks .
Some scientists believe that the fusing of lips evolved because it facilitates mate selection .
“ Kissing , ” said evolutionary psychologist Gordon G. Gallup of the University at Albany , State University of New York , last September in an interview with the BBC , “ involves a very complicated exchange of information — olfactory information , tactile information and postural types of adjustments that may tap into underlying evolved and unconscious mechanisms that enable people to make determinations … about the degree to which they are genetically incompatible . ”
Kissing may even reveal the extent to which a partner is willing to commit to raising children , a central issue in long - term relationships and crucial to the survival of our species .
Satisfying Hunger
Whatever else is going on when we kiss , our evolutionary history is embedded within this tender , tempestuous act .
In the 1960s British zoologist and author Desmond Morris first proposed that kissing might have evolved from the practice in which primate mothers chewed food for their young and then fed them mouth - to - mouth , lips puckered .
Chimpanzees feed in this manner , so our hominid ancestors probably did , too .
Pressing outturned lips against lips may have then later developed as a way to comfort hungry children when food was scarce and , in time , to express love and affection in general .
The human species might eventually have taken these proto-parental kisses down other roads until we came up with the more passionate varieties we have today .
Silent chemical messengers called pheromones could have sped the evolution of the intimate kiss .
Many animals and plants use pheromones to communicate with other members of the same species .
Insects , in particular , are known to emit pheromones to signal alarm , for example , the presence of a food trail , or sexual attraction .
Whether humans sense pheromones is controversial .
Unlike rats and pigs , people are not known to have a specialized pheromone de­tector , or vomeronasal organ , between their nose and mouth [ see “ Sex and the Secret Nerve , ” by R. Douglas Fields ; Scientific American Mind , February / March 2007 ] .
Nevertheless , biologist Sarah Woodley of Duquesne University suggests that we might be able to sense pheromones with our nose .
And chemical communication could explain such curious findings as a tendency of the menstrual cycles of female dormitory mates to synchronize or the attraction of women to the scents of T - shirts worn by men whose immune systems are genetically compatible with theirs .
Human pheromones could include an­drostenol , a chemical component of male sweat that may boost sexual arousal in women , and female vaginal hormones called copulins that some researchers have found raise testosterone levels and increase sexual appetite in men .
If pheromones do play a role in human courtship and procreation , then kissing would be an extremely effective way to pass them from one person to another .
The behavior may have evolved because it helps humans find a suitable mate — making love , or at least attraction , quite literally blind .
We might also have inherited the intimate kiss from our primate ancestors .
Bonobos , which are genetically very similar to us ( although we are not their direct descendants ) , are a particularly passionate bunch , for example .
Emory University primatologist Frans B. M. de Waal recalls a zookeeper who accepted what he thought would be a friendly kiss from one of the bonobos , until he felt the ape ’s tongue in his mouth !
Good Chemistry
Since kissing evolved , the act seems to have become addictive .
Human lips enjoy the slimmest layer of skin on the human body , and the lips are among the most densely populated with sensory neurons of any body region .
When we kiss , these neurons , along with those in the tongue and mouth , rocket messages to the brain and body , setting off delightful sensations , intense emotions and physical reactions .
Of the 12 or 13 cranial nerves that affect cerebral function , five are at work when we kiss , shuttling messages from our lips , tongue , cheeks and nose to a brain that snatches information about the temperature , taste , smell and movements of the entire affair .
Some of that information arrives in the somatosensory cortex , a swath of tissue on the surface of the brain that represents tactile information in a map of the body .
In that map , the lips loom large because the size of each represented body region is proportional to the density of its nerve endings .
Kissing unleashes a cocktail of chemicals that govern human stress , motivation , social bonding and sexual stimulation .
In a new study , psychologist Wendy L. Hill and her student Carey A. Wilson of Lafayette College compared the levels of two key hormones in 15 college male - female couples before and after they kissed and before and after they talked to each other while holding hands .
One hormone , oxytocin , is involved in social bonding , and the other , cortisol , plays a role in stress .
Hill and Wilson predicted that kissing would boost levels of oxytocin , which also influences social recognition , male and female orgasm , and childbirth .
They expected this effect to be particularly pronounced in the study ’s females , who reported higher levels of intimacy in their relationships .
They also forecast a dip in cortisol , because kissing is presumably a stress reliever .
But the researchers were surprised to find that oxytocin levels rose only in the males , whereas it decreased in the females , after either kissing or talking while holding hands .
They concluded that females must require more than a kiss to feel emotionally connected or sexually excited during physical contact .
Females might , for example , need a more romantic atmosphere than the experimental setting provided , the authors speculate .
The study , which Hill and Wilson reported in November 2007 at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience , revealed that cortisol levels dropped for both sexes no matter the form of intimacy , a hint that kissing does in fact reduce stress .
To the extent that kissing is linked to love , the act may similarly boost brain chemicals associated with pleasure , euphoria and a motivation to connect with a certain someone .
In 2005 anthropologist Helen Fisher of Rutgers University and her colleagues reported scanning the brains of 17 individuals as they gazed at pictures of people with whom they were deeply in love .
The researchers found an unusual flurry of activity in two brain regions that govern pleasure , motivation and reward : the right ventral tegmental area and the right caudate nucleus .
Addictive drugs such as cocaine similarly stimulate these reward centers , through the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine .
Love , it seems , is a kind of drug for us humans .
Kissing has other primal effects on us as well .
Visceral marching orders boost pulse and blood pressure .
The pupils dilate , breathing deepens and rational thought retreats , as desire suppresses both prudence and self - consciousness .
For their part , the participants are probably too enthralled to care .
As poet e. e. cummings once observed : “ Kisses are a better fate / than wisdom . ”
Litmus Test
Although a kiss may not be wise , it can be pivotal to a relationship .
“ One dance , ” Alex “ Hitch ” Hitchens says to his client and friend in the 2005 movie Hitch , “ one look , one kiss , that ’s all we get … one shot , to make the difference between ‘ happily ever after ’ and , ‘ Oh ?
He ’s just some guy I went to some thing with once . ’ ”
Can a kiss be that powerful ?
Some research indicates it can be .
In a recent survey Gallup and his colleagues found that 59 percent of 58 men and 66 percent of 122 women admitted there had been times when they were attracted to some­one only to find that their interest evaporated after their first kiss .
The “ bad ” kisses had no particular flaws ; they simply did not feel right — and they ended the romantic relationship then and there — a kiss of death for that coupling .
The reason a kiss carries such weight , Gallup theorizes , is that it conveys subconscious information about the genetic compatibility of a prospective mate .
His hypothesis is consistent with the idea that kissing evolved as a courtship strategy because it helps us rate potential partners .
From a Darwinian perspective , sexual selection is the key to passing on your genes .
For us humans , mate choice often involves falling in love .
Fisher wrote in her 2005 paper that this “ attraction mech­anism ” in humans “ evolved to enable in­di­vi­duals to focus their mating energy on speci­fic others , thereby conserving energy and facilitating mate choice — a primary aspect of reproduction . ”
According to Gallup ’s new findings , kissing may play a crucial role in the progression of a partnership but one that differs between men and women .
In a study published in September 2007 Gallup and his colleagues surveyed 1,041 college undergraduates of both sexes about kissing .
For most of the men , a deep kiss was largely a way of advancing to the next level sexually .
But women were generally looking to take the relationship to the next stage emotionally , assessing not simply whether the other person would make a first - rate source of DNA but also whether he would be a good long - term partner .
“ Females use [ kissing ] … to provide information about the level of commitment if they happen to be in a continuing relationship , ” Gallup told the BBC in September .
The locking of lips is thus a kind of emotional barometer : the more enthusiastic it is , the healthier the relationship .
Because women need to invest more energy in producing children and have a shorter biological window in which to reproduce , they need to be pickier about whom they choose for a partner — and they cannot afford to get it wrong .
So , at least for women , a passionate kiss may help them choose a mate who is not only good at fathering children but also committed enough to stick around and raise them .
That said , kissing is probably not strictly necessary from an evolutionary point of view .
Most other animals do not neck and still manage to produce plenty of offspring .
Not even all humans kiss .
At the turn of the 20th century Danish scientist Kristoffer Nyrop described Finnish tribes whose members bathed together but considered kissing indecent .
In 1897 French anthropologist Paul d’Enjoy reported that the Chinese regard mouth - to - mouth kissing to be as horrifying as many people deem cannibalism to be .
In Mongolia some fathers do not kiss their sons .
( They smell their heads instead . )
In fact , up to 10 percent of humanity does not touch lips , according to human ethology pioneer Irenäus Eibl - Eibesfeldt , now head of the Max - Planck - Society Film Archive of Human Ethology in Andechs , Germany , writing in his 1970 book , Love and Hate : The Natural History of Behavior Patterns .
Fisher published a similar figure in 1992 .
Their findings suggest that some 650 million members of the human species have not mastered the art of osculation , the scientific term for kissing ; that is more than the population of any nation on earth except for China and India .
Lopsided Love
For those cultures that do kiss , however , osculation conveys additional hidden messages .
Psychologist Onur Güntürkün of the Ruhr - University of Bochum in Germany recently surveyed 124 couples kissing in public places in the U.S. , Germany and Turkey and found that they tilted their heads to the right twice as often as to the left before their lips touched .
Right - handedness cannot explain this tendency , because being right handed is four times more common than is the act of kissing on the right .
Instead Güntürkün suspects that right - tilted kissing results from a general preference that develops at the end of gestation and in infancy .
This “ behavioral asymmetry ” is related to the lateralization of brain functions such as speech and spatial awareness .
Nurture may also influence our tendency to tilt to the right .
Studies show that as many as 80 percent of mothers , whether right - handed or left - handed , cradle their infants on their left side .
Infants cradled , face up , on the left must turn to the right to nurse or nuzzle .
As a result , most of us may have learned to associate warmth and security with turning to the right .
Some scientists have proposed that those who tilt their heads to the left when they kiss may be showing less warmth and love than those who tilt to the right .
In one theory , tilting right exposes the left cheek , which is controlled by the right , more emotional half of the brain .
But a 2006 study by naturalist Julian Greenwood and his colleagues at Stranmillis University College in Belfast , Northern Ireland , counters this notion .
The researchers found that 77 percent of 240 undergraduate students leaned right when kissing a doll on the cheek or lips .
Tilting to the right with the doll , an impassive act , was nearly as prevalent among subjects as it was among 125 couples observed osculating in Belfast ; they tilted right 80 percent of the time .
The conclusion : right - kissing probably results from a motor preference , as Güntürkün hypothesized , rather than an emotional one .
Despite all these observations , a kiss continues to resist complete scientific dissection .
Close scrutiny of couples has illuminated new complexities woven throughout this simplest and most natural of acts — and the quest to unmask the secrets of passion and love is not likely to end soon .
But romance gives up its mysteries grudgingly .
And in some ways , we like it like that .

The Awful German Language , by Mark Twain
A little learning makes the whole world kin .
-- Proverbs xxxii , 7 .
I went often to look at the collection of curiosities in Heidelberg Castle , and one day I surprised the keeper of it with my German .
I spoke entirely in that language .
He was greatly interested ; and after I had talked a while he said my German was very rare , possibly a " unique " ; and wanted to add it to his museum .
If he had known what it had cost me to acquire my art , he would also have known that it would break any collector to buy it .
Harris and I had been hard at work on our German during several weeks at that time , and although we had made good progress , it had been accomplished under great difficulty and annoyance , for three of our teachers had died in the mean time .
A person who has not studied German can form no idea of what a perplexing language it is .
Surely there is not another language that is so slipshod and systemless , and so slippery and elusive to the grasp .
One is washed about in it , hither and thither , in the most helpless way ; and when at last he thinks he has captured a rule which offers firm ground to take a rest on amid the general rage and turmoil of the ten parts of speech , he turns over the page and reads , " Let the pupil make careful note of the following exceptions . "
He runs his eye down and finds that there are more exceptions to the rule than instances of it .
So overboard he goes again , to hunt for another Ararat and find another quicksand .
Such has been , and continues to be , my experience .
Every time I think I have got one of these four confusing " cases " where I am master of it , a seemingly insignificant preposition intrudes itself into my sentence , clothed with an awful and unsuspected power , and crumbles the ground from under me .
For instance , my book inquires after a certain bird -- ( it is always inquiring after things which are of no sort of consequence to anybody ) : " Where is the bird ? "
Now the answer to this question -- according to the book -- is that the bird is waiting in the blacksmith shop on account of the rain .
Of course no bird would do that , but then you must stick to the book .
Very well , I begin to cipher out the German for that answer .
I begin at the wrong end , necessarily , for that is the German idea .
I say to myself , " Regen ( rain ) is masculine -- or maybe it is feminine -- or possibly neuter -- it is too much trouble to look now .
Therefore , it is either der ( the ) Regen , or die ( the ) Regen , or das ( the ) Regen , according to which gender it may turn out to be when I look .
In the interest of science , I will cipher it out on the hypothesis that it is masculine .
Very well -- then the rain is der Regen , if it is simply in the quiescent state of being mentioned , without enlargement or discussion -- Nominative case ; but if this rain is lying around , in a kind of a general way on the ground , it is then definitely located , it is doing something -- that is , resting ( which is one of the German grammar 's ideas of doing something ) , and this throws the rain into the Dative case , and makes it dem Regen .
However , this rain is not resting , but is doing something actively , -- it is falling -- to interfere with the bird , likely -- and this indicates movement , which has the effect of sliding it into the Accusative case and changing dem Regen into den Regen . "
Having completed the grammatical horoscope of this matter , I answer up confidently and state in German that the bird is staying in the blacksmith shop " wegen ( on account of ) den Regen . "
Then the teacher lets me softly down with the remark that whenever the word " wegen " drops into a sentence , it always throws that subject into the Genitive case , regardless of consequences -- and that therefore this bird stayed in the blacksmith shop " wegen des Regens . "
N. B. -- I was informed , later , by a higher authority , that there was an " exception " which permits one to say " wegen den Regen " in certain peculiar and complex circumstances , but that this exception is not extended to anything but rain .
There are ten parts of speech , and they are all troublesome .
An average sentence , in a German newspaper , is a sublime and impressive curiosity ; it occupies a quarter of a column ; it contains all the ten parts of speech -- not in regular order , but mixed ; it is built mainly of compound words constructed by the writer on the spot , and not to be found in any dictionary -- six or seven words compacted into one , without joint or seam -- that is , without hyphens ; it treats of fourteen or fifteen different subjects , each inclosed in a parenthesis of its own , with here and there extra parentheses which reinclose three or four of the minor parentheses , making pens within pens : finally , all the parentheses and reparentheses are massed together between a couple of king - parentheses , one of which is placed in the first line of the majestic sentence and the other in the middle of the last line of it -- after which comes the VERB , and you find out for the first time what the man has been talking about ; and after the verb -- merely by way of ornament , as far as I can make out -- the writer shovels in " haben sind gewesen gehabt haben geworden sein , " or words to that effect , and the monument is finished .
I suppose that this closing hurrah is in the nature of the flourish to a man 's signature -- not necessary , but pretty .
German books are easy enough to read when you hold them before the looking - glass or stand on your head -- so as to reverse the construction -- but I think that to learn to read and understand a German newspaper is a thing which must always remain an impossibility to a foreigner .
Yet even the German books are not entirely free from attacks of the Parenthesis distemper -- though they are usually so mild as to cover only a few lines , and therefore when you at last get down to the verb it carries some meaning to your mind because you are able to remember a good deal of what has gone before .
Now here is a sentence from a popular and excellent German novel -- which a slight parenthesis in it .
I will make a perfectly literal translation , and throw in the parenthesis - marks and some hyphens for the assistance of the reader -- though in the original there are no parenthesis - marks or hyphens , and the reader is left to flounder through to the remote verb the best way he can :
" But when he , upon the street , the ( in - satin - and - silk - covered - now - very - unconstrained - after - the - newest - fashioned - dressed ) government counselor 's wife met , " etc. , etc . [ 1 ]
1 . Wenn er aber auf der Strasse der in Sammt und Seide gehüllten jetzt sehr ungenirt nach der neusten Mode gekleideten Regierungsräthin begegnet .
That is from The Old Mamselle 's Secret , by Mrs. Marlitt .
And that sentence is constructed upon the most approved German model .
You observe how far that verb is from the reader 's base of operations ; well , in a German newspaper they put their verb away over on the next page ; and I have heard that sometimes after stringing along the exciting preliminaries and parentheses for a column or two , they get in a hurry and have to go to press without getting to the verb at all .
Of course , then , the reader is left in a very exhausted and ignorant state .
We have the Parenthesis disease in our literature , too ; and one may see cases of it every day in our books and newspapers : but with us it is the mark and sign of an unpracticed writer or a cloudy intellect , whereas with the Germans it is doubtless the mark and sign of a practiced pen and of the presence of that sort of luminous intellectual fog which stands for clearness among these people .
For surely it is not clearness -- it necessarily can't be clearness .
Even a jury would have penetration enough to discover that .
A writer 's ideas must be a good deal confused , a good deal out of line and sequence , when he starts out to say that a man met a counselor 's wife in the street , and then right in the midst of this so simple undertaking halts these approaching people and makes them stand still until he jots down an inventory of the woman 's dress .
That is manifestly absurd .
It reminds a person of those dentists who secure your instant and breathless interest in a tooth by taking a grip on it with the forceps , and then stand there and drawl through a tedious anecdote before they give the dreaded jerk .
Parentheses in literature and dentistry are in bad taste .
The Germans have another kind of parenthesis , which they make by splitting a verb in two and putting half of it at the beginning of an exciting chapter and the other half at the end of it .
Can any one conceive of anything more confusing than that ?
These things are called " separable verbs . "
The German grammar is blistered all over with separable verbs ; and the wider the two portions of one of them are spread apart , the better the author of the crime is pleased with his performance .
A favorite one is reiste ab -- which means departed .
Here is an example which I culled from a novel and reduced to English : " The trunks being now ready , he DE - after kissing his mother and sisters , and once more pressing to his bosom his adored Gretchen , who , dressed in simple white muslin , with a single tuberose in the ample folds of her rich brown hair , had tottered feebly down the stairs , still pale from the terror and excitement of the past evening , but longing to lay her poor aching head yet once again upon the breast of him whom she loved more dearly than life itself , PARTED . "
However , it is not well to dwell too much on the separable verbs .
One is sure to lose his temper early ; and if he sticks to the subject , and will not be warned , it will at last either soften his brain or petrify it .
Personal pronouns and adjectives are a fruitful nuisance in this language , and should have been left out .
For instance , the same sound , sie , means you , and it means she , and it means her , and it means it , and it means they , and it means them .
Think of the ragged poverty of a language which has to make one word do the work of six -- and a poor little weak thing of only three letters at that .
But mainly , think of the exasperation of never knowing which of these meanings the speaker is trying to convey .
This explains why , whenever a person says sie to me , I generally try to kill him , if a stranger .
Now observe the Adjective .
Here was a case where simplicity would have been an advantage ; therefore , for no other reason , the inventor of this language complicated it all he could .
When we wish to speak of our " good friend or friends , " in our enlightened tongue , we stick to the one form and have no trouble or hard feeling about it ; but with the German tongue it is different .
When a German gets his hands on an adjective , he declines it , and keeps on declining it until the common sense is all declined out of it .
It is as bad as Latin .
He says , for instance :
SINGULAR
Nominative -- Mein guter Freund , my good friend .
Genitive -- Meines guten Freundes , of my good friend .
Dative -- Meinem guten Freund , to my good friend .
Accusative -- Meinen guten Freund , my good friend .
PLURAL
N. -- Meine guten Freunde , my good friends .
G. -- Meiner guten Freunde , of my good friends .
D. -- Meinen guten Freunden , to my good friends .
A. -- Meine guten Freunde , my good friends .
Now let the candidate for the asylum try to memorize those variations , and see how soon he will be elected .
One might better go without friends in Germany than take all this trouble about them .
I have shown what a bother it is to decline a good ( male ) friend ; well this is only a third of the work , for there is a variety of new distortions of the adjective to be learned when the object is feminine , and still another when the object is neuter .
Now there are more adjectives in this language than there are black cats in Switzerland , and they must all be as elaborately declined as the examples above suggested .
Difficult ? -- troublesome ? -- these words cannot describe it .
I heard a Californian student in Heidelberg say , in one of his calmest moods , that he would rather decline two drinks than one German adjective .
The inventor of the language seems to have taken pleasure in complicating it in every way he could think of .
For instance , if one is casually referring to a house , Haus , or a horse , Pferd , or a dog , Hund , he spells these words as I have indicated ; but if he is referring to them in the Dative case , he sticks on a foolish and unnecessary e and spells them Hause , Pferde , Hunde .
So , as an added e often signifies the plural , as the s does with us , the new student is likely to go on for a month making twins out of a Dative dog before he discovers his mistake ; and on the other hand , many a new student who could ill afford loss , has bought and paid for two dogs and only got one of them , because he ignorantly bought that dog in the Dative singular when he really supposed he was talking plural -- which left the law on the seller 's side , of course , by the strict rules of grammar , and therefore a suit for recovery could not lie .
In German , all the Nouns begin with a capital letter .
Now that is a good idea ; and a good idea , in this language , is necessarily conspicuous from its lonesomeness .
I consider this capitalizing of nouns a good idea , because by reason of it you are almost always able to tell a noun the minute you see it .
You fall into error occasionally , because you mistake the name of a person for the name of a thing , and waste a good deal of time trying to dig a meaning out of it .
German names almost always do mean something , and this helps to deceive the student .
I translated a passage one day , which said that " the infuriated tigress broke loose and utterly ate up the unfortunate fir forest " ( Tannenwald ) .
When I was girding up my loins to doubt this , I found out that Tannenwald in this instance was a man 's name .
Every noun has a gender , and there is no sense or system in the distribution ; so the gender of each must be learned separately and by heart .
There is no other way .
To do this one has to have a memory like a memorandum - book .
In German , a young lady has no sex , while a turnip has .
Think what overwrought reverence that shows for the turnip , and what callous disrespect for the girl .
See how it looks in print -- I translate this from a conversation in one of the best of the German Sunday - school books :
" Gretchen .
Wilhelm , where is the turnip ?
Wilhelm .
She has gone to the kitchen .
Gretchen .
Where is the accomplished and beautiful English maiden ?
Wilhelm .
It has gone to the opera . "
To continue with the German genders : a tree is male , its buds are female , its leaves are neuter ; horses are sexless , dogs are male , cats are female -- tomcats included , of course ; a person 's mouth , neck , bosom , elbows , fingers , nails , feet , and body are of the male sex , and his head is male or neuter according to the word selected to signify it , and not according to the sex of the individual who wears it -- for in Germany all the women either male heads or sexless ones ; a person 's nose , lips , shoulders , breast , hands , and toes are of the female sex ; and his hair , ears , eyes , chin , legs , knees , heart , and conscience have n't any sex at all .
The inventor of the language probably got what he knew about a conscience from hearsay .
Now , by the above dissection , the reader will see that in Germany a man may think he is a man , but when he comes to look into the matter closely , he is bound to have his doubts ; he finds that in sober truth he is a most ridiculous mixture ; and if he ends by trying to comfort himself with the thought that he can at least depend on a third of this mess as being manly and masculine , the humiliating second thought will quickly remind him that in this respect he is no better off than any woman or cow in the land .
In the German it is true that by some oversight of the inventor of the language , a Woman is a female ; but a Wife ( Weib ) is not -- which is unfortunate .
A Wife , here , has no sex ; she is neuter ; so , according to the grammar , a fish is he , his scales are she , but a fishwife is neither .
To describe a wife as sexless may be called under - description ; that is bad enough , but over - description is surely worse .
A German speaks of an Englishman as the Engländer ; to change the sex , he adds inn , and that stands for Englishwoman -- Engländerinn .
That seems descriptive enough , but still it is not exact enough for a German ; so he precedes the word with that article which indicates that the creature to follow is feminine , and writes it down thus : " die Engländerinn , " -- which means " the she - Englishwoman . "
I consider that that person is over - described .
Well , after the student has learned the sex of a great number of nouns , he is still in a difficulty , because he finds it impossible to persuade his tongue to refer to things as " he " and " she , " and " him " and " her , " which it has been always accustomed to refer to it as " it . "
When he even frames a German sentence in his mind , with the hims and hers in the right places , and then works up his courage to the utterance - point , it is no use -- the moment he begins to speak his tongue flies the track and all those labored males and females come out as " its . "
And even when he is reading German to himself , he always calls those things " it , " where as he ought to read in this way :
Back to German .

For what one expert thought was the first time , the number of monthly foreclosures exceeded the number of monthly home sales in California in January , according to data compiled by two research companies .
The data is a grim reflection of the worsening housing market , as the number of homeowners who ca n’t or wo n’t make their payments rises and the number of home buyers dwindles .
ForeclosureRadar , a Discovery Bay real estate research firm , said 19,821 California homes went into foreclosure in January , representing about $ 8 billion in home loans .
Meanwhile , DataQuick reported 19,145 home and condo sales in January .
In December , there were 12,783 foreclosures , according to ForeclosureRadar , and 25,585 home and condo sales , according to DataQuick .
Sean O’Toole of ForeclosureRadar said he doubts there has ever been another time when the number of foreclosures exceeded the number of sales in a month .
DataQuick ’s numbers are for closed transactions that occurred in January .
ForeclosureRadar uses its own proprietary method of gathering foreclosure data .
“ There ’s no way a market that slow can clear these kinds of foreclosures , ” said Christopher Thornberg of Beacon Economics , a Bay Area research and consulting firm .
“ What that number says to me is you have more homes getting dumped on the market in terms of foreclosures than there is demand for homes . ”
Like other fathers and sons , Douglas Gentile and his father have spent many hours arguing about video games .
What makes them different is that Douglas , an Iowa State University assistant professor of psychology , is one of the country 's top researchers on the effects of media on children .
His father , J. Ronald Gentile , is a leading researcher on effective teaching and a distinguished teaching professor emeritus of educational psychology at the University of Buffalo , State University of New York .
Through their discussions , they realized that video games use the same techniques that really great teachers use .
" That realization prompted us to ask the question , ' Should we therefore be surprised that violent video games could teach aggression to players ? ' " said Doug Gentile , who is also director of research for the National Institute on Media and the Family .
Violent video games teach aggression
The Gentiles decided to test that hypothesis .
Through a study of nearly 2,500 youths , they found that video games are indeed effective teaching tools .
Students who played multiple violent video games actually learned through those games to produce greater hostile actions and aggressive behaviors over a span of six months .
" We know a lot about how to be an effective teacher , and we know a lot about how to use technology to teach , " said lead author Douglas Gentile .
" Video games use many of these techniques and are highly effective teachers .
So we should n't be surprised that violent video games can teach aggression . "
The paper presents conceptual and empirical analyses of several of the " best practices " of learning and instruction , and demonstrates how violent video games use those practices effectively to teach aggression .
It documents how violent video games motivate learners to persevere in learning and mastering skills to navigate through complex problems and changing environments -- just like good teachers do .

The study describes seven parallels between video games and effective teachers , including the ability to adapt to the level of each individual learner -- requiring practice distributed across time -- and teaching for transfer to real - world situations .
Studying nearly 2,500 youths
To test their hypothesis , the Gentiles studied three groups of youths -- 430 third through fifth - graders ; 607 eighth and ninth graders ; and 1,441 older adolescents with an average age of 19 .
Elementary and middle school children were recruited from nine Minnesota schools , and older adolescents from Iowa State University .
In the longitudinal elementary school sample , students , their peers , and their teachers completed surveys at two points during the school year .
The surveys assessed the subject 's aggressive thoughts and self - reported fights , and their media habits -- including violent video game exposure .
Teachers and peers were also asked to rate the participants ' aggressive behavior .
Controlling for age , race , sex , total amount of time spent playing all video games , and prior aggressive behaviors , the research found that the amount of rated violence in the games played predicted increased aggression .
Among elementary students , playing multiple violent video games increased their risk of being highly aggressive -- as rated by peers and teachers -- by 73 percent , when compared to those who played a mix of violent and non-violent games , and by 263 percent compared to those who played only non-violent games .

" Because we had longitudinal data , we were able to show that students who play multiple violent games actually changed to have a greater hostile attribution bias , which also increased their aggressive behaviors over prior levels , " the researchers wrote .
And because learning occurs from video games , regardless of whether the effects are intentional or unintentional , the Gentiles added that this " should make us more thoughtful about designing games and choosing games for children and adolescents to play . "
But this study is not all bad news for video game technology .
Because video games were found to be such effective teaching tools , the Gentiles propose greater educational use of today 's smarter technology found in those games -- technology that " thinks " along with students , adapting instruction to each student 's current skills , strategies or mistakes .
While some schools are already incorporating this type of educational programming , the researchers report that it 's not widely used .
The authors urge educators not to wait for more advancement before using such technology with students in the classroom .
They co-authored a paper on their research titled " Violent Video Games as Exemplary Teachers : A Conceptual Analysis , " which will be published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Youth and Adolescence .
It is already available online to the journal 's subscribers .
At Tableau , a key cultural value is to “ eat our own dogfood ” .
Over the last several years , we ’ve had an on - going internal project ( “ Project ALPO ” ) focused on connecting Tableau to our own operational data , ranging from SalesForce CRM data to Fogbugz defect data , to data from our Cisco router .
Not only has this given us the typical benefits of improving the team ’s familiarity with the product , getting usability feedback , and finding bugs , but it has also enabled us to reap the benefits of analyzing our business ’s core metrics .
As a developer , usability fanatic , and Tableau co-founder , I ’ve been fascinated by several aspects of our Project ALPO to use our own products .
One of the most interesting elements has been to watch how each employee ’s perspective on data and its utility to their day - to - day job changes as they use the product .
There are two findings I ’ve seen with most new users :
1. People do n’t know what questions to ask of their data .
Most tools for asking questions of data are difficult to use and require a heavy investment for each new question .
As a result , people rarely venture to ask new questions and invest little time thinking about what questions they would ask if they could .
People stumble a bit with the possibilities :
The blank palette can be intimidating at first .
But then , they start asking simple questions ( “ How many bugs do I have open ? ” ) .
When the answers come easily , they venture to ask more sophisticated questions evolving into rapid - fire Q&A sessions with their data ( “ How rapidly are bugs verified and closed after being resolved ? ” , “ What percentage of revenue this quarter is due to new business compared to previous quarters ? ” ) .
It is an exciting process to witness .
2. Visual analytics ?
I ’ll take a text table , thanks .
The transition to visual analytics is incremental .
Tableau is really two tools in one : ( a ) an easy to use tool for Q&A with your data and ( b ) a data visualization tool .
Most people start using it for the former and then incrementally venture into using it for the latter .
People start by simply recreating the reports they can already generate , simply gaining the benefits of quicker and easier answers .
But for almost every use , they slowly venture into visual analytics .
One day they take their traditional text table and drop a metric on color , highlighting the anomalies .
A week later , they tweak the table , transforming it to a tabular bar chart , communicating the same data as before but new information starts to jump out .
Then they create a new sheet with a whole new view of their data and soon they are experts in the process of visual analytics and seeing their data like never before .
Over the next several weeks , I ’ll author several blog posts outlining how we ’ve connected Tableau to numerous common data sources .
For this post , I ’m focusing on a data source that I care deeply about , our defect - tracking system Fogbugz .
I ’ll follow up soon with a posting about SalesForce.com and our evolving use of visualization in our analytics process .

SpeedswitchXP - CPU frequency control for notebooks running Windows XP News SpeedswitchXP version 1.52 is out ( 28 . August 2006 ) .
I 've made the following changes to version 1.51 : support for multiple languages ( currently english and german ) reincluded the source code in the distribution file Download For donations for future developments and for hosting efforts click here : SpeedswitchXP V1.52 ( 787 KB )
Primary download site ( Germany )
The previous version 1.4 can be downloaded from here .
General info SpeedswitchXP is a small applet that sits in the system tray and allows dynamic switching of the frequencies of mobile Intel and mobile AMD CPUs under Windows XP .
During the development of Windows XP , Microsoft decided to integrate dynamic frequency switching into the operating system itself .
On a default Windows XP installation , the power schemes in the power settings of the system panel control the frequencies of the processor .
On Windows 2000 and previous operating systems , it was possible to manually control the CPU frequencies with a SpeedStep applet provided by Intel , but this is not possible anymore under Windows XP .
It is not very good documented what the different Windows XP power schemes do and it is impossible to fully adjust the schemes as the important settings are not accessible through the control panel .
SpeedswitchXP tries to fill this gap in that it provides access to ALL power scheme settings .
This small applet is similar in functionality to the native Intel SpeedStep applet for Windows 9x / ME and Windows 2000 but with a few more options .
Basically all it does is creating a power scheme under the power settings in the system panel and making this the default power scheme for Windows XP .
When this is done , you can control all settings of this new scheme through the applet .
Since this program is using Windows XP 's internal processor performance control functions , it should work on all notebooks that feature dynamic speed switching .
So far , it has been successfully tested on notebooks with the following mobile CPUs : CPU type Tested notebooks Mobile Pentium III - M Dell Inspiron 4100 / 8100 , Dell Latitude C610 / C810 Mobile Pentium 4 - M Dell Inspiron 8200/8500 , Dell Latitude C840 Mobile Pentium 4 Dell Inspiron 5150 Mobile Pentium M / Centrino IBM Thinkpad T40 / T40 p , Dell Latitude D800 Intel Core Solo / Duo Dell Inspiron E1705/9400 Mobile AMD Athlon XP Peacock Freeliner XP , Fujitsu - Siemens Amilo A x600
Crash course for program usage
After starting the program , it automatically minimizes itself into the system tray .
It can be identified by one of four different icons which indicate the current CPU policy : Icon CPU policy means ... Max . performance keeps the CPU at maximum speed ( i.e. a Pentium - M 1.6 GHz runs at 1.6 GHz continously )
Battery optimized keeps the CPU at the lower speed ( i.e. a Pentium - M 1.6 GHz runs at 600 MHz continously ) Max .
battery Keeps the CPU at the lower speed and allows further throttling depending on remaining battery power Dynamic switching switches between the lower and maximum speed according to current CPU utilization ( i.e. a Pentium - M 1.6GHz switches automatically between 600 MHz and 1.6 GHz )
If you move the mouse pointer over the tray icon , you see the current CPU policies for AC ( external power ) and DC ( battery power ) in a small popup window : A rightclick on the tray icon opens a small window which allows fast switching between the different CPU policies :
When changing the CPU policy , the tray icon changes automatically to reflect the new CPU policy .
A leftclick on the tray icon opens the main window .
It looks like this :
On the main window , you can change the CPU policies for both external and battery power .
The program automatically switches between the external and battery CPU policies when a power state change occurs ( pulling the AC plug or plugging it back in ) .
You can also adjust the main power options here like display timeouts , HD spindown timeouts , etc. Clicking on ' Detect max .
speed ' activates the detection of the CPU 's maximum speed .
This process takes approximately two seconds .
Clicking on the options button shows the options window :
These options have the following meaning : Enable Autostart Activates the autostart functionality .
When activated , the program will be started automatically on every boot .
Enable Debugmode Activates the debug mode .
When in this mode , the program writes runtime log messages to the log file " SpeedswitchXP.log " .
Minimize To Tray ...
When activating this option , the program will be minimized to the tray instead of shutting down when clicking on the ' Close ' button .
Reactivate previus power scheme when terminating Reactivates the power scheme that was active at program start when the program is terminated .
Check power scheme integrity Checks the power scheme " Speedswitch Control " on the given interval for changes from outside the program .
When detecting a change , the program restores the power scheme settings to its original values .
Read CPU speed Activates the CPU speed detection in certain intervals .
The CPU speed can be detected by two methods : receiving the current speed from Windows XP ( ' Ask Windows about speed ' ) or calculating the current speed in realtime ( ' Realtime speed calculation ' ) .
You can also enable a separate tray icon which shows the CPU speed by enabling the option ' Show in tray icon ' .
Read CPU load Detects the current CPU load in certain intervals .
You can also enable a separate tray icon which shows the CPU speed by enabling the option ' Show in tray icon ' .
If both these options here and for the CPU speed are activated then there 's only one icon showing the speed in its upper part and the load in its lower part .
Show history diagram Displays the detected CPU speeds and loads in the history diagram on the main window .
The CPU speed is displayed in 100MHz units and can be scaled to get a clearer speed display .
Show battery level in tray Displays an additional tray icon which shows the remaining battery capacity :
The program can display the battery icon only when the system runs from battery ( ' Only when on battery power ' ) or when running both from AC or battery .
The value shown in the tray icon can be either the remaining battery charge in % or the remaining battery time in minutes .
When moving the mouse pointer over the tray icon , both values are shown in a small popup window : .
The option ' Indicate battery charging status ' shows a charging battery icon if the battery is currently being charged .
In this mode , the icon automatically displays the remaining battery charge in percent so you can observe the charging status :
Update interval Determines the update interval for the CPU speed , CPU load , and battery capacity detection .
The ' User policy ' , ' Machine policy ' and ' CPU policy ' tabs take you to the internal settings of the power scheme .
Before you make any changes to these internal settings you should teach yourself on their internal functionality .
I suggest that you read these documents to fully understand their meaning : Windows XP native processor performance control
User policy settings
Machine policy settings
CPU policy settings
If you want to know even more about processor control and C - states then take a look at these sites : ACPI specification 2.0a
Microsoft ACPI / Power Management site Clicking on the ' Show system info ' button on the main window brings up a window showing some info about the CPU and your system 's power capabilities :
The second window tab shows your system 's power capabilites :

The laptop was designed to be robust and easy to use
In late November I returned from Nigeria with a sample of the XO laptop .
The computer , made by the One Laptop per Child charity , is a robust little machine designed to entertain and educate children while allowing them to learn by themselves .
I knew there was only one person who could review it for me .
The Nine Year - old's View
Enter Rufus Cellan - Jones .
He is nine , has far more experience of games consoles than computers , and has strong views on most matters .
" Looks fun , " was his only comment when I handed over the small , green and white laptop , explaining that he was the only child in Britain to have one .
I use the calculator - that can be rather useful for sums .
You can even browse onto the internet .
You can watch and learn stuff .
Rufus Cellan- Jones
Rufus ' review
But very quickly he was up and running .
All I did was give him the security code for our home wireless network so he could take the XO online .
The rest he figured out for himself , as he explains :
Lots of fun
" I just seemed to work it out .
It was rather easy .
I did n't even need help . "
Surprise , surprise , his first discovery was a game .
" I found Block Party .
It 's like Tetris .
I 'm now up to Level 7 . "
I thought my young games fanatic might stick there but he moved on .
" Then I discovered paint .
You can use pencils , change the texture , use different sizes of brush . "
Even better , there was an animation programme called Etoys .
" That 's my favourite .
You make things .
You can see tutorials and demos .
Then you can make a new project .
I 've made a crazy UFO which you can move . "
But Rufus says it is n't just about play .
" I use the calculator - that can be rather useful for sums .
You can even browse onto the internet .
You can watch and learn stuff .
You can write things and it can also remind you which is extremely useful . "
What , I asked , does a nine year old need to remind himself about ?
" Christmas stuff , " he said , with an air of mystery .
Social networking
But the real surprise came one evening , when Rufus asked me to explain what his friends were telling him on the laptop .
I thought those imaginary childhood friends from years back must have returned .
But I went and had a look - and it was true - he appeared to be chatting online .
So how had he managed that ?
" You go on " neighbourhood " , then you go to the chat thing .
" You go on Nigeria and you chat to them . "
But why , if he was online with the children at the Nigerian school I had visited , were they sending messages in Spanish ?
I decided he must be linking up with one of the South American schools taking part in the OLPC project but we still are n't sure quite how that is happening .
Still , Rufus is widening his social circle .
" I have three friends .
It 's nice to talk to them .
They do n't speak much English but I can understand them . "
The conversation is not exactly sparkling , but Rufus has learned to say " Hola " .
Not a toy
So Rufus is using his laptop to write , paint , make music , explore the internet , and talk to children from other countries .
Because it looks rather like a simple plastic toy , I had thought it might suffer the same fate as the radio - controlled dinosaur or the roller - skates he got last Christmas - enjoyed for a day or two , then ignored .
Instead , it seems to provide enduring fascination .
Laptop pupils give their views
In detail
I had returned from Nigeria not entirely convinced that the XO laptop was quite as wonderful an educational tool as its creators claimed .
I felt that a lot of effort would be needed by hard - pressed teachers before it became more than just a distracting toy for the children to mess around with in class .
But Rufus has changed my mind .
With no help from his Dad , he has learned far more about computers than he knew a couple of weeks ago , and the XO appears to be a more creative tool than the games consoles which occupy rather too much of his time .
The One Laptop Per Child project is struggling to convince developing countries providing computers for children is as important as giving them basic facilities like water or electricity .
Unusually , Rufus does not have an opinion about that controversy , but he does have a verdict on the laptop .
" It 's great , " he says .
How humiliating .
The story begins with the shameful case of Maher Arar , a Syrian - born Canadian who was kidnapped by U.S. agents as he changed planes in New York in 2002 and rendered to Syria , where he was tortured for a year on behalf of the American authorities before being released .
Arar  who was awarded millions of dollars in compensation by the Canadian government in January 2007 , but has yet to receive even an apology from the U.S. government  had been wrongly fingered by Canadian intelligence , and his case his one of many chilling examples of the damage caused by failed intelligence in the American program of " extraordinary rendition . "
In an attempt to prime diplomats about how to spot the signs of torture when they visit Canadians in foreign jails , the Canadian government ’s Foreign Affairs Department instigated a " torture awareness workshop , " which also informed the diplomats of where they could expect to find what CTV in Canada described as " countries and places with greater risks of torture . "
The list , in a training manual issued by the Foreign Affairs Department , included traditional offenders  Afghanistan , China , Egypt , Iran , Mexico , Saudi Arabia , and Syria  but also included some torturers that are not generally mentioned in polite Western company : Israel and the United States .
Specific mention was made of Guantánamo Bay , where , to drive the point home , the manual noted specific " U.S. interrogation techniques , " including " forced nudity , isolation , and sleep deprivation . "
Oops .
The manual was never supposed to have been publicly released , of course , but the Canadian government inadvertently released it to lawyers for Amnesty International as evidence in a court case relating to the alleged abuse of Afghan detainees , after they were handed over by Canadian soldiers to the local Afghan authorities .
After realizing their mistake , government officials desperately tried to get the manual back , stating , as CTV put it bluntly , that they " wanted to black out sensitive parts that may anger allies . "
It ’s too late for that , of course .
While U.S. Ambassador David Wilkins declared , " We find it to be offensive for us to be on the same list with countries like Iran and China , " adding , " Quite frankly it ’s absurd , " lawyers and human rights activists have seized upon the documents to insist , for the second time in only a few months , that the Canadian government is guilty of double standards in its refusal to act on behalf of Omar Khadr , the Canadian Guantánamo detainee who was just 15 years old when he was captured in Afghanistan in July 2002 .
And they ’re right to do so .
The first set of double standards was highlighted in September , when , during a visit to Canada to publicize Khadr ’s plight , his U.S. military lawyer , Lt. Cmdr.
William Kuebler , contrasted the Canadian government ’s " leadership in international efforts to recognize child soldiers as victims in need of special protection and rehabilitation " with its " virtual silence " in the case of his client .
Just two weeks ago , David Crane , the former U.S. prosecutor for Sierra Leone ’s war crimes trials , now a professor at Syracuse University , revived this argument , telling Michelle Shephard of the Toronto Star that he failed to understand how Canada and the United States " could be sympathetic to the plight of Africa ’s child soldiers , who are forced to commit atrocious crimes , " but not to Khadr , whose circumstances were the same .
" I ’m just not sure why the Canadian government , which was tremendously important in my work in West Africa  they were incredibly supportive  is not making a bigger deal of this , " he said .
This latest revelation only adds to the government ’s self - inflicted woes .
As Amir Attaran , a law professor at the University of Ottawa , explained to CTV , the new developments cast doubt on the government ’s assertion that Khadr is being treated fairly in U.S. custody .
" Canada has just admitted we believe torture is possible in Guantánamo Bay , " he told the broadcaster ’s Canada AM show .
" That clashes terribly with what Prime Minister Stephen Harper has said , that Mr. Khadr , who is in Guantánamo Bay and was a child at the time he was put there , is being given a ( quote , unquote ) appropriate judicial process .
Torture is not an appropriate judicial process . "
Attaran went on to suggest that the Canadian government ’s refusal to demand Khadr ’s release from Guantánamo was purely political .
" Out of a desire to appear tough on the war on terror , Mr. Harper has put this set of considerations out the window , and that ’s not appropriate , " he said , adding , " We have to obey the law . "
Lt. Cmdr. Kuebler also spoke to CTV , reinforcing Amir Attaran ’s statement that the documents relating to the " torture awareness workshop " contradict Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s assurances that Khadr is receiving fair treatment .
" Omar has been there for five and a half years , " he said , " and at some point in the course of [ his ] detention the Canadian government developed the suspicion he was being tortured and abused .
And yet it has not acted to obtain his release from Guantánamo Bay and protect his rights , unlike every other Western country that has had its nationals detained in Guantánamo Bay . "
Kuebler added that the suspicions that his client has been tortured at Guantánamo undermined any claims that he could receive a fair trial in his military commission  the novel system of show trials invented by Dick Cheney and his advisers in November 2001 , whose rampant lawlessness is discussed at length here .
Kuebler explained that he and the rest of his legal team want Khadr to be sent back to Canada to face justice there , and he pointed out the absurdity of the Canadian government ’s claims that they were waiting for the U.S. judicial process to play itself out .
" Omar has certainly been abused , his rights have been violated under international law , and apparently the Canadian government has reason to believe that ’s true , and yet , they ’ve acted not at all to assist him , " he told CTV .
While the Canadian government attempts to repair its relations with the United States and Israel , the next phase of Omar Khadr ’s trial by military commission is scheduled to take place early next month , and several motions have already been filed on his behalf .
One argues that the commissions are unconstitutional because they are designed only for non-Americans , and another  relating specifically to Khadr  argues that they have no jurisdiction over him because trying a detainee who was 15 years old at the time of his capture would violate the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict , a United Nations measure ratified by the United States in 2002 , which safeguards juveniles ( those under 18 years old ) from prosecution .
As his lawyers have pointed out , " No international criminal tribunal established under the laws of war , from Nuremberg forward , has ever prosecuted former child soldiers as war criminals , " adding that , if commission judge Col .
Peter Brownback pursues Khadr ’s case , he will be " the first in Western history " to preside over a trial of alleged war crimes committed by a child .
Adding to the Canadian government ’s embarrassment , at almost the same time that the contents of the Canadian government ’s training manual were made public , it was revealed that 55 law professors and 22 members of Parliament , including Canada ’s former attorney general , Irwin Cotler , had signed the defense lawyers ’ motion , stating unequivocally , " It is a principle of customary international law that children are to be accorded special protections in all criminal proceedings , and in any prosecution for participation in warlike acts . "
In the pipeline , undoubtedly , are numerous references to the Canadian government ’s latest gaffe , in documents to be filed by Omar Khadr ’s lawyers , which would be laughable if the result of the government ’s contradictions and cowardice were not so heartless .
You could ask Omar Khadr himself , if you could get anywhere near him .
For more information about Omar Khadr , the military commissions , and " extraordinary rendition , " see my book The Guantánamo Files : The Stories of the 774 Detainees in America ’s Illegal Prison .
In the first counterterrorism strategy of its kind in the nation , roving teams of New York City police officers armed with automatic rifles and accompanied by bomb - sniffing dogs will patrol the city ’s subway system daily , beginning next month , officials said on Friday .
Under a tactical plan called Operation Torch , the officers will board trains and patrol platforms , focusing on sites like Pennsylvania Station , Herald Square , Columbus Circle , Rockefeller Center and Times Square in Manhattan , and Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn .
Officials said the operation would begin in March .
Financing for the program will be funneled to the Police Department and will come from a pool of up to $ 30 million taken from $ 153.2 million in new federal transit grants to the state .
Michael Chertoff , the secretary of homeland security , and Gov. Eliot Spitzer announced the grants at a news conference on Friday at Grand Central Terminal , where Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly outlined his plans to add a layer of security to the city ’s 24 - hour transit system .
A US military study officially acknowledged for the first time yesterday that Saddam Hussein had no direct ties to al - Qaida , undercutting the Bush administration 's central case for war with Iraq .
The Pentagon study based on more than 600,000 documents recovered after US and UK troops toppled Hussein in 2003 , discovered " no ' smoking gun ' ( ie , direct connection ) between Saddam 's Iraq and al - Qaida " , its authors wrote .
George Bush and his senior aides have made numerous attempts to link Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda terror in their justification for waging war against Iraq .
Wary of embarrassing press coverage noting that the new study debunks those claims , the US defence department attempted to bury the release of the report yesterday .
The Pentagon cancelled a planned briefing on the study and scrapped plans to post its findings on the internet , ABC news reported .
Unclassified copies of the study would be sent to interested individuals in the mail , military officials told the network .
Another Pentagon official told ABC that initial press reports on the study made it " too politically sensitive " .
As early as 2002 , military intelligence analysts discounted the administration 's claim that the Hussein government had trained al - Qaida members to employ chemical weapons .
But Bush aides continued asserting that the intelligence they received showed a link .
" The reason I keep insisting that there was a relationship between Iraq and Saddam and al - Qaida : because there was a relationship between Iraq and al - Qaida , " Bush said in 2004 .
Government memos examined by US military researchers showed financial support given to " suicide bombers in Gaza and the West Bank " , the study continued .
The Hussein regime also recorded its development of car bombs and explosive vests in detail .
Despite those findings , the admission of no direct ties between the deceased dictator and al - Qaida makes the study a potential flashpoint for the Bush administration as it tries to play up signs of improving security in Iraq .
Next week marks the fifth anniversary of the invasion , and several high - profile remembrance events are planned in Washington .
The Pentagon 's independent auditor released a report last year that chastised an internal military office created by Bush allies for promoting a link between Hussein and al - Qaida despite intelligence showing that none existed .
Even after that report , however , vice president Dick Cheney continued saying that al - Qaida leader Abu Musab al - Zarqawi collaborated with Iraq .
Al - Zarqawi " took up residence there before we ever launched into Iraq , organized the al - Qaida operations inside Iraq before we even arrived on the scene , " Cheney told conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh in April .
The documents used for today 's study came from the so - called Harmony database , an expansive catalogue of al - Qaida evidence maintained by the military .
The Pentagon 's treatment of the report today echoes its response in 2005 to a study prepared by another research arm that chastised the White House for failing to prepare for the post - war reconstruction of Iraq .
Military officials deemed those conclusions " of a limited value " and decided to keep the study secret , the New York Times reported .
Authors of the study - conducted by the Institute for Defence Analyses , the military 's non-profit research arm , found evidence that the Hussein government supported some Palestinian terrorist groups but largely focused their attention on internal terrorist acts .
" The predominant targets of Iraqi state terror operations were Iraqi citizens , both inside and outside of Iraq , " the study 's executive summary concluded .

Visa plans to sell more than half of itself in IPO Picture this : Private equity firm buys Getty Images for $ 2B Electronic Arts offers nearly $ 2 billion for Take - Two BIGGEST U.S. IPOS BIGGEST U.S. IPOS Visa 's IPO would be the USA 's biggest , topping these .
Issuer Issue date IPO proceeds * AT&T Wireless
4/26/2000 $ 10.6 Kraft Foods
6/12/2001 $ 8.7 UPS
11/9/1999 $ 5.5 CIT Group 7/1/2002 $ 4.9 Blackstone Group 6/21/2007 $ 4.8 Conoco
10/21/1998 $ 4.4 Travelers Property Casualty 3/21/2002 $ 4.3 Agere Systems 3/27/2001 $ 4.1 Charter Communications
11/8/1999 $ 3.7 Goldman Sachs 5/3/1999 $ 3.7 * in billions Source : Thomson Financial Visa is hoping investors will open their wallets and shell out more than $ 16 billion for what 's expected to be the biggest U.S. IPO ever .
More than three months after filing plans for an initial public offering , the leading credit card processor Monday provided the much - awaited price and number of shares it expects to sell in its IPO .
Q&A : How does Visa make money ; how does it rank among competitors ?
Specifically , Visa plans to sell 406 million shares , or a little more than half the company , for $ 37 to $ 42 a share .
If Visa pulls it off , its IPO will top the $ 10.6 billion raised by AT&T Wireless ( T ) in April 2000 , which had been the biggest U.S. IPO , says Thomson Financial .
( TOC ) Visa would also rank as the third - largest global IPO , behind the $ 22.0 billion IPO of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in October 2006 and the $ 18.1 billion NTT Mobile raised in October 1998 .
" It 's huge .
A lot of people will be watching it to see if it gets done , " says Joel Greenberg , partner at law firm Kaye Scholer .
If things go as planned , shares of Visa should be trading by the week of March 19 .
The IPO is expected to garner attention because it is : • A much - needed boost for the ailing IPO market .
So far this year , just 18 companies pulled off their IPOs , down 47 % from the same period last year , Renaissance Capital ( RCG ) says .
Amid a choppy broad market , IPOs in general this year are down 16 % , Renaissance says .
" It 's a big deal being done in a bad market , " says Renaissance 's Kathy Smith .
• Conjuring memories of MasterCard 's IPO .
Visa is larger than MasterCard ( MA ) and processed about 60 % of total transactions in 2006 , according to Visa 's regulatory filing .
MasterCard is second with 39 % .
But investors hope Visa 's stock will do as well as MasterCard's .
MasterCard shares have soared more than 400 % from their initial price of $ 39 in May 2006 .
MasterCard shares fell $ 5.03 to $ 198.45 Monday .
Visa is n't a screaming bargain like MasterCard was , says Francis Gaskins of IPOdesktop .
Visa 's price - earnings ratio ( stock price divided by earnings per share ) , based on the middle of its price range , is 30 times its annualized fiscal fourth - quarter earnings , he says .
That 's well above MasterCard 's 21 P - E now and its 11 P - E at its IPO , Gaskins says .
" Is this another MasterCard ?
The answer is no , " he says .
Plus , the sheer size of Visa is n't the makings of an explosive IPO , says Jay Ritter , professor of finance at the University of Florida .
There are also concerns consumers may slow their spending , and keep their plastic put away , if the economy weakens .
Even so , the IPO could be a much - needed windfall for Wall Street .
Visa is owned by banks that could use the cash to help make up for soured bets on mortgages .
JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America and Citigroup are among the biggest owners of Visa .
These sellers are selling 51 % of the company , which is a high percentage to sell at one time , Ritter says , adding that companies sold just 31 % of themselves in IPOs last year .
The banks selling their shares will raise more than $ 10 billion from the IPO , Gaskins says .
That capital is welcome amid a credit crunch .
" This is a good time to get some of this cash , " Ritter says .

John McCain ’s virtually certain victory in the Republican Party ’s presidential contest has led to scrutiny of his conservative credentials .
The heated campaign debate between McCain and his former rival Gov. Mitt Romney about who was a less authentic conservative did more damage to Romney than to McCain because of McCain ’s long - standing ability to draw upon moderate Republicans and independent voters in prior elections and in the primaries .
That aspect of McCain ’s appeal has raised questions about whether his “ straight talk ” reputation for creative dissent amounted to “ flip - flopping ” on conservative principles .
It made McCain the target of harsh criticism from talk radio guru Rush Limbaugh and columnist Ann Coulter , both famous for their flamboyant brand of conservatism .
More important , it gave traction to one of McCain ’s two remaining challengers in the primaries , Gov. Mike Huckabee , who is drawing on fundamentalist religious conservatives to win in several solidly “ red ” states , mainly in the South .
The debate over McCain ’s conservatism is part of a broader , older argument among conservatives about what constitutes conservatism , an argument so heated that The Economist last year characterized it as a “ civil war . ”
The irony of this campaign season is that the only candidate who has consistently adhered to conservative principles , Rep. Ron Paul , has been largely ignored .
Paul ’s authenticity as a conservative is evident in his support for small government , fiscal and budgetary prudence , and  most obvious , given McCain ’s position on national security  for a strict non-interventionist approach to national defense .
This was evident in the Republican presidential candidates ’ CNN debate before Super Tuesday .
When asked by CNN ’s Anderson Cooper about whether the United States is in a recession and whether Americans are “ better off than we were eight years ago , ” when the Bush administration began , Paul gave a very conservative answer , which included the following observations :
“ No , no , we ’re not better off .
We ’re worse off , but it ’s partially this administration ’s fault and it ’s the Congress .
But it also involves an economic system that we ’ve had for a long time and a monetary system that we ’ve had and a foreign policy that ’s coming to an end and we have to admit this .
“ We were elected in the year 2000 to have a humble foreign policy and not police the world , and yet what are we doing now ?
We ’re bogged down in another war .
We ’re bankrupting our country and we have an empire that we ’re trying to defend which costs us $ 1 trillion a year .
“ But it has to do with a fiscal policy , monetary policy , and foreign policy of way too much spending , but it took a lot of years for us to get here .
The people in this country have been begging for a change in direction , and they have n’t had it .
It ’s time we gave it to them . ”
Paul underscored this viewpoint later in the debate :
“ We should be debating foreign policy , whether we should have interventionism or non-interventionism , whether we should be defending this country or whether we should be the policemen of the world , whether we should be running our empire or not , and how are we going to have guns and butter ? ”
Sadly , while Ron Paul has been pointedly critical of the supposedly conservative candidates ’ positions on America ’s geopolitical , fiscal , and societal policies , his criticism has drawn open scorn from mainstream Republicans .
Their smirks and condescension toward Paul are clearly meant to demonstrate that they are the real conservatives and he is not .
Yet all they have demonstrated is why and how conservatism has gone astray .
Paul ’s commitment to constitutionalism , fiscal prudence , federalism , small government , and avoiding the strategic entanglements that the founding fathers  especially Washington and Jefferson  warned against makes him the only true conservative among the Republican presidential aspirants .
The fact that he will not prevail while McCain does should reinvigorate the entire debate over the meaning of “ conservatism . ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Home foreclosure filings in February edged down from January but were a whopping 60 percent higher than a year earlier , real estate data firm RealtyTrac said on Thursday .

The surge in foreclosures from a year earlier indicated that the cycle has yet to hit its peak , the firm said .
Home foreclosure filings in February totaled 223,651 , down 4 percent from January , RealtyTrac , an online market of foreclosure properties , said in its February U.S. Foreclosure Market Report .
The figure is a total of default notices , auction sale notices and bank repossessions ,
In January , home foreclosure filings had risen 8 percent from December .
RealtyTrac , based in Irvine , California , said the national foreclosure rate was one foreclosure filing for every 557 U.S. households in February .
“ The 4 percent monthly decrease this February was similar to the 6 percent monthly decrease we saw in February 2007 , ” James Saccacio , chief executive officer of RealtyTrac , said in a statement .
“ However , the year - over - year increase of 60 percent this February was significantly higher than the 19 percent year - over - year increase in February 2007 , indicating we have still not reached the peak of foreclosure activity in this cycle , ” he said .
Nevada had the highest foreclosure rate in the country , with one foreclosure filing for every 165 households , followed by California and Florida .
All three states had been among the hottest U.S. housing markets during the boom years from 2000 to 2005 .
Default rates and foreclosures have jumped over the past year as the housing market deteriorated .
As interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages reset higher , many homeowners who have been unable to sell their homes or refinance existing home loans amid a drop in home prices have been forced into foreclosure .
Nevada had 6,167 foreclosure filings in February , up 1 percent from January and up 68 percent from February 2007 .
Although California ’s foreclosure activity fell 6 percent from the previous month , it still ranked second highest in the nation with one filing for every 242 households .
California , the most populous U.S. states , reported 53,629 foreclosure filings , the most of any state and up 131 percent from February 2007 .
Florida had one foreclosure filing for every 254 households ranks in February , with 32,447 filings , up more than 7 percent from January and more than 69 percent than a year earlier , Realty Trac said .
“ If you pull an all - nighter , ” Dr. Benca said , “ the next night your slow waves will be much larger . ”
Other mammals experience REM sleep and slow - wave sleep , as well , indicating that humanlike sleep patterns existed early in the history of mammals .
But beyond mammals , scientists have had a hard time finding humanlike sleep patterns .
So far , they have been seen just in birds .
The fact that the closest relatives of birds , like alligators and turtles , do not have our kind of REM sleep and slow - wave sleep suggests that birds , or their dinosaur ancestors , evolved humanlike sleep independently .
This parallel evolution has given scientists the opportunity to test the hypothesis that slow - wave sleep is essential .
“ If slow - wave sleep is a fundamental building block of sleep , then it should be true in birds as well as in mammals , ” Dr. Benca said .
Niels Rattenborg of the Max Planck Institute of Ornithology in Germany tested this hypothesis by depriving pigeons of some slow - wave sleep .
“ We kept pigeons from taking their daytime naps , ” he said .
“ All we did was tap their cage or move the cage floor or give them things to play with for eight hours before we turned the lights off . ”
After the lights went dark , the pigeons had slow waves 27 percent stronger than on undisturbed nights .
“ What we found was that they actually showed response very much like that observed in mammals , ” Dr. Rattenborg said .
“ There ’s something in common in being a bird and being a mammal that results in sleeping this way . ”
Dr. Rattenborg contends that birds and mammals have similar kinds of sleep because birds and mammals have much larger and more complex brains for their size than other vertebrates .
In mammals , much of that expansion occurred in the front of the brain , in the neocortex .
The neocortex endows mammals with sophisticated , flexible learning and decision making .
Only in recent years have scientists realized that birds have a brain region similar to the mammal neocortex .
Known as the pallium , it arises from the same population of embryonic cells that produces the neocortex in mammals .
The pallium is made up of clumps of neurons , while the neocortex is organized in layers .
Despite the differences , the pallium also lets birds carry out many impressive mental tasks .
Some birds can remember thousands of locations where they hide food .
Others fashion tools like sticks , to obtain food .
Others can learn many bird songs .
Pigeons can learn how to distinguish between Cubist and Impressionist paintings .

ROME ( Reuters ) - A court in Sicily has ruled that an accused Mafioso can be put under house arrest because he is too fat for any Italian jail .
Salvatore Ferranti , who weighs 462 pounds , was allowed to go home after spending six months in four Italian prisons , his lawyer told Reuters , confirming a local newspaper report .
Guards at the first two prisons said they constantly needed to help Ferranti , 36 , get dressed and undressed , move about and go to the bathroom .
Guards at other prisons said there was no bed big enough for him , that he could not get through the bathroom door , and that they would be at a loss if he had to be taken to a hospital in an emergency .
Ferranti was accused of being a member of the Mafia clan once headed by Salvatore Lo Piccolo , the “ boss of bosses ” arrested last November .
Lawyer Raffaele Bonsignore filed a motion with a court in Palermo to release him under house arrest because he suffered from “ grave obesity , ” calling it “ a pathology incompatible with prison . ”
Devil May Cry 4 should be hitting retail shelves in the next day or so , and since the demo is available on both the PS3 and Xbox 360 you can test out both versions to see which one you prefer .
We enjoyed the demo on the 360 , simply because it was available first , but news has been circulating that the game requires a one - time 5GB install on the PlayStation 3 .
Oh the humanity !
It can take upwards of twenty minutes before you get to play !
Gamers , as they often do , sounded off on the message boards .
Capcom , as it often does , responded in a somewhat amusing fashion .
" It 's true : the first time you drop your DMC4 Blu-ray disc into your PS3 tray , you 're going to be treated to an exciting 22 - 25 minute load process as the disc spins a few gigs of data onto your hard drive , " writes Chris Kramer , senior director of Communications and Community .
" While the game is loading , you get to watch a really nifty series of screens that completely catch you up on the DMC4 backstory .
Think of it as compressing the last three ' seasons ' into a single info blast , accompanied by some fantastic DMC artwork . "
He then says if you do n't need to catch up on the story , go make some food .
You 'll need to be able to concentrate on the game , and that 's hard to do while hungry .
" Low blood sugar will make you dizzy and you ’ll need to be focused like an Alan Parsons Project to defeat the enemies in this game . "
Why should we put up with this OMG TRAVESTY ?
Simply put , " the PS3 version of the game has near - Super Nintendo speed load times .
You 'll be amazed how fast levels load , the virtually instantaneous transition from cut scenes to action and that you ’re continuously playing the game , as opposed to staring at loading screens of a door opening every time you move from one room to the next . "
That sounds worth a few minutes at the beginning .
I 'll most likely be picking this up on the PS3 to shorten the loading times ; I have my sandwich - makings ready to go .

Danish flags have been burnt at demonstrations in the Muslim world
Two days before the scheduled trip , Tehran demanded the MPs condemn the cartoon on their arrival in Iran .
The row follows the arrest on Tuesday of three men for allegedly planning to murder cartoonist Kurt Westergaard .
The following day , 11 Danish papers reprinted his drawing depicting the Prophet with a bomb in his turban .
A condemnation and apology would help convince the Iranian people that Denmark 's authorities had distanced themselves from the action , Iran 's parliament said in a letter to Danish MPs .
If anyone needs to apologise ... it is the Iranians
Villy Soevndal ,
Danish MP
Nine members of Denmark 's foreign affairs committee were due to arrive in Iran on Monday for a three - day trip focusing on human rights and the Islamic Republic 's nuclear programme .
" We are not the ones to apologise , " said Villy Soevndal , the leader of Denmark 's Socialist People 's Party .
" If anyone needs to apologise for freedom of speech , human rights , imprisonments , executions and lack of democracy , it is the Iranians . "
Denmark 's foreign minister has backed the parliamentarians ' decision not to travel .
( PopSci.com ) --
In recent months , PopSci has covered various scientists ' plans to curb global warming through carbon sequestration , mainly by feeding it to algae to make biofuel , or burying it underground .
Skymine uses the carbon dioxide emitted from smokestacks to make baking soda .
Today , a company called Skyonic announced a novel new system , Skymine , which uses the carbon dioxide emitted from smokestacks to make baking soda .
According to Skyonic CEO Joe David Jones , the system will be powered by waste heat from factories , and will produce food - grade baking soda .
Last year , the utility company Luminant installed a pilot version of the system at its Big Brown Steam Electric Station in Fairfield , Texas .
There 's still quite a bit of work to be done to make the current system viable on a large scale , but the baking soda idea offers solutions to some of the economic problems posed by other carbon sequestration methods .
For starters , according to Jones , the stuff can be sold for home or industrial use or buried harmlessly in landfills or abandoned mines .
Jones apparently got the idea for the SkyMine system while watching a Discovery Channel show with his kids .
He pulled out an old college science textbook and immediately turned to a passage about converting C02 to baking soda .

The two sides signed an agreement on defence cooperation in 2006
The exercise is taking place between 20 and 28 December in China 's south - western province of Yunnan .
It involves a company - just over 100 officers and men - from each side .
India and China fought a brief but bloody border war in 1962 and observers say the largely symbolic exercise is to boost historically frosty relations .
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says after years of mistrust both sides are beginning to benefit from increased trade and their governments are coming under increasing pressure from business leaders to improve ties .
' Three evil forces '
" The joint training is aimed at enhancing understanding and mutual trust between Chinese and Indian armies and strengthening their exchanges in the anti-terror areas , " a statement issued by the foreign office of the Chinese Ministry of National Defence said .
Indian troops have a long - standing border dispute with China
" It is also aimed at deterring the ' three evil forces ' - separatists , extremists and terrorists - and promoting the strategic partnership for peace and prosperity between China and India . "
Indian troops taking part have been picked from forces fighting insurgencies in restive north - eastern India and Indian - administered Kashmir , reports said .
Indian forces are carrying their personal weapons , light machine guns and mortars .
The armoury - tanks , helicopter gunships and unmanned aerial vehicles - are being provided by the Chinese army .
Analysts say the exercise will bolster ties between the two countries .
" It will definitely help strengthen the mutual trust between the two countries , and the militaries in particular , given that they have an episode of unpleasant history , " Sun Shihai , a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences told the BBC .
Swaran Singh , associate professor at the School of International Studies at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University , said : " This reflects the growing mutual trust and understanding between the two sides , including between their military establishments . "
' Intrusions '
Ties between the two countries remained tense after the brief war in 1962 .
During an Indian high altitude military exercise called Operation Chequerboard in 1987 , the two armies nearly went to war again .
In between , both sides patrolled the desolate frontier aggressively and skirmishes were not infrequent .
The situation eased after the two countries signed a treaty for peace and tranquillity in 1993 , agreeing to reduce troop levels on the borders .
India and China signed an agreement on defence cooperation in May 2006 during the visit of former Indian Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee to China .
Since then the two countries have been sending officers to each other 's military institutions for training , and military delegations have been visiting each other on a regular basis .
Last year , China agreed to reopen the strategic Nathu La pass to border trade , thereby accepting Sikkim as a part of India .
Around 100 Indian soldiers are taking part
But in the last year China appeared to be uncomfortable with India 's growing strategic ties with the US , cemented through a series of joint exercises , including the huge five - nation naval exercise in the Bay of Bengal , this year .
In recent months , Indian forces reported more and more Chinese " intrusions " across the disputed border even as Beijing stepped up its rhetoric over the disputed frontier , reiterating its claims to the north - east Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh .
Analysts say the visit of India 's governing Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi to China last month has helped put bilateral relations back on the right track .
For its part , China , a long - term ally of Pakistan , appears no longer to object to India 's civilian nuclear deal with the US .
But other sources of suspicion remain , among them China 's influence in India 's neighbour Burma and India 's hosting of the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama .
Forget talk of soft landings .
Ignore those who say that the Federal Reserve is in control of events .
Take with a pinch of salt suggestions that the problems at Bear Stearns are a one - off .
The rescue package orchestrated for America 's fifth - biggest investment bank makes it abundantly clear that this is now a different sort of market and a different sort of crisis .
It is no longer hyperbole to state that the US is facing the most serious threat to its financial system since the Depression of the 1930s .
After days of denying market rumours that it was in trouble , Bear Stearns eventually came clean today and said that it had been forced to seek help from a combination of JP Morgan and the New York Federal Reserve as a result of a deterioration in its financial position in the past 24 hours .
Bear 's problems have , however , been building up for a lot longer than that , and the talk of a sudden descent into crisis looks like an attempt to prevent US regulators taking an interest in whether the bank has been trading under false pretences this week .
Like Northern Rock in the UK , it was the bank that was most heavily exposed to the sub - prime meltdown in the American real estate market .
Like Northern Rock , it was singled out as the limping wildebeest struggling to keep up with the herd .
And like Northern Rock it has been the victim of a bank run , only this time the run has involved other banks selling its shares short rather than customers turning up to withdraw their savings .
The severe problems at Bear Stearns explain why the Fed has been so hyperactive .
Ben Bernanke , the Fed chairman , is a student of the Great Depression and knows only too well the role that collapsing banks had in magnifying the impact of the slump .
The plan , evidently , is to take decisive action in the hope that Bear Stearns can be ringfenced from the rest of Wall Street .
Whether this works remains to be seen .
Previous attempts to contain the sub - prime crisis to America 's trailer parks and poorer suburbs proved singularly unsuccessful : the key word of the past eight months has been contagion not containment , and there are plenty of other banks that have allowed greed to influence their investment decisions .
There are three immediate conclusions to be drawn from today 's events .
The first is that the market turmoil will continue and perhaps deepen .
The second is that the Fed will now almost certainly cut interest rates by 75 basis points when it meets next week .
The third is that the chronic weakness in the dollar will continue and before long may prompt coordinated central bank action to prop it up .
But the scary truth is that the Fed has lost control of events .
This crisis has a life of its own and it is not going to end until a floor is put under the US housing market , because only that will stem - eventually - the losses being made by the banks .
As things stand today , that still looks a long way off .
A common way to measure a Presidential candidates popularity is the percentage of people would like to have a beer with that candidate .
A recent poll of 1500 college students reveals that there will , in fact , be a woman in the White House in 2008 .
But it 's not who you might think ..
The future president thinking about foreign policy .

A couple nights ago I walked down to LispNYC in the East Village to hear Rich Hickey talk about Clojure , his new Lisp - like language .
To be honest , I was n’t expecting much .
Another Lisp ?
Ho hum .
I ’m sure it ’s very clever and cool and all , but not something I can actually use .
Instead , I was blown away by Rich ’s presentation .
Clojure might just be the Lisp I ’ve been waiting for .
Here ’s why :
Clojure targets the JVM .
That does n’t just mean it ’s written in Java .
It compiles directly to Java bytecode , so it can take advantage of all the optimization work that ’s been done on just - in - time bytecode compilers .
So it ’s both fast and portable .
Clojure is functional , i.e. “ side - effect free . ”
The built - in data structures are immutable .
At the same time , you can have side effects ( via external Java calls ) without needing monads .
Clojure has modern data structures .
Vectors and hash maps are built in , and both can be used as “ functions ” that take a key value as their argument ( I immediately thought yes , that ’s the way it should be ) .
Clojure fits into the Java ecosystem .
All squintillion Java library methods can be called directly from Clojure .
( Hickey demonstrated a small Swing app with fewer lines than the Java version . )
Clojure data structures implement the Java collection interfaces .
Clojure has built - in concurrency support .
I barely understand this , but Hickey has done his homework and built a sophisticated concurrency and transaction system right into the language .
Clojure abstracts Lisp sequences .
Standard functions like “ map ” and “ filter ” work on any sequence , not just lists .
In fact , they work on any object that implements the Java “ Iterable ” interface .
Clojure has metadata .
Objects can have metadata attached to them , which can be used by the program without affecting the value of the data ( e.g. two objects with identical contents but different metadata are still considered “ equal ” ) .
Clojure is still Lisp !
It has first - class functions , Common Lisp - style macros ( with automatic gensyms ) , a reader , “ eval ” , and a REPL .
I have n’t been this excited about Lisp since Peter Seibel came to talk about Practical Common Lisp .
Hickey ’s full presentation should show up soon at LispNYC.org .
There ’s also a ( beautiful )
Clojure web site and a Google group .
Update Nov. 21 : Audio and slides from the presentation are available at LispNYC .
“ We make guilty of our disasters the sun , the moon , and stars ; ” – Shakespeare
In Shakespeare ’s time , people blamed the stars for their problems .
Today scientists tell us either that our brain has been pre-programmed by evolution , or shaped by our environment , or both , and therefore operates on auto - pilot .
According to all of this , we are not responsible for our actions or our personalities .
“ No basis for discussion can be found with anyone who believes that mind and brain are separate ” says neurologist Mark Hallet in a recent article .
I like to read about the brain .
It is relevant to my work in education .
I compare what I read to my own experience .
Life may be full of illusions , but I like my illusions , especially those that work for me .
Unlike Hallet , I do separate my mind from my brain .
I talk to myself and I tell my brain what to do .
I think that my conscious desires and intentions influence the activity of my brain .
As a child of 10 or so , I admired my father ’s ability to wiggle his ears .
I wanted very badly to do the same .
At first I could not .
So I just sat there for hours , sometimes while watching television , just telling my brain to get going and start moving my ears .
Eventually the brain gave in .
I succeeded , through will power , in training my brain .
Certainly genetics and circumstances have influenced my personality and my values .
If I had not seen my father wiggle his ears , I would probably still be unable to do so .
Maybe I am genetically preconditioned to be stubborn .
I know full well that my brain was not born a “ clean slate ” , and that family , friends and culture have influenced who I am .
But I still feel I am in control of what I do .
The Stoic philosopher Epictetus said ; “ In our power are conception , effort , desire , aversion and … our actions . ”
On the other hand , success , health , wealth and reputation are outside our control , so Epictetus said not to worry about them .
However , for most people , success matters .
The desire for self - improvement is usually aimed at achieving success , or better health or some similar goal .
But most of us have trouble following through on good advice .
It is not enough to know that we should avoid rich foods , or exercize more , or be neat , or set priorities .
Somehow we have to get our brain to cooperate , since our brain often seems to have a mind of its own , preventing us from changing our habits .
To change our habits we first need to stop blaming ourselves and start working on our brain .
We can influence the workings of our brain with our will power .
Our brain is not hard - wired .
Neuro - plasticity is the scientific term for the fact that our brain is constantly adapting and changing and recreating itself .
Our determination and intent are forms of neural activity that influence the brain .
Our conscious self can impose its will on the brain .
In “ The Mind and the Brain “ , Jeffrey M. Schwartz , a research psychiatrist at UCLA , outlines his theory and clinical experience of how will power can overcome Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) .
The first step for Schwartz ’s patients is to recognize that a behavior pattern exists as a network of neural activity , independently of the their will .
It is not the patient that has a bad habit , it is the brain .
The brain has to be brought to heel , to be trained .
This is done with concentrated intent and determination .
That is what I did when I trained my brain to wiggle my ears .
Schwartz describes four steps in helping people overcome such compulsive needs as the desire to wash their hands every five minutes .
His four steps are called Relabel , Reattribute , Refocus , and Revalue , and consist of :
Understanding the problem as a faulty pattern in the brain .
Separating this pattern from any sense of self - guilt .
Focusing on actions that replace the undesired behavior .
Changing how the undesirable behavior is valued .
In other words , you train yourself not to binge on chocolate sundaes or procrastinate any more , and your brain develops a new value system that no longer rewards that activity .
I have found it comforting and effective to see my bad habits , not as the disappointing proof of my weakness , but as objective neural activity that I can train my brain to change , if my desire is strong enough .
I have found intent and will power important in all learning activities , even at my age .
It is never too late to learn new skills or to challenge old habits !

CAIRO , Egypt ( CNN ) --
An Egyptian human rights activist who posted videos about police abuse says YouTube has shut down his account because of complaints that the videos contain " inappropriate material . "
Egyptian human rights activist and blogger Wael Abbas says YouTube has suspended his account .
Wael Abbas , an award - winning anti-torture watchdog , told CNN on Wednesday that there have been 100 videos posted on his account containing images of torture , police brutality , demonstrations , strikes , sit-ins and election irregularities .
Now , material he had posted is no longer available on the popular video - sharing Web site , he said .
Abbas said YouTube sent him an e-mail saying they had suspended his account .
" They did n't ask me to remove it .
They said ' Your account is n't working , ' " he said .
Watch Abbas ' complaints about YouTube »
When asked about Abbas , a YouTube spokesperson said , " We take these matters very seriously , but we do n't comment on individual videos . "
YouTube regulations state that " graphic or gratuitous violence " is not allowed and violations of the Terms of Use could result in the ending of an account and deleting all of the videos in it .

Online torture video jails police
" You Tube prohibits inappropriate content on the site , and our community effectively polices the site for inappropriate material , " the spokesperson said .
" Users can flag content that they feel is inappropriate and once it is flagged it is reviewed by our staff and removed from the system within minutes if it violates our Community Guidelines or Terms of Use .
We also disable the accounts of repeat offenders . "
Abbas agreed that some of the videos were " graphic , " but said strong images underscore the issue of abuse and make an " impact on public opinion . "
He said the graphic images he posted had an impact like the photos and videos of Abu Ghraib prison that emerged in 2004 showing mistreatment of detainees by U.S. troops and stoking international outrage .
" We managed to direct the attention of the people to something that was taboo , something that was never discussed before , which is police brutality and torture inside police stations , " said Abbas , referring to his videos .
The 33 - year - old Abbas also operates one of Egypt 's best known blogs , misrdigital.com , which owes its popularity in part to its frequent postings about police abuse .
In one prominent incident , Abbas posted a video on his blog of a police officer binding and sodomizing an Egyptian bus driver who intervened in a dispute between police and another driver .
The video was one of the factors that led to the conviction of two police officers , who were sentenced to three years each in connection with the incident .
" It 's the first time Egyptian people saw something like that , " Abbas said , referring to beatings and torture .
" It was a shock to the Egyptian people . "
The blogger , who said he 's in a " state of shock " because he lost videos he 's uploaded for years , said he might resort to campaigning against YouTube .
" We thought that YouTube was our ally , " Abbas said .
" It helped show the truth in countries like Burma . ...
With what they did now , it does n't seem like that anymore , " he said .
Abbas said he has also had a problem with Yahoo !
because it shut down two of his e-mail accounts , accusing him of being a spammer .
The International Center for Journalists recently awarded a Knight International Journalism Award to Abbas for his work .

India ’s Tata Motors on Thursday unveiled its much anticipated $ 2,500 car , an ultra - cheap price tag that brings car ownership into the reach of tens of millions of people .
But critics worry the car could overwhelm the country ’s roads and create an environmental nightmare .
Company Chairman Ratan Tata , introducing the Nano during India ’s main auto show , drove onto a stage in a white version of the tiny four - door subcompact , his head nearly touching the roof .
With a snub nose and a sloping roof , the world ’s cheapest car can fit five people — if they squeeze .
And the basic version is spare : there ’s no radio , no passenger - side mirror and only one windshield wiper .
If you want air conditioning to cope with India ’s brutal summers , you need to get the deluxe version .
While the price has created a buzz , critics say the Nano could lead to possibly millions more automobiles hitting already clogged Indian roads , adding to mounting air and noise pollution problems .
Others have said Tata will have to sacrifice quality and safety standards to meet the target price .
The chairman , though , insists the car will meet safety standards and pollute even less than motorcycles , passing domestic and European emission standards and averaging about 50 miles per gallon ( 20 kilometers per liter ) .
Read
Chief U.N. climate scientist Rajendra Pachauri , who shared last year ’s Nobel Peace Prize , said last month that “ I am having nightmares ” about the prospect of the low - cost car .
“ Dr. Pachauri need not have nightmares , ” Ratan Tata said at the unveiling .
“ For us it ’s a milestone and I hope we can make a contribution to the country . ”
The basic model will sell for for 100,000 rupees — $ 2,500 — but analysts estimate that customers could pay 20 - 30 percent more than that to cover taxes , delivery and other charges .
Tata has long promised that he ’d create a 100,000 - rupee car , a vow that was much - derided in the global industry but created a frenzy of attention in India .
On Thursday , nearly every news station covered the unveiling live .
“ A promise is a promise , ” Tata told the crowd .
The company has said they expect the car to revolutionize the auto industry , and analysts believe the Nano may force other manufacturers to lower their own pricing .
French automaker Renault SA and its Japanese partner , Nissan Motor Co. , are trying to determine if they can sell a compact car for less than $ 3,000 .
For now , the car will be sold only in India , but Tata has said it eventually hopes to export it .
The Nano could become the basis for other similar super - cheap models in developing markets around the world .
As rising middle class incomes drive demand for cars in India , automakers expect the ranks of car owners in the country to expand dramatically in coming years .
But for some , a huge influx of cars is a terrifying prospect of traffic jams at midnight , hours - long commutes and increasing pollution .
“ If you ’re talking about urban environment , it will cause serious problems , ” said Jamie Leather , a transport specialist with the Asian Development Bank .
“ It ’s a major concern . ”
In 2005 , Indian vehicles released 219 million tons of carbon dioxide , the leading greenhouse gas blamed for global warming .
By 2035 , that number is projected to increase to 1,467 million tons , due largely to the expanding middle - class and the expected rise of low - cost cars , according to the Asian Development Bank .
“ The cheaper and cheaper vehicles become , the quicker those pollution levels will increase , ” Leather said .

BBC News , Belgrade
The morning after Serbia lost Kosovo , the street cleaners in Belgrade were out picking up the glass from the pavements .
The scale of the violence in Belgrade was relatively small
It followed hours of rioting when up to 1,000 people , mainly football hooligans , rampaged through the city centre smashing windows , pushing huge rubbish bins into the road and wrenching up traffic signs .
The violence was interspersed with chants of " Serbia " and " Kosovo is Serbia " .
Earlier they had targeted the US embassy and the embassy of Slovenia , which currently holds the European Union Presidency .
A few rocks were thrown , a few windows were smashed .
People were injured and there were a number of arrests .
Show of unity
The scale of the violence , and the numbers involved , were pretty small .
But , in a sense , the anger and frustration that spilled onto the streets did fairly represent the feelings of the vast majority of the Serb people .
Protesters earlier targeted the US and Slovenian embassies
The country 's cultural and spiritual heartland was gone .
It was now part of another country and that was hard to take .
In fact , the official attitude is that nothing has changed .
Independence will not be recognised , it will never be recognised , chorused the main political leaders in Belgrade .
Indeed , Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said Serbia would broaden and strengthen its support for Kosovo 's Serbs .
In a rare show of unity , the leaders of the three main political parties in Belgrade agreed to call for a mass demonstration in the capital on Thursday to show the widespread opposition to independence .
EU ' betrayal '
Serbia and the Serbs feel hurt and betrayed , especially by countries in the EU .
As long as Serbs exist , Kosovo is Serbia
Vojislav Kostunica
Serbian Prime Minister
And relations between Serbia and the EU are set for a rocky ride , with the EU due to deploy a 2,000 - strong mission to the new state of Kosovo over the coming weeks and months .
Pristina may have declared independence , but for Belgrade it is business as usual - Kosovo remains an integral part of Serbia .
Mr Kostunica summed it up : " As long as Serbs exist , Kosovo is Serbia . "
One chapter in Kosovo 's history may have now closed , but the story is far from over .

I spend a lot of time wondering how our nation has become lazy , stupid and completely dependent on the talking heads of government and their toadies in the press to navigate life .
As is my nature , I 've been searching for a practical solution to this problem .
My teenaged daughter , bless her , is always holding my feet to the fire and demanding explanations for how we went from the Boston Tea Party , which was thrown in protest of a miniscule tax , to today 's insane surveillance - police - state , warfare / welfare empire in which we find ourselves .
Her latest request in our rather liquid home school was a discussion about the Bill of Rights .
It was a pretty short discussion .
Sis had read the document and understood the words but wanted more .
So do I !
I wish I had answers for her .
I only have questions of my own .
The one thing I could explain to her was that , in the beginning , the founding documents were composed to specify and limit the things that government could do to people .
Like the manipulative power shift in Orwell 's Animal Farm , over the years it has subtly and magically morphed from a constitutionally limited republic , limiting what government can do to you , to fascism .
Limitations on the size and scope of government ?
Uh , not so much .
Modern government leans more towards the inception and growth of ' appointed public servants . '
It 's like telling your watchdog to ' sit ' while you run errands .
Sooner or later some taxpayer in heat will wander past that nose with a sense of smell 10,000 times stronger than yours or mine .
The natural impulse of the lust to possess takes over and your commands are damned .
In this way , big government colludes with big business to consume the wealth of the nation .
As a mere formality , new laws are written which state that it is legal for them to do to you what they intended to do anyway , to put you out of your misery and into theirs .
These big dogs are bad to the bone .
This is sold to the people by calling it , all hail now , ' democracy . '
We the people are led to believe that we have a say in how we are to be devoured , it 's just that the devouring is not up for debate .
Even if it were fair to allow 51 % of the people to take away the rights of the other 49 % , in practice ' democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner . '
This slight of hand was no small feat .
It is the very nature of government to promote itself this way .
The fact that ' government ' is n't actually anyone or anything is part of the slight of hand .
What is government ?
It is not a man that you can challenge openly .
If you do challenge a bureaucrat and live to tell about it , there is an endless stream of others like him .
Government is layers , shadows , complicated verbiage in legal tomes , implication and shifting sands .
It is the darkest , most depraved and sinister aspects of greed and lust and yet it is nothing at all .
The puppet masters pulling the strings and calling the shots are invisible .
Even though some people give him a lot of credit for extensive collateral damage , I 'm convinced that even the president is merely a wooden headed marionette , a figurehead to distract the audience .
Bureaucracy is like fighting a ghost ' there is no defense .
How clever !
Should you object to being fleeced , ambiguity comes to an end .
You 'll see the guns come out , the guns of government .
The power behind the ' throne ' will never be exposed , and even the enforcers are becoming more obscured , but you will know where you stand .
The beauty of this system is that it is all paid for by the victim himself , the taxpayer .
This sounds eerily familiar , no ?
It 's like something out of a Mario Puzo tale .
However , there is a big difference between the mob and the government .
Even though they are both in the protection racket , the differences are clear : the mob does have a code of ethics and justice and they wo n't murder you in front of your family .
Part of the problem was sown in the very fabric of our nation .
The Founding Fathers began with the assumption that some type of government was necessary .
They had experienced tyranny first hand as subjects of the British Empire and so decided that limitations on such tyranny would do the job .
They did n't even know that they were attempting to found a nation on a false premise .
Hierarchy is so much a working part of the mind of man that they were unaware of its existence as a questionable concept .
There was no questioning something that has become as common as breathing , eating or sleeping .
In the old days salesmen used to say ' because you seem like such a nice guy , I 'll tell you what I 'm going to do . . . .'
Similarly , government falls on the sword for you by volunteering to be responsible for securing your freedom .
Just let them hold your gold for you in Fort Knox where it will be safe too , America !
When was the last time anyone mentioned that ?
For one low , low down payment and more payments over time , they can make your dreams come true !
You just sit back in your easy chair and enjoy another cold one .
They 'll raise your children , they 'll see to your elderly , they 'll put a chicken in every pot and plan for your golden years too .
Social Security is not a Ponzi scheme , really !
Ponzi schemes are fraudulent and illegal .
They 'll protect your freedom and your way of life for you by declaring war on drugs , poverty and terror ( more invisible windmills at which to tilt ! ) .
There 's also a bridge for sale .
It 's a boondoggle bridge to nowhere and it's not just in Alaska .
If you really care , turn the guns of government on a loved one today .
I do not typically point a gun at someone I really want to help .
To show you what I mean , here is a slice of Americana .
Recently I accompanied a friend to consult a surgeon for a hernia operation .
We signed in and were seated in the waiting room .
We had plenty of time to observe the other patients who were also waiting .
It occurred to me that no one there was paying cash for their consultation .
Some third party was paying for everything that occurred , including my friend , who is employed with health benefits .
Some people might be more generous , but I would describe the other patients this way .
To our immediate left was the best prospect for being self - responsible .
He was a youngish man , maybe 40 .
He did n't look terribly ill , so was obviously capable of working for a living .
His slight build and appearance and somewhat blank stare suggested he might do some kind of unskilled labor such as building maintenance .
Directly across from us sat an older gentleman , obviously on Medicare .
Next to us on the other side sat an elderly lady , also retired and collecting her monthly stipend from Uncle Sam .
Continuing around the room , there was an obviously handicapped woman who struggled to walk with a cane .
She was likely there for some kind of surgery to improve her situation .
As I said , there were no homeless people present .
The woman was probably not working and in all likelihood on some kind of disability payments .
Next to her , seated on a ' bench ' of a seat against one wall was an obese woman .
I would estimate her weight at 300 pounds .
Her hair and clothing were badly unkept .
She was in her forties with two small , unsatisfied children .
Later we realized she was their grandmother , attending them while her obese daughter consulted the surgeon .
It seemed unlikely to me that she was employed or employable , her daughter obviously less so .
Again , none looked hungry , so they all appeared to be on someone else 's dime .
It 's possible that they had their own private disability insurance , but unlikely .
Even then , as I said , someone else was paying for this dance .
I 've set the stage for what happened next .
When the door opened , in walked a 400 hundred pound woman .
She was probably in her twenties and nearly bald .
Please do n't write to me and tell me I 'm insensitive because this unfortunate young woman must have a thyroid condition .
I have a thyroid condition myself and I take a little pill every day to make it all better .
It costs me about $ 10 a month .
I also watch what I eat and exercise regularly , even though it is usually the last thing I 'd like to do .
I 'm no M.D. , but if what she had was a thyroid problem , I think she'd be visiting an internist instead of a surgeon .
The 400 - pound girl staggered up to the desk , signed in , and seeing as how she was not going to squeeze into a seat , moved to an open space to stand and wait .
I watched the 300 - pound grandmother also observing the situation .
After a few moments , she subtly raised herself from the only ' bench ' seat and moved herself and her grandchildren nearer the door to the examining rooms , as if she expected to be called any moment .
I watched her squeeze herself into a regular chair , knowing full well that the younger woman would never be able to do so .
The 400 - pound girl pretended to ' notice ' the open bench and , after waiting what seemed a reasonable amount of time so as not to seem desperate to secure it for herself , she seized upon it .
As in a dream , it all seemed as if there was an unspoken agreement :
It 's OK if you are not at all responsible for yourself , everyone else will take care of you .
Does such ' help ' encourage a person to be more responsible in the future , or less ?
To take better care of themselves , or worse ?
Could this create less ' need ' for health care ?
My companion nudged me back from my pondering .
He was irritated about the hour - long wait .
' Boy , if this is bad , imagine what socialized medicine will be like . '
( We both know it is inevitable . )
I responded that this is hardly private medical care .
' Two of these people are on Social Security , four are on disability or some other kind of welfare handout .
Janitorman over there probably earns less than poverty level wages , so he 's not subsidizing any of them .
You are carrying all these people around on your shoulders with the guns of government at your back , my friend .
No wonder you got a hernia . '
You get the government you deserve
Americans have gotten fat and lazy , there 's just no question about it .
The Constitution was a contract for a Cadillac , but delivered a lemon .
We fell hook , line and sinker for the oldest pigeon drop in the world .
We 've traded a little liberty for the empty promise of some security and just look where we 're at now .
Besides being bogged down in yet another in an endless stream of military conflicts that cannot be won and which are bankrupting us , we are less secure than ever .
We 've looked away for a moment and now we 're in shackles .
Two for flinching , America !
Modern man is guilty of depraved indifference when it comes to the vigilance required for liberty .
He 's fallen for the get - rich - quick scheme of the hucksters in Washington with their snake oil promises of freedom in the homeland ( if they can just spy on us enough ) , equality ( if we all sacrifice enough ) , democracy ( you simply get The Man to tell your neighbor how to live ) , immigration ( The Man decides who gets invited to the party ) , justice ( Big Pharma and the DEA choose your medicine and your punishment ) and security ( torture Muslims and rape and kill their women and children too ) .
This is considered a solid basis for the procurement of liberty ?
Most people can't admit they 've been had because it's too humiliating and painful , especially if you 've lost a limb or a loved one to the war machine .
It 's too much work to try to extricate one 's self from the machine of government now .
It reminds me of a woman I once knew who had supported Jim Bakker and his Praise The Lord house of cards .
She kept sending in her payments even after he was arrested for fraud !
Her reasoning was that if she stopped ' donating , ' she would n't get her free stay at the PTL Hotel , which I doubt she got anyway and had already more than paid for .
They had sold far more ' free stays ' than they could accommodate anyway .
They must have taken a leaf out of the government Social Security playbook .
Just keep paying , cross you fingers and maybe you 'll get yours .
The U.S. Government is so far in debt it can never dig itself out even if it wanted to , which it does n't because ' deficits do n't matter . '
It has inflated away 95 % of the value of its currency by manipulation of the money supply and in so doing has created one fragile economic bubble after another .
It has overextended its empire into nearly every corner of the globe and made mortal enemies every step of the way .
Here in metro Detroit , real estate is in the toilet ' houses are cheaper than cars .
Auto industry jobs are disappearing by the tens of thousands and the evaporation of livelihood goes out in waves in supporting industries .
I have lived here all my life and I 've never seen so many empty houses ; some do n't even have ' for sale ' signs .
Economically we are heading for ground zero without a shot fired , due totally to the ' something for nothing ' world improvers and the dupes who fell for their song and dance .
Anyone half awake is wondering if they can't just ' get theirs and get out ' unscathed like in a deal going sour .
It does n't work that way .
My Dad always said that if you dance to the music you have to pay the piper , and boy , oh boy , have we racked up a tab !
No piece of paper protects my liberty , just as no piece of paper kept me faithful to my husband or protective of my children .
If something greater is n't fueling my living , then what I am is not free nor worthy .
That something greater is sadly uncommon in modern America .
Government is basically made up of thieving , morally decrepit whores who come in the night to steal , kill and destroy .
Like Snow
White , humanity , en masse , has been put into a poisonous slumber of dependency on government .
Contrary to popular belief in the second coming of the Clintons , there is no princely wake up kiss coming in the 2008 election .
There is a kiss coming , but it 's more like the one the doomed guy gets from the Godfather .
The average politician , as my Dad would say , has the ' morals of an alley cat , ' and I 'm not talking about their sex lives .
Anything valuable is worth fighting for , and freedom is valuable indeed .
Without it , there is really nothing else worth having .
Freedom wo n't come to you in the mail like a cheap life insurance policy , and it wo n't protect you from inside a frame under glass in the halls of Congress or from the sworn statement of politicians no matter what you believe .
It wo n't ride up on a white steed .
It is paid for in blood and its cost is dear .
Many have died to obtain it .
You may have to die trying to retrieve and protect it .
This is not an appealing idea , but many people die under the heel of tyranny too .
If liberty is valuable enough for thieves in government to come after , is n't it worth another look , America ?

Wexler Calls For Cheney ’s Impeachment
By John Bresnahan
( The Politico ) Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - Fla. ) is urging the House Judiciary Committee to begin impeachment hearings against Vice President Dick Cheney , despite opposition from House Democratic leaders .
Wexler , who first gained national attention for defending former President Bill Clinton during his impeachment in 1998 , said Cheney has to be ousted in order to restore the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches , which in his view , has been eroded by an ever - expanding claim of authority under Cheney and President Bush .
“ There ’s a litany of issues that need to be heard , ” Wexler said .
“ This administration has abused the power of executive privilege .
This administration has completely avoided testifying before Congress on any one of a host of six , seven , eight issues .
“ Whether we are talking about the manipulation of intelligence on Iraq , ”  he went on , “ whether we are talking about the outing of a covert CIA agent , whether we ’re talking about the illegal use of torture , whether we ’re talking about the potentially unlawful firing of U.S. prosecutors – on all of these issues , the administration has thus far successfully used the power of executive privilege . ”
But impeachment hearings would be different , Wexler said , since the White House could not raise a privilege claim in order to avoid answering questions from lawmakers .
“ In an impeachment hearing , the administration does not have the power of executive privilege , ” Wexler said , noting that the secret tapes that helped bring down President Richard Nixon did not surface until the House Judiciary Committee began impeachment hearings .
The House voted on Nov. 6 on a resolution by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) to bring articles of impeachment against Cheney for pushing for the 2003 invasion of Iraq , repeatedly suggesting that there ties between al Qaeda and the late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and advocating military action to overthrow Iran .
When Republicans , in a bid to embarrass House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders , voted for the measure , the House was thrown into a brief deadlock .
The measure was eventually approved and sent to the Judiciary Committee , where Chairman John Conyers Jr. ( D - Mich . ) has declined to take action , despite pressure from Wexler and liberal activists outside Congress .

The wild streets of Skegness have seemed just that little bit safer ever since survival expert and obsessed Rambo fan Stephen O'Rourke changed his name to that of the muscle - bound movie hero .
Skegness ' own John Rambo might draws stunned glances from passers - by as he patrols through the town in full military get - up and bandana , but at least no one dares mess with him .
John , 40 , changed his name 20 years ago after watching the Rambo movies for the first time .

John Rambo has trained himself in the art of survival to emulate his hero
Not content with sharing the same name as the tough action hero and dressing the same , he has also perfected Sly Stallone 's distinctive slow drawl .
The charity worker helps teach outdoor survival tactics at his local Air Training Corps .
He said : " I really am the real - life Rambo .
" Generally people think twice about what they say to me .
Nobody messes with me .
" Sometimes people do n't believe I 'm serious at first .
They just think it 's quite amusing .
" Then they realise the truth . "
Unmarried John changed his name by deed poll in 1988 when he was 20 - the year the third film came out .
He said : " I was mad on all the Rambo films at the time .
I was 14 , 17 and 20 when they came out and it was when the last one came out that I changed my name .
" People had already nicknamed me Rambo .
I had a really short fuse and I always wore a bandana .
" I thought Rambo was great and we were so similar I knew I was just the real - life version of the character .
" The name was the only thing missing and once I changed that I really was John Rambo . "
It is not just John 's name that makes him stand out from the crowd as a real - life action hero .
Wearing a bandana and combat trousers he is the spitting image of Sylvester Stallone 's character in the popular films .
He said : " I 've always worn something on my head , usually a cap , but I started wearing a bandana too .
" In the films Rambo wears a red one but mine 's camouflage green .
They 're similar enough though .
" I wear combat trousers quite a lot , so I look just like him .

The real thing : Stallone as Rambo in the latest film in the series
John does not just keep up appearances with his love of everything ' Rambo ' .
He has honed the same skills as his icon , making himself an expert on aircraft , weaponry and survival .
He said : " I 'm really into survival .
I 've done a few courses and I could easily survive in the woods if I had to .
" I 'm really into aircraft and weaponry , I 've been into it for a long time .
" I am the chairman of the civilian committee for the 1073 Skegness Squadron Air Training Corps so that is right along the line of my interests . "
Single John will be among the thousands of Rambo fans across the country queuing up to see the fourth offering of the world - famous films .
He said he could n't wait to see his hero 's latest appearance to pick up some hints and tips , and hoped the film would live up to its predecessors .
He added : " My favourite film was the second one , but I love all three of them .
I can watch them over and over again .
" I think the new one will be just as good , although maybe that John Rambo will have mellowed like I have over the years .
" I do n't have as much of a short fuse as I used to and the film Rambo is probably the same .
" He 's older and wiser now .
" I 'm really looking forward to seeing the film .
I 'll be watching it in the cinema on the day it starts showing . "
Danielle Holley - Walker is a professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law and is actively supporting the campaign of Sen. Barack Obama .
Danielle Holley - Walker : Media 's features on African - American women voters are missing the point .
( CNN ) --
You can't turn on a 24 - hour news channel or your nightly news this week without seeing a feature on African - American women voters .
It makes sense , being that the South Carolina Democratic primary is only one day away and African - American women will make up approximately one - third of the voters .
The angle in these news features is virtually identical .
The commentators wonder and marvel at the extraordinarily difficult choice for African - American women in this primary -- will we vote for the woman candidate or the African - American candidate ?
Reporters have been busying themselves traveling to crowded beauty shops all over the state to answer this question .
The funniest , or perhaps most disturbing , thing about these stories is how far they are from my reality .
I am an African - American woman living in South Carolina .
I have African - American women family members and friends who live in this state .
I actually visit beauty shops to get my hair done .
Never once have I heard a single woman I know frame the choice about whom to vote for as a question of gender or racial politics .
Anderson Cooper 360
How race and gender are influencing the election
Tonight , 11 ET see full schedule »
So what are African - American women talking about when the cameras are n't watching or , more importantly , what are we telling the media that is not being fairly reported ?
African - American women are talking about the issues !
We talk about the vision that each candidate has for leading this country .
We enthusiastically discuss the possibility that real , positive change will come from this election .
We even parse the policy distinctions in the candidates ' positions on education , creating jobs and ending the war in Iraq .
Sometimes , the issues we talk about do deal with aspects of gender and racial identity .
We debated Sen. Hillary Clinton 's statement implying that Martin Luther King 's civil rights movement did not fulfill its promise until Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act .
We argue and marvel at the significant generational divide in the African - American community that is being exposed by this election process .
If you listen closely to the women in the news features at the beauty shops , they are commenting on these issues , even when the voice - over in the same feature is telling you that the women are discussing whether it's more important to have the first woman or the first black president .
Why is the media determined to make us choose ?
Why do they insist that we declare our loyalty to either women or to African - Americans ?
This is a truly false dichotomy in that we are the living , breathing embodiment of both identities .
Asking us to prefer our gender over our race ( or vice versa ) is the equivalent of asking us to prefer one vital organ over another .
That is not to say that identity politics are completely irrelevant in this election .
African - American women are expressing their pride in both candidates and in the progress this country has made that allows a white woman and an African - American man to be strong contenders for the presidency .
My mother is uplifted by the idea that Obama 's candidacy means that her two grandsons will grow up being able to realistically dream about being president .
On Saturday , we will carry this pride into the voting booth with us , but when we cast our votes , we will be thinking about the serious issues facing this country .
That 's the truth , and do n't let the media tell you otherwise .

Young people rarely visit Citizens Advice with money concerns
Advice on money matters will be targeted at young people aged 16 to 25 via web content , podcasts and straight to their mobile phones .
Support charities Citizens Advice and YouthNet have teamed up for the project , which they hope will reach half a million youngsters .
It follows a government plan for more personal finance lessons in schools .
The modern way
Young adults , such as students , were particularly vulnerable to money troubles as they took responsibility for their financial affairs for the first time , said Citizens Advice spokeswoman Moira Haynes .
But only one in eight would consider going to their local Citizens Advice Bureau ( CAB ) , the charity 's research found .
HAVE YOUR SAY Digital communication is currently the best way to reach the majority of people most let down by modern education , so I 'm entirely in favour of this .
Nic Brough , London
She added that young people were more likely to search the internet for advice than turn to the more traditional face - to - face or telephone services run by the CAB in its 3,400 outlets across England and Wales .
Instead , the charity has joined forces with one - stop shop advice group YouthNet .
Its website , TheSite.org , already carries advice for young people ranging from crime prevention to wooing techniques .
As well as Citizens Advice offering independent advice on the money section of the website , some 30 new money advice fact sheets will be created to be read on youngsters ' mobile phones .
Audio versions will be available to download to mp3 players .
About 600 young people have already been consulted on what type of information they would want from the scheme , which is expected to include basic definitions of financial terms such as APR and ways to avoid unscrupulous lenders .
The scheme is expected to be launched in late April or early May .
Figuring it out
The £ 300,000 three - year project is being funded by the HBOS Foundation , which works with charitable and not - for - profit organisations across the UK .
Personal finance lessons in schools have been suggested
" We funded this ground - breaking programme , working with these two unique and respected charities , so that they can combine their unique areas of expertise and support and advise young people on the whole range of money issues that affect their lives , " said Janet Roberts , grants manager at the HBOS Foundation .
The charities have stressed that all the advice will remain independent and not influenced by the funding body .
The new project follows a survey which suggested parents and teachers supported personal finance education in schools .
Some 93 % of those asked by researchers for the Association of Investment Companies supported the move .
Personal finance education is not currently a mandatory part of the curriculum anywhere in the UK , although the government recently announced plans to add a new voluntary course called " economic well - being " to personal social and health education lessons from September 2008 .
Some trains are operating again but crowds remain at stations
Crowds at station
Sixty people are now known to have died as a result of the severe weather , which began three weeks ago .
Millions of travellers remain stranded as they try to get home for next week 's Lunar New Year holiday , with the army helping to clear railways and roads .
Meanwhile , the authorities have ordered coal production to be increased and imposed emergency price controls .
With millions reported to be without water and electricity , the government is working hard to convince people it is in control of the situation .
On Wednesday , President Hu Jintao visited a coal mine in Shanxi province .
" Disaster - hit areas need coal and the power plants need coal , " he told miners , according to Xinhua news agency .
" I pay an early New Year call here to those miners who will not go back home to celebrate the Spring Festival for [ the sake of ] the coal production , " he said .
' How long ? '
Snow has been falling in central and southern regions for three weeks .
Officials have warned that many could face food shortages in the future as a result of wrecked winter crops .

It has also hit the busiest travelling season - the run-up to Lunar New Year on 7 February .
People , many of them poor migrant workers , have been stranded at stations across the region , while major roads have also been blocked .
On Wednesday trains began operating out of Guangzhou , where hundreds of thousands of people have been stranded .
Daily passenger capacity was up to 400,000 , official media said , but huge crowds still remained at the station .
Graphic designer Cheng Xia , 28 , was not optimistic .
" The weather is still bad , " he told the Associated Press news agency .
" Once I get on a train , who knows how long I 'll be on it ?
We could get stuck for three or four days . "
Officials had urged people not travel - a plea that many seemed to be heeding , Xinhua news agency said .
Still more snow was expected over the next few days and temperatures were expected to remain below freezing , forecasters said .
Hearts Grow Fonder for Absinthe Absinthe spurred Van Gogh to remove ear ; now liquor is in a store near you .
Dec. 21 , 2007  --
Decadence and debauchery .
Mayhem and murder .
Absinthe , the legendary drink and muse of the Moulin Rouge set , is now legal in the United States and making a comeback for the holidays .
Absinthe 's reputation is as intoxicating as its licorice - tasting spirit .
The emerald - colored elixir , known as the " green fairy , " was said to spark creativity , hallucinations and mental illness .
The cultural force of the Belle Epoch , absinthe reputedly derived its hallucinogenic properties from the wormwood plant and its nasty byproduct , a chemical called thujone .
Oscar Wilde , Pablo Picasso and Ernest Hemingway were inspired by its toxic qualities , and Vincent Van Gogh was said to have cut off his ear under its influence .
Now , marketers are hoping to cash in on absinthe 's mystique .
" Prohibition is over , " declares the makers of Lucid , who fought the legal battle to sell an original recipe of the French elixir last May .
Today , just after the 74th anniversary of the end of Prohibition , an American company , St. George Spirit , will begin selling its Absinthe Verte .
The homegrown spirit will go head to head with Veridian Spirit 's Lucid , Swiss Kubler , Brazilian Absinto Camargo .
Competition has been so keen that Crillon Importers , which has legally sold the absinthe - like liqueur Absente , will soon launch its own wormwood - based product .
The end of America 's ban on absinthe is just the beginning of a new brand war for share of a small but growing number of young drinkers who either pride themselves on a sophisticated palate or on living dangerously .
" It 's taking off again , " said Ray Foley , editor of Bartender magazine .
" Bartenders have been after it for a while .
The younger kids think it 's kind of cool , like Van Gogh cutting off his ear . "
California 's St. George has sold all its 3,600 bottles in presale orders , according to owner Lance Winters the day before its Dec. 21 launch .
" It 's pretty crazy today .
It 's all been a strange trip .
I knew there was going to be interest .
I did n't think it would be this big . "
Absinthe has been illegal in most of Europe since the early 20th century .
Legend has it that a Swiss vineyard worker triggered the ban after murdering his family while under the influence of absinthe .
In the United States it was banned in 1912 , after Prohibitionists brought on its demise , citing health risks in a campaign not unlike the 1936 film " Reefer Madness " that led to the criminalization of marijuana .
But in May , the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau lifted the ban .
The government still regulates use of thujone , a chemical in wormwood that can cause brain damage at high levels and is a common ingredient in perfumes and salves like Vick Vap - O - Rub and Absorbine Junior .
Since the 1990s , absinthe has been available in Spain , Portugal and the Czech Republic , and the United States has turned a blind eye to college students bringing back bottles for personal use .
Bars and liquor stores say today 's younger customers are familiar with the absinthe mystique .
" Most of our buyers seem to be in their 20s , " said Chris Sletvold , manager of Joe Canal Liquors in Hamilton , N.J. " They associate absinthe with the old days , when people hallucinated , and think they are going to have a trip . "
Those who have sipped the powerful green liquid are more apt to get smashing drunk -- it 's 124 proof -- than hallucinate , but stories abound .
James Alexander , a 26 - year - old hipster from New York City , first tried absinthe at a Czech bar while studying abroad .
" It had a strong licorice flavor and seemed pretty alcoholic , " said Alexander .
" The only thing unusual I noticed was when I got up to walk to the bathroom , I did feel a little bit of a gliding sensation in my movements . "
Distillers and retailers say much of the allure to the drink is the power of suggestion .
" I feel like the hype around absinthe is much larger than the actual effects , " said Alexander .
" American college kids do their 15 - countries - in - Europe summer backpacking trip and buy a bottle of absinthe because it seems so exotic . "
Alexander bought a bottle in 2001 when he was in Prague and when he returned he shared it with friends .
" I remember going onto the Internet back in the states to figure out how we were supposed to drink it , " he said .
" We ended up heating a teaspoon of sugar with a lighter and dropping it into the glass of absinthe .
We drank the whole bottle and I did n't see any green fairies . "
Megan Royal , a 24 - year - old writer from Vermont , believes that absinthe had a " special ingredient , " similar to THC , the active ingredient in marijuana .
" It feels like a kind of spacey , high drunk . "
" It was pretty cool , " she said .
" Mostly because it was bright green and feels so exotic and literary to be drinking .
But it has an awful licorice taste , so I had to sip it down real quick . "
Absinthe is an acquired taste , say distributors , and that is why it may take some time for Americans to adjust their palates .
The proper way of serving the drink is complicated : Cold water is slowly poured over a cube of sugar on a slotted spoon into the green liquid , turning the drink cloudy white .
Many earlier formulas are " hard to swallow , " said Jim Nikola , vice - president for sales at Crillon Importers .
" The overall category is very young , and it 's hard to say where it can go .
When you think of how you drink it and the flavor -- licorice mixed with water -- it 's not a proven winner . "
His company started the absinthe category with Absent 's Absinthe Refined , by using a " sister botanical , " southern wormwood , and getting the government to allow a product with less than 10 pp million thujone .
Their sales are up 30 percent .
Sales of Lucid's Absinthe Superieure are " phenomenal , " according to Viridian Spirits founder Jared Gurfein .
The company sells its original French recipe as well as all the accoutrements available -- replica spout fountains for the water and the slotted spoons .
Just four days after its release , Lucid sold its first 1,000 cases .
" People in the industry say our volume was better in a half year than the major houses did in a full year , " said Gurfein , who waged the legal battle to sell wormwood - based absinthe in the United States .
" We are not just feeding to young hipsters , " Gurfein said .
" We have a sophisticated clientele .
We are definitely not marketing as contraband .
It appeals to people who tend to buy better quality spirits and cocktails . "
Ted Breaux , an environmental chemist and absinthe connoisseur , spent 14 years developing the brand from a 130 - year - old French recipe , using the same process and equipment with no artificial additives .
He still owns a dozen of the original 19th century bottles .
" My passion was to resolve the mysteries of absinthe through modern forensic chemistry , " said Breaux .
What he found was even the absinthe of old could pass today 's government regulations on thujone .
Hallucination stories are " a complete myth , " he said .
" The truth was it was a beautiful , stimulating and drunk in copious quantities . "
Absinthe ranges from $ 57 to $ 74 a bottle , a price tag that feeds the demand at high - end watering holes .
St. George 's Lance Winters says his customers are less concerned about mind - altering properties and more about " the poetry in the glass . "
At the upscale Bowery Hotel in New York City , where classic absinthe fountains adorn the bar , waiters honor the French practice of pouring ice - cold water slowly over sugar through a slotted spoon .
There , a block away from New York 's Five Points glorified in the film " Gangs of New York , " a cosmopolitan crowd is increasingly ordering absinthe , according to food and beverage manager James Stuart .
" These are not 23 - year - old kids coming in , " he said .
" They are guys in their 30s , who might have a martini or a Manhattan and say , ' Oh really , it 's legal now .
I 'll try that . ' "
Bartenders , who often get calls for Sazerac , which calls for absinthe , are now " elated " they can serve it legally , he said .
When the fountain arrives at the table , " Everyone gets interested . "
Still , the debauchery associated with absinthe cannot help seep into the ambience of the bar .
" We try to honor the historic nature of the Bowery , " said Stuart .
" On one side we have a methadone clinic and on the other a project renewal .
We incorporate an old - fashioned warm , honest feeling . "
" Absinthe makes total sense , " said Stuart .
" And now that it is legal , you can have fun with it . "
In wake of assassination of Benazir Bhutto , Bush administration rushes to defense of Musharraf
By Keith Jones
28 December 2007
Pakistan People ’s Party “ life chairperson ” and prime ministerial candidate Benazir Bhutto was assassinated early Thursday evening , Pakistani time , while campaigning for national and provincial assembly elections scheduled for January 8 .
The assassination was carried out in Rawalpindi , headquarters of the Pakistani military and ostensibly one of the country ’s most secure cities .
There are conflicting accounts of how the assassination occurred .
Many news reports are citing witnesses as saying that Bhutto was shot in the neck and torso before her assassin blew himself up .
The explosion killed at least 20 other people .
However , the New York Times has reported senior Pakistan People ’s Party ( PPP ) officials as saying Bhutto was hit by a rooftop sniper before a second assailant carried out the suicide bombing .
A rally organized by the other major opposition party , which was to have been addressed by deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif , also came under attack Thursday .
Snipers reportedly killed four supporters of the Pakistan Muslim League ( Nawaz ) and injured five more .
Before any evidence had been collected , let alone examined , and with key facts about the assassination still in dispute , the US political establishment effectively declared the investigation over , categorically attributing Bhutto ’s murder to Al Qaeda or a like - minded Islamicist group .
In a perfunctory statement wildly at odds with political reality in Pakistan , President George W. Bush declared Thursday morning , US time , that Bhutto ’s assassination was a “ cowardly act by murderous extremists who are trying to undermine Pakistan ’s democracy . ”
He urged Pakistanis “ to honor Benazir Bhutto ’s memory by continuing with the democratic process for which she so bravely gave her life . ”
Later , White House spokesman Scott M. Stanzel said Bush planned to speak with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in the coming hours , but would not tell him whether to proceed with the January 8 elections .
“ That is up to the Pakistanis , ” said Stanzel .
Democratic Party presidential candidate Barack Obama spoke along the same lines as Bush , and the US media quickly took up the refrain : Bhutto was a martyr to the war on terror and the Pakistani people should rally round Musharraf and the military ’s stage - managed elections .
There was hardly a voice in the US media that even hinted at the possibility that elements in and around the Musharraf regime could have had a hand in Bhutto ’s murder .
No matter that the Musharraf regime has an eight - year record of gross human rights abuses , including orchestrating lethal attacks on political opponents , and the Pakistani military - intelligence apparatus has for decades patronized armed Islamicist groups and used them as tools of its geo-political and political machinations .
Can there be any doubt that the assassination of the leading oppositional figure in a country whose military strongman was out of favor with the US would have evoked a very different response from Washington ?
Then the entire American political and media establishment would have pointed the finger of guilt at the regime .
Even if the Musharraf government was not directly involved in the murder of Bhutto , a very strong case is already emerging that its calculated negligence produced an outcome it privately welcomed .
Bhutto herself publicly accused elements in the government and Pakistan ’s military - intelligence establishment of having staged the October 18 attempt on her life in Karachi — a multiple bomb attack that killed 140 people .
Prior to her mid-October return to Pakistan , Bhutto wrote a letter to the government naming three individuals whom she said were intent on destroying her .
While Bhutto never made the names public , they are reputed to have included Ijaz Shah , the director general of the Intelligence Bureau .
In recent weeks , Bhutto repeatedly complained that the government had failed to provide for her most basic security needs , including supplying her with an armored car with tinted glass windows and the requisite equipment to jam electronic bomb detonations .
One of her US spokesmen said the slain PPP leader had told him that were she killed , the Pakistani government and military should be held responsible .
US Senator Joseph Biden , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination , has stated that he personally appealed to the Musharraf regime to provide greater security for Bhutto , but his appeals were ignored .
It appears that Bhutto herself , though aware of the immense danger to which she was exposed , counted on her close relations with the US to provide her with protection .
In this she gravely miscalculated .
The fraud of Pakistani “ democracy ”
Bhutto ’s assassination throws into question whether the military government headed by Musharraf will proceed with the long - promised elections .
At the very least , the government can be expected to use Thursday ’s assassination and bombing atrocity as the pretext to ban virtually all election campaign events .
Musharraf made a brief television appearance in which he announced three days of national mourning and blamed the killing on Islamicist terrorists .
Nawaz Sharif , whom the regime has prevented even standing as an election candidate , responded to Bhutto ’s assassination by announcing that his party will boycott the elections if the government holds them on January 8 .
The assassination of Bhutto , Pakistan ’s best known opposition leader and a two - time prime minister , only underscores the utterly bogus character of the elections , which have been touted by the Bush administration and the US media as marking a climactic step in Pakistan ’s “ democratic transformation . ”
On December 15 , Musharraf , who seized power in a 1999 military coup , lifted the state of emergency he had imposed six weeks earlier .
He had declared emergency rule so as to abolish , by dictatorial fiat , all legal - constitutional impediments to his reelection as president .
The state of emergency continues , however , in all but name .
The media remains subject to draconian censorship provisions .
Government opponents can be tried by military courts .
Election processions and all anti-government protests are banned .
And the country ’s Supreme and High courts , which have ultimate legal authority over the elections , have been purged of judges deemed insufficiently loyal to Musharraf .
As is generally true of such criminal conspiracies , it cannot be said with certainty who was the author of Bhutto ’s assassination .
But much , if not most , of the Pakistani public holds the Musharraf regime and its military sponsors responsible .
Distraught PPP members who had gathered at the hospital to which the fatally wounded Bhutto was taken , chanted “ Dog , Musharraf , dog . ”
Leaders of Al Qaeda and various other Islamic militias did vow to eliminate Bhutto , after the Bush administration made clear earlier this year that it favored a power - sharing deal between her and Musharraf , in hopes of providing the dictatorship with greater popular legitimacy .
But this does not mean that Islamacists carried out the killing or , even if they did , that it was not instigated or facilitated by elements from within the military - security apparatus and the government .
Many within the Pakistani military and bourgeois elite have never forgiven the PPP for having made demagogic appeals to mass discontent over poverty and inequality during its rise to power in the dying days of the Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan dictatorships .
Bhutto ’s father , PPP founder and former Pakistani prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was hanged by the military regime of Zia-ul Haq in 1979 to a chorus of applause from Pakistan ’s business and landlord elite .
The Bush administration expended considerable energy in the summer and fall trying to engineer a power - sharing deal between Bhutto and Musharraf and apparently still held out hope that a deal could be fashioned between them following the sham elections .
But through the support it lent Musharraf during the recent “ emergency , ” the Bush administration made abundantly clear that it views Musharraf and the military as its best allies .
The US ’s steadfast support for the government and its preposterous claim to be guiding Pakistan toward democracy could have only encouraged the most ruthless and reckless elements in the military and among Musharraf ’s political cronies in the Pakistan Muslim League ( Q ) , if not the president himself , to contemplate getting rid of Bhutto once and for all .
Bhutto ’s assassination constitutes a political decapitation of the PPP , which opinion polls had indicated was likely to emerge as the largest single party in Pakistan ’s national parliament .
A dynastic party , the PPP has but all exclusively focused its political appeal on Benazir Bhutto and her executed father .
The assassination of the PPP ’s “ life chairperson ” manifestly benefits Musharraf and the regime by eliminating a potential rival for power and for Washington ’s favor .
There are , however , concerns in the US political establishment , as voiced in a Council on Foreign Relations conference call with the press Thursday afternoon , that the assassination could strip the regime of any remaining credibility it enjoys and spark social unrest .
Rioting broke out in Karachi , in other cities in Bhutto ’s native Sindh province and elsewhere in Pakistan .
According to the BBC , at least eleven people were killed as security forces moved to quell the protests .
The role of US imperialism
It is imperialism , above all US imperialism , which ultimately bears responsibility for the political and socio-economic malignancy that is contemporary Pakistan — a country where the officer corps dominates the government and shares with a tiny stratum of capitalists and landlords the fortunes amassed from the brutal exploitation of the working class and impoverished rural toilers .
While the US media prattles on about Pakistani democracy , the reality is that Pakistani capitalism has failed to address the most elementary problems of the toiling masses — from guaranteeing basic civil liberties and the equality of women , to providing education and sanitation , to eliminating child - and bonded - labor .
In pursuit of the US elite ’s predatory economic and geo-political interests , Democratic and Republican administrations alike have supported a succession of brutal military dictatorships .
Two interconnected processes lie at the crux of Pakistan ’s still - born democracy and economic underdevelopment : the imperialist - imposed communal partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947 and the refashioning of Pakistan under General Muhammad Zia ul - Haq .
In close alliance with Washington , Zia “ Islamicized ” the Pakistani military and Pakistani politics , while making the country the pivot of the US campaign to undermine the Soviet Union by fomenting and arming Islamic fundamentalist militias in Afghanistan .
Pakistan is an artificial state , whose creation defied economic and geographic logic , to say nothing of the historical and cultural traditions of South Asia , and served to perpetuate two key elements in the British system of imperial control : the state - sponsored definition of Muslims as a separate political group and the Punjabi - dominated British Indian Army .
To say this is not to absolve the bourgeois Indian National Congress ( INC ) of responsibility for partition , nor to suggest that the independent bourgeois state created in India , on the foundations of the British Raj , has any greater historical legitimacy .
The INC connived with the Hindu communalist Hindu Mahasabha and RSS and was unwilling and organically incapable of defeating the machinations of British imperialism by uniting the subcontinent from below through the revolutionary mobilization of the working class and oppressed peasantry against landlordism and capitalism .
Partition was only the most graphic and bloody expression of the suppression , at the hands of imperialism and the aspirant national bourgeoisies of India and Pakistan , of the anti-imperialist movement that had convulsed the subcontinent in the first half of the twentieth century .
It has thwarted rational economic development , enshrined the communal divide in a state rivalry that has embroiled the peoples of South Asia in three declared wars , served as a means for the respective bourgeoisies to deflect social discontent into chauvinism , and , last but not least , facilitated imperialist domination of South Asia .
Continuing the role charted by the Muslim League prior to independence , the Pakistani bourgeoisie only more abjectly and openly aligned itself with imperialism than did its Indian rival during the Cold War .
By the middle 1950s , Pakistan was one of Washington ’s “ frontline ” states in confrontation with the USSR , and the Pakistani military was well on the way to becoming a linchpin of US geo-political strategy .
When Commander in Chief Ayub Khan seized power in 1958 , he received Washington ’s enthusiastic support , as exemplified by the quip , “ Ike [ Eisenhower ] likes Ayub . ”
After the Ayub Khan regime collapsed in 1968 - 69 in the face of mass student - worker protests and opposition from East Pakistan to its subordinate position within the Pakistani federation , Nixon and Kissinger encouraged a new military strongman , Yahya Khan , in a genocidal campaign to prevent Bangladesh ’s secession .
Pakistan ’s ignominious defeat in the Third Indo - Pakistani War caused the Pakistani elite and Washington to turn to Bhutto , the scion of a landlord family and former protégé of Ayub Khan .
Bhutto used anti-Indian chauvinism and pseudo - socialist phrases to politically emasculate the mass opposition to the military and Pakistan ’s grossly unequal social order .
During his six years in power , he sought to balance precariously between conflicting social forces .
He rehabilitated the military , using it to crush a nationalist insurgency in Baluchistan , proclaimed Pakistan an Islamic republic , and maintained the US - Pakistani alliance .
He also carried out limited social reforms , while violently suppressing any independent actions of the working class .
Ultimately , as politics internationally shifted to the right in the late 1970s , the military , under General Zia and with Washington ’s encouragement , seized power .
The Zia regime would have horrific consequences for the subsequent development of Pakistan .
For some eleven years , beginning in 1978 - 79 , Washington utilized Islamabad as the nexus for the US intervention in the Afghan civil war , fomenting and organizing the anti-Soviet Islamicist forces and acting as the conduit of US and Saudi arms and money to the Afghan mujahadeen .
This complemented Zia ’s own efforts domestically to build up the Islamic right as a bulwark against the working class and the left , and to promote Islamic fundamentalism as the state ideology .
As the state withdrew from providing education and other basic public services , in keeping with the Zia regime ’s right - wing economic policies , Islamic religious institutions were encouraged to fill the gaping holes .
The end result was the promotion of religious obscurantism , mounting sectarian strife , increased oppression of minorities , and the development of a nexus between the military and armed Islamicist groups , which all sections of the Pakistani elite sought to make use of in Pakistan ’s geo-political conflict with India .
During the Cold War , Washington egged on the Pakistan elite in its ruinous rivalry with India , providing and selling Pakistan all manners of arms and weapon systems .
But following the collapse of the USSR and the Indian bourgeoisie ’s repudiation of its national economic policy , the US , under the Clinton administration , moved to fashion a new strategic partnership with India .
Though Pakistan was now less central to US geo-political strategy , the Pentagon - Pakistani military partnership endured , with Washington continuing to view the Pakistani military as a prized asset and the bulwark of the Pakistani state .
When the Bush administration seized on the events of September 11 , 2001 to shift to a more aggressive foreign policy aimed at securing US control over the oil resources of Central Asia and the Middle East , the Pentagon - Pakistani military relationship was injected with new vigor , and Musharraf quickly emerged as one of the US ’s most important allies .
Washington admits to having provided $ 10 billion to Pakistan since September 2001 , the vast bulk of it in the form of military aid and payments to the military for support in the “ war on terror . ”
In return , the Musharraf regime has provided pivotal logistical support for the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan , allowed US security forces to run torture centers , and is now allowing Pakistan to be used as a training ground for a possible US attack on Iran .
Even as the Musharraf regime has once again bared it fangs over the past two months , imposing a six - week state of emergency , the US has moved to further strengthen its ties with the Pakistani military .
Last week , the Democratic Party - controlled US Congress approved a further $ 785 million in aid for Islamabad for 2008 .
According to reports in the Washington Post and New York Times , under a newly concluded US - Pakistani agreement , several hundred US Special Forces will be deployed to Pakistan in the coming weeks to “ train and support indigenous counter - insurgency forces and clandestine counter - terrorism units . ” ( December 26 , Washington Post )
The working class and the struggle for democracy in Pakistan
The struggle for democracy in Pakistan is a struggle against the US - sponsored and financed military state apparatus and the imperialist - imposed nation - state system in South Asia .
It requires the intervention of Pakistan ’s toiling masses into political life in the fight for basic civil liberties , but also for jobs , public services and support for rural producers — that is , for radical anti-capitalist measures .
In the final analysis , the failure of the Pakistani bourgeoisie to adhere to even the most elementary democratic norms and its recourse time and again to military rule and extra-constitutional measures is rooted in the extreme polarization of wealth within Pakistani society and its subordination to imperialism .
No section of the bourgeois democratic opposition , including the minority of parties that called for an election boycott , is willing or able to make a genuine appeal to the masses , tying the struggle against military rule to the socio-economic grievances of the working class and Pakistan ’s peasant toilers , above all the agricultural laborers and tenant and share - crop farmers .
This is underscored by the evolution of Bhutto .
Over the past year , as opposition to the Musharraf regime became more and more publicly manifest , Bhutto time and again expressed her opposition to any popular agitation against the government , for fear it would escape the political elite ’s control .
All sections of the bourgeois opposition are dependent on the military to defend their own class privileges against the working class and to maintain the territorial integrity of the crisis - ridden Pakistani state .
They are , moreover , tied through a web of financial interconnections to imperialism .
They consequently fear and oppose a genuine popular challenge to military rule and imperialist domination .
The growing popular discontent over deepening social inequality , mounting unemployment , food and energy shortages and price rises only makes the bourgeois opposition more disinclined to make any appeal to the Pakistani people to challenge the dictatorship .
They are haunted by the fear that the once roused , Pakistan ’s toilers will not quickly be returned to the shadows and will begin to invest the call for democracy with an egalitarian content that challenges their own privileges .
As part of the struggle to mobilize the masses to bring down the Musharraf dictatorship and break the pernicious political influence of the bourgeois opposition , the working class and socialist - minded students and intellectuals should demand the immediate release of all political prisoners , the scrapping of all press restrictions , the lifting of all prohibitions on political protests and strikes , the dissolution of the Musharraf regime and the holding of genuine elections .
But in doing so , they should reject the entire framework of the ruling class debate over the constitution and democracy , which reduces democracy to the observance of a handful of civil liberties and accepts as a given Pakistan ’s capitalist order and subservient relationship to the United States and world imperialism .
Genuine democracy requires the liquidation of landlordism , the dismantling of the US sponsored military - security state , the separation of mosque from state , socialist measures to provide jobs and a secure income for all , and the overthrow of the communal state system that imperialism imposed on South Asia , with the connivance of the Indian National Congress and Muslim League , in 1947 - 48 .
It will be realized only in the form of a workers ’ and peasants ’ government that consciously links the fate of the toilers of Pakistan and South Asia to the international working class ’ struggle to put an end to capitalism .
The World Socialist Web Site appeals to our readers and supporters in Pakistan and South Asia to begin the fight for a new revolutionary party of the working class — a Pakistani section of the International Committee of the Fourth International — that will prosecute this struggle .
The sun sets behind the main Palestinian electricity company , Al - Nuseirat , in the central Gaza Strip .
January 21 , 2008
We , the Israeli organizations signed below , deplore the decision by the Israeli government to cut off vital supplies of electricity and fuel ( and therefore water , since the pumps cannot work ) , as well as essential foodstuffs , medicines and other humanitarian supplies to the civilian population of Gaza .
Such an action constitutes a clear and unequivocal crime against humanity .
Prof. John Dugard , the UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in the Palestinian Territories , called the Israeli government�s actions " serious war crimes " for which its political and military officials should be prosecuted and punished .
The killing of more than 40 civilians this past week violates , he said , " the strict prohibition on collective punishment contained in the Fourth Geneva Convention .
It also violates one of the basic principles of international humanitarian law that military action must distinguish between military targets and civilian targets . "
Indeed , the very legal framework invoked by the Israeli government to carry out this illegal and immoral act � declaring Gaza a " hostile entity " within a " conflict short of war " � has absolutely no standing in international law .
We call on the Secretary General of the UN , Mr. Ban Ki-Moon , to lead the Security Council to a decisive decision to end the siege on Gaza when it meets in emergency session on Wednesday .
We call on the governments of the world , and in particular the American government and the European Parliament , to censure Israel�s actions and , in light of recent attempts to revive the diplomatic process , to end all attacks on civilians , including the continuing demolition of Palestinian homes at an alarming rate .
We call upon the Jews of the world in whose name the Israeli government purports to speak , and upon their rabbis and communal leaders in particular , to speak out unequivocally against this offense to the very moral core of Jewish values .
And we call upon the peoples of the world to let their officials and leaders know of their repudiation of this cruel , illegal and immoral act � an act that stands out in its cruelty even in an already oppressive Israeli Occupation .
We condemns attacks on all civilians , and we acknowledge the suffering of the residents of Sderot .
Still , those attacks do not justify the massive disproportionality of Israeli sanctions over a million and half civilians of Gaza , in particular in light of Israel�s oppressive 40 year occupation .
Such violations of international law by a government are especially egregious and must be denounced and punished if the very system of human rights and international law is to be preserved .
The Israeli government�s decision to punish Gaza�s civilian population , with all the human suffering that entails , constitutes State Terrorism against innocent people .
Only when Israeli policy - makers are held accountable for their actions and international law upheld will a just peace be possible in the Middle East .

The UK government must either extend furlough , or give us the powers to do it ourselves .
There ’s too many jobs on the line right now for us not to do something .
The Endeavour space shuttle has landed successfully at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
An increase of plastic waste in the Pacific is putting birds and animals on the Midway Islands at risk .
In one of the PVC end caps , drill a single small hole in the center .
This hole should be correctly sized to snugly receive the little outlet nozzle of your butane can .
In the other end cap , drill a group of 5 or 6 small holes clustered in the center ( like a pepper shaker ) .
After putting a piece of paper towel or coffee filter inside it for filtration , put the end cap with several holes on one end of the pipe .
Push it on there real tight .
This is the bottom .
Fill the pipe up with plant matter that has been pulverized into a coarse powder .
You want it filled , but not packed down .
( Full pipe estimated at 1.5 oz capacity , but this is a guess .
I did not weigh it . )
Place the top end cap on the pipe .
Again , push it on as securely as you can by hand .
Find a location outdoors with a decent breeze .
You want these butane fumes to be quickly carried away .
Seriously .
Mount the pipe ( single hole - side up ) over a vessel that can hold 300 mL + .
Beakers are perfect .
A lab stand and clamp are ideal for the mounting , but a regular shop clamp or anything that can hold it sturdily is fine .
( Avoid metal if you can , to reduce the chance of sparks . )
Position the bottom end of the pipe immediately over ( 1 - 2 " ) the receiving vessel to eliminate splatter loss .
Turn the butane gas can upside down and dispense the gas into the pipe via the single top hole .
A whole 8 - oz can takes about 10 - 12 seconds to evacuate .
Be brave , swift , and careful .
A spark at this moment would spell disaster since you have basically created an incendiary explosive device that is leaking .
When you 've exhausted the can into the pipe , back off to a nice distance and let it do its thing .
For those of us who never quite got over the loss when fine - quality hash oil disappeared from the market , and for cannabis connoisseurs of all ages everywhere , it would be my honor to write up what has to be the easiest , highest - yielding and most selective cannabis oil extraction method available to date .
This method has its basis in a fascinating industrial extraction method known as Supercritical Fluid Extraction .
It uses totally over - the - counter butane gas ( 8 oz can , camping supply store , ~ US $ 4.50 ) as the extraction solvent , and requires nothing even remotely suspicious or difficult to purchase .
The only other thing needed is about $ 2.00 worth of PVC pipe : a section 1.5 ( one and a half ) feet long and 1 & 3/4 " diameter ( outer diameter I believe ) , and two end caps .
Threaded PVC is not necessary .
For reasons not yet clear to those of us investigating these things " unofficially , " butane ( and perhaps other gas / solvents with similar ultra - low - boiling properties ) selectively solvate the desirable fraction (s ) of cannabis oils , pulling out only a beautiful amber " honey oil " and leaving the undesirable vegetative oils , waxes , chlorophyll , etc. behind in the plant matter .
Even unsmokable shade leaves produce a wonderfully clean and potent gold oil with this method .
I have every reason to suspect that this would work splendidly to extract a super - strong and tasty oil from gross , unpalatable " schwag " commercial pot too , and of course , the better grade of herb you put it in , the better the resulting oil .
Note that the amount of honey oil resulting is very low .
Cannabis leaf and bud varies in THC content from 0.5 % to over 10 % for extremely high potency bud , with the average for normal quality material in the 1 - 3 % range .
With a perfect extraction ( this method will not approach 100 % ) , that would mean less than a gram of oil from each ounce of leaf and between 1 and 3 grams of oil from each ounce of high - potency bud .
The primary use for this technique is to render leaf into a form more appropriate for medical use by removing other tars and ash - producing material from the psychoactive principals .
The butane moves down the pipe , extracting the cannabis as it goes .
When it gets to the bottom ( ~30 seconds after dispensing ) , it begins to drain into the receiving vessel .
Notice the pale , glowing yellow - green - gold hue of the extract .
It is obvious no chlorophyll was pulled out of the herb .
Over approximately five to eight minutes , the butane extract will finish draining from the pipe to the receiving vessel .
Maintain caution with the pipe , however , since there is a lot of residual butane still evaporating from within the pipe ( notice the stream of fumes coming from the top hole ) .
When it slows down to a drop every few seconds , you can tap on the top hole with your finger and it will help push the last of the liquid butane out ( or one can gently blow into the top hole to do the same thing ) .
Remember , NO SMOKING , unless you wish to immolate yourself in grand fashion .
Being very low - boiling and volatile , the collected butane will likely begin boiling at ambient temperature .
The receiving vessel will gradually frost up as the butane cools it down , slowing down its rate of evaporation , but you can speed this up again simply by holding it in your hands .
A better way is to set it in a saucepan containing a little bit of warm water .
Watch the butane start bubbling madly with the increase in temperature and marvel at its low boiling point .
Again , be doing this outdoors with a nice breeze !
It takes about 20 minutes or so to allow the butane to evaporate , or quicker if you help it along .
You are left with a deep amber , almost orange oil of amazing purity .
The best way to collect and store the oil is probably to let all of the butane evaporate off and then redissolve the oil in some anhydrous or high - % alcohol , and then pour this into a vial and let it sit out for a day or two to allow the alcohol to evaporate .
Trying to transfer the oil into a small container while it is still solvated by the butane is too risky .
I learned the hard way about this , thanks to the volatile temperament of butane .
I had filled a vial almost all the way to the top and was preparing to drop those last couple drops in , so that cleverly , I could let the last of the butane evaporate from the vial and the oil would all be neatly contained .
But when the last drop hit the mother lode in the vial , it changed the temperature of the solution in the vial upward by a hair and it all " superboiled " out of the vial and onto my fingers , which of course startled me and caused me to drop the vial .
I suggest dissolving it in alcohol as I mentioned above .
If you can get pure or 99 % isopropanol ( isopropyl ) , use it , because THC 's photosensitivity reportedly does not occur in isopropanol .
The final product is a deep yellow - amber oil of the highest quality , incredibly pure and potent .
I remember well some of the prime " honey oil " hash oils that hit the market in the late 1970s , and this stuff stands up to ( if not exceeds ) any of them .
It 's amazing how this method extracts only the good fraction and leaves the junk in the weed .
But that 's exactly what it does .
Note also that this oil has a somewhat higher melt / vaporization point than traditional hash oils ; the traditional dispensing method ( dipping a needle or paper clip in , getting some goop on the end , and warming it with a flame to get it to drip off into your bowl ) still works with this stuff , but it seems you have to be more careful with it because it does n't heat to liquid state as quickly or in the same manner , and it can more easily be allowed to burn up on your needle .
So be careful .
There should be no remaining solvent smells when the oil is finished .
If there are , the oil needs more time to evaporate off the butane .
Those who prefer a tincture - like preparation can of course thin the product a little with a bit of warm high - percentage alcohol like Everclear or 90 - whatever - % isopropyl , then drop it onto buds or let a joint absorb some , then let the alcohol evaporate .
I also observed that unlike hash oil derived from traditional methods , this product is not immediately soluble in room - temp alcohol ; it needed to be warmed before it dissolved fully .
So there it is .
Spread the word far and wide : honey oil is BACK ![ Erowid Note : Some concern has been expressed about the possibility of a PVC residue in the final product .
This has not been verified , but a possible solution would be to use steel instead .
Some reliable chemists have stated that PVC should be resistant to butane , but a preliminary flush of the PVC to remove any residue left from production might be warranted .
Opinions differ about how much PVC interacts with or is dissolved by butane , but a number of PVC chemical resistance tables used in the plastics industry indicate that PVC and butane do not interact much .
According to the " PVC Chemical Reistance Guide : First Edition " , 2009 , by IPEX , butane is marked as " R : Generally Resistant " .
According to Spilltech 's " PVC CHEMICAL RESISTANCE CHART " , Butane is " Good / No data available " .
It should be noted that there are many different forms of PVC , from clear , flexible tubing to the more rigid opaque white " schedule 40 " pipe used for drinking water lines .
The flexible , clear PVC is likely NOT suitable to use with butane .
Many people report using stainless steel turkey basters as small , home alternatives to PVC .
Some turkey basters have tips that can fit into or around a butane can nozzle . ]
Pentagon report finds no evidence of Saddam attempt to assassinate Bush Nick Juliano
Published : Monday March 24 , 2008
|
Print This Email This In President Bush 's view , former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was many things -- a developer of weapons of mass destruction , an ally of al Qaeda and " a guy that tried to kill my dad . "
Recent intelligence reports have already shot down those first two notions .
No WMD stockpiles were found in Iraq after the US invasion , and a just - released Pentagon assessment failed to find any " smoking gun " link between Saddam and the terror group that plotted the 9/11 attacks .
Now skepticism is newly enveloping allegations of an Iraqi plot to assassinate former President George H.W. Bush during a trip to Kuwait in 1993 .
Newsweek 's Michael Isikoff reports that the same Pentagon report that has essentially disproved an Iraq - al Qaeda link also calls into question the 1993 plot that spurred former President Bill Clinton to launch a Tomahawk cruise - missle strike against Saddam 's Iraqi Intelligence Service ( IIS ) .
Isikoff writes :
The review , conducted for the Pentagon 's Joint Forces Command , combed through 600,000 pages of Iraqi intelligence documents seized after the fall of Baghdad , as well as thousands of hours of audio - and videotapes of Saddam 's conversations with his ministers and top aides .
The study found that the IIS kept remarkably detailed records of virtually every operation it planned , including plots to assassinate Iraqi exiles and to supply explosives and booby - trapped suitcases to Iraqi embassies .
But the Pentagon researchers found no documents that referred to a plan to kill Bush .
The absence was conspicuous because researchers , aware of its potential significance , were looking for such evidence .
" It was surprising , " said one source familiar with the preparation of the report ( who under Pentagon ground rules was not permitted to speak on the record ) .
Given how much the Iraqis did document , " you would have thought there would have been some veiled reference to something about [ the plot ] . "
Isikoff notes that the absence of evidence does not prove the Iraqis were n't planning to assassinate the former question ( just as Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously said about Iraq WMD never found , that " the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence " ) , but his latest report adds to questions that have been raised about the alleged plot since the months before and after the missile strike it inspired .
On May 27 , 1993 , the Boston Globe obtained a CIA report that questioned Kuwait 's claims of the Iraqi plot to assassinate Bush ( via Nexis ) : A classified US intelligence analysis has concluded that Kuwait may have " cooked the books " on an alleged plot to assassinate former President Bush while he was in Kuwait last month . [...]
At least one administration official has expressed the fear that President Clinton , under heavy criticism for his indecision over issues like Bosnia , may be tempted to hit at Iraq to prove his willingness to undertake resolute action .
The report notes that some of the evidence definitely points to Iraqi involvement .
The explosive devices captured by the Kuwaitis , for example , match those used by Iraqi intelligence in other terrorist operations .
But the report says it was unable to corroborate the Kuwaiti assertion that the plot was aimed at Bush .
In November 1993 , the New Yorker 's tenacious investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported , " [ M ] y own investigations have uncovered circumstantial evidence , at least as compelling as the [ Clinton ]
Administration's , that suggests that the American government 's case against Iraqas it has been outlined in public , anyway is seriously flawed . "
Join the national Call - In for Peace .
A diverse coalition of Peace & Justice groups are coordinating a unified phone campaign to get Congress to reject additional Iraq war funding – the Bush supplemental appropriations request for $ 93 billion more .
1- 888-851-1879
With the Democratic leadership signaling weakness and half - hearted amendments aimed at undermining the surge but not the war , our coalition is phoning in a loud and clear message :
NO MORE FUNDING FOR WAR .
VOTE NO ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL .
BRING OUR TROOPS HOME . .
.AND OUT OF IRAQ’S CIVIL WAR .
When you call your Senate and Congressional offices , politely tell them one or two of the following points :
~ Most Iraqis “ “ both Sunni and Shia — want US troops out of their country and most believe attacks on our troops are justified .
~ US military force is no solution in Iraq “ “ especially given the tainted rationales for invading Iraq , cultural gaps , Abu Ghraib , etc .
Diplomacy , not war , is the solution .
~ The American people at the polls in November and in opinion polls have expressed their view that the US needs to get out .
Four years is enough !
~ With its Constitutionally - granted “ power of the purse , ”  Congress has the duty to end the war by cutting off war funding , except what ’s needed for the prompt , safe , orderly withdrawal of all our troops .
~ And please mention to your Congressperson(s ) that Impeachment is Justice , and Justice should NEVER be off the table – Impeach Bush and Cheney .
Each day from March 5 through March 13 , different national groups in our alliance will spark phone calls to Congress .
Instead of just one day of calls , we ’ll keep pressure on Congress for over a week leading up to the Iraq Supplemental vote .
Thanks to our toll - free number ( connected directly to the Capitol Hill switchboard ) , we ’ll track how many calls we can generate when we all work together .
ImpeachforPeace.org members and supporters can call any of the following days or ALL of the following days .

How do you get people interested in a $ 1,500 keyboard ?
Simple , turn each key into an OLED screen .
When you hit caps lock , the keys change to show they 're upper case .
Play a first - person shooter and the WASD keys turn into arrows .
The Optimus Maximus keyboard brought this audacious idea to life , although since it was first shown in 2005 the hardware has gone through many delays .
So many delays , in fact , that Art. Lebedev was accused of promoting " vaporware " up until the price was announced , at which point there was a whole new set of sticker - shock - induced complaints .
At CES this year we stopped by Art. Lebedev Studio's booth at CES to put our fingers on the home row of the Maximus , and it is definitely a stunning piece of hardware when seen in person .
The screens are bright and easy to read , although the buttons press down around the screens themselves so that the images never move up and down , something that felt odd at first .
Also , the keys are slightly larger than you may be used to ( unlike some other hardware that we 've looked at ) , so it took me a few tries to type a sentence without any mistakes .
One question I had for Art. Lebedev concerned the durability of the screens .
I 'm a bad abuser of keyboards ; I often eat at my desk , so turning a keyboard upside down after I 've used it for a month or so would probably disgust most people .
So what happens if you damage a key and blow out the the tiny screen ?
Simple , I 'm told .
Replacement keys can be ordered online for $ 10 each .
In fact , the lowest - priced configuration for the keyboard is only $ 462 , and comes with one OLED screen in the keyboard , inside the space bar .
Other configurations with differing numbers of OLED screens are available below the full - priced 113 - screen configuration , so you can , in essence , order the base keyboard and add a few screens every paycheck .
" It 's like a payment plan , " I say , as Audrey Dyakov , the general manager of Lebedev , removes a key and replaces it with a little plastic tool .
" Exactly ! " he tells me , nodding vigorously .
It 's an odd idea , buying a keyboard with such large keys and adding ten or fifteen OLED screens every few weeks until you have a full keyboard .
One can imagine the excitement of finally putting that backspace key in , completing the collection .
Is hitting a button with an Ars Technica logo on it to get directly to this site worth $ 1,500 ?
Probably not , but if you 've already sprung for the keyboard it 's definitely worth the extra $ 10 , no matter what configuration you settle on .
Even though the ship date has been pushed back to some time in the second half of February , it 's nice to know there is a real , working model out there .
Time to start saving your pennies .

Chris Matthews has being going after Hillary Clinton with a passion during the campaign , but on this morning 's Chris Matthews
Show it was n't just Tweety who was doubting her , his panelists were all in agreement -- there 's a long way to go in the primary season , but right now , things do n't look good for Hillary Clinton .
The consensus was that the message that worked for Barack Obama in Iowa was change , yet Clinton is still playing the experience card in New Hampshire .
It 's obvious that she is n't going to give up and has plenty of money to stay in for the long haul , but the feeling among all the panelists is that Hillary is going to have to change her message and image if she wants to beat Obama .
So much can happen in an instant -- is this line of thinking premature ?
For nearly two decades Evan Dooley quietly made a living trading commodities like wheat in his home state , Tennessee , far from the hurly - burly of Wall Street .
But on Thursday Mr. Dooley , 40 , became the talk of the financial markets when MF Global , the giant commodities brokerage firm , accused him of making unauthorized trades that led to $ 141.5 million in losses for the firm .
Mr. Dooley , the firm said , wagered on wheat futures with money he did not have .
Mr. Dooley , who worked in the firm ’s Memphis office , had bought as many as 15,000 wheat futures , the equivalent of about 10 percent of the market for these contracts for any given month , company officials said .
MF
Global discovered the trades early Wednesday morning and ran up the losses as it desperately unwound the positions in a volatile market .
“ This is a very disappointing situation for us , ” said Kevin Davis , the chief executive of MF Global , in a conference call with investors and reporters on Thursday .
The company ’s stock plunged nearly 28 percent .
The rogues gallery of pay - for - failure CEOs is scheduled to get three new inductees Thursday , when the chief executive of Countrywide Financial Corp . and the former heads of Merrill Lynch & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are hauled before a congressional committee to defend their multimillion - dollar compensation packages amid the subprime - mortgage mess .
The trio make inviting targets .

" Biltmore can't log in , " David 's boss said in a panic , " you need to fix this .
Now ! "
It was the perfect way to start a Monday morning .
When Biltmore could n't log in , that meant that Biltmore could n't get Biltmore 's executive reports .
And that meant that the entire company would grind to a halt and focus entirely on getting Biltmore 's reports .
Grudgingly , David called up Biltmore .
And as expected , Biltmore was n't happy .
" It keeps asking for my bloody PIN number , " Biltmore cursed , " Why do I have to keep typing in my bloody PIN number ?
I need my reports ! "
For some reason - perhaps the original developer 's insanity , or perhaps Biltmore 's - the executive reporting system authenticated users with a four - digit PIN number .
David selected his own name from the list and typed in his PIN number : 7734 .
And the system worked like a charm .
Well , as charming as a rickety , old PHP - based reporting can be .
No one had touched the code in ages , so David assumed the problem was with Biltmore 's browser .
Perhaps it was overflowing temp files ?
Or security settings ?
Disabled cookies ?
Corrupt files ?
David tried it all to no avail .
And each step of the way , Biltmore became more and more aggravated .
" Where are my reports ! ? "
Biltmore insisted , " I need them now ! "
On a whim , David asked Biltmore for his PIN number .
" Hmphf , " Biltmore scoffed , " I just changed it , and now I 'll have to change it again !
My bloody PIN number is 0010 ! "
And then it hit him .
David made a new account , set the PIN number to be " 0010 , " and logged in .
He clicked through the site for exactly ten seconds .
And then he was kicked off .
It asked him for his PIN again .
Confirming his suspicion , he jumped into the logon code ...
$ _SESSION [' TIMEOUT ' ] = $ this ->getTimeOut ( ) ;
Digging a bit further , David looked for getTimeOut ...
function getTimeOut ( ) { return $ _POST [' pin_number ' ] ; }
Fearing that he'd break the old PHP system , David reset Biltmore 's PIN number to 1337 and cautioned Biltmore about changing it to anything " less than " 1000 again .

But that 's not all ...
3.1 . Say Cheese Figure 2 The Cheese program .
GNOME 2.22 introduces a new application , Cheese .
Cheese lets you take photos and make videos using your computer 's webcam .
You can apply a range of different effects like mauve , noir / blanc , shagadelic , and warp .
You can share these photos and videos with your friends , load them into F - Spot , or set them as your account photo .
3.2 . Window Compositing GNOME 2.22 introduces window compositing on capable platforms .
Fitting with GNOME 's " keeping it simple " policy , the features are very low key .
The most noticeable changes are drop shadows on windows , live previews when switching windows with Alt + Tab , and transparency effects .
Not all graphics hardware reliably supports compositing , so this feature is currently turned off by default and not yet exposed in the preferences .
If you know you have graphics hardware that supports compositing , you can run the following command : gconftool - 2 -s -- type bool / apps / metacity / general / compositing _manager true from the run dialog , or set the key in the Configuration Editor .
To disable compositing , set the key to false .
3.3 . Better Networked Filesystems GNOME 2.22 introduces GVFS : a new network - transparent virtual filesystem layer for GTK +.
GVFS is designed to overcome the shortcomings of the older GNOME - VFS system .
Improvements over GNOME - VFS include remembering login credentials for the entire session and being more resilient to failures .
Many GNOME applications are already using GVFS , including all of the core applications .
With the switch to GVFS , GNOME is now using the Freedesktop.org Desktop Trash Can specification to handle the storage of deleted files .
Some new protocols are also available .
cdda:// will show all of the audio tracks on a CD , available as WAV files .
gphoto2:// will give you access to any connected digital cameras .
GNOME 's File Manager is now smarter about removable media , and will show you an information bar with possible actions when you insert removable media or browse to a folder on a removable drive .
Technical information about GVFS is available in Section 6.1 ― GVFS and GIO under What 's New For Developers .
3.4 . DVD , Digital TV , and More GNOME 's Movie Player now offers improved support for DVD playback as well as support for digital television ( DVB ) .
Also appearing in 2.22 is a selection of new plugins , including support for MythTV , Youtube , and Tracker - based searching .
This release also features playlist sharing and the ability to select subtitles for files .
GNOME 2.22 premieres the capability to preview and play Flash content and video using the free and open Flash decoder swfdec .
3.5 . International Clock
No need to do any more mental arithmetic to work out what time your teleconference starts in Sydney .
GNOME 2.22 now has internationalisation built into its clock .
You can add multiple locations from around the world to see the local time and weather .
Figure 3
The international clock .
3.6 . Continual Evolution Evolution continues to be improved with new support for Google Calendars and custom message labels ( tagging ) for your email .
Figure 4 Evolution showing a Google Calendar .
Work has also gone into improving the speed of spam filtering and making error dialogs less intrusive on your desktop session by using the status bar rather than popups .
3.7 . Remote Desktop New in GNOME 2.22 is the Remote Desktop Viewer .
This application complements the existing remote desktop server support in GNOME .
It features the ability to discover machines on the local network and bookmark your favorites .
Figure 5 Remote Desktop Viewer interacting with the current desktop .
Users desiring more control over the remote desktop server will also appreciate the addition of an Advanced tab in the properties dialog .
3.8 . Simplified Keyboard Settings
The keyboard layout and keyboard accessibility preferences have been merged into one dialog , putting every keyboard setting you need in one place .
Desktop Keyboard Shortcuts remain separate .

much , much more that you 'll have to install or upgrade to see !
4. What 's New in Accessibility 4.1 . Screenreading and Magnification Improvements
Screenreading and Magnification Improvements 4.2 . New Mouse Accessibility 4.1 . Screenreading and Magnification Improvements Orca , GNOME 's screenreading technology , has many exciting improvements in 2.22 .
Close collaboration with Mozilla has led to excellent accessibility in Firefox 3 , including support in Orca for Accessible Rich Internet Applications ( ARIA ) and Live Regions .
This allows for much richer accessibility with today 's modern , dynamic web applications .
Orca in GNOME 2.22 also adds support for level 2 contracted braille .
A
Lot of work has also gone into improving its quality and stability .
The screen magnifier has been improved and can now take advantage of technology like X compositing to allow smoother scrolling and fullscreen scrolling on hardware that supports it .
There is also improved support for colorblind filters .
4.2 . New Mouse Accessibility GNOME 2.22 now includes a set of special accessibility enhancements for controlling the mouse .
Features include : the ability to capture the pointer within a region of the screen ;
the ability to open the contextual menu with only one mouse button ; and
the ability to perform different types of clicks ( e.g. single click , double click , context click , and dragging ) without using a mouse button ( usually referred to as a dwelling ) .
Figure 7 Mouse Accessibility options .
5. What 's New For Administrators 5.1 . PolicyKit Integration
PolicyKit Integration 5.2 . Better System Tools 5.1 . PolicyKit Integration PolicyKit is a new cross -desktop security framework .
The purpose of PolicyKit is to provide a consistent way for user applications to gain extra privileges , e.g. for administrative applications .
Using PolicyKit , administrators can now configure system - wide settings .
For example , you might allow some user to adjust the date and time of the clock , or you might grant specific users the ability to start and stop system services .
For users , control panels now feature unlock buttons next to settings they are not currently authorized to change .
Clicking on the unlock button will ask the user to provide extra authorization credentials .
Figure 8 Network Settings .
5.2 . Better System Tools GNOME 's system administration tools now monitor for changes in the configuration files they 're editing .
This means that if another administrator changes the configuration , your display is updated to reflect those changes .
The Shared Folders tool now allows you to edit the SMB user database ( smbpasswd ) .
The Network tool can now set up PPPoE and GPRS connections .
6 . What 's New For Developers
The GNOME 2.22 Developer Platform provides a stable base for independent software developers to create third - party applications .
GNOME and its platform are licensed to allow the creation of both free and proprietary software to run on top of GNOME .
Libraries in the GNOME Platform are guaranteed to be API and ABI stable for the rest of the GNOME 2.x release series .
Libraries in the GNOME Desktop do not have this guarantee , but most remain consistent from release to release .
6.1 . GVFS and GIO
GVFS and GIO 6.2 .
Anjuta IDE 6.1 . GVFS and GIO GVFS is a userspace virtual file system with backends for protocols like SFTP , FTP , DAV , SMB , ObexFTP .
GVFS is the replacement for GNOME - VFS .
GNOME - VFS should now be considered deprecated , and developers should not use it in new applications .
GVFS consists of two parts : GIO , a new shared library that is part of GLib and provides the API for GVFS ; and
GVFS itself , a new package containing backends for various file system types and protocols such as SFTP , FTP , DAV , SMB and ObexFTP .
GVFS / GIO aims to provide a modern , easy - to - use VFS system .
Its goal is to provide an API that developers prefer over raw POSIX IO calls .
Rather than cloning the POSIX IO API , it provides a higher - level , document - centric interface .
As well as reading and writing files , GIO provides facilities for file monitoring , asynchronous IO , and filename completion .
GVFS works by running a single master daemon ( gvfsd ) that keeps track of the current GVFS mounts .
Each mount is run in a separate daemon .
( Some mounts share a daemon process , but most do n't . )
Clients talk to the mounts with a combination of D - Bus calls ( on the session bus and using peer - to - peer D - Bus ) and a custom protocol for file contents .
Moving the backends out of process minimises dependency bloat for applications and makes the whole system more robust .
GVFS also offers a FUSE mountpoint in ~/.gvfs / so that GVFS mounts can be exposed to legacy applications using standard POSIX IO .
Unlike GNOME - VFS , connections in GVFS are stateful .
This means that a user only needs to enter his or her password once , not over and over again for each successive connection .
With the switch to GVFS , automounting and autostart are now handled directly by Nautilus rather than gnome - volume - manager .
API documentation for using GIO is available online along with migration guides for moving from POSIX IO and GNOME - VFS to GIO .
6.1.1 . Regressions 6.1.1 .
Regressions
Although GVFS fixes a lot of problems that previously existed by using GNOME - VFS , there are currently some feature regressions .
Most notable is the lack of fonts :// and themes :// targets .
These issues will be fixed as soon as possible .
There are also some applications that still remain to be ported over to GVFS .
The state of this port is documented online .
6.2 . Anjuta IDE
The Anjuta IDE is now a part of the GNOME Developer Suite .
Anjuta is a GNOME - integrated IDE that offers many features for developers , such as an integrated debugger , integrated Glade UI editor , and a Valgrind interface .

8. Installing GNOME
You can try out GNOME 2.22 with the LiveCD , which contains all of the software included in GNOME 2.22 on a single CD .
You can boot your computer directly from the LiveCD without installing anything .
The LiveCD can be downloaded from the GNOME BitTorrent site .
To install or upgrade your machine to GNOME 2.22 , we recommend you install official packages from your vendor or distribution .
Popular distributions will make GNOME 2.22 available very soon , and some already have development versions with GNOME 2.22 available .
You can get a list of distributions that ship GNOME and discover the latest versions they ship on our Get Footware page .
If you are brave and patient and would like to build GNOME from source , we recommend you use one of the build tools .
GARNOME builds GNOME from release tarballs .
You will need GARNOME 2.22.x to build GNOME 2.22 .x .
There is also jhbuild , which is designed to build the latest GNOME from SVN .
You can use jhbuild to build GNOME 2.22.x by using the gnome - 2.22 moduleset .
While it is possible to build GNOME directly from the release tarballs , we strongly recommend the use of one of the build tools above .
9. Looking Forward to GNOME 2.24 Development does n't stop with GNOME 2.22 .
Work has already begun on GNOME 2.24 , due to be released exactly six months after 2.22 .
Some of the exciting things to look forward to in GNOME 2.24 will hopefully include : a new version of GNOME 's Ekiga VoIP client featuring a revamped user interface and SIP presence support ;
the Empathy instant messaging client utilising the Telepathy communications framework ;
the often requested column and list views in GNOME 's File Manager ;
the completion of the port from GNOME - VFS to GVFS ; and
bug fixes , performance improvements , and memory improvements throughout the desktop .
GNOME 's roadmap details the developers ' plans for the next release cycle , and the GNOME 2.24 release schedule will appear soon .
Interesting allegation :
… federal law enforcement officials who need to know have already learned the identities of those responsible for running the Storm worm network , but that U.S. authorities have thus far been prevented from bringing those responsible to justice due to a lack of cooperation from officials in St. Petersburg , Russia , where the Storm worm authors are thought to reside .

B - 2 bombers evade radar signals , making them hard to attack
The United States Air Force ( USAF ) said both pilots had ejected safely before the plane came down at Andersen Air Force Base , shortly after take - off .
A spokeswoman said it was the first time a B - 2 had crashed .
B - 2 bombers , which can evade most radar signals , cost about $ 1.2bn ( £ 610 m ) each to build .
They have a range of 6,000 nautical miles ( 11,112 km ) without refuelling and have seen service in Kosovo , Iraq and Afghanistan .
Thick , black smoke could be seen coming from the wreckage following the crash .
Lieutenant Colonel Doug Smith from the USAF told the BBC that the crash would be investigated .
" The two pilots ... ejected prior to the crash .
One of them was medically evaluated and released and the other is in a stable condition at a naval hospital , " he said .

Forest Replacing Tundra At Rapid Rate
by Staff Writers
Edmonton , Canada ( SPX ) Mar 07 , 2007
Forests of spruce trees and shrubs in parts of northern Canada are taking over what were once tundra landscapes -- forcing out the species that lived there .
This shift can happen at a much faster speed than scientists originally thought , according to a new University of Alberta study that adds to the growing body of evidence on the effects of climate change .
The boundary , or treeline , between forest and tundra ecosystems is a prominent landscape feature in both Arctic and mountain environments .
As global temperatures continue to increase , the treeline is expected to advance but the new research shows that this shift will not always occur gradually but can surge ahead .
" The conventional thinking on treeline dynamics has been that advances are very slow because conditions are so harsh at these high latitudes and altitudes , " said Dr. Ryan Danby , from the Department of Biological Sciences .
" But what our data indicates is that there was an upslope surge of trees in response to warmer temperatures .
It 's like it waited until conditions were just right and then it decided to get up and run , not just walk . "
Danby and Dr. David Hik , also from the Faculty of Science , reconstructed changes in the density and altitude of treeline forests in southwestern Yukon over the past 300 years .
Using tree rings , they were able to date the year of establishment and death of spruce trees and reconstruct changes in treeline vegetation .
The study is published in the Journal of Ecology .
They found that a rapid change in response to climate warming during the early mid 20th century was observed at all locations .
Treeline advanced considerably - as much as 85 metres elevation - on warm , south - facing slopes and tree density increased significantly - as much as 65 per cent - on cooler , north - facing slopes .
" The mechanism of change appears to be associated with occasional years of extraordinarily high seed production - triggered by hot , dry summers - followed by successive years of warm temperatures favourable for seedling growth and survival , " said Danby .
Widespread changes to treelines could have significant impacts , says Danby .
As tundra habitats are lost and fragmented , species and habitats are forced to move upwards as well .
" The problem is that in mountainous areas you can only go so high so they get forced into smaller and smaller areas , " said Danby .
These changes are of particular importance in these northern regions where First Nation people still rely heavily on the land , says Danby .
Tundra species like caribou and sheep populations , which are important parts of that lifestyle , have declined across southwestern Yukon .
As treeline advance , the reflectance of the land surface declines because coniferous trees absorb more sunlight than the tundra .
This light energy is then re-emitted to the atmosphere as heat .
This sets up a " positive feedback , " the same process that is associated with the rapidly decaying Arctic ice cap .
" These results are very relevant to the current debate surrounding climate change because they provide real evidence that vegetation change will be quite considerable in response to future warming , potentially transforming tundra landscapes into open spruce woodlands , " said Danby , who will also be participating in an International Polar Year project that will be examining treeline dynamics across the circumpolar north .
Dr. Hik is also executive director of the Canadian International Polar Year secretariat at the University of Alberta .
Did you know that resting up in bed will often worsen your sciatica condition ?
In many cases you will be better off engaging in a regular program of gentle sciatica exercises .
Bed rest is not your best bet
Understandably , many people will retire to their beds when they get an onset of sciatica .
Its seems logical that lying down will help the back to relax and repair .
Well , it turns out that in many cases this course of action will actually do you more harm than good .
After extended periods of inactivity the back muscles will weaken and the spine will lose some of it 's suppleness .
Both of which will increase your chances of back strain and serious injury .
Fortunately there is something that you can do for free in your own home : gentle sciatica exercises .
Be careful who you frag .
Having eliminated all terrorism in the real world , the U.S. intelligence community is working to develop software that will detect violent extremists infiltrating World of Warcraft and other massive multiplayer games , according to a data - mining report from the Director of National Intelligence .
The Reynard project will begin by profiling online gaming behavior , then potentially move on to its ultimate goal of " automatically detecting suspicious behavior and actions in the virtual world . "
The cultural and behavioral norms of virtual worlds and gaming are generally unstudied .
Therefore , Reynard will seek to identify the emerging social , behavioral and cultural norms in virtual worlds and gaming environments .
The project would then apply the lessons learned to determine the feasibility of automatically detecting suspicious behavior and actions in the virtual world .
If it shows early promise , this small seedling effort may increase its scope to a full project .
Reynard will conduct unclassified research in a public virtual world environment .
The research will use publicly available data and will begin with observational studies to establish baseline normative behaviors .
The publicly available report – which was mandated by Congress following earlier concerns over data - mining programs – also mentions several other data - mining initiatives .
These include :
Video Analysis and Content Extraction - software to automatically identify faces , events and objects in video
Tangram -
A system that wants to create surveillance and threat warning system that evaluates known threats and finds unknown threats to issue warnings ahead of an attack
Knowledge Discovery and Dissemination -
This tool is reminiscent of the supposedly - defunct Total Information Awareness program .
It seeks to access disparate databases to find patterns of known bad behavior .
The program plans to work with domestic law enforcement and Homeland Security .
The report gives no indication why the find - a- terrorist cell in Sims project is called Reynard , though that is a traditional trickster figure in literature .

There 's something about folks who are willing to kill for money that has always fascinated cinema audiences .
It could be the remarkable flexibility of morality that these characters display ; their willingness to cross a line that most of us could n't even consider approaching .
Or it could be that they 're really cool .
Hitman is pretty much up there with footballer and porn star as far as dream jobs go .
So , in honour of these murderous movie mainstays , we present you with cinema 's 20 greatest hitmen , crack shots every one of them .
20 . THE T - 800 in THE TERMINATOR
Who is he ?
Arnie 's T - 800 had the potential to do so well in a list of the movies ' top hitmen .
He was sent from the future and is a bona fide cybernetic bad - ass .
So why is n't he higher ?
Well , despite the quotable lines and the shades , the T - 800 could n't seal the deal .
Charged with the simple task of killing an annoying chick , he spends the film 's running time being foiled at every turn .
True , he was up against a young Michael Biehn , but he was a robot from the future and Michael Biehn is armed with nothing more than some primitive weaponry and a flasher mac .
C'mon Skynet , you can do better than that .
Greatest hit ?
The Austrian automaton wastes no time in checking out the first two Sarah Connors in the phone book .
Pow !
Pow !
19 . JIMMY 'THE TULIP ' in THE WHOLE NINE YARDS
Who is he ?
Any hitman who can get a kill by persuading Amanda Peet to whip out her mams may just be the best ever .
The reason why Jimmy The Tulip is n't , is the amazing restraint he shows in not giving Chandler a double tap to the back of the head .
We really can't put our considerable critical weight behind someone so willing to kill , yet able to pass up such a remarkable opportunity .
Anyway , in a movie where the only other highpoint is the aforementioned top bollocks , Bruce charms his way through in a manner in which only he can .
Just do n't mention the sequel .
Greatest hit ?
After shooting Jimmy in the back , Stanley Posilansky
took a really , really long time to die .
18 . MR . KIDD AND MR .
WINT in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER
Who are they ?
Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint , the homosexual hatchet men charged with taking the lead out of 007's pencil in one of the worst Bond films in the series , are n't very good hitmen .
However , you have to admire their ( perhaps stereotypically ) flamboyant approach to their work : why are n't more of cinema 's hired killers eschewing guns and knives in favour of dropping a scorpion down a shirt collar ?
And wearing suits with flared trousers ?
And not - so - subtly suggesting that they appreciate the man-love ?
Okay , we answered our own question there .
Greatest hit ?
Drowning an old lady schoolteacher in the canals of Amsterdam , then threatening to send photos of the body to her schoolkids .
17 . MICHAEL McMANUS in THE USUAL SUSPECTS
Who is he ?
As one of the usual suspects brought in by the cops at the ultimate behest of Keyser Soz� , Michael McManus brings some hitman cool to a group held back by physical disabilities , speech impediments , and Kevin Pollack .
Later on , Mikey even proves he 's been watching his John Woo movies by taking out two guys with two guns at the same time .
Big brother Alec might have been in The Simpsons , but Stephen 's involvement in this movie will always mean he 's the best Baldwin .
Although , it 's the strangest thing ...
Greatest hit ?
Sniping a target while singing Old MacDonald .
" On that farm he shot some guys , badda boom badda bing bang boom ... "
16 . PAULIE GATTO in THE GODFATHER
Who is he ?
Whatever you get up to in life , just make sure that you do n't P.O. a Sicilian , as those guys really know how to avenge a slight .
First they 'll chop the top off an equine and have it delivered to your boudoir .
Then a fat bloke will make out with you a little , and finally they 'll call in the services of a guy like Paulie Gatto , the tough - talking , meatball - eating button man .
Sure , his loyalties are flexible , so there 's every chance you might be able to save your bacon by making him an offer he can't refuse .
But chances are , even if you go to the mattresses , you 'll end up sleeping with the fishes .
Greatest hit ?
His greatest moment would have been setting up Don Corleone for the big checkout , but we all know how that worked out ...
Top hitmen 15 - 11 ! >>>

Amazon today has announced plans to take its DRM - free MP3 music store to countries beyond the United States .
In the U.S. , at least , Amazon MP3 is already the online music store of choice .
It ’s hard to compete with the largest library ( 3.3 million songs from 270,000 artists ) of restriction free music , much of which is priced lower than the going rate of $ 0.99 / track .
And it integrates seamlessly with iTunes ( or other desktop music applications ) plus works with pretty much any digital music player available .
This announcement comes just days after rumors of Yahoo considering opening an online music store , though Amazon has set the bar fairly high .
At this point , any competition ( including Apple ) has to play catch up before I ’d consider switching again .
For those curious as to which countries this might mean …
Well , the press release does n’t say explicitly .
But reading between the lines of the last sentence ( “ The company is not disclosing a specific launch timeline for individual Amazon international websites ” ) , the new offering is likely to be for those countries which already have their own separate Amazon website , namely : Canada , the United Kingdom , Germany , Austria , France , China , and Japan .
See Amazon ’s press release below :
SEATTLE–( BUSINESS
WIRE ) –Jan. 27 , 2008 –Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) today announced that in 2008 the company will begin an international rollout of Amazon MP3 , Amazon ’s DRM - free MP3 digital music store where every song is playable on virtually any digital music - capable device , including the PC , Mac( R ) , iPod( R ) , Zune ( R ) , Zen( R ) , iPhone ( TM ) , RAZR ( TM ) , and BlackBerry ( R ) .
Amazon MP3 is the only retailer to offer customers DRM - free MP3s from all four major music labels as well as over 33,000 independent labels .
“ We have received thousands of e-mails from Amazon customers around the world asking us when we will make Amazon MP3 available outside of the U.S.
They ca n’t wait to choose from the biggest selection of high - quality , low - priced DRM - free MP3 music downloads which play on virtually any music device they own today or will own in the future , ” said Bill Carr , Amazon.com Vice President of Digital Music .
“ We are excited to tell those customers today that Amazon MP3 is going international this year . ”
Launched on Amazon.com in September 2007 , Amazon MP3 offers Earth ’s Biggest Selection of a la carte DRM - free MP3 music downloads , which now includes over 3.3 million songs from more than 270,000 artists .
Every song and album in the Amazon MP3 music download store is available exclusively in the MP3 format without digital rights management ( DRM ) software and is encoded at 256 kbps to deliver high audio quality .
Amazon MP3 customers are free to enjoy their music downloads using any hardware device ; organize their music using any music management application , such as iTunes ( R ) or Windows Media Player ( TM ) ; and burn songs to CDs for personal use .
Most songs available on Amazon MP3 are priced from 89 cents to 99 cents , with more than 1 million of the over 3.3 million songs priced at 89 cents .
The top 100 bestselling songs are 89 cents , unless marked otherwise .
Most albums are priced from $ 5.99 to $ 9.99 .
The top 100 bestselling albums are $ 8.99 or less , unless marked otherwise .
Buying and downloading MP3s from Amazon MP3 is easy .
Customers can purchase downloads using Amazon 1 - Click shopping , and with the Amazon MP3 Downloader , seamlessly add their MP3s to their iTunes ( R ) or Windows Media Player ( TM ) libraries .

Which countries produce porn stars ?
Which countries produce porn stars ?
Just curious .
I have a rough intuition .
So I went to
Country # of porn star entries
Normalized porn star index
Austrian 4 188 Belgian 3 111 Brazilian 20 42 Czech 43 1627 Danish 4 283 Dutch 4 95 Finnish 4 294 French 28 170 German 23 109 Hungarian 41 1598 Indian 3 1 Iranian 1 5 Irish 0 - Italian 10 66 Japanese 66 201 Mexican 6 22 Norwegian 5 415 Polish 3 31 Romanian 4 73 Russian 2 5 Slovak 10 722 Spanish 14 121 Swedish 7 296 Turkish 2 10 Ukrainian 1 8 Venezuelan 1 14 Just curious .
I have a rough intuition .
So I went to Porn stars by nationality on Wikipedia .
I clicked the entries and tallied up the number of porn stars .
I excluded English speaking countries since I figure that the listing would be biased that way because this is an English language encyclopedia .
I created a " porn star index " by dividing the number of porn stars by population and then renormalized using the entry with the smallest value .
Labels : porn

Republican presidential hopeful John McCain on Sunday said the U.S. should step up its war on drugs as part of efforts to secure the country ’s borders .
He said that ’s because Americans are to blame for “ creating the demand ” for illegal drugs that come into the country and give too much power to drug cartels that terrorize border areas .
“ We are creating the demand .
We are creating the demand for these drugs coming across our border , which maybe means that we should go back more trying to make some progress and in telling Americans , particularly young Americans , that the use of drugs is a terrible thing for them to do , ” he said .
The Arizona senator spoke during an appearance at a central Iowa farm where he devoted much of the conversation with a few dozen supporters to foreign relations and immigration .
Edwards :
All must go to doc
ocratic presidential hopeful John Edwards said Sunday that his universal - health - care proposal would require that Americans go to the doctor for preventive care .
“ If you are going to be in the system , you ca n’t choose not to go to the doctor for 20 years .
You have to go in and be checked and make sure that you are OK , ” he told a crowd in front of the Cedar County ( Iowa ) Courthouse in Tipton .
He noted , for example , that women would be required to have regular mammograms in an effort to find and treat “ the first trace of problem . ”
Edwards and his wife , Elizabeth , announced earlier this year that her breast cancer had returned and spread .
Clinton defends the system
Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday challenged her top rivals ’ claims that she is too conventional to bring needed change to Washington , declaring “ you bring change by working in the system . ”
Clinton argued that political transformation can come only by working within established rules and seeking common ground when necessary .
Her years as part of the Washington establishment as first lady and as a New York senator have convinced her that real change can come only by seeking consensus , she told a rally on the lawn of the New Hampshire state capitol in Concord .
“ I ’ve learned you bring change by working in the system established by the Constitution , ” she said .
“ You ca n’t pretend the system does n’t exist . ”
Interaction and awareness about each other are what keeps the human race going .
We all are social animals who somewhere …
The Clinton camp , Emily ’s List and seemingly all of Left Blogistan are up in arms about an offhand comment MSNBC ’s David Shuster made in discussing Chelsea Clinton ’s role in her mother ’s campaign .
The furor led , this afternoon , to Shuster ’s suspension by the network .
Here ’s the clip in question :
So let me see if I can parse what ’s really going in this case , and I ’ll begin by saying that I have no relevant opinion on Shuster beyond this instance .
I do n’t watch him and for better or worse he ’s not part of my media or news landscape .
Let ’s start here : what do we really believe Shuster said ?
Do we think he is suggesting that the Clintons are literally whoring their daughter out ?
That seems unlikely , right ?
Do we believe this is what he actually thinks ?
Do we think this is what he intended to communicate ?
Or do we understand him to mean there ’s something not entirely kosher or appropriate about how the campaign is using Chelsea ?
If the latter , then I take it we all pretty much know what he means , right ?
That is , we ’re intelligent enough to understand that the term “ pimping ” can be used in multiple ways , and that we , being fluent speakers of contemporary English , get precisely the intent of the word as used in the context of his comments ?
No , I do n’t think any of us could be led to believe that he meant it as a compliment , but how far out of bounds would I be if I were to suggest that the furor we ’re seeing this afternoon is n’t entirely honest , intellectually speaking ?
I mean , if this is the most appalling thing that is said during this campaign , we ’ll know we ’ve entered a new golden age of civility in political discourse .
Trust me , folks , I get the signification power of language .
I spent plenty of time in doctoral seminars surrounded by people who could be described as radical constructionists – that is , they believe that socially speaking there ’s damned near no such thing as actual , objective reality .
It ’s all – all – constructed , primarily through language .
Language does n’t just express thought , it dictates what can be thought .
And so on .
So please , let ’s have no lectures on the power of language , etc .
I get a little nervous when we wander so close to this precipice : what you intended is of absolutely no importance , even if I clearly understood it .
The only thing that matters is who wins the ensuing media football game .
This is n’t new , of course .
It ’s merely a public media bubbling up of an academic project that began decades ago with de Saussure and the Structuralists , and which has been force - marched to its illogical extreme by a generation or two of radical deconstructionism .
There is no such thing as an individual .
The subject is a myth .
There is no such thing as authorial intent – because there is no such thing as an author .
And so on .
Let me relate an illustrative story from several years ago .
In a rampaging debate thread on one of my academic lists I got a little annoyed with something a prominent deconstructionist scholar had written ( he was n’t a member of this particular group ) .
So I poleaxed his argument .
Somebody on the list knew him ( I think the person was a student at the university where he taught ) and took my critique to him for comment .
The man ’s response was a marvel to me at the time , and still is .
In a nutshell he said that he wished he were n’t a post - structuralist / deconstructionist because he thought I was misinterpreting his words .
But he could n’t say I was wrong , because according to his philosophy he really could n’t assert any ownership of his own intent .
Let me boil that down a bit .
He said that I had more right to define the meaning of his writing than he did .
I want you to think about this and apply it to your own world for a minute .
Imagine living in a situation where your words can be twisted to mean anything and you have no recourse .
You literally are not allowed to argue that what you meant matters .
Davis Shuster is not Don Imus , unless there are facts that I am as yet unacquainted with .
Imus had established a context where it was impossible not to read “ nappy - headed hos ” as anything but more of the same .
But I see no examples of Shuster as a misogynyst .
In fact , it ’s telling to read the Emily ’s List statement linked above , which has to attack MSNBC not for the prior misdeeds of Shuster , but for its tolerance of bad behavior by other personalities .
Surely if there were a bad - Shuster context we ’d hear about it there , right ?
All of which leads me to the conclusion that people are n’t just overreacting , they ’re doing so according to a fairly transparent agenda .
No attempt is being made to participate in good - faith communication .
Quite the contrary .
This is about cynical political arm - wrestling .
I do n’t have any particluar concern for Shuster , per se , but yes , I do have a dog in this fight .
I write a lot , and I damned well have a vested interest in a world where I can own what I mean .
We all know that the same words can be used in ways that are innocuous and offensive , and we understand which is which by resorting to inflection , tone , syntax , what we know about the speaker and the forum , and so on .
If we choose to ignore these critical communication and meaning - making markers , then we can turn just about any statement into justification for a duel .
If we do n’t rely on these meaning - making tools , then fuck everybody , because I can say anything and never be held accountable again , right ?
If I ’m not in control of my meaning , you ca n’t blame me for anything , right ?
Right ?
I do n’t ever want to find myself in the position where I can be punked into oblivion because somebody has the power to assign meaning to my words that never existed .
That ’s part and parcel of a decades - long corrosive project of deconstructionism , and it does none of us any good .
Unless I ’m missing something .
And if I am , please enlighten me .
They 've Really Come Full Circle
return to their corners
takes it home to the bank ?
are n't sparring
allow either of them to get any momentum
mixing it up
A couple of weeks ago I wrote a column that resonated with a lot of people .
Since 2001 , I noted , " We 've lost our right to see an attorney , to confront our accusers , even to get a fair trial .
Government agents have kidnapped thousands of people , most of whom have never been heard from again .
Bush even signed an edict claiming the right to assassinate anyone , including you and me , based solely on his whims .
Torture , the ultimate sign that civilized society has been replaced by a police state , " has been legalized .
None of the major presidential candidates are currently promising to do what it would take to restore democracy : close Gitmo and the CIA torture chambers , get out of Afghanistan and Iraq , revoke the protofascist USA - Patriot and Military Commissions Acts , obey the Geneva Conventions and turn over Bush , his torturers , his Congressional allies and his top civilian and military officials to an international war crimes tribunal for their role in the murders of more than one million Afghans and Iraqis .
The politicians are too timid to do what 's right .
But we can bully them into it .
Let 's begin America 's long slog toward moral and political redemption by demanding that our next president 's first act be to declare the Bush Administration null and void .
Every law and act carried out between 12 noon on January 20 , 2001 and January 20 , 2009 should just ... go... poof .
My readers are cranky , distrustful and smart .
( You can read their comments at tedrall.com . )
Rallblog readers are all over the place politically : old - school Democrats , Goldwater Republicans , libertarians , socialists , anarchists , even neoconservatives .
But they 're speaking out as one about my call to expunge the legacy of the Bush Administration : Yes .
Yes .
Hell , yes !
Let 's make it happen !
Now is the time .
Write ( an actual letter , not email ) to your favorite presidential candidate and declare that you are a single - issue voter .
Swear that , if he or she agrees to sign the following Pledge , your vote is assured .
If not , promise to stay home or vote for someone else .
" I , ______________ , hereby solemnly pledge that my first act upon assuming the office of President shall be to sign an American Renewal Act of 2009 , which shall declare all laws , regulations , executive orders , treaties and actions undertaken by the federal government during the illegitimate and unlawful administration of George W. Bush to be null , void and without effect . "
Sound crazy ?
So did Thomas Paine in 1775 .
As a practical and legal matter , however , consigning Bush to the dung heap of history makes more sense than revolting against the British .
First , the law .
George W. Bush 's January 20 , 2001 inauguration was unconstitutional .
This is n't because Bush lost the popular vote .
Nor is it because he lost Florida and thus the electoral vote .
The U.S. Supreme Court 's decision to hear the Florida recount lawsuit , Bush v. Gore , violated the U.S. Constitution .
It 's a states ' rights issue .
Elections fall under state law ; the highest court that may resolve a legal challenge about an election is a state supreme court .
The U.S. Supreme Court - a federal body - did n't have jurisdiction in the case .
An American Renewal
Act is merely a confirmation of two centuries of standard practice .
There are precedents .
After France was liberated in 1944 , incoming president Charles de Gaulle declared the collaborationist government of Marshall Henri-Philippe Petain null and void .
( It was a stretch .
Unlike Bush , who carried out a judicial coup , Petain came to power legally . )
In any case , Petain vanished from textbooks .
Numerous laws passed between 1940 and 1944 , dealing with matters like taxes and construction projects , had to be debated and passed all over again .
The Southern secession of 1860 was perfectly legal , yet laws and currency issued by the Confederate government in the South were invalidated by the victorious Union in 1865 .
The main argument for erasing Bush and his nefarious deeds is a legal one : official acknowledgement that the 2000 election was stolen gets the U.S. back on the path to democracy .
( Should Al Gore should be allowed to serve the term he won in 2000 ?
I do n't know . )
There 's also an ethical principle at stake .
As de Gaulle said about Petain 's partnership with the Nazis , the Bush Administration so disgraced itself and our nation that we have to renounce it in order to restore our moral authority , to be able to face citizens of other , less despicable , countries in the eye .
Another argument is based on power .
Imagine that Gore had seized power in 2000 instead .
Now imagine that he had turned as rabid as Bush , that he had ruled as far to the left as Bush has to the right .
Businesses would have been nationalized .
Healthcare would have been socialized ; doctors would be federal employees .
Taxes on the rich would have soared while the poor got off scot - free .
Republican protesters at the Democratic National Convention would have gotten beaten up and thrown into filthy internment facilities for days on end .
Crazy Gore would have apologized for foreign policies that provoked the 9/11 attacks .
To prove he meant it , he would have sent troops to overthrow the world 's most heinous dictators , all U.S. allies , in Uzbekistan , Pakistan and elsewhere .
Now imagine that , over the years , Gore 's policies had ruined the economy and mired the military in endless , losing wars .
That people had turned again him to the same degree that they 've rejected Bush .
As Frank Rich writes in The New York Times , only 24 percent of Americans approve of the Bush Administration - almost as bad as the image of the U.S. in Pakistan .
You can bet that the Republicans , after they took back power , would carry out the mother of all rollbacks .
Gore , the rogue president , would probably wind up in prison .
There 's no reason to treat Bush and his policies any more gently .
" We are a people in clinical depression , " writes Rich .
" Americans know that the ideals that once set our nation apart from the world have been vandalized , and no matter which party they belong to , they do not see a restoration anytime soon . "
Anyone who reads Tim Weiner 's " Legacy of Ashes : The History of the CIA " knows the U.S. was damned far from perfect before Bush came along .
But Rich 's broader point is correct .
Falling short of lofty ideals is better than forgetting about them .
Demand that the major presidential candidates sign the Pledge for American Renewal .
We know the woman and half - dozen men who are leading in the polls want to rule us .
But will they lead ?

In Washington these days , people talk a lot about the collapse of the bipartisan foreign policy consensus that existed during the Cold War .
But however bitter today ’s disputes are about Iraq or the prosecution of the so - called global war on terrorism , there is one bedrock assumption about foreign policy that remains truly bipartisan :
The United States will remain the sole superpower , and the guarantor of international security and global trade , for the foreseeable future .
In other words , whatever else may change in the decades to come , the 21st century will be every bit as much of an American century as the 20th .
This assumption rests , in turn , on two interrelated beliefs .
The first is that because no country or alliance of states has shown any great desire to challenge U.S. preeminence -- or demonstrated the means of doing so -- no country is going to .
China ’s interests are regional at most , the argument goes , and the European Union is too divided , too unwilling or too weak to rebuild its once - formidable military machine .
As for Russia , believers in the durability of a world order anchored in Washington insist that its declining population and excessive reliance on its energy wealth will in the long run preclude it from playing a central role in global affairs .
The second is that the world needs the U.S. and appreciates the role it plays .
( In some versions of this argument , the world needs the U.S. far more than the U.S. needs the world . )
If there have been no serious challenges to American hegemony to date , it is asserted , it is because the U.S. provides what are referred to by foreign policy analysts as “ global goods ” :
It maintains political and economic stability around the world , it guarantees a democratic capitalist world order and , by virtue of its unparalleled military strength , it acts as a world policeman of last resort .
Whatever the merits of this case , surely it is significant that it is most often made by U.S. policy analysts and government officials ( as well as , to a lesser extent , by British officials ) .
From Pax Romana through Pax Britannica to the current Pax Americana , empires have justified their own power by insisting that they were not simply serving their own interests but rather the common good .
Looking back at the British imperial high - water mark of 1900 , H.G. Wells wrote that “ the sprawling British Empire still maintained a tradition of free trade , equal treatment and open - handedness to all comers round and about the planet . ”
Such confidence in Britain ’s fundamental benignity as an empire is matched today by figures across the American political spectrum , from Barack Obama to Rudy Giuliani , from the conservative policy analyst Robert Kagan to the liberal academic Michael Mandelbaum .
Whatever their other , substantial differences , all seem convinced that the world works best with the United States at the helm , and that without American leadership , the world would soon become more dangerous and anarchic and less prosperous .
Indeed , if they are to be believed , the only serious threat to U.S. hegemony visible anywhere on the horizon is the American people ’s potential unwillingness to support their country as it plays this role .
But what if the Americans who hold these beliefs are not , in fact , clear - eyed observers of the world scene stripped of its anti-imperial mystifications ?
Instead , what if they are people who have fallen for the same self - delusion that the British ruling class entertained before World War I , which was that their empire was so essential to world stability and , at least when compared with the alternatives and with empires past , so just that its hegemony could and would weather all challenges ?
It is hardly farfetched to scan the historical record and conclude that self - love and imperialism go together , whether it was the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes insisting that British colonialism in Africa had been “ philanthropy plus 5 % " or President Bush insisting that it was America ’s special mission to spread democracy throughout the world .
But what the historical record also shows is that imperial moments are , in fact , fleeting , and that hegemony has a shorter and shorter shelf life .
The Roman Empire lasted more than 700 years ( more than a millennium if you count the Byzantines ) ; the British Empire lasted a little more than 300 years in India and less than a century in much of Africa .
The economic challenges facing the U.S. at least suggest that America ’s time as sole superpower could be shorter still .
Americans , who grow up believing in their country ’s exceptionalism ( which in foreign policy terms often seems to mean not believing that the historical constraints that apply to other nations apply to the U.S. ) , are not predisposed to believe that American predominance could possibly be coming to an end .
And yet it seems more like wishful thinking than rational analysis to believe that the United States -- which in the coming decades will certainly have to adapt to a multipolar world in geo-economic terms , as China and India reoccupy the central place in the global economy that they had 500 years ago -- can continue indefinitely to play a hegemonic role .
The truth is that whether it is imperial Rome , imperial Spain or imperial Britain , economic strength and political strength have always gone together .
Because no one denies that the U.S. will decline in comparative terms economically ( though it will almost certainly remain one center of the world economy ) , the only way one can believe that geopolitics will not also become multipolar is to believe that the U.S. is somehow exempt from what seems one of history ’s few ironclad laws .
And that is not analysis ; that is faith .
The war in Iraq has demonstrated the limits of even America ’s vaunted military strength -- the one arena in which the U.S. is likely to remain supreme for decades to come .
In an era of asymmetric threats , conventional military power is rapidly becoming an anachronistic measure of a country ’s strength .
None of this is to say that the U.S. will not continue to be one of the most important powers -- only that its days of first dictating and then guaranteeing the rules are numbered in an era in which it has become a debtor nation .
In any case , the post - World War II structures of international governance are crumbling -- as well they might after more than six decades .
Everyone knows they need to be revised .
For the moment , the U.S. is the sole superpower .
But instead of deluding ourselves that we will go on that way into the indeterminate future , an intelligently self - interested foreign policy would have us do everything in our power to shape , according to our most urgent priorities , the international rules that will govern relations between states after the American moment has passed -- as it inevitably will .
The alternative is to go the route of the British before 1914 and imagine that because a certain set of political arrangements seems best to us , they must also be best for the world -- and destined to endure indefinitely .
The real choice that confronts us is not between a second American century and anarchy but between a multipolar world in which we will play an important role and an anti-American century .
David Rieff is the author of many books , including “ At the Point of a Gun : Democratic Dreams and Armed Intervention ” and “ A Bed for the Night : Humanitarianism in Crisis . ”
The Don Siegelman case recently publicized on 60 Minutes marks yet another nasty convergence between reality and the “ You ’re - with - us - or - you ’re - against-us ” rhetoric driving the American right these days .
For anyone who somehow managed to miss the story , which aired on February 24th , Don Siegelman was the Democratic ex-governor of Alabama .
He is currently serving a prison term for what looks like a politically motivated frame - up .
His greatest “ crime ” was apparently being a powerful and popular Democrat .
There ’s been a good bit of emoting from the Alabama GOP in response .
Before the 60 Minutes segment even broadcast they sent out a press release that was almost British in its dignified anger , bristling with Peter Cushing - ish words like “ perfidy , ” “ ludicrous charges , ” and “ grotesque imaginings ” and describing the segment as a “ hatchet job . ”
Afterwards , the Alabama GOP demanded a retraction .
" Only the most committed anti-Rove / Bush activist could swallow such a tale , " wrote party chairman Rep. Mike Hubbard .
“ What ? ”
The right wing sputters , opening its eyes very wide and laying a hand upon its chest to still the pounding of its outraged heart .
“ You say Karl Rove wrecked someone ’s life and career using trumped up criminal charges merely because he was a political threat to the Republicans ? ”
“ Why , that ’s … that ’s just crazy talk ! ”
Of course , the problem is that the right has , for the past twenty years , been doing its best to blur in the minds of thousands of people , the difference between being a liberal or a Democrat or anyone else perceived as an adversary of the G.O.P. , and being a criminal .
At the rock - bottom level you ’ve got the Freepers , Michael Savage , and that fun bunch at KSFO wishing that Democrats or other perceived critics of Bush could be arrested and charged with treason , or hanged , or electrocuted slowly and painfully in defective electric chairs .
Higher up on the food chain you ’ve got more well known personalities like Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh , and Ann Coulter describing Harry Reid as “ a propaganda minister for our enemies , ” and coverage of the Haditha scandal as “ a gang rape by the Democratic Party … to finally take us out in the war against Iraq , ” or writing bestselling books with titles like Treason : Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism .
And at the top you have GOP strategists who ’ve exploited this equation of dissent with disloyalty and criminal behavior and consider themselves clever bunnies indeed for doing so .
As far back as 1994 , Newt Gingrich described supporters of Bill Clinton as “ the enemies of normal Americans . ”
At a 2005 Conservative Party fundraiser in Manhattan Karl Rove opined " Let me just put this in fairly simple terms : Al Jazeera now broadcasts the words of Sen. Durbin to the Mideast , certainly putting our troops in greater danger .
No more needs to be said about the motives of liberals . "
The string that holds all these nasty little pearls together , from Free Republic to the DC Beltway , can be found in a 2001 online essay written by someone named Eric Heubeck for the Free Congress Foundation and entitled “ The Integration of Theory and Practice : A Program for the New Traditionalist Movement . ”
The Free Congress Foundation , I should point out , is a conservative think tank headed by Paul Weyrich , with close ties to Karl Rove .
“ We must channel undesirable impulses to serve good purposes , ” … wrote Heubeck .
“ We must be feared , so that they ( the opposition ) will think twice before opening their mouths …
We must learn to treat leftists as natural disasters or rabid dogs .
If we act as if this were in fact true ( of course , it is not ) , we will not needlessly expend our energy on being upset with our opponents . ”
In short , Heubeck advocates spreading unreasoning loathing among the masses and using it as a political weapon .
After reading his essay it ’s difficult to imagine Heubeck – or anyone else at the Free Congress Foundation -- being shocked or upset by the prospect of imprisoning a prominent Democrat solely because he ’s a prominent Democrat .
It ’s certainly consistent with “ channeling undesirable impulses . ”
In the seven years since it was published , it looks like Heubeck ’s strategy has been used to good effect .
As language from the right equating liberalism with criminality becomes more and more mainstreamed , the idea of sending someone to prison on a flimsy pretext because they ’re a powerful Democrat has become more and more palatable to a certain segment of the American population .
The recent scandal surrounding the firing of attorneys in the Justice Department who were reluctant to pursue weak cases against Democrats indicates that “ certain segment ” is not confined to the relatively powerless crackpots who post to Free Republic and send mash notes to Ann Coulter .
One of the most depressing successes of the right has been the shutting down of dialogue .
Online , the far right has pretty much made it their policy to talk only to other right - wingers in echo chambers like Free Republic or Little Green Footballs or , ( at a rock - bottom level of malicious stupidity that makes FR look like Harvard ) Conservapedia .
When a conversation with a liberal does take place , offline or online , it tends to be for a very limited amount of time in venues where the right - winger has control , like talk radio or on a cable news show with a sympathetic host .
The people who utter statements like Karl Rove ’s vile insinuation that liberals are motivated by the desire to put our troops in greater danger , or Hannity ’s equation of Reid saying that the “ [ Iraq ]
War is lost ” with being a “ propaganda minister for our enemies , ” are rarely confronted directly and in detail with the actual meanings and implications of their words .
And that ’s exactly how they want it to stay .
Because it ’s becoming increasingly obvious that the question to ask them , whether they are operating on the level of Freepers or of eager young aides to Karl Rove , is not “ Is Don Siegelman in prison now because he ’s a Democrat . ”
The question to ask them is , “ would it bother you if he were ? ”
Do n’t assume , even for a minute , that the answer would be a simple and unequivocal “ yes . ”

If the Twentieth Century proved anything , it is that the single greatest danger to human life are the thugs of the centralized political State , who extinguished more than 170 million souls during the bloodiest rampage in recorded history .
By any rational standard , modern States are the last and greatest remaining predators — and that the danger has not abated with the demise of communism and fascism .
All Western democracies currently face vast and accelerating escalations of State power and centralized control over economic and civic life .
In almost all Western democracies , the State chooses :
where children go to school , and how they will be educated
the interest rate citizens can borrow at
the value of currency
how employees can be hired and fired
how more than 50 % of their citizens ' time and money are disposed of
who a citizen 's doctor is
what kinds of medical procedures can be received — and when
when to go to war
who can live in the country
… just to touch on a few .
Most of these amazing intrusions into personal liberty have occurred over the past 90 years , since the introduction of the income tax .
They have been accepted by a population helpless to challenge the endless expansions of State power — and yet , even though most citizens have received endless pro-State propaganda in government schools , a growing rebellion is brewing .
State predations are now so intrusive that they have effectively arrested the forward momentum of society , which now hangs before a fall .
Children are poorly educated , young people are unable to get ahead , couples with children fall ever - further into debt , and the elderly are finding State medical systems collapsing under the weight of their growing needs — and State debts continue to grow .
Thus , these early years of the twenty - first century are the end of an era , a collapse of mythology comparable to the fall of fascism , communism , monarchy , or political Christianity .
The idea that the State is capable of solving social problems is now viewed with great skepticism — which foretells a coming change .
As soon as skepticism is applied to the State , the State falls , since it fails at everything except increasing its power , and so can only survive on propaganda , which relies on unquestioning faith .
Yet while most people are comfortable with the idea of reducing the size and power of the State , they become distinctly uncomfortable with the idea of getting rid of it completely .
To use a medical metaphor , if the State is a cancer , they prefer medicating it into an unstable remission , rather than eliminating it completely .
This can never work .
A central lesson of history is that States are parasites which always expand until they destroy their host population .
Because the State uses violence to achieve its ends — and there is no rational end to the expansion of violence —
States grow until they destroy civilized interaction through the corruption of money , contracts , honesty , family , and self - reliance .
As such , the cancerous metaphor is not misplaced .
People who believe that the State can somehow be contained have not accepted the fact that no State in history has ever been contained .
Even the rare reductions are merely temporary .
The United States was founded on the principle of limited government ; it took little more than a century for the State to break the bonds of the Constitution , implement the income tax , take control of the money supply and the educational system , and begin its catastrophic expansion .
There is no example in history of a State being permanently reduced in size .
All that happens during a tax or civil revolt is that the State retrenches , figures out what it did wrong , and plans its expansion again .
Or provokes a war , which silences all but fringe dissenters .
Given these well - known historical facts , why do still people believe that such a deadly predator can be tamed ?
Surely it can only be because they consider a slow strangulation in the grip of an expanding State somehow better than the quick death of a society bereft of a State .
Why , then , do most people believe that a society will crumble without a coercive and monopolistic social agency at its core ?
There are a number of answers to this question , but generally they tend to revolve around three central points :
dispute resolution ;
collective services ; and ,
pollution .
Dispute Resolution
The fact that people still cling to the belief that the State is required to resolve disputes is amazing , since modern courts are out of the reach of all but the most wealthy and patient , and are primarily used to shield the powerful from competition or criticism .
In this writer 's experience , to take a dispute with a stockbroker to the court system would have cost more than a quarter of a million dollars and taken from five to ten years — however , a private mediator settled the matter within a few months for very little money .
In the realm of marital dissolution , private mediators are commonplace .
Unions use grievance processes , and a plethora of other specialists in dispute resolution have sprung up to fill in the void left by a ridiculously lengthy , expensive and incompetent State court system .
Thus the belief that the State is required for dispute resolution is obviously false , since the court apparatus is unavailable to the vast majority of the population , who resolve their disputes either privately or through agreed - upon mediators .
How can the free market deal with the problem of dispute resolution ?
Outside the realm of organized crime , very few people are comfortable with armed confrontations , and so generally prefer to delegate that task to others .
Let 's assume that people 's need for such representatives produces Dispute Resolution Organizations ( DROs ) , which promise to resolve disputes on their behalf .
Thus , if Stan is hired by Bob , they both sign a document specifying which DRO they both accept as an authority in dispute resolution .
If they disagree about something , and are unable to resolve it between themselves , they submit their case to the DRO , and agree to abide by that DRO 's decision .
So far so good .
However , what if Stan decides he does n't want to abide by the DRO 's decision ?
Well , several options arise .
First of all , when Stan signed the DRO agreement , it is likely that he would have agreed to property confiscation if he did not abide by the DRO 's decision .
Thus the DRO would be entirely within its right to go and remove property from Stan — by force if necessary — to pay for his side of the dispute .
It is at this point that people generally throw up their arms and dismiss the idea of DROs by claiming that society would descend into civil war within a few days .
Everyone , of course , realizes that civil war is a rather bad situation , and so it seems likely that the DROs would consider alternatives to armed combat .
What other options could be pursued ?
To take a current example , small debts which are not worth pursuing legally are still regularly paid off — and why ?
Because a group of companies produce credit ratings on individuals , and the inconvenience of a lowered credit rating is usually greater than the inconvenience of paying off a small debt .
Thus , in the absence of any recourse to force , small debts are usually settled .
This is one example of how desired behaviour can be elicited without pulling out a gun or kicking in a door .
Picture for a moment the infinite complexity of modern economic life .
Most individuals bind themselves to dozens of contracts , from car loans and mortgages to cell phone contracts , gym membership , condo agreements and so on .
To flourish in a free market , a man must honour his contracts .
A reputation for honest dealing is the foundation of a successful economic life .
Now , few DROs will want to represent a man who regularly breaks contracts , or associates with difficult and litigious people .
( For instance , this writer once refrained from entering into a business partnership because the potential partner revealed that he had sued two previous partners . )
Thus if Stan refuses to abide by his DRO 's ruling , the DRO has to barely lift a finger to punish him .
All the DRO has to do is report Stan 's non-compliance to the local contract - rating company , who will enter his name into a database of contract violators .
Stan 's DRO will also probably drop him , or raise his rates considerably .
And so , from an economic standpoint , Stan has just shot himself in the foot .
He is now universally known as a man who rejects legitimate DRO rulings that he agreed to accept in advance .
What happens when he goes for his next job ?
What if he decides to eschew employment and start his own company , what happens when he applies for his first lease ?
Or tries to hire his first employee ?
Or rent a car , or buy an airline ticket ?
Or enter into a contract with his first customer ?
No , in almost every situation , Stan would be far better off to abide by the decision of the DRO .
Whatever he has to pay , it is far cheaper than facing the barriers of existing without access to a DRO , or with a record of rejecting a legitimate ruling .
But let 's push the theory to the max , to see if it holds .
To examine a worst - case scenario , imagine that Stan 's employer is an evil man who bribes the DRO to rule in his favour , and the DRO imposes an unconscionable fine — say , one million dollars — on Stan .
First of all , this is such an obvious problem that DROs , to get any business at all , would have to deal with this danger up front .
An appeal process to a different DRO would have to be part of the contract .
DROs would also rigorously vet their own employees for any unexplained income .
And , of course , any DRO mediator who corrupted the process would receive perhaps the lowest contract rating on the planet , lose his job , and be liable for damages .
He would lose everything , and be an economic pariah .
However , to go to the extreme , perhaps the worst has occurred and Stan has been unjustly fined a million dollars due to DRO corruption .
Well , he has three alternatives .
He can choose not to pay the fine , drop off the DRO map , and work for cash without contracts .
Become part of the grey market , in other words .
A perfectly respectable choice , if he has been treated unjustly .
However , if Stan is an intelligent and even vaguely entrepreneurial man , he will see the corruption of the DRO as a prime opportunity to start his own , competing DRO , and will write into its base contract clauses to ensure that what happened to him will never happen to anyone who signs on with his new DRO .
Stan 's third option is to appeal to the contract rating agency .
Contract rating agencies need to be as accurate as possible , since they are attempting to assess real risk .
If they believe that the DRO ruled unjustly against Stan , they will lower that DRO 's contract rating and restore Stan's .
Thus it is inconceivable that violence would be required to enforce all but the most extreme contract violations , since all parties gain the most long - term value by acting honestly .
This resolves the problem of instant descent into civil war .
Two other problems exist , however , which must be resolved before the DRO theory starts to becomes truly tenable .
The first is the challenge of reciprocity , or geography .
If Bob has a contract with Jeff , and Jeff moves to a new location not covered by their mutual DRO , what happens ?
Again , this is such an obvious problem that it would be solved by any competent DRO .
People who travel prefer cell phones with the greatest geographical coverage , and so cell phone companies have developed reciprocal agreements for charging competitors .
Just as a person 's credit rating is available anywhere in the world , so their contract rating will also be available , and so there will be no place to hide from a broken contract save by going u2018 off the grid ' completely , which would be economically crippling .
The second problem is the fear that a particular DRO will grow in size and stature to the point where it takes on all the features and properties of a new State .
This is a superstitious fear , because there is no historical example of a private company replacing a political State .
While it is true that companies regularly use State coercion to enforce trading restrictions , high tariffs , cartels and other mercantilist tricks , surely this reinforces the danger of the State , not the inevitability of companies growing into States .
All States destroy societies .
No company has ever destroyed a society without the aid of the State .
Thus the fear that a private company can somehow grow into a State is utterly unfounded in fact , experience , logic and history .
If society becomes frightened of a particular DRO , then it can simply stop doing business with it , which will cause it to collapse .
If that DRO , as it collapses , somehow transforms itself from a group of secretaries , statisticians , accountants and contract lawyers into a ruthless domestic militia and successfully takes over society — and how unlikely is that !
— then such a State will then be imposed on the general population .
However , there are two problems even with this most unlikely scare scenario .
First of all , if any DRO can take over society and impose itself as a new State , why only a DRO ?
Why not the Rotary Club ?
Why not a union ?
Why not the Mafia ?
The YMCA ?
The SPCA ?
Is society to then ban all groups with more than a hundred members ?
Clearly that is not a feasible solution , and so society must live with the risk of a brutal coup by ninja accountants as much as from any other group .
And , in the final analysis , if society is so terrified of a single group seizing a monopoly of political power , what does that say about the existing States ?
They have a monopoly of political power .
If a DRO should never achieve this kind of control , why should existing States continue to wield theirs ?
Collective Services
Roads , sewage , water and electricity and so on are also cited as reasons why a State must exist .
How roads could be privately paid for remains such an impenetrable mystery that most people are willing to support the State — and so ensure the eventual and utter destruction of civil society — rather than cede that this problem just might solvable .
There are many ways to pay for roads , such as electronic or cash tolls , GPS charges , roads maintained by the businesses they lead to , communal organizations and so on .
And if none of those work ?
Why , then personal flying machines will hit the market !
The problem that a water company might build plumbing to a community , and then charge exorbitant fees for supplying it , is equally easy to counter .
A truck could deliver bottled water , or the community could invest in a water tower , a competing company could build alternate pipes and so on .
None of these problems touch the central rationale for a State .
They are ex post facto justifications made to avoid the need for critical examination or , heaven forbid , political action .
The argument that voluntary free - market monopolies are bad — and that the only way to combat them is to impose compulsory monopolies — is obviously foolish .
If voluntary monopolies are bad , then how can coercive monopolies be better ?
Due to countless examples of free market solutions to the problem of u2018 carrier costs ' , this argument no longer holds the kind of water it used to , so it must be elsewhere that people must turn to justify the continued existence of the State .
Pollution
This is perhaps the greatest problem faced by free - market theorists .
It 's worth spending a little time on outlining the worst possible scenario , and see how a voluntary system could solve it .
However , it 's important to first dispel the notion that the State currently deals effectively with pollution .
Firstly , the most polluted resources on the planet are State - owned , because State personnel do not personally profit from retaining the value of State property ( witness the destruction of the Canadian cod industry through blatant vote - buying ) .
Secondly , the distribution of mineral , lumber and drilling rights is directly skewed towards bribery and corruption , because States rarely sell the land , but rather just the resource rights .
A lumber company cannot buy woodlands from the State , just the right to harvest trees .
Thus the State gets a renewable source of income , and can further coerce lumber companies by enforcing re-seeding .
This , of course , tends to promote bribery , corruption and the creation of u2018 fly - by - night ' lumber companies which strip the land bare , but vanish when it comes time to re-seed .
Auctioning State land to a private market easily solves this problem , because a company which re-seeded would reap the greatest long - term profits from woodland , and so would be able to bid the most for the land .
Also , it should be remembered that , in the realm of air pollution , governments created the problem in the first place .
In 19th century England , when industrial smokestacks began belching fumes into the orchards of apple farmers , the farmers took the factory - owners to court , citing the common - law tradition of restitution for property damage .
Naturally , the capitalists had gotten to the State courts first , and had more money to bribe with , employed more voting workers , and contributed more tax revenue than the farmers — and so the farmers ' cases were thrown out of court .
The judge argued that the u2018 common good ' of the factories took precedence over the u2018 private need ' of the farmers .
The free market did not fail to solve the problem of air pollution — it was forcibly prevented from doing so through State corruption .
The State , then , is no friend of the environment — but how would the free market handle it ?
One egregious example often cited is a group of houses downwind from a new factory which works day and night to coat them in soot .
When a man buys a new house , is n't it important to him to ensure that it wo n't be subjected with someone else 's pollution ?
People 's desire for a clean and safe environment is so strong that it's a clear invitation for enterprising capitalists to sweat bullets figuring out how to provide it .
Fortunately , since we have already talked about DROs and their role in a free market , the problem of air pollution can be solved quite easily .
If the aforementioned group of homeowners is afraid of pollution , the first thing they will do is buy pollution insurance , which is a natural response to a situation where costs cannot be predicted but consequences are dire .
Let 's say that a homeowner named Achmed buys pollution insurance which pays him two million dollars if the air around or in his house becomes polluted in some predefined manner .
In other words , as long as Achmed 's air remains clean , the insurance company makes money .
One day , a plot of land upwind of Achmed 's house comes up for sale .
Naturally , his insurance company would be very interested in this , and would monitor the sale .
If the purchaser is some private school , all is well ( assuming Achmed has not bought an excess of noise pollution insurance ! ) .
If , however , the insurance company discovers that Sally 's House of Polluting Paint Production is interested in purchasing the plot of land , then it will likely spring into action , taking one of the following actions :
buying the land itself , then selling it to a non-polluting buyer ;
getting assurances from Sally that her company will not pollute ;
paying Sally to enter into a non-polluting contract .
If , however , someone at the insurance company is asleep at the wheel , and Sally buys the land and puts up her polluting factory , what happens then ?
Well , then the insurance company is on the hook for $ 2 M to Achmed ( assuming for the moment that only Achmed bought pollution insurance ) .
Thus , it can afford to pay Sally up to $ 2 M to reduce her pollution and still be cash - positive .
This payment could take many forms , from the installation of pollution - control equipment to a buy - out to a subsidy for under- production and so on .
If the $ 2 M is not enough to solve the problem , then the insurance company pays Achmed the $ 2 M and he goes and buys a new house in an unpolluted neighbourhood .
However , this scenario is highly unlikely , since the insurance company would be unlikely to insure only one single person in a neighbourhood against air pollution — and a single person probably could not afford it !
So , that is the view from Achmed 's air - pollution insurance company .
What about the view from Sally 's House of Polluting Paint Production ?
She , also , must be covered by a DRO in order to buy land , borrow money and hire employees .
How does that DRO view her tendency to pollute ?
Pollution brings damage claims against Sally , because pollution is by definition damage to persons or property .
Thus Sally 's DRO would take a dim view of her polluting activities , since it would be on the hook for any property damage her factory causes .
In fact , it would be most unlikely that Sally 's DRO would insure her against damages unless she were able to prove that she would be able to operate her factory without harming the property of those around her .
And without access to a DRO , of course , she would be hard - pressed to start her factory , borrow money , hire employees etc .
It 's important to remember that DROs , much like cell phone companies and Internet providers , only prosper if they cooperate .
Sally 's DRO only makes money if Sally does not pollute .
Achmed 's insurer also only makes money if Sally does not pollute .
Thus the two companies share a common goal , which fosters cooperation .
Finally , even if Achmed is not insured against air pollution , he can use his and / or Sally 's DRO to gain restitution for the damage her pollution is causing to his property .
Both Sally and Achmed 's DROs would have reciprocity agreements , since Achmed wants to be protected against Sally 's actions , and Sally wants to be protected against Achmed 's actions .
Because of this desire for mutual protection , they would choose DROs which had the widest reciprocity agreements .
Thus , in a truly free market , there are many levels and agencies actively working against pollution .
Achmed 's insurer will be actively scanning the surroundings looking for polluters it can forestall .
Sally will be unable to build her paint factory without proving that she will not pollute .
Mutual or independent DROs will resolve any disputes regarding property damage caused by Sally 's pollution .
There are other benefits as well , which are almost unsolvable in the current system .
Imagine that Sally 's smokestacks are so high that her air pollution sails over Achmed 's house and lands on Reginald 's house , a hundred miles away .
Reginald then complains to his DRO that his property is being damaged .
His DRO will examine the air contents and wind currents , then trace the pollution back to its source and resolve the dispute with Sally 's DRO .
If the air pollution is particularly complicated , then Reginald 's DRO will place non-volatile compounds into Sally 's smokestacks and follow them to where they land .
This can be used in a situation where a number of different factories may be contributing pollutants .
The problem of inter-country air pollution may seem to be a sticky one , but it 's easily solvable .
Obviously , a Canadian living along the Canada / US border , for instance , will not choose a DRO which refuses to cover air pollution emanating from the US .
Thus the DRO will have to have reciprocity agreements with the DROs across the border .
If the US DROs refuse to have reciprocity agreements with the Canadian DROs — inconceivable , since the pollution can go both ways — then the Canadian DRO will simply start a US branch and compete .
The difference is that international DROs actually profit from cooperation , in a way that governments do not .
For instance , a State government on the Canada / US border has little motivation to impose pollution costs on local factories , as long as the pollution generally goes north .
For DROs , quite the opposite would be true .
Finally , one other advantage to DRO 's can be termed the u2018 Scrabble - Challenge Benefit ' .
In Scrabble , an accuser loses his turn if he challenges another player 's word and the challenge fails .
Given the costs of resolving disputes , DROs would be very careful to ensure that those bringing false accusations would be punished through their own premiums , their contract ratings and by also assuming the entire cost of the dispute .
This would greatly reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits , to the great benefit of all .
The idea that society can only survive in the absence of a centralized State is the greatest lesson that the grisly years of the Twentieth Century can teach us .
Our choice is not between the free market and the State , but between life and death .
Whatever the risks involved in dissolving the central State , they are far less than the certain destruction which will result from its inevitable escalation .
Like a cancer patient facing certain demise , we must open our minds reach for whatever medicine shows the most promise , and not wait until it is too late .

The Best of Stefan Molyneux
I recently left the world of 9 - 5 software development , and now I work from home as a freelancer .
While it ’s not required , many people doing this in the UK set up their own limited company .
I ’m going to describe the process of getting yourself set up in this way .
I think you ’ll be surprised how little work and money you actually need to become director of your very own company .
Firstly , you actually need to create the company .
Companies in the UK are registered with http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/
and you can fill in forms and pay a small fee to do it directly .
But many companies will do all this for you – you simply select a company name and give some details and they do the rest .
You can do it all online , even , and in most cases your company will exist by the end of the day !
Places like here allow you do do it for just £ 75 ( + VAT ) .
To start a company you must have at least one director ( you ) and you must also have a company secretary .
This person has very few responsibilities and does not have to receive shares in the company or a salary … many people use their wife / husband / parent .
You will also want a business bank account .
All the banks you ’d go to for a personal account also provide business accounts , but there is a tendency for them to charge for just about every action you ’d want to take .
I have been recommended The Abbey by many people , as not only is it free , but you can operate your account online .
You can also apply for an account without having to go and visit them – you just post them an application form and some photocopied proof of identity / address .
Finally , you ’ll probably want to hire an accountant .
It ’s not at all essential but unless you want to delve into tax law , and are confident you can do it all correctly , an accountant is something you need .
As well as making sure you do n’t accidentally commit fraud , an accountant can figure out what you can claim as expenses against tax , and generally make sure you pay as little tax as legally allowed .
Personally , I ’d rather be making money than poring over tax documentation .
I signed up with Quay Accounting .
For £ 66 ( +VAT ) a month , they do everything .
I will give them my income and expenses each month and they will not only do the tax for my company , but also my personal tax returns , as well as sorting out the salary I am paid by my company .
They also operate a company creation service ( it cost me £ 100 to get my company set up ) and can provide a bank account , although I preferred the Abbey account over theirs .
Basically , using a full package like this means I can get on with doing some actual work .

On September 16 1985 , when the Commerce Department announced that the United States had become a debtor nation , the American Empire was as dead , theoretically , as its predecessor , the British .
Our empire was seventy - one years old and had been in ill financial health since 1968 .
Like most modern empires , ours rested not so much on military prowess as on economic primacy .
-- Gore Vidal , Chapter Three of Imperial America ( Nation Books , 2005 )
On a personal note , landing at Kansas City International Airport the other day , my vision of America altered by my in - flight reading of Mr. Berman 's remarkable work , I saw the landscape through new eyes , a landscape I now understood to have been systematically vandalized by the corporatocracy : big box stores , chain hotels and restaurants , strip malls and gas stations , a landscape everywhere repeated across the United States , a landscape we intend to impose upon the world in order to fulfill our destiny as bringer of freedom as expressed through consumption .

If Iran is attacked it will have nothing or next to nothing to do with the oil bourse .
It will be because the PNACers have targeted Iran , because , like Iraq , it is not a puppet state , and , in the Neocon " mind " thus presents an " existential threat " to the greater Israel that they imagine .
Certainly , when oil is no longer traded in dollars , it is not only the dollar that will collapse .
It means that the US -- on the bad end of a huge balance of trade deficit -- will no longer be able to afford to import goods or services .
For a nation that long ago ( Reagan years primarily ; See Vidal , cited ) gave up its role as a manufacturing nation , this collapse will be monumental , catastrophic .
The fact that oil had been traded in dollars was the only thing propping up the dollar .
That there was a demand for dollars because there was a demand for oil meant that you could continue to buy imported goods with dollars .
Now -- imagine a world in which no other country need " purchase " dollars in order to import oil !
What if oil producing nations agree to accept other currencies ?
What if they refuse to accept dollars ?
Go to Wal - Mart or even your local supermarket .
Almost everything on the shelves is imported .
Imagine a shop owner refusing to accept as payment for anything in the shop your worthless dollars !
As Gore Vidal pointed out , the US empire ended in the eighties , when the US became a net debtor nation .
GOP regimes since have only made the situation worse .
Just as empire became the business of Rome , empire had become the " business " of the US which no longer produces enough to employ its population let alone export to the rest of the world .
Most US consumer goods are imported from China , sold in Warl - Mart , discarded in America .
America 's best days are over .
We live in the twilight of empire .
Mr Bush said the passing of the law was an urgent priority
Bush speech
He called on the House of Representatives to approve the law , already passed by the Senate .
An initial act , allowing warrantless tapping of phone calls and e-mails of suspected terrorists , expired on 17 February but did not grant immunity .
Lawsuits have been filed against some of the firms which took part .
They are accused of violation of privacy .
He told the White House on Tuesday " abusive " lawsuits against telecoms firms would " aid our enemies " by teaching them how to duck surveillance .
' Dangerous intelligence gap '
The House of Representatives allowed the law to expire this month after refusing to rubber stamp a Senate bill that would give telecommunication firms immunity from lawsuits .
The legislation allowed government spying on foreign telephone calls and electronic correspondence without court permission .
" The law expired , the threat to America has not expired , " Mr Bush said .
Mr Bush told the White House on Tuesday " a dangerous intelligence gap " had opened up last year before the temporary Protect America Act was passed in August .
" Allowing these lawsuits to proceed would be unfair , " he said .
" If any of these companies helped us , they did so after being told by our government that their assistance was legal and vital to our national security .
" Allowing the lawsuits to proceed could aid our enemies , because the litigation process could lead to the disclosure of information of how we conduct surveillance and it would give al - Qaeda and others a roadmap as to how to avoid the surveillance . "
He warned firms would refuse to co-operate with the intelligence services if they were not granted immunity from lawsuits .
In a wide - ranging speech Mr Bush also :
Me : “ Good morning , how can I help you ? ”
Woman : “ Yeah , a small coffee with two splendas and extra milk . ”
Me : “ Okay , that will be $ 1.49 . ”
( She pays and I give her the change .
I proceed to make the drink .
I pressed the “ Medium ” button for milk and then gave an extra shot .
When I gave it to her , she took a sip and made a face as if she had just taken a sip of liquefied dog s**t. )
Me : “ What seems to be the problem ? ”
Woman : “ I asked for extra milk !
This is too strong . ”
Me : “ Well , I ’ll put some more in for you .
No problem . ”
Woman : * muttering under her breath * “ Idiot kid … ”
( I put another “ Medium ” shot in .
This is two mediums and one extra shot for a total of seven milks .
She takes another sip , with the same face . )
Woman : “ What part of extra milk do you not understand ? ”
Me : “ I understand what extra milk means .
I put in about four times the regular amount of milk . ”
Woman : “ Well , put more ! ”
( I put in more .
I put a “ Large ” shot of milk ( four more ) .
This brings our total to eleven milks , therefore being classified as milk with a little coffee . )
Me : “ Here . ”
( She takes another sip , and yes .
Again , she makes that freaking face . )
Woman : “ Look .
Extra milk means you put in the regular amount , and then you put in MORE . ”
Me : “ I know that !
That is a SMALL coffee with ELEVEN MILKS ! ”
Woman : “ PUT IN MORE ! ”
( I put in more another “ Medium ” shot ( three more ) ) .
Me : “ Here .
The coffee is almost white now . ”
( She drinks it again and SPITS IT ALL OVER THE COUNTER . )
Me : “ Lady , what ’s your problem ? ”
Woman : “ This coffee is cold !
I ordered a hot coffee , not a cold coffee !
Can you comprehend that ? ”
Me : “ F*** this .
Who ’s next ? ”
( My shift leader was laughing in the corner the whole time .
She remade this lady ’s drink with one large shot of milk and gave it to her .
She sipped it … ” Ah , now that ’s better ! ” )
( Everyone in line had a pretty good laugh about it . )

The riots left at least 1,000 dead - mostly Muslims
A policeman is among those who have been found guilty .
The case was moved out of Gujarat and handed over to federal police by the supreme court which said the state had done little to bring them to justice .
More than 1,000 people , mostly Muslims , died in the riots , although independent groups say the toll was nearly 2,000 .
Infamous
The convictions were delivered by a special court in the Indian city of Mumbai ( Bombay ) where the trial was shifted following the supreme court order in 2004 .
This was one of the most infamous cases in the Gujarat riots - a Hindu mob attacked a group of Muslims .
Fourteen Muslims were killed and three women were gang - raped .
One of them was Bilkis Bano , who was pregnant at the time and only managed to survive because the attackers thought she was dead .
She was the key witness during the trial and it was the evidence she provided that led to Friday 's convictions .
Among those convicted is a policeman who was charged with protecting the guilty .
Sentences will be handed out on Monday .
The Gujarat government , which is run by the Hindu nationalist BJP , was heavily criticised for its poor handling of the riot cases .
For over five and a half years , as I explain in depth in my newly released book , The Guantánamo Files , the prison in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , has held hundreds of innocent men .
Humanitarian aid workers , teachers or students of the Koran , businessmen , economic migrants , and refugees from persecution  all were swept up for bounty payments , either in Afghanistan or Pakistan , at a time when the U.S. military was offering $ 5,000 a head for al - Qaeda suspects .
Many of these innocent men were Afghans who were sold to the U.S. military by rivals secure in the knowledge that the Americans had neither the will nor the curiosity to investigate the veracity of the allegations that swept their futures away .
Many others were foreigners 
Arabs mainly , from Saudi Arabia , Yemen , and other Gulf countries , and from the northern African countries bordering the Mediterranean .
Some were seized in Afghanistan , either by soldiers of the Northern Alliance or by opportunistic villagers ; others were captured crossing from Afghanistan to Pakistan , where their flight from the chaos precipitated by the U.S. - led invasion and the collapse of the Taliban was construed as a sign that they were fleeing from combat ; and many others were gathered at random on the streets of Pakistan ’s cities , far from any battlefield .
One of these innocent men , Mohammed al - Amin , who hails from an even more distant location  the western Saharan country of Mauritania  has just been released from Guantánamo , and his story , though brutal , is typical of the suffering that these men have been forced to endure for five and a half years .
While reading it , remember that his is not a unique case : hundreds of other innocent men have been treated in a similar manner , and many of them remain in Guantánamo .
It is one thing to tout the 778 men who have been held in Guantánamo as " the worst of the worst , " as the administration did when the prison was set up in January 2002 , but it is quite another to realize that 431 of these men have now been released , and a large number of them , like Amin , were completely innocent of any wrongdoing .
Amin ’s accidental odyssey to torture and years of illegal imprisonment without charge or trial began when , at the age of 17 , he left his parents and his five sisters and traveled to Saudi Arabia to study the Koran , with the intention of becoming a teacher .
He then traveled to Pakistan to continue his studies , but he was arrested in Peshawar in April 2002 and held for two months in a Pakistani jail .
There , he was " subjected to beatings , held for prolonged periods in solitary confinement , and denied adequate food , " in an attempt to force him to confess that he was a Saudi Arabian national , because , presumably , Saudis were valued more highly by the U.S. military than Mauritanians .
He was then transferred to Bagram , where , like many other prisoners , he was suspended by his wrists for long periods of time .
He explained to his lawyers in Guantánamo that he was tied by his hands to the ceiling " for days on end , " and that " whenever he lost consciousness a guard would forcefully pull him up to wake him . "
He also said that he was sexually abused , subjected to sleep deprivation , and threatened with being sent to Egypt to face further torture .
After two months of this treatment , he explained , " They wanted me to say I had come to join the jihad .
Eventually I told them what they wanted to hear , and the torture stopped . "
What they wanted to hear surfaced in Guantánamo , where it was alleged that he traveled to Afghanistan to fight the Americans , having decided to " go on jihad after being angered over the U.S. air attacks in Afghanistan , " and that he trained with the Pakistani militant group Lashkar - e - Tayyiba .
These were all lies coerced out of him by his own captors , but it took another five years before the administration was prepared to acknowledge that he was actually an innocent man  or , as those involved insist on describing it , being unable to acknowledge that they have made mistakes , that he was " no longer an enemy combatant . "
Transferred to Guantánamo in August 2002 , he said that his first year in Guantánamo was " terrible " and " worse than Bagram . "
In addition to the sleep deprivation and sexual humiliation that he had experienced in Afghanistan , he was also exposed to loud music as part of a program to " break " the detainees , which was masterminded by the Pentagon and introduced by Guantánamo ’s commander , Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller .
As in Bagram , he was eventually forced to make false confessions , telling his interrogators whatever they wanted to hear .
To protest his indefinite detention without charge or trial , Amin joined a widespread hunger strike in August 2005 , when his weight , which had been a meager 121 pounds on arrival , plunged , at one point , to just 103 pounds .
By January 2006 , when he was one of 84 detainees who were still maintaining their hunger strike , the authorities responded by drafting in a new team of doctors , armed with restraint chairs and feeding tubes .
Amin said that he was removed from the camp hospital and placed in solitary confinement in a windowless black cell , which he called the " freezer , " because the air conditioning was turned up to the maximum .
He also explained that the guards would " throw water on him to exacerbate the freezing conditions , and would wake him up if he fell asleep . "
Describing his force - feeding , he  like others who have spoken about the experience  said he was fastened so tightly in the restraint chair that he was unable to move at all , and a large feeding tube was then forced into his stomach , which was , of course , extremely painful .
Whether by accident or design , the doctors regularly " stated that they could not find the correct position and forcefully pulled the feeding tube from him , " repeating the process two or three times , which caused his nose to bleed .
Amin also stated that he was " deliberately overfed until he vomited , and when he vomited the force feeding would start again " ; that he was " strapped in the restraint chair for periods of two to three hours at a time , which , coupled with being overfed , led him to urinate and defecate on himself " ; and that he was then " dumped , covered in his own vomit , blood , and feces , back in his isolation cell . "
Although he attempted to maintain his hunger strike , he admitted that he gave up after 21 days .
With some accuracy , he told his lawyers the authorities " used physicians to commit crimes , " as the doctors supervised the force - feeding , watching him while he was forced to vomit .
On one occasion , said Amin , a doctor asked him , " Are you going to quit the hunger strike or stay in this situation ? "
Despite all this violence , he was cleared for release sometime in 2006 , after an administrative review board concluded that he was no longer a threat to the United States and no longer had any intelligence value .
Yet he was not released until now apparently because of confusion about his nationality : though he lived in Mauritania before losing five and a half years of his life , he had actually been born in Niger .
Since his return to Mauritania on Wednesday , Amin has been held for questioning by his homeland ’s national security services , but human rights activist Hamad Ould Nebagha insisted that it is a " mere formality , " designed to show Washington that the government is committed to fighting terrorism .
Anticipating that Amin will soon be released without charge , Nebagha pointed out that Amin ’s " U.S. accusers have failed to link him to the alleged terrorist activities " for which he was held .
Amin ’s lawyers in Denver  John Holland and his daughter Anna Cayton - Holland  have also spoken about their former client and what his case  and that of all the other innocent men held in Guantánamo  should mean to the American public .
" No one wants to see terrorists set free , " Anna Cayton - Holland explained .
" We believe in our system , that you ca n’t torture people and use the fruits of that to convict them .
We ’re tired of people saying we are coddling terrorists .
We ’re not .
We ’re saying you can try and convict , separate the terrorist wheat from the innocent chaff in the true light of the legal system . "
John Holland added , " I did n’t get into law to make a lot of money .
It ’s like my mom said , do good and the world will be good to you .
Mostly we do this work because we are Americans , and we believe America is struggling to hold onto its moral soul . "
As the Supreme Court prepares to consider once more whether the Guantánamo detainees should have the right to challenge the basis of their detention , the cases of Mohammed al - Amin and the hundreds of other innocent men who have been held in Guantánamo should stand as a cautionary example of why it is unwise and unjust to deny habeas corpus rights to prisoners held in U.S. custody and to hand unfettered power to a government that , despite its blustering , clearly does not know what it is doing .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Genarlow Wilson , freed last week from a Georgia prison , said he 's glad he rejected a plea deal from prosecutors , even if it would have sprung him from prison months earlier .
Genarlow Wilson tells CNN on Sunday that he will be more conservative and alert in the future .
The 21 - year - old , who served two years of a 10 - year sentence for aggravated child molestation , said the prospect of being labeled a sex offender drove him to turn down the deal .
He had to think about his 9 - year - old sister and having a family of his own one day , he said Sunday .
" It might 've been lesser time , but then again , I would have nowhere to go because I would have no home , " Wilson said during a CNN interview scheduled to air Monday at 8 p.m .
" I would n't be able to stay with my mother because I have a little sister .
You know , when you 're a sex offender you can't be around kids .
Basically , I can't even have kids myself , you know , so what is the point of life ? " he asked .
In 2005 , a jury found Wilson guilty of aggravated child molestation for having oral sex with a 15 - year - old girl at a 2003 New Year 's Eve party .
Wilson was 17 at the time of the party .
Watch Wilson say why he rejected the plea deal »
The conviction carried a 10 - year mandatory prison sentence and a sex offender designation .
According to Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker , prosecutors in Douglas County , Georgia , offered Wilson a plea deal that would have reduced his sentence , possibly to time served , and would have eventually removed the conviction and sex offender status from his record .
Defense attorney B.J. Bernstein said in June that Wilson rejected the deal because he did n't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15 - year sentence .
The state Legislature last year amended the law under which Wilson was convicted , making such sexual encounters misdemeanors .
However , the Legislature did not make the law retroactive , so it had no effect on Wilson 's sentence .
Now 21 , Wilson was released Friday after the state Supreme Court ruled 4 - 3 that the young man 's sentence " constitutes cruel and unusual punishment . "
Wilson said Sunday he feels no " negative energy " toward District Attorney David McDade , who fought efforts to have Wilson 's sentence reduced .
Instead , Wilson said , he is focused on the future and hopes to soon immerse himself in his college studies .
He wants to major in sociology , he said , " because I feel like I 've been living my major . "
The new Genarlow Wilson will be more conservative , more alert and more appreciative of the blessings bestowed upon him , he said .
" When it seems like you have everything , you know , you feel like you have no worries until it's all gone , and I know what it feels like to be without and I do n't want to ever feel like that again , " said the former honor student , football star and homecoming king .
" I do n't ever want to see the inside of a prison or a prison , period . "
Though he called his sentence " absurd , " Wilson said he understands that prosecutors " were doing their job and they felt they were carrying out the law . "
Wilson also said he knows what he did was foolish .
" I was young then .

Oh my !
Nokia are buying KDE !
Well that ’s a bit of an overstatement .
Nokia are buying the makers of the Qt library , by far the biggest component of KDE and KDE applications .
Make no mistake , this is big news for both Nokia and Linux .
Nokia released a statement a few hours ago saying :
Espoo , Finland and Oslo , Norway - Nokia and Trolltech ASA today announced that they have entered into an agreement that Nokia will make a public voluntary tender offer to acquire Trolltech ( www.trolltech.com), a company headquartered in Oslo , Norway and publicly listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange .
Trolltech is a recognized software provider with world - class software development platforms and frameworks .
In addition to the key software assets , its talented team will play an important role in accelerating the implementation of Nokia ’s software strategy .
…
The acquisition of Trolltech will enable Nokia to accelerate its cross-platform software strategy for mobile devices and desktop applications , and develop its Internet services business .
With Trolltech , Nokia and third party developers will be able to develop applications that work in the Internet , across Nokia ’s device portfolio and on PCs .
Nokia ’s software strategy for devices is based on cross- platform development environments , layers of software that run across operating systems , enabling the development of applications across the Nokia device range .
Examples of current cross-platform layers are Web runtime , Flash , Java and Open C.
Trolltech have the same statement up on their website , accompanied by the some key points :
The acquisition supports Trolltech ’s company vision of driving Qt adoption in the commercial and open source markets ( Qt Everywhere ) .
The acquisition of Trolltech will enable Nokia to accelerate the cross-platform software strategy for mobile devices and desktop applications , and to develop its Internet services business .
With Nokia , Trolltechs
Qt technology will grow significantly in the PC and mass - volume mobile devices markets Nokia plans to continue to develop Trolltechs products and continue to drive sales to new and existing customers Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions , including regulatory and Trolltech shareholder approval
Speculate away !
I ’ll edit this post once I ’ve pondered .
Edit 1 : It looks like Nokia are doing this primarily to acquire Trolltech ’s mobile platform : Qtopia .
But in a letter to the open source community , Trolltech have announced ( PDF ) :
Nokia is committed to continue Trolltechs current open source engagements , including honoring the KDE Free Qt agreement , and we will seek to strengthen our support of KDE in the future .
As a first step Nokia will apply to become a Patron of KDE * .
Awesome news for KDE .
Perhaps Nokia might get around to releasing a cross platform version of their PC Suite / Firmware upgrading software .
A lot of people have strong feelings -- positive or negative -- about Catholic education .
Where do you fit in spectrum ?
Very positive .
And I attribute it to the [ nuns ] who dedicated their lives to the religious .
I was very fortunate .
These are some of the most significant , important people in my life and I treasure their memories .
BELIEFNET : Would it be possible to summarize the message they taught you about the nature of Christianity ?
KUCINICH : About always doing the right thing no matter what , about never being afraid to take a stand .
About a sense of personal responsibility for one 's actions .
BELIEFNET : So what part of your genetic makeup as a politician came from that ?
KUCINICH : Social conscience .
In the spirit of a Dorothy Day , in the spirit of Pope Leo XIII , in the spirit of Pope Paul VI and Populorum Progressio .
BELIEFNET : Any other Catholic or Christian writers or teachers that have influenced you in particular ?
KUCINICH : I would say all the gospels .
The letters of Paul to Corinthians .
In the Old Testament , the book of Proverbs , the book of Isaiah .
BELIEFNET :
In terms of your spiritual practice , did you go to mass regularly or was it a more private practice ?
KUCINICH :
It was a private practice that included mass .
BELIEFNET : What was the name of church ?
KUCINICH : Oh , my family lived in 21 places before I was 17 .
Are you kidding ?
I 'll give you the names of a dozen churches .
You want 'em ?
BELIEFNET : Maybe later .
The private aspects , anything you want to mention about that ?
KUCINICH : Making a connection to anything transcendent -- some people feel being in a church helps facilitate that .
Other times , the sanctity of one 's own thoughts is a church .
BELIEFNET : Do you have a set of prayers that are most meaningful to you ?
KUCINICH : I think the Lord 's Prayer is a very powerful prayer .
And the prayer of St. Francis .
BELIEFNET : You have supplemented or complemented your Catholic upbringing with a variety of other spiritual teachings .
What was the nature of your spiritual journey in 1979 and 1980 , when you left the mayoralty [ in Cleveland ] ?
KUCINICH : Anyone who really studies Catholicism deeply is aware of the mystical nature of our faith .
Even references to Christ 's mystical body has connections to that principle .
The liturgy of the faith derives from symbology which connects to the universe and which underscores the universality of the church .
I had the opportunity to learn about the many different ways in which my Catholic faith connects with the world .
And I think this is what was anticipated by Pope John the 23 in the Ecumenical Council .
BELIEFNET : Can you give me a specific example of something you learned in that period that some people would view as a separate teaching but that you saw as connected ?
KUCINICH : I would say there 's a sense of which the doctrine of substantiation is connected to the Hindu religion 's concepts of shakti , yanim and vipassana .
BELIEFNET : In an essay for Marianne Williamson 's book you wrote , " Our greatest challenges are spiritual at their source : a misunderstanding of power , the heavy burden of unrelieved materialism , fear of death .
If all that government does is address symptoms , we will always be dissatisfied with the government .
Government itself must be moved to a higher level of thought , to a quickened cognizance of its generative role as a convener of consciousness for the country . "
How can the government play a role of convener of consciousness for the country ?
KUCINICH : To create communities .
To create dialogue to bring people together in town hall meetings and in universities and to have great discussions and great debates in a society .
To recreate the commons , to recreate the public sphere and the commonwealth .
BELIEFNET : What sort of policies ?
KUCINICH :
That 's reflected in everything .
It 's reflected in the way we build the architecture of cities .
It 's reflected in our mass transit policies .
It 's reflected in our health and education systems .
Talking about something that 's holistic .
BELIEFNET : You are vegan .
Why do you follow that path ?
KUCINICH :
Well , I met someone who I fell in love with , and , basically , as a way of exploring the relationship , I changed my diet .
It worked for me .
It gave me a sense of connection and energy and clarity and health that I could never have imagined .
That 's how it started as with many of us , and we meet someone and creates a shift in our lives .
BELIEFNET : Most of those are reasons of physical well - being .
At this point , do you view there as being an ethical dimension ?
KUCINICH : Look , there 's an ethical dimension to everything we do !
Not just our choice of food .
The choice of interviews I do .
There 's an ethical dimension to my life and all of our lives , from the time we get up in the morning to the time we sleep including what we sleep on .
So I do n't separate my choices from ethical choices at any time
It 's consistent with a desire to help participate in sustaining the planet which I think this diet does .
And it also sustains my health , which creates a reciprocal relationship between self and world .
BELIEFNET : For some vegans it implies or is part of a view about a continuum of life ...
KUCINICH :
There is an ethical basis for a choice of foods and for people who pursue the diet I enjoy , the ethical dimension is important .
It 's important to me .
I do n't want to be construed as saying someone who does another diet is lacking in ethics .
BELIEFNET :
There are number of controversial issues about how government approaches life -- whether its abortion , stem cell research , or euthanasia .
Is there a connection between your holistic approach about diet and how you would approach those public policy issues related to life ?
KUCINICH : Yes , I do n't insist that anyone follow the diet that I follow .
Because there has to be an element of freedom in a democratic society .
BELIEFNET : And so , in the case of abortion you might be personally opposed to abortion but pro-choice ?
KUCINICH : I did n't say that .
What I said was that in a democratic society , people must be permitted to make their choices and that the choices of women should not be subordinate to the choices of men , otherwise women are less than equal , are second - class citizens .
Let women choose , and they will choose wisely .
And at the same time with respect to abortion we can create a society where we can all work together to make abortions less necessary which is I think is an important and praiseworthy goal through birth control and sex education .
BELIEFNET :
Why do you think it 's an important goal to make abortion more rare ?
KUCINICH : I think it 's self - explanatory .
I do n't think there needs to be any elaboration on that .
BELIEFNET : I 'm not sure it will be necessarily self - evident .
Clinton used to use the line that he thought abortions should be legal , safe , and rare , but other politicians have not used the last part of the formulation which tells me ...
KUCINICH : I do n't think there 's any woman out there who wakes up and says , " Gee , I think I 'll have an abortion . "
BELIEFNET : [ The Catholic Church ] says that politicians who do n't adopt the anti-abortion line are not good Catholics .
KUCINICH :
Well , you know when we start to define that , when you get into defining , it begins to establish a latitude that could become problematic .
BELIEFNET : Could you elaborate on that ?
I 'm not sure I understand .
KUCINICH : No . I do n't need to .
BELIEFNET : You had interesting comments about the Founding Fathers and separation of church and state .
" Our founders wanted a separation of church and state , but never intended that America would become separated from the spiritual principles which animated the founding of this country . "
What do you think the spiritual principles that animated the founding of the country ?
KUCINICH : An understanding of the role of divine providence .
An understanding of the connection between God and nature .
An appreciation for the possibility that life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness flowed from a transcendent source .
Things like that .
BELIEFNET : You 've proposed creating a Department of Peace .
For our readers who are n't necessarily familiar with that proposal , could you explain ?
One question people would have is how is that different from the State Department .
KUCINICH :
Well , they would n't ask that question if they knew anything about the State Department .
The purpose of the State Department is to support U.S. interests .
Those interests are essentially commercial interests and sometimes military interests .
The Department of Peace takes no position with respect to commercial and military interests but recognizes the interests of the entire society and of our domestic life in America for creating conditions so that we may have a culture of nonviolence .
The way we do it is through creating programs in the schools and programs with community organizations and government organizations and actually create a culture of peace by teaching peace in our schools - by teaching peace giving , and peace sharing and mutuality and reciprocity and seeing the other person as an aspect of one 's self .
I mean [ this is ] very much in line with the teaching of Christ -- do unto others as you would have them do unto you .
Love your neighbor as you love yourself .
The golden rule .
To do that in a practical sense .
To make it the every day work of the nation to teach our children not just how to get along but why they should get along .
Not just simply addressing issues in the school but help families with the difficulties they have with domestic violence and spousal abuse and child abuse .
Take a whole new approach that 's compassionate and accepting of family 's potential to heal and repair the wounds and move beyond their difficult experiences .
BELIEFNET : To what extent should Gandhi's or Martin Luther King 's principles [ of non-violence ] be integrated into our foreign policy ?
KUCINICH :
They would be with a cabinet level position because that would always be a part of the discussion .
Just think if President Bush had that as an option in Iraq .
BELIEFNET : What would that have looked like ?
KUCINICH : UN inspectors .
BELIEFNET : How would your personal spirituality affect what kind of president you 'd be ?
KUCINICH : [ I 'd be ] both grounded and able to envision that place where matter comes together to create the stars and to contemplate both that which is being created and the creator .
BELIEFNET :
In terms of your current spiritual practice , do you do meditate or do yoga ?
What you could you tell us about your current spiritual practice ?
KUCINICH : I 'm meditating now .
BELIEFNET : What do you mean ?
KUCINICH : I 'm meditating now .
This conversation with you is a meditation .
BELIEFNET : Hmmm .
How so ?
KUCINICH :
In that it is a constant flowing in and flowing out of spiritual principles , connection to thought , which is derived from spirit .
It 's the way I live every moment .
BELIEFNET : Does campaigning feel like a spiritual practice ?
KUCINICH : Every moment of my life .
EVERY MOMENT connects to spirit .
In fact , that 's how I 'm here .
It 's Sunday , so it 's time for William " The Bloody " Kristol to pull more factoids out of the orifice of his choice to further his ( and only his ) agenda .
Download Download ( h/t Heather )
In the discussion of John McCain 's " surprise " win in New Hampshire ( do n't let that polling that showed him ahead all the way up to the primary sway you ) to rise from the dead of pundit - declared lost candidacies , Bill Kristol has just one factor that won it all for McCain :
The surge .
KRISTOL : McCain advocated the surge , defended the surge .
It was unpopular ; people thought ... two - thirds of his own campaign wanted him to abandon his position on Iraq .
He stuck with it .
He showed guts , he showed intelligence .
The surge is now working , very , very well .
And McCain , Republicans , like it .
LIASSON : And he held two town meetings .
He worked his butt off .
KRISTOL : He worked his butt off too , but I do n't think ... that would n't have mattered , he could have had town meeting after town meeting .
And if many voters had thought that perhaps it was a mistake to go into Iraq , we did n't change strategy effectively , it would have been disastrous for McCain .
So he was identified with the surge , he is the most credible Commander - in - Chief .
That 's what worked for him in New Hampshire .
Leave aside the new and improved definition of what it means that the surge " has worked , " does it surprise any of you to know that Kristol is completely and utterly wrong , again ?
New Hampshire Republicans said the economy was the nation 's most pressing issue , with the war in Iraq barely edging illegal immigration for second place .
McCain , 71 , fared well among those preoccupied by the economy and the war .
Four in five New Hampshire Republicans are worried about the economy , and they preferred McCain over Romney ( with Huckabee and Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , tied for a distant third ) .
Nearly two - thirds of the Granite State 's GOP voters approve of the war in Iraq , and that group gave slightly more votes to Romney than to McCain .
But McCain more than made up the deficit by winning big margins from the one - third of GOP voters who disapprove of the war .
Obama chides press , talks expectations , looks ahead
Obama spoke to reporters between Houston annd San Antonio , chiding them for buying Clinton claims that the media has been soft on him , Carrie Budoff Brown reports .
He was asked whether he could have responded more quickly to bat down negative stories in recent days about his relationship with Tony Rezko , an indicted Chicago businessman , and a meeting between his economic adviser and the Canadian consulate .
" Look , they have run a pretty negative campaign over the last several weeks , " he said .
" I have said we would do things differently .
I am not going to do things I am not comfortable with .
I want to make sure we stay focused on the issues .
" I am a little surprised that all the complaining about the refs has actually worked as well as it has for them , " he added .
" This whole spin that the press is being so tough of them and not tough on us .
I just did n’t expect you guys would bite on that . "
He also described the election today as " very , very tight " and spoke several times of moving his campaign in the next week to Wyoming and Mississippi -- both expected to be strong states .
“ We started at 20 points behind in Texas and Ohio , " he said .
" We closed the gap . …
We know there is not going to be a huge shift in delegates . ”
When asked if he expected Clinton to bow out if she does not win decisively today , Obama would only say that she was a " tenacious " and " determined " campaigner .
In winning court orders to freeze up to $ 12 billion of Venezuela 's global assets , Exxon Mobil Corp. has mounted the boldest response yet against the resource nationalism that has swept Latin America in recent years .
Announced by Exxon Thursday , the injunction represents the latest chapter in a battle between Venezuelan state oil company , Petróleos de Venezuela ( PDVSA ) , and the US oil giant , which began after Venezuela took a majority stake in some of the country 's largest oil projects last year .
Exxon refused the new terms at that time .
The legal fight on compensation is expected to take years , analysts say .
For now Venezuela , which has dismissed the latest move as " judicial terrorism , " is expected to appeal .
But the political ramifications are immediate .
While analysts say Exxon 's victory could bolster sympathies for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in the face of what he calls " US imperialism , " they say the wider impact will be a strike against efforts by oil and gas - producing countries to renegotiate contracts as commodities prices soar .
" It obviously represents an effort by Exxon not only to address its concerns in Venezuela but to try to deter the increasing tendency of economic nationalism in Latin America and elsewhere , " says Miguel Tinker - Salas , a Latin America oil and politics expert at Pomona College in Claremont , Calif .
" It may embolden other companies to do the same thing . "
Last year , Mr. Chávez declared oil sovereignty by taking a majority stake in projects in the Orinoco River Basin , which may hold the world 's largest deposits of heavy crude .
Of the six companies operating there , all agreed to new contracts except for Conoco - Phillips and Exxon .
Unable to come to terms over the value of its assets , Exxon demanded arbitration to settle .
The effort to freeze Venezuela 's foreign assets is meant to guarantee that PDVSA has the money to pay should Exxon Mobil win in arbitration .
Exxon sued in US , British , and Dutch courts .
Is Exxon 's move a negotiating tactic ?
But many see the move as a negotiating tactic , too .
" This is a pressure mechanism , trying to pressure Venezuela on negotiations to extract a higher value , " says Roger Tissot , a Canadian - based independent energy analyst and expert on Latin America .
Venezuelan oil minister Rafael Ramirez moved to assuage concerns about the financial health of the state company .
" This does not affect our cash flow or our operations at all .
We are operating at 100 percent , and there are no direct consequences for our assets , " he said in Caracas .
Regional model
Venezuela has been viewed as a model for nationalization throughout the region for allies such as Ecuador and Bolivia .
" Venezuela is the key in this area ; the model for many of these countries , " Mr. Tinker - Salas says .
Ecuador 's President Rafael Correa came into office promising to increase state control of national resources .
And the popularity of Bolivian President Evo Morales soared after he took control over his country 's oil and natural gas reserves in May 2006 .
But Venezuela , Ecuador , and Bolivia have faced setbacks and in some cases softened their tone , say analysts , because of a real need for more investment and a weakening global economy .
In this environment , the move by Exxon , widely considered one of the most aggressive companies in dealing with renegotiated contracts , could push other multinationals that have taken more moderate stances until now .
" Resource nationalism works when the economy is booming , " says Mr. Tissot .
" When it 's not , it makes countries more willing to listen to companies ....
The equation is changing in Latin America . "
White House Declares Itself a " Freedom " Free Zone Posted by Pile ( 9300 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
The Bush administration argued in court papers this week that the White House Office of Administration is not subject to the Freedom of Information
Act as part of its effort to fend off a civil lawsuit seeking the release of internal documents about a large number of e-mails missing from White House servers .
In other words , us taxpayers pay for everything over there , but those guys are no longer able to be scrutinized in any way , and if we do n't like it , well I guess we know what Cheney would say .
The claim , made in a motion filed Tuesday by the Justice Department , is at odds with a depiction of the office on the White House 's own Web site .
As of yesterday , the site listed the Office of Administration as one of six presidential entities subject to the open - records law , which is commonly known by its abbreviation , FOIA .
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , a nonprofit group , filed a lawsuit in May seeking Office of Administration records about the missing e-mails , including when they were deleted from government computer files .
CREW said it understood that internal White House documents had estimated at least 5 million e-mails were missing from March 2003 to October 2005 .
The Bush administration has not provided a number publicly .
Some of the records may have been subject to a document preservation law administered by the National Archives and Records Administration .
Congress has sought access to them as part of its probe into the administration 's firing of nine U.S. federal prosecutors in 2006 .
Melanie Sloan , CREW 's executive director , said that " one has to wonder if this is an effort by the White House to keep secret the details of how millions of White House e-mail suddenly went missing .
The OA 's disingenuous claim that it is not subject to the FOIA is contradicted by its own actions and statements . "
White House spokesman Scott Stanzel declined to comment .

The first fossil tracks belonging to large , carnivorous dinosaurs discovered in Victoria , Australia show that large dinosaurs were living in a polar environment during the Cretaceous Period , when Australia was still joined to Antarctica and close to the South Pole .
The find is being reported today , Friday , Oct. 19 , at the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting in Austin , Texas , by Anthony Martin , senior lecturer in environmental studies at Emory .
Martin researched the find with Patricia Vickers - Rich and Lesley Kool of Monash University and Thomas Rich of the Museum of Victoria .
The three separate dinosaur tracks are about 14 inches long , show at least two or three partial toes , and were likely made by large carnivorous dinosaurs ( theropods ) on river floodplains about 115 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period .
Based on track sizes , Martin estimates that these dinosaurs were 4.6 to 4.9 feet tall at the hip , large by human standards but about 20 percent smaller than Allosaurus , a large theropod from the Jurassic Period .
Dinosaurs near the South Pole ?
Martin found two of the tracks during a February 2006 visit with Rich to the " Dinosaur Dreaming " site , near the coastal town of Inverloch .
Tyler Lamb , a Monash undergraduate student and volunteer at the dig site , found a third track in February 2007 , having been alerted by Kool to look for them .
Martin then confirmed its identity during a visit in July 2007 .
Other possible , partial dinosaur tracks have been found at the same site and another locality , but these have yet to be studied in detail .
Vickers - Rich and Rich have been studying the dinosaurs and mammals of Victoria for nearly 30 years .
Lower Cretaceous strata of Victoria have yielded a sizeable amount of dinosaur skeletal material since the late 1970s , resulting in the best - documented polar dinosaur assemblage in the world .
Until Martin's find in 2006 , however , only one dinosaur track ( from a small herbivorous dinosaur ) had been documented .
" I think a lot more tracks are out there , but they 've been too subtle to notice before now , " Martin says .
He and the other researchers say they are optimistic that additional tracks will be found , now that they have examples of the tracks to go by in their searches .
- Emory University
Edward Wasserman , writing in the Feb .
18 Miami Herald , makes an obvious but still unsettling point about the news business :
The nearly two - century - old marriage between consumer advertising and journalism is on the rocks .
Prof. Wasserman , the Knight professor of journalism ethics at Washington and Lee University , recounts that two hundred years from the penny press to the difficulties that “ new media ” have with a business model that presumes people will pay for news â€ ” and therefore advertisers will pay to park themselves in front of those eyeballs .
But , says Prof. Wasserman :
That era is now ending , not because the public no longer needs news or because people mistrust news any more than they always have â€ ” but because new technologies are churning out better ways to reach customers who are shopping for cars , jobs or homes .
For two centuries , advertising has supported journalism .
The First Amendment guarantees freedom of the press â€ ” but does not guarantee profitability .
That news organizations must achieve without government support .
And they have been doing that .
Even now , newspapers represent cash cows for their owners .
Profit margins hover in the mid-teens , although they ’re down from the heydays of 20 - plus percent of just a decade ago .
As investors demand that profits be maintained , news companies have reduced expenses â€ ” primarily by cutting staffs and curtailing geographical circulation â€ ” to do so .
No more , says Prof. Wasserman .
Those means will not allow profitability much longer .
A new revenue model is needed .
He reviews the revived notions of foundation ownership and public financing and finds them lacking .
In some respects such [ foundation ] patronage is hugely appealing , though as [ the American Journalism Review article ] suggests the dangers to editorial independence can be no less serious than with advertising support :
Indeed , advertisers could be sublimely indifferent to editorial content as long as it was drawing a crowd they could sell to ( and was n’t about them ) .
But foundations and public - minded plutocrats are less bashful about their preferences and convictions , and some philanthropies may even be obligated to ensure their money advances certain policy goals .
Public financing , too , long banished from polite conversation , is getting a new airing .
An article last fall in the Columbia Journalism Review dusted off the topic and noted that in other countries , stand - alone systems of automatic funding have kept dying newspapers alive and made the press even feistier â€ ” more , not less , inclined to watchdog governments .
Remember , please , Prof. Wasserman is exploring ways to generate financial support for journalism beyond the dying - on - the - vine business model to which the news business is unwisely and unfortunately tethered .
He asks one fundamental question :
Who gets the money ?
It ’s the Internet age .
A great many entities and individuals have leapt into fact - gathering and topical commentary in a magnificent , worldwide surge of communicative enfranchisement .
Should n’t they get compensated , too ?
Maybe the solution is n’t to escape the market , but to empower it .
Modern computing offers unparalleled capacities to track and calculate .
Imagine a vast menu of news and commentary offered to you ad - free for pennies per item , the charges micro-billed , added up and presented like a utility bill at month ’s end .
The money that journalism providers got would depend on their audience .
Right now , I enjoy The New York Times free of charge every day .
And I read , also free , news stories from other Web sites .
Has Prof. Wasserman proposed a workable business model that would benefit bloggers as well ?
Would you pay a few pennies for each item you read on the Web , billable at the end of the month ?
If you visited S&R , would you pay a few cents to read the posts ?
More to the point , if others read your comments , should you be paid a few cents as well ?
I do n’t know if Prof.
Wasserman ’s suggestions are workable .
But his commentary is worth the read .
It is a new approach to a vexing problem .
And we do know this : Journalism needs a sustainable business model that secures both suitable revenue for ownership and guarantees against government interference .

Spitzer Resigns -
It 's Time to Impeach Bush
Today Gov. Eliot Spitzer apologized again to the people of New York for his personal failings and resigned , just 16 months after winning an historic landslide election with 70 % of the vote .
But Spitzer 's resignation was not entirely voluntary , because Republican leaders were busy drafting Articles of Impeachment .
What was Spitzer 's impeachable offense ?
The " lowest " crime in the book .
As we know , the Founding Fathers wanted Impeachment to be used for " High Crimes " like treason , bribery , war crimes , and subverting the Constitution itself .
Eliot Spitzer committed no " High Crimes " - but George Bush and Dick Cheney most certainly have , and they continue to do so with absolute impunity .
It 's time for Congress to impeach them for it .
http://www.democrats.com/peoplesemailnetwork/88?ad=d8
16 months ago , we posted a petition listing 10 High Crimes which justified their impeachment :
(1) Starting a " war of aggression " ( 2 ) torture ( 3 ) arbitrary detention ( 4 ) war crimes ( 5 ) warrantless wiretapping ( 6 ) signing statements ( 7 ) election fraud ( 8 ) outing a covert CIA operative ( 9 ) the " unitary executive " ( 10 ) gross negligence for Katrina and global warming .
Each one of these crimes is as unacceptable today as it was then .
After 5 years in Iraq ( see below ) , Bush has killed nearly 4,000 Americans and over 1 million Iraqis and incurred $ 3 trillion in costs .
And there are many more crimes we could add , including Bush 's commutation of Scooter Libby 's sentence to stop him from testifying about the crimes of Bush and Cheney themselves , and Bush 's ongoing threats to bomb Iran .
And each one makes Spitzer 's " crime " utterly insignificant by comparison .
Over 137,000 of you have signed this petition , and we thank you .
( If you 've forgotten , our form wo n't let you sign twice . )
But many of you have not .
And in the wake of the Republican effort to impeach Eliot Spitzer for his " low " crime , every American who is outraged by Bush 's " High Crimes " should sign it .
Please tell your Senators and Representative to Impeach Bush and Cheney Now :
http://www.democrats.com/peoplesemailnetwork/88?ad=d8
And thanks for all you do to make the world a better place .

Exclusive BT ’s servers were secretly passing data on subscribers to its " new " advertising partner as long ago as last summer , though the companies refused to acknowledge any relationship at the time .
BT - the UK 's number one internet provider - finally revealed the plan earlier this month along with Virgin Media and Talk Talk , which occupy the number two and three spots behind it .
This means
Phorm , the company that will run the targeting system , will have access in all to more than 10 million streams of web browsing data .
Phorm 's Open Internet Exchange is an online broker that matches advertisers with publishers , much like Google or Yahoo !.
The difference is that rather than target your interests using data you volunteer via web searches and by using free email services , Phorm is paying your ISP to hand over data on your browsing habits direct .
The technology has roots in spyware , but the company insists it is setting a new " gold standard " in privacy online and emphasises that ISP customers will be able to opt-out .
Phorm and its trio of ISP partners are hoping to sell consumers on the idea by bundling some shiny anti-phishing bells and whistles with the package .
However , BT 's reluctance to acknowledge what appears to have been a pilot of the Phorm system indicates how nervous executives are - or were - about their new revenue scheme .
' You have malware '
In June 2007 , Reg reader Stephen noticed his Firefox 2.0.0.4 installations making suspicious unauthorised connections to the domain dns.sysip.net every time he visted any website .
Naturally worried his machines had contracted some kind of digital infection , Stephen performed a series of exhaustive malware scans , which all came back clean .
He was n't the only BT subscriber to notice that his browser was making the mysterious contacts around July last year , as this thread archived at Thinkbroadband.com shows .
" I spent all weekend wiping my disks clean and reinstalling from backups ( four PCs seemed to be affected ) .
I spent a further two days researching and installing all kinds of anti-virus , anti-spyware and anti-rootkit utilities .
But even after all that I still have this problem ! "
Stephen told us at the time .
Having failed to trace the source of the dodgy redirect in his own network , he contacted BT to suggest one of their DNS servers may have been hijacked .
BT dismissed the idea , yet the browser requests were still making an unauthorised stop off at dns.sysip.net .
Worried that his business ' financial data might be being monitored , Stephen continued to investigate .
A Whois search for dns.sysip.net revealed the domain was registered by Ahmet Can , an employee of a new online advertising company called 121 Media .
The address is now registered through a third party private domaining agency .
121 Media rebranded itself as - you guessed it - Phorm in May 2007 .
This is , you 'll be unsurprised to learn , is indeed the same Phorm that BT , Virgin Media and Carphone Warehouse recently revealed they had agreed to sell their customer 's browsing habits to , despite the questions over its links to spyware .
For helping Phorm target advertising , the ISPs are set to bag a cut of click revenues .
The company 's proposed business model was in the public domain last summer , and being able to put two and two together , Stephen asked Phorm and BT what they were doing with dns.sysip.net and his browsing data .
This is where the story got weird .
Thayer added a forehead pad and chin rest to his design of the catcher 's mask to help absorb the impact of the ball .
Image courtesy National Baseball Hall of Fame Library 1878 : Fred Thayer , captain of Harvard University 's baseball team , receives a patent for his inspired invention , the catcher 's mask .
Getting hit in the face with a baseball is always an unpleasant experience .
Only a complete idiot would willingly squat behind home plate to catch live pitching , with a live batter , without wearing a mask – and a chest protector , shin guards and , yes , a cup .
But when the game was in its infancy and pitchers did n't throw 100 mph , that 's exactly what the catchers did .
Maybe there were no Randy Johnsons back then , but it was still dangerous .
The curveball was becoming popular , and some catchers had trouble handling the new pitch .
And Thayer could n't help but noticing that guys became a little tentative behind the dish after getting clocked by a few foul tips .
When Harvard 's promising new receiver , James Tyng , started acting head - shy , Thayer began looking for ways to fix things .
Taking his inspiration from the fencing mask , Thayer designed a mask that added a forehead pad and chin rest to help absorb the impact of the ball .
He also replaced the fine wire mesh of the fencing mask with a " birdcage " face protector that improved visibility .
Thayer and Tyng experimented with the catcher 's mask away from the diamond , before Tyng finally used it in a regular - season game on April 12 , 1877 .
It was , pardon the pun , a hit .
Gushed the Harvard Crimson :
( T) he new mask was proved a complete success , since it entirely protects the face and head and adds greatly to the confidence of the catcher , who need not feel that he is every moment in danger of a lifelong injury .
To the ingenious inventor of this mask we are largely indebted for the excellent playing of our new catcher , who promises to excel the fine playing of those who have previously held this position .
Tyng originally wore the mask only on a two - strike count , when catching the third strike cleanly was necessary to record the out .
But he soon saw the advantage of wearing it all the time , and nobody argued with him .
Word of Thayer 's invention spread quickly throughout the baseball world , and soon even major league catchers had adopted it .
A.G. Spalding and Brothers , a sporting - goods company , began selling " Thayer 's Patent Harvard Catcher 's Mask " for $ 3 ( that 's $ 58 in today 's money ) .
Thayer 's original is on display at the Baseball Hall of Fame .

Cognitive insight , those flashes of brilliance when a mental breakthrough happens , are widely recognized but very little is known about their constituent cognitive components and underlying neural mechanisms .
It is also unclear why trying too hard does more harm than good .
In a study published in PLoS ONE , researchers at Goldsmiths College , London , investigated brain rhythms and their dynamics while human volunteers solved verbal problems .
Often , the participants reached a state of mental block and could not progress further .
An excessive amount of gamma brain rhythm ( the same rhythm gets enhanced with selective attention ) might cause this mental road block , thus reaffirming the belief that focusing too much on a topic is detrimental .
They provided clues to participants in the state of mental block yet they were not always successfully utilized and the researchers discovered it was possible to predict the success or failure based on the brain state prior to the clue presentation .
They also found that when the volunteers were consciously aware that they were having a strong breakthrough in their mental strategies , they were less likely to feel the suddenness of " Aha ! "
Significant clusters of the nonparametric cluster randomization tests for mental impasse and timeout .
( A ) Comparison of mental impasse with timeout trials .

Top right : topography of the occipital theta band cluster for the same comparison .
Bottom : Pseudo - color coded time - frequency representation in decibel ( dB ) of the difference between mental impasse and timeout averaged over electrodes PO3 , Oz and PO4 .
Red color indicates higher spectral power for mental impasse and blue color indicates higher spectral power for timeout .
Mental impasse response or timeout is at t = 0 s. ( B ) Comparison of the immediate pre- and post - hint presentation time period after reaching a mental impasse between hints that led to a correct solution versus those that led to a timeout trials .
Topographical map on the left shows the right parieto - occipital gamma band cluster , displaying significant ( P< 0.04 ) differences .
Top right : Pseudo - color coded , grand - averaged time - frequency representation of all electrodes that comprise the significant cluster .
Bottom : grand - averaged gamma frequency event - related synchronization ( ERS ) averaged for both conditions between 38 and 52 Hz and for the same electrodes as in the time - frequency representation .
The red rectangle marks the zone of significance ( p<0.01 ) .
Red color indicates higher spectral power for correct solution trials and blue color indicates higher spectral power for timeout trials .
( C ) As in ( B ) but comparing the immediate pre- and post - hint presentation time period of hints after timeout that led to a correct solution versus those that led to a further timeout .
The dotted red rectangle marks the zone of significance with p<0.05 .
The white rectangles with solid and dotted lines in the grand averaged time - frequency representation plots show the time - frequency zones of significance with p<0.01 and p<0.05 , respectively .
Bhattacharya and colleagues show that a strong " Aha ! " sensation involves minimal metacognitive ( monitoring of one ’s own thoughts ) processes and unconscious restructuring or , better , an automatic , subconscious recombination of information which stands in contrast to conscious mental restructuring which is an attention - demanding process involving executive control .
The study shows that it is possible to identify these processes before they reach the level of verbal awareness .
Arguably , insight lies at the core of human intelligence , so its proper understanding in terms of a set of underlying neural mechanisms will not only influence the immediate fields of psychology and cognitive neuroscience but also exert sold impact on a range of scientific and educational disciplines .
The pedagogical importance is also noteworthy .
For example , a better understanding of complex problem solving behaviour of human subjects will facilitate a better strategy of teaching and enhancing the performance of pupils , formulation of efficient solution strategies which , in turn , enhances the creativity .

Two leaders of the Omaha chapter of the Black Panthers ' National Committee to Combat Fascism , Ed Poindexter and Mondo we Langa ( formerly David Rice ) , are serving life sentences for the 1970 bombing murder of Omaha Police officer Larry Minard .
Officer Minard was killed at a booby - trapped vacant house while answering a call about a woman screaming .
Police arrested 15 year - old Duane Peak for the murder who quickly implicated Poindexter and Langa in exchange for a reduced sentence .
Peak , the confessed killer , walked free in 1974 .
Poindexter and Langa remain behind bars and both deny any involvement in the crime .
Poindexter and Langa had been targets of COINTELPRO , a secret and illegal operation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ordered by J. Edgar Hoover to disrupt domestic political groups .
Hoover had been personally kept updated on developments in his war on the Black Panthers by field agents .
The Special Agent - in - Charge of the Omaha FBI office notified Hoover directly about the case they were building against Poindexter and Langa .
Five Omaha police detectives and command officials can now be directly tied to deception or false testimony under oath about the case by examining court records , judicial decisions , COINTELPRO memorandums , and Congressional documents .
A then - secret COINTELPRO memo tells the story of withheld evidence -- a recording of the emergency call that lured Larry Minard to his death -- and implicates Assistant Chief of Police Glenn Gates in knowingly withholding evidence that would destroy the credibility of Peak , the state 's murderous star witness .
Assistant Chief Gates , according to the FBI , sought to keep the recording away from the defense attorneys .
The jury never got to hear the tape with its lethal message .
COINTELPRO memorandum , Oct. 13 , 1970 , from the Omaha FBI office to J. Edgar Hoover :
" Assistant COP GLENN GATES , Omaha PD , advised that he feels that any use of tapes of this call might be prejudicial to the police murder trial against two accomplices of PEAK and , therefore , has advised that he wishes no use of this tape until after the murder trials of PEAK and the two accomplices has been completed . "
A trip to Washington , D.C. and sworn testimony by Captain Murdock Platner to the U. S. House Committee on Internal Security gave rise to false statements to a Congressional committee about Langa , contradicted by the trial record .
At trial , and earlier at the preliminary hearing , Peak testified that a Panther named Raleigh House had supplied him with the dynamite .
House was arrested but never prosecuted .
Captain Platner falsely testified to Congress that Langa supplied the dynamite , just several weeks after the preliminary hearing and the day after the COINTELPRO memo about Assistant Chief Gates .
U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Internal Security , Oct. 14 , 1970 , p. 4889 :
" Duane Peak , a 16 - year - old boy who was arrested , testified in a preliminary hearing .
It is from this preliminary hearing you are bound over to the district court to stand trial .
In the preliminary hearing he testified that David Rice [ Langa ] brought a suitcase filled with dynamite to his house or to somebody 's house , I 'm not for sure just which place , ; that they removed all the dynamite from the suitcase except three sticks ; made the bomb , the triggering device , and so on , and put it together ; and then packed the suitcase with newspapers and that he left with this suitcase . "
The questioning of the killer 's family and Delia Peak , simultaneous with the police search of Langa 's house , led to Lieutenant James Perry 's false testimony in court to justify the search .
U.S. District Judge Warren Urbom best tells the story of Lt. Perry 's false sworn statements in the case .
Rice v. Wolff , 388 F. Supp. 185 ( 1974 ) U.S. District Court , pp. 198-199 :
" Lt. Perry 's testimony that Delia Peak told him that Duane Peak , Edward Poindexter and David Rice were constant companions is in no way corroborated by the remainder of the record before me .
The police report of her interview reveals nothing about Duane Peak 's being a constant companion of David Rice's , and the rights advisory form she signed indicates that only Sgt. R. Alsager and Richard Curd were present for her interview .
Moreover , her interview did not begin until the very hour police first approached David Rice 's house and was not completed until after the decision has been made to enter his house .
The police report of her interview also reveals that she had seen Duane Peak at about 5:00 p.m. the night before .
Thus , it simply is not so that Duane Peak 's family had not seen him in the two days before they had entered the petitioners house and is persuasive that Delia Peak 's family did not make a contrary statement .
Finally , there is no indication in the police reports of interviews with Duane Peak 's family prior to the entry of Rice 's house that they were concerned that he might have been eliminated .
On the basis of the entire record before this court and having heard and seen Lt. Perry testify , it is impossible for me to credit his testimony in the respects mentioned . "
Sergeant Jack Swanson testified at the murder trial that he went down to the basement and found the dynamite .
Sergeant Robert Pheffer backed up Swanson saying he first saw the dynamite when Swanson carried it upstairs .
Pheffer testified he never went down in the basement .
At an Omaha court hearing in May 2007 in Poindexter 's bid for a new trial , Pheffer testified that his trial testimony was not correct and that he , not Swanson found the dynamite .
The dynamite was never seen in the basement by anyone else and only first appears in an evidence photo pictured in the trunk of a police squad car .
Robert Bartle , Poindexter 's attorney describes the contradictory testimony in an appeal brief to the Nebraska Supreme Court where the case is now pending .
Nebraska v. Poindexter , S-07-001075 , Nebraska Supreme Court , Appellant 's Brief , pp. 45 - 46 :
" At Poindexter 's trial , Sgt. Swanson testified that he found dynamite in Rice 's basement at 2816 Parker and that Sgt. Pheffer was also in the basement when Swanson found it .
Contrary to Swanson 's trial testimony , Pfeffer testified at trial that he ( Pheffer ) never went down into Rice 's basement and that he ( Pheffer ) first saw the dynamite found by Swanson when Swanson carried it up from Rice 's basement .
At Poindexter 's post - conviction hearing on May 30 , 2007 , Pheffer 's testimony about finding the dynamite in Rice 's basement was significantly different from his sworn trial testimony 36 years earlier .
On May 30 , 2007 , Pheffer testified that he was the one who found the dynamite in Rice 's basement at 2816 Parker on August 22 , 1970 .
Pheffer claimed that Swanson was right behind him and that when Pheffer saw the dynamite , he became scared and told Swanson that they needed to ' get the heck out of here . '
When confronted with the discrepancy between Pheffer 's sworn trial testimony in 1971 and his recent testimony of actually being the officer who found the dynamite , Pheffer swore that this trial testimony in 1971 was not correct , that ' the court reporter , somebody got it wrong . ' "

Torrie Gonzales stood at the stove , laughing with her boyfriend as she fried him some eggs on his 23rd birthday .
Then she felt him press a flimsy blade against her neck .
Struggling on the floor , she pried a paring knife from Reny Cabral ’s hand , leaving him curled up in a ball , sobbing and seemingly horrified .
“ He said , ‘ I do n’t know what I ’m doing .
I ’m so sorry , ’ ” recalled Gonzales , now 25 .
Twice more he attacked her , choking her until she passed out , then performed mouth - to - mouth resuscitation to revive her .
Finally , he raised his arms with a look of panic and walked into the orchard adjacent to his parents ’ modest rural home .
A neighbor , hearing Gonzales ’ screams , dialed 911 .
In the days leading up to the Jan. 6 attack , Cabral had been exhibiting symptoms of an emerging psychotic illness .
He was held , briefly , in a psychiatric facility .
But once Glenn County sheriff ’s deputies responded to the 911 call , he lost any chance of being treated in the mental health system .
He would now be dealt with as a criminal , with catastrophic consequences .
As the availability of acute inpatient services has diminished , rising numbers of the mentally ill are ending up behind bars .
About 350,000 of the country ’s 2.1 million inmates have been diagnosed with severe mental illness , said Dr. H. Richard Lamb , director of research for the Institute of Mental Health , Law , and Public Policy at USC ’s Keck School of Medicine .
Some mentally ill people find themselves diagnosed and treated for the first time after being incarcerated .
But jails and prisons -- never designed for therapeutic care -- often trigger deeper crises , Lamb said .
What happened to Cabral provides a stark illustration of just how wrong things can go .
Today , Cabral is not only facing criminal charges and struggling with mental illness ; he is also paralyzed from the mid-chest down , unable to walk , to dial a phone or hold a pen .
Arturo and Rosa Cabral immigrated to Orland in the late 1970s from the hills of Zacatecas in central Mexico .
On the flat expanse of the northern Sacramento Valley , hard work was plentiful in orchards of almonds , olives and plums .
In time , they forged their own business as landscapers and had three sons , who helped from the time they were young .
None pitched in with as little complaint as Reny .
“ Conscientious , ” “ always respectful , ” and “ a cut above the outstanding ” an array of elementary and high school teachers wrote of him in letters last spring to the Glenn County Superior Court .
He ran track and played basketball , baseball and football , all while making the honor roll .
Photographs show him beaming as prom king .
At Butte College , he developed a passion for politics , trolling fraternity parties at Cal State Chico in 2004 to register new voters .
At one such party , Cabral met Gonzales , a women ’s studies major with laser - sharp wit .
The following summer they moved in together .
“ He was something different from everyone else who I met , ” Gonzales said .
“ He was n’t some drunk guy .
That was refreshing . ”
But by the fall of 2006 , she recalled , he ’d changed .
“ He would sit on the couch and just stare at nothing . ”
He told her bizarre tales : that he worked for the FBI , that he ’d been kidnapped and molested .
He began using marijuana and alcohol in increasing quantities , Gonzales said , a common occurrence among people with emerging mental illness .
On landscaping jobs , the old Reny would lift his mother in the air and twirl her around until both were breathless with laughter .
The new Reny was removed .
“ His face was different .
He talked to us differently , ” said Rosa Cabral .
“ But we did n’t know what it was . ”
ON Jan. 3 , Gonzales walked through the open door of the Chico apartment she shared with Cabral to find tufts of body hair on the living room floor .
Meanwhile , in the city ’s expansive Bidwell Park , police watched as Cabral bolted naked through traffic , dragging a roll of saran wrap behind him .
Nearby , officers found 5 gallons of kerosene and his oil - drenched clothes .
A detached Cabral spoke of suicide to police and social workers and said he shaved his eyebrows for a “ fresh start , ” records show .
Police had him transported to a local emergency room , and from there he was sent to Butte County ’s 16 - bed Psychiatric Health Facility on a 72 - hour hold , police and county records show .
There , he was tentatively diagnosed with psychotic and depressive disorders , records show , and prescribed Risperdal , an antipsychotic drug most commonly used to treat schizophrenia .
Early chart entries described him as “ suspicious ” and “ guarded . ” Entries at 2:45 a.m. and 6:15 a.m. found him restless .
But by 7:30 a.m. , the tone of the entries had changed : Cabral promised he would not hurt himself .
“ I do need some help though , ” he said .
“ I can not do it on my own . ”
When , at 9:30 a.m. , he said he needed “ to spend time with my family , ” the facility obliged .
His diagnosis was changed to “ major depressive disorder , ” and about 10:30 a.m. -- just 10 hours into his three - day hold -- Cabral was released .
The Cabrals , Gonzales and Julie Nasr , a close family friend , were waiting for Reny upon his release .
Gonzales said Cabral that evening told the family he had been instructed by God to “ cleanse the household ” on his birthday .
She said he burst into tears and told her : “ The loved one ” to be sacrificed “ is you . ”
Nasr had already placed several unsuccessful calls to the psychiatric facility , begging them to take Cabral back .
Now she and Reny ’s older brother , Art Jr. , both called in a panic .
But Cabral refused to return to the facility , and the family was reluctant to call police who might use force .
Butte County Behavioral Health officials declined to comment on the case .
But Lamb , the USC psychiatrist , noted that as the availability of community beds for those with acute mental illness has plummeted statewide , there has been “ a tremendous amount of pressure to keep the length of stay down . ”
Cabral ’s bizarre behavior , however , made the need for more extensive treatment obvious , he said .
“ We can say with 100 % certainty that he needed the full 72 hours , ” Lamb said .
“ We can probably say with 90 % certainty that he should have had the full 17 days ” that mental health officials could have authorized .
If Cabral had been held for 72 hours , he would have been hospitalized on the day of the attacks .
The fact that Cabral was experiencing his first psychotic break , Lamb noted , would have greatly enhanced his chances of successful intervention had he gotten proper treatment .
On the Saturday after his release , Gonzales and Cabral made plans .
They would cook breakfast , then walk the family ’s corgi- basset hound mix .
His worried parents went to work , arranging for Art Jr. to come to the house too .
But when he overslept and did n’t show up , Gonzales was n’t worried .
“ I did n’t have the possible inkling that he would hurt me , ” Gonzales said of Cabral .
“ I think we were all in denial because everything hit so quick .
We were thinking of the Reny that was , the Reny that would n’t hurt anyone . ”
The deputies who brought Cabral to the Glenn County Jail in Willows had heard about his recent psychosis from Art Jr. , sheriff ’s records show .
The jail also received a faxed copy of the police report from neighboring Butte County outlining the park episode and psychiatric hold .
Nasr ’s husband , a Chico pathologist , called to inform jail officials that Cabral had been prescribed antipsychotic medication and needed help .
But Cabral did not receive it .
The lone psychiatrist who contracts with the jail was on vacation , records show , so shortly after Cabral was booked on charges of attempted murder and domestic abuse , a jail nurse called Glenn County ’s Mental Health Department to ask for a clinical assessment .
But when a social worker called the jail , a deputy told him Cabral seemed OK , county records show .
“ The jail staff will advise us of any further desired services in this case , ” the social worker wrote in a log of the exchange .
About 40 hours after Cabral ’s arrest , deputies noticed urine seeping from under his cell door , according to county officials .
They found him naked , drinking copious amounts of water and vomiting .
In his distorted mind , Cabral would later recall in an interview , he was transforming into the DC Comics hero Aquaman so he could travel down the drain “ to be with my mom . ”
When deputies entered to move him to the jail ’s “ safety ” cell , he began throwing toilet water .
Willows Police Officer Jason Dahl , who responded to a call for backup , deployed his Taser , delivering seven 5 - second shocks to Cabral ’s chest , police records show .
Writhing , Cabral splashed more urine and fecal matter from the toilet .
Dahl reloaded and zapped again , then reached for his pepper spray .
“ I emptied the entire 4 - ounce bottle . . . on Cabral , ” he wrote that morning in a document later filed in court .
Finally subdued at 3:50 a.m. , Cabral was placed in a safety cell lined with a thin layer of hard rubber .
Paranoia raging , he believed he would be raped if he did n’t escape , he recalled , and so rammed his head against the wall .
In checks through a slit in the door every 15 minutes , deputies noted his posture .
The last entry to record him standing was at 4:31 a.m .
“ Laying on floor , ” “ Laying on stomach breathing , ” “ Laying on stomach , ” subsequent entries in a jail log note .
At 5:45 a.m. , breakfast was pushed through the opening .
Cabral did not rise .
Cabral claims he yelled for help steadily .
“ If they did answer , they said to ‘ get up , ’ ” he said .
The first log entry to note Cabral ’s distress was at 10:11 a.m. : “ Laying on stomach / yelling . ”
At 11:10 a.m. : “ alleges paralysis -- ‘ broken neck . ’ ” Without entering the cell to investigate , the deputy left a voicemail for a nurse , records show .
At noon , as Cabral pleaded for help , they served him lunch .
No one opened the door until the jail nurse arrived at 1:09 p.m. -- more than eight hours after Cabral was last reported standing .
Willows ’ tiny Glenn Medical Center concluded Cabral was quadriplegic .
Three more hours passed before he was taken to Enloe Medical Center in Chico and given medication to reduce spinal cord swelling , according to a legal claim Cabral filed against Glenn County .
The county rejected the claim , and Cabral ’s civil attorney said he is now preparing to file a lawsuit .
His paralysis might have been mitigated by more prompt treatment : Steroids to reduce swelling must generally be given within eight hours of trauma , said Dr. Geoffrey Manley , chief of neurotrauma at San Francisco General Hospital and Medical Center .
“ Time is critical for the nervous system , ” he said .
Cabral emerged from surgery “ a C6 complete quadriplegic , ” Dr. Jeffrey Mimbs wrote in a document submitted to the criminal court .
He could elevate his arms and flex his elbows , but could not use his hands .
Because of the civil claim alleging negligence , malpractice , battery and civil rights violations , county officials have declined to discuss details of Cabral ’s stay at the jail .
But Glenn County Sheriff Larry Jones conceded that his staff -- whom he notes are “ not mental health clinicians ” -- are increasingly overwhelmed by inmates in psychiatric crisis .
Just two weeks after Cabral broke his neck in the safety cell , officers repeatedly used a Taser on a mentally ill inmate who was dipping his shredded articles of clothing in toilet water and eating them , according to a Sheriff ’s Department document .
Unlike Butte County , Glenn County has no psychiatric facility , instead leasing beds in Yuba City for $ 600 a day .
Jones has declined to send inmates there because the facility insists that guarding officers check their weapons at the door -- a requirement that Jones said would leave his officers “ emasculated . ”
A recent Glenn County Grand Jury report , while not mentioning Cabral ’s case specifically , acknowledges inadequate inmate mental health care , spreading blame among the jail , the county Mental Health Department and the hospital , citing several cases in which mentally ill inmates did not receive any care .
For the Cabrals , it has been a year of pain and adjustment .
“ Before this , I maybe saw my dad cry once , ” Art Jr. said .
“ Now it ’s a regular occurrence . ”
Dozens of friends , relatives and former teachers have packed Cabral ’s court hearings along with longtime landscaping customers who have pitched in to defray legal costs , shouldered primarily by the Nasrs .
At a March arraignment held at the physical rehabilitation center where Cabral was recovering , he was released on his own recognizance pending trial .
After six months at a Chico nursing home , Cabral returned this month to his parents ’ now heavily mortgaged home , equipped with ramps and climate control financed by a $ 65,000 loan .
His position must be frequently adjusted to relieve pressure .
Tight gloves compress his hands at night to create a claw - like reflex that may help him perform simple tasks .
Cabral is taking a dose of Risperdal that quiets his mind , leaving him with a slight slur of speech and a gentle insight into his schizophrenia diagnosis .
“ It ’s something I ’m committed to do -- to stay on the medication , ” Cabral said from his bed one evening .
He longs to be at work with his parents , hearing “ the rustle of the leaves , the wind in the trees . ”
But along with a maddening desire for independence has come reflection .
“ You know , ” he told Nasr one night as she read aloud to him from Ray Bradbury ’s “ Fahrenheit 451 , ” “ I ’m looking forward to what my life as a quadriplegic will bring me .
I think it will be a more intellectual life than I would have otherwise had -- now that I do n’t have my body . ”
His relationship with Gonzales has taken new shape , punctuated by Best Friends Forever bracelets .
In May , she returned for her first visit since moving to her parents ’ home in Riverside to grieve and rebuild .
Both were nervous .
But the hug came naturally .
For days , Gonzales sat by Cabral ’s side , feeding him , stroking his arm , playing Uno .
At night , amid the inhale and exhale of the leg pressurizing machine , they cried and talked -- about the shattered romance and Cabral ’s looming criminal charges .
Twenty - seven California counties have mental health courts for adults whose crimes are linked to illness , offering flexible treatment and a reduced or nonexistent criminal record .
Glenn County is not among them .
Prosecutors there continue to press their case , even as community members have pleaded for leniency .
Gonzales ’ early statements to law enforcement form the backbone of the prosecution ’s case , despite her desire to see the charges dropped .
Conviction on triple attempted murder charges could mean many years in a state prison system in which care of the mentally -- and medically -- ill has been deemed so poor as to be unconstitutional .
It could also jeopardize Cabral ’s chances of accessing public housing for the disabled , and frighten off potential employers .
Cabral ’s other option -- a mental health defense of not guilty by reason of insanity -- raises the specter of indefinite institutionalization in the state mental hospital system , which is under federal oversight for a history of poor patient care .
Cabral ’s defense attorney , Dennis Latimer , first sought to leave the mental health issue out altogether , arguing that Cabral ’s attempts at resuscitation and Gonzales ’ superficial injuries indicated no intent to kill .
But Cabral ’s actions are hard to explain without context .
On Aug. 25 , Cabral and his family once again entered a Glenn County courtroom .
Inside , Cabral softly entered his plea :
Not guilty by reason of insanity .
Latimer hopes prosecutors -- or a jury -- will see fit to reduce the charges .
“ Do you understand that this could mean a lifetime in a state mental hospital ? ” the judge asked Cabral .
“ Yes , ” he answered , as his mother wept .

Fed 's bold moves : Band - Aid or breakthrough ?

1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Faced with the threat of a massive economic meltdown last week , the Federal Reserve rode to the rescue with unprecedented remedies .
It did n't just slash interest rates , it offered emergency loans to securities firms , agreed to take mortgage debt as collateral , and brokered a fire sale of collapsing Wall Street giant Bear Stearns .
Now that the Fed has calmed the economy 's troubled waters , investors and economists are left wondering whether the fix will prove to be a Band - Aid or a breakthrough .
Even optimists admit the economy seems to be in an early - stage recession with job losses spreading and spending curtailed as the credit crunch tightens .
The question now is how deep the downturn will be and how long it will last .
" It 's too soon to say whether we 've turned a corner on a sustained basis , but this week 's developments pulled us back from the edge , " said Gary Schlossberg , senior economist at San Francisco 's Wells Capital Management .
" We 're not out of the woods yet by any means .
The fact the Fed and the government have shown willingness to move aggressively ( helped ) calm the markets ; it may limit the turbulence going forward . "
Many Wall Street experts say they are encouraged by the Fed 's drastic actions and by the government 's allowing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - the government - chartered lending agencies - to raise billions more to channel into buying mortgages .
Most important , investors may have recovered some heart .
But there are still huge challenges ahead .
Liquidity dries up
Simply put , much of Wall Street has become gun-shy about lending money as the infection has spread from the defaults of risky , subprime loans that lie at the heart of the economic problems .
That crisis of confidence brought Bear Stearns to the brink of bankruptcy .
It also has hammered consumers applying for mortgages and businesses seeking loans .
Precious little liquidity is available .
Even though the Fed has chopped a whopping three percentage points off its key federal funds rate since September , that has not translated into lower rates for mortgages , car loans and other forms of credit .
" If no one is lending , who cares what the rate is ? " said Steve Cochrane , senior economist at Moody 's Economy.com in West Chester , Pa . " Even a zero or very - low - interest ( federal funds ) rate means nothing if there 's no lending going on .
That 's part of what forced the Fed 's hand to move in these other directions to become the lender of last resort , and to a wider range of financial institutions . "
" What you and I care about is the end borrowing rate , the rate we 're going to be paying , " said James Wilcox , a professor of financial institutions at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley .
" So far it has n't gone down because the financial system is n't working right now .
That 's short - circuiting some of the interest - rate cuts . "
Housing at the epicenter
It all comes down to where it started : the housing market .
The wounds are no longer confined to subprime mortgages , but have spread to all segments of real estate with buyers and sellers in a virtual stalemate , and prices plummeting .
Until that changes , the economy cannot recover .
" The housing market is the epicenter of the crisis today , " said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody 's Investor Service in New York .
" Stabilizing housing and moderating home - price deflation would go far to enhance investor confidence and modify the supply of liquidity .
As home prices slump , so does wealth in general .
That reduces consumer spending . "
But the housing market is nowhere near a correction yet .
The most cheerful estimate is that it will bottom out late this year .
Some say it could take years to recover .
" There is no sign that prices have leveled off anywhere , " Cochrane said .
" Home prices have to get down to a point where buyers truly think they 're a bargain given the cost of financing and the long - term outlook for price appreciation . "
For a textbook correction , the faster housing prices plunge , the faster they 'll hit bottom and be ready to turn around .
But the faster they fall , the broader the pain - for homeowners forced into foreclosures , for their neighbors as their home values drop , for Wall Street investors as billions of dollars in mortgage - backed securities go up in smoke .
For that reason , some experts think the government should take even more steps to soften the fall .
" The simple idea would be to give home buyers a tax credit , " Lonski said .
" Say a home buyer would be allowed to subtract 5 or 10 percent of the purchase price of a home from her tax liability .
That incentive would boost capital spending . "
Meanwhile , the Fed 's interest - rate cuts may help stem the foreclosure tide - which in turn could slow home price devaluation .
That 's because many homeowners get into trouble when their adjustable - rate mortgages reset to unaffordable levels .
ARMs are linked to the federal funds rate , so lower rates there translate into more - manageable monthly mortgage payments and potentially fewer foreclosures .
Pop goes the bubble
Not everyone thinks the government should try to cushion the blow .
" To my mind , the best thing that could happen would be for the ( housing ) bubble to deflate more quickly , " said Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington .
" Instead they 're coming up with crazy schemes to get more money to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to expand lending .
That will keep ( home ) prices inflated . "
Baker said he felt the Fed overstepped its bounds by opening its discount lending window to securities traders .
If ( Fed chief Ben ) Bernanke can do that , " Can he just lend me money ? "
Baker joked .
" If he can , maybe I 'll call him up and get a low - interest loan . "
Another naysayer on government intervention is Peter Schiff , president of Euro Pacific Capital , a Darien , Conn. , retail brokerage , and author of " Crash Proof : How to Profit From the Coming Economic Collapse , " a 2007 book that predicted economic carnage .
" We would not have this mess if the Fed had not brought interest rates down ( in the early 2000s ) to postpone the pain from the dot - com collapse , " Schiff said .
" That created a bigger bubble in housing .
Now it 's trying to find ways to postpone the pain again . "
Schiff 's view is that the Fed is debasing the dollar 's value - and that that will lead directly to rampant inflation .
" We did n't have a severe recession in 2001 - 2002 , " he said .
" Now we 're paying the price in spades . "
But other experts say being too laissez - faire carries its own set of harsh consequences .
Christopher Thornberg , founding partner of Beacon Economics , said a mind - set that preceded the Great Depression was : " ' Let 's allow a little Darwinian action to cure the industry of its ills . '
In the process of that purge , you basically destroyed the U.S. economy . "
Help the rich , not the poor ?
This week 's actions stirred controversy among those who feel the government will do whatever it takes to prop up rich folks on Wall Street , while exerting less effort for poor folks on Main Street - the people losing their homes to foreclosures .
" We 've already seen the Nader - ists call this a bailout of the rich , " Thornberg said .
" We 're going to continue to hear that , but I would make the fundamental argument here , bailout or no bailout , you just can't allow a wholesale panic to cripple the banking industry . "
Peter Morici , a business professor at the University of Maryland and former chief economist of the U.S. Trade Commission , begged to disagree .
Treasury Secretary " Henry Paulson is running around the country telling people that if they 're upside down in their mortgage but can still afford to pay it , then they have an obligation to pay , " he said .
" But on the other hand , we let these guys in New York walk away with gigantic severance packages while Bernanke lends them money to stay afloat .
That 's not fair .
" The policies place a heavy burden on those least able to bear it and let the rich bankers off scot - free , " Morici continued .
" This kind of stuff caused the French Revolution .
They should be thankful people do n't work on farms anymore because then they would all have access to a pitchfork . "
Morici thinks the Fed should have extracted some concessions from Wall Street in exchange for its assistance , such as agreeing to issue simple , easy - to - analyze mortgage - backed bonds rather than the complex instruments whose failures triggered the current crisis .
Bernanke should " take bankers to the woodshed , go up there with a hickory stick and straighten them out , " Morici said .
Even Lonski from Moody's , who was bullish on the Fed 's actions , cautioned that its results were fragile .
" Whatever we gained in confidence this past week can be lost in a hurry if we have new evidence of a worsening of home sales and home price deflation , and signs of even bigger job losses and further cutbacks in business and consumer spending , " he said .

I just went through Bush 's NIE presser and it was pretty disturbing all around .
The war drumbeat against Iran has been going on for sooo long now .
You can understand why this report shatters the Bush / Cheney doctrine of immorally - -- attacking -- a-- country - -- that has n't attacked us .
It 's a virtual replay of their Iraq intelligence scam .
NBC's David Gregory , called Bush on his " hyping " this scam just like he did with Iraq .
Bush ineffectually told David Gregory that he just got the results of the NIE report last week .

Q Mr. President , thank you .
I 'd like to follow on that .
When you talked about Iraq , you and others in the administration talked about a mushroom cloud ; then there were no WMD in Iraq .
When it came to Iran , you said in October , on October 17th , you warned about the prospect of World War III , when months before you made that statement , this intelligence about them suspending their weapons program back in '03 had already come to light to this administration .
So ca n't you be accused of hyping this threat ?
And do n't you worry that that undermines U.S. credibility ?
THE PRESIDENT : David , I do n't want to contradict an August reporter such as yourself , but I was made aware of the NIE last week .
In August , I think it was Mike McConnell came in and said , we have some new information .
He did n't tell me what the information was ; he did tell me it was going to take a while to analyze .
Why would you take time to analyze new information ?
One , you want to make sure it 's not disinformation .
You want to make sure the piece of intelligence you have is real .
And secondly , they want to make sure they understand the intelligence they gathered :
If they think it 's real , then what does it mean ?
And it was n't until last week that I was briefed on the NIE that is now public .
Not that it mattered to him , but Bush and Cheney and any number of warmongers go around spewing venom and trying to get the public behind another military strike while he 's waiting for the new intelligence to be verified ?
OK , I know there 's a neocon always needing a war fix --- and probably has dark suspicions about the NIE report , but this
And here 's what Stephen Hadley said yesterday .
Q Steve , when was the first time the President was given the inkling of something ?
I 'm not clear on this .
Was this months ago , when the first information started to become available to intelligence agencies ?
MR .
HADLEY : You ought to go back to the intelligence community .
We will get you an answer on that .
There 's two questions : one , when did they first get the information ? -- you ought to ask that to them -- two , when was the President notified that there was new information available ?
We 'll try and get you a precise answer .
As I say , it was , in my recollection , is in the last few months .
Whether that is October -- August , September , we 'll try and get you an answer to that .
I 'm a big " Texas Hold em " fan and Josh Marshall caught a " tell " that indicates he knew before a week ago .
If you go back to his October 17th press conference , the one where he spoke of ' World War III ' he changes his wording .
It 's no longer the need to prevent the Iranians from getting the bomb .
Now it 's the necessity of " preventing them from hav[ing ] the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon . "
That 's the tell .
That change is no accident .
He wants claims that will survive the eventual revelation of this new intelligence -- while also continuing to hype the imminence of the Iranian nuclear threat that his spy chiefs are telling him likely does not exist .
They 've shifted their rules of engagement again to attacking a country for knowledge alone .

April 15 , 2003 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CEA Opposes Detroit Waste Incinerator Renewable Operating Permit
Windsor , Ontario - The Citizens Environment Alliance has filed a letter of opposition with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regarding the renewal of the operating permit of the Greater Detroit Resource Recovery Facility ( Detroit Municipal Waste Incinerator ) .
The CEA urged the EPA to reject the renewable operating permit of the incinerator and requested that the EPA require the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to :
Study the cumulative environmental and health impacts ( cancer , asthma , etc. ) that may be caused by the many pollution sources in the area
Evaluate the Environmental Injustice caused by the Incinerator 's operations and emissions to the surrounding minority and low - income communities that are already exposed to many pollution sources and suffer high rates of environmentally related health problems .
Hold a public hearing in the impacted community , which was earlier denied by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality .
" The Detroit incinerator has been a significant local source of smog causing emissions , greenhouse gas emissions and toxic contaminants like mercury for a decade and a half , " said Derek Coronado , Research and Policy Coordinator of the Citizens Environment Alliance .
" We have been living with this legal source of toxic air pollution for far too long .
We need to ban the burn , " said Coronado .
The Detroit Municipal Waste Incinerator is the largest incinerator of its type in the United States .
It currently burns approximately 2,000 tons of city residential and commercial garbage everyday and generates approximately 3,600,000 pounds per year ( 1.63 million kg ) of toxic metals , acid gasses and other hazardous emissions , including dioxin and mercury .

Detroit's Waste Incinerator
The Detroit Municipal Waste Incinerator ( Greater Detroit Resource Recovery Facility ) can burn up to 3,600 tons ( 3,273 tonnes ) of garbage per day - the largest in the United States .
Currently two furnaces burn approximately 2,000 tons of residential and commercial garbage every day - approximately 730,000 tons ( 663,636 tonnes ) each year .
Pollution
The incinerator emits 3,600,000 lbs. or 1,636,364 kg per year ( 4.5 tonnes per day ) of toxic metals , including mercury , acid gasses and persistent pollutants such as dioxin under a State of Michigan permit .
The facility is located approximately 6 km. from downtown Windsor .
Health Impacts
Persistent Pollutants : Dioxins , furans , and mercury , are examples of pollutants that can persist in the environment increasing the risk of harmful environmental impacts .
Incinerators contribute a substantial amount of the total U.S. emission of these pollutants .
Dioxin : persists in the environment and bioaccumulates in the food chain .
Dioxin is the most toxic substance known and may cause cancer in humans , damage to the hormone and immune systems .
Dioxin has been found in several fish species in the Great Lakes .
Municipal Solid Waste ( MSW ) incinerators are the most significant source of dioxin emissions in the United States .
Emissions of dioxin from MSWs are dropping due to better emission controls and , primarily due to the closure of several dozen facilities across the United States .
Mercury :
When released into the environment mercury persists in groundwater and surfacewater and accumulates to dangerous levels in the fish that Americans and Canadians eat .
The Detroit River is contaminated by mercury .
Mercury can cause significant neurological damage and birth defects , developmental and cognitive impairment .
Lead , cadmium : other toxic metals are emitted from the incineration process .
These toxins can attack human organs such as the liver , lungs and kidneys .
Lead also damages children 's cognitive abilities .
Children living near the Detroit waste incinerator have the highest lead blood levels in the state and 40 % of children under 6 living near the incinerator have elevated lead blood levels .
Acid gasses ( sulfur dioxide , hydrochloric acid and nitrogen oxides ) : these substances contribute to the formation of acid rain and smog .
These substances can increase the rate and severity of respiratory problems , e.g. asthma attacks .
In addition to harming lungs and the cardiovascular system these substances contribute to crop losses and damage to buildings and structures .
Particulate matter : another incinerator emission that contributes to the formation of smog .
Particulate matter can contribute to lung and cardiovascular disease and trigger asthma attacks .
Children living near the incinerator are hospitalized for asthma at 3 times the average rate in Michigan .
Other Impacts
Toxic Fly Ash : because incineration creates ash and the compounds in the ash are toxic , the ash must be landfilled in a specialized landfill .
Ironically , the more efficient the pollution control equipment the more toxic the fly ash becomes .
While emission controls have been able to reduce overall dioxin emissions to the air , there is no evidence that overall dioxin releases ( fly ash , bottom ash , and other residues ) have decreased .
The Detroit incinerator creates over 200,000 tons ( 181,818 tonnes ) of toxic ash per year .
Financial Cost : by substituting incineration with a comprehensive recycling and composting program and limited reliance on landfilling for disposal Detroit could save $ 25 million per year .
Recycling could improve the separation of hazardous materials from the waste stream to ensure a more environmentally sound disposal option .

Obviously the FDA is n’t paying attention to the abuses by the pharmaceutical industry .
They run tests to solve one problem and then out of the blue , they start selling it for yet another problem .
Maybe it works out OK but maybe it does n’t .
Keep in mind that the US spends more per person on pharmaceuticals than any other country on the planet .
This move is all about keeping the money train moving and has very little to do about saving lives .
A 2006 study estimated that more than 20 percent of all prescriptions written by doctors were for unapproved uses .
But drug makers have in the past abused doctors ’ discretion by telling them that some medicines were appropriate for patients in whom the drugs may have caused more harm than good .
In 2004 , Pfizer paid a $ 430 million fine to resolve criminal and civil charges that it marketed its epilepsy drug Neurontin for conditions in which the company ’s own studies suggested that the drug was ineffective .
news Ceci N’est Pas Une Bombe
Thorarinn Ingi Jonsson has , as he put it to Torontoist in a phone interview earlier today , “ seen better days . ”
The Integrated Media OCAD student and his final project for his advanced video class are the direct cause––intended or not––for yesterday ’s bomb scare at the Royal Ontario Museum , and , a day later , Jonsson is now suspended from OCAD and is wanted for questioning by police .
Inspired by Marcel Duchamp ’s readymades pieces ( the most famous of which is the urinal - cum - art - piece Fountain ) , Jonsson wanted to make a piece for his final project about recontextualization : the idea that the context changes the meaning of a piece of art .
In this case , something that is “ quite clearly not dangerous , but when you put it in a different context the viewer recontextualizes it ” : a fake pipe bomb , and fake YouTube videos showing its fake explosion .
Yesterday at about 4 p.m. , Jonsson walked into the ROM with the fake bomb inside a bag .
Attached to the bomb was a note that read “ This is not a bomb . ”
Jonsson thought that the note meant he was n’t breaking the law : he had been advised by an OCAD Student Union lawyer before installing the piece , he says , against spreading false news , and told that he should not attempt to deceive people about the bomb ’s legitimacy .
( That ’s why , for instance , one of the descriptions for the videos he later uploaded read : “ Fake footage of the fake bombing at the Royal Ontario Museum capturing the fake moment of impact . ” )
Though Jonsson intended to leave the pipe bomb outside of the bag out in the open in a “ noticeable spot , ” “ almost like a presentation , ” he says there were “ too many people around , ” and he decided to keep the sculpture inside the bag , placing it on the right - hand side of the ROM ’s Bloor Street entrance with the declarative note visible on top .
“ I went a bit down the street , as soon as I came out of the gathering , ” he told us , “ and I dialed up the ROM and they asked for an extension and I had n’t really thought that far , so I typed in some random last name and I ended up reaching some girl at some office at the ROM and I simply told her : ‘ Listen there ’s no bomb by the entrance to the museum , ’ and then I hung up . ”
Jonsson went straight from the ROM back to school for 5 p.m. to give his presentation of his final piece , where he “ revealed the extent of the project . ”
People in his class , he says “ were really impressed with the extent I went to . ”
Worried that there was a possibility of legal action , he had n’t told his professors about the piece until the night it was installed .
When Jonsson got back home , he uploaded the videos he ’d recorded earlier that day to YouTube ( to an account that featured other videos––like the one of Osama Bin Laden on the roof of the World Trace Center watching as hearts pour out of the building and Bob Dylan ’s “ The Man In Me ” plays– –that Jonsson says are “ completely unrelated ” ) .
Then , he e-mailed the addresses of them to several news organizations .
“ I did n’t really expect it go so crazy . ”
Nothing happened until about ten that night , when Jonsson starting hearing about the “ crazy circus ” that the ROM and its surrounding area had been turned into : streets shut down , bomb squad on hand , and an AIDS gala cancelled ( which Jonsson says he had no idea about and that he does “ feel bad about ” ) .
A day later , “ the police are looking for me , ” he admits ( he intends to approach them , and he fears a mischief charge ) ; while OCAD has taken disciplinary action against him as well , suspending him from the school today for non-academic misconduct .

Justice Department says legal opinion on Executive orders is classified John Byrne
Published : Wednesday March 12 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Refuses to provide legal opinions on executive power The Bush Administration 's Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel is refusing to turn over a document providing its analysis of Bush 's justification for executive orders .
Responding to a Freedom of Information
Act request from the Federation of American Scientists , the office said the document was " classified . "
Steven Aftergood , who writes the Secrecy News blog for the Federation , requested the legal opinion after a Democratic senator referenced it on the Senate floor .
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) , the freshman senator who ousted Sen. Lincoln Chafee ( R - RI ) in 2006 , said he 'd reviewed three documents that outlined Justice Department opinions .
" For years , under the Bush administration , the Office of Legal Counsel within the Department of Justice has issued highly classified , secret legal opinions related to surveillance , " Whitehouse said in a Dec. 7 , 2007 floor statement .
" This is an administration that hates answering to an American court , that wants to grade its own exams , and OLC is the inside place the administration goes to get legal support for its spying program . "
" As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee , I was given access to those secret opinions and spent hours poring over them .
Sitting in that secure room , as a lawyer , as a former U.S. attorney , legal counsel to Rhode Island 's Governor , and State attorney general , I was increasingly dismayed and amazed as I read on , " he continued .
Whitehouse gave two examples from the documents he read :
An Executive order cannot limit a President .
There is no constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new Executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms of a previous Executive order .
Rather than violate an Executive order , the President has instead modified or waived it .
The President , exercising his constitutional authority under article II , can determine whether an action is a lawful exercise of the President 's authority under article II .
In other words , the president can decide whether his own interpretation of the law is lawful .
" We requested a copy of that seemingly innocuous , if questionable , opinion under the Freedom of Information Act , " Aftergood wrote at Secrecy News .
" But the request was denied . "
Aftergood only requested the documents relating to executive orders , not those directly related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
Aftergood 's request , along with the Office of Legal Counsel 's response , can be read in PDF format here .
GP Sippy is no more .
He passed away at his home peacefully recently at the advanced age of 93 .
I fondly recall my childhood days when Sholay was creating waves and rewriting the very basic way of how Hindi Cinema should be produced .
Shekhar Gupta once rightly said while carrying out an interview for the Indian Express , how Sholay had vertically divided the Indian Cinema into two distinct categories : the first one the pre-Sholay era , and the second one the post - Sholay phase !
And I still remember how each of those flaming posters of Jay , Viru , Thakur , Basanti and Gabbar Singh used to distinctly read on GP Sippy ’s signature everywhere .
I ’ll have plenty of stuff to speak on regarding Sholay in the coming weeks and months , as I ’ll try to write more about Hindi Films and its Music .
But for now , let me share the following story from The New York Times , which carried a good brief on Sippy ’s life and works .
Btw , he was Gopaldas Parmanand Sippy , a born Sindhi and Karachiite before moving on to the dream city of Mumbai after India ’s partition .
And he had to do plenty of many other jobs before producing Sholay .
Unfortunately , there are no decent photographs of him available right now , and I just missed downloading it from one of those epapers the other day .
To sum up , let me say , I salute the man who made Sholay and gifted the Hindi Cinema Lovers with an exceptional movie .
It will continue to enthrall many more generations after you and myself had given up watching movies .
May god bless him with eternal peace !

In modern China with its brutal pace of development , it was an unremarkable death .
Racked with disease and with no money to pay for medicine , peasant farmer Wang Puzhi waited until his family were out , slipped a rope around his neck and ended his suffering .
Before his suicide , however , Wang 's life was far from unremarkable .
He was one of a seven - strong team of workers who , while digging a well on their communal farm in Yang village in 1974 , stumbled across the most priceless archaeological discovery of modern times : the 2,200 - year - old Terracotta Army .
Scroll down for more ....
Their discovery has brought millions of tourists to Xi'an in north - western China and made many businessmen and , it is claimed , officials rich .
But for the farmers who found the buried army , the warriors have proved more a curse than a blessing .
On the eve of a sensational exhibition at the British Museum - the largest ever display of the soldiers outside China - The Mail on Sunday tracked down the survivors from the group who discovered the figures .
But instead of reaping the rewards of finding the treasures , they are bewildered at the greed and destruction the warriors brought to the surface with them .
Their farmland was claimed by the government .
Their homes were demolished to make way for exhibition halls and gift shops .
Their 2,000 - year - old village has all but disappeared .
Within three years of 60 - year - old Puzhi 's suicide in 1997 , the two youngest members of the team who found the warriors - Yang Wenhai and Yang Yanxin - died in their 50s , jobless and penniless .
Today , the four remaining men 79 - year - old Yang Quanyi , 78 - year - old Yang Peiyan and 69 - year - olds Yang Zhifa and Yang Xinman - earn £ 2 a day to sit in official souvenir shops at the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor and sign books for tourists .
" Officials and businessmen have made a lot of money from the Terracotta Army , but not us , " said Quanyi , who has been signing the books for nine years , having spent three months learning how to write his own name .
" We got nothing for the discovery .
" It was the days of collective farms and we were given ten credit points by our brigade leader for finding the warriors .
That was the equivalent of about one yuan [ 5 p ] . "
There had always been rumours of buried treasure in the farmers ' village .
Then , in March 1974 , while digging a well , one of the farmers , Zhifa , struck something about 15 m down .
" At first all we saw was the top of a head , " said Quanyi .
" Then as we dug further we saw the whole head . "
Thinking he had found a bronze relic that the villagers could sell for the price of a few packets of cigarettes , Zhifa used a hammer to break it off and brought it back to the village .
" Everyone was afraid to touch it , " said Quanyi .
" We thought it was a temple statue - a buddha perhaps .
" We were frightened that the buddha would punish us . "
In fact the farmers had found one of more than 8,000 terracotta foot soldiers , archers and charioteers that had been buried with Qin , the First Emperor of China , in 221 BC in a mausoleum covering several square miles .
Officials and archaeologists poured into the village and began to excavate the tomb .
Over the next few years , land that for centuries had provided the village with its livelihood was claimed by the state .
Villagers say almost all the compensation paid by the government was siphoned off by officials .
With China still a relatively closed country and the tourism boom still years off , they sank deeper into what was to prove fatal poverty for three of the seven .
" Families here are too poor to afford medicine , " said Quanyi .
" Yang Yanxin died of a skin disease that caused his body to rot away .
Yang Wenhai died in great pain at home . "
The family of Wang Puzhi , who hanged himself in 1997 , are still upset at his death .
" He had acute heart disease , ' said Yang Lou Cheng , his stepson .
" He could n't bear the suffering and he did n't want to be a burden to my mother and me .
So one day when he was alone in the house he hanged himself .
My mother died a short while later . "
In recent years , as China has opened its doors to tourists , the site at Xi'an has been expanded .
Families were forced to move to new homes a mile away and had to pay £ 525 per person for the construction .
" The government has taken away our land and our livelihoods , " said one villager who did n't want to be named .
" People in Yang village are simple farm-ers .
Scroll down for more .....
" Only a handful of them have been able to make any money by selling food or souvenirs to tourists .
But 100 per cent of the local officials here have become rich . "
Already there are plans to expand the exhibition space and bulldoze what remains of Yang village .
When a group of villagers travelled by bus and train to Beijing , 1,000 miles away , to petition the government for compensation , they were sent away with nothing .
But what the villagers want most is for the farmers who found the Terracotta Army to receive the recognition they deserve .
Not one of the group of seven is named or photographed anywhere - within the complex in Xi'an .
Other men who had nothing to do with the discovery pose as the original farmers , signing books for tourists .
One such man is 60 - year - old Yang Xi An , who sits underneath a banner describing himself as the man who made the discovery in 1974 , alongside a blownup photograph of him shaking hands with former American President Bill Clinton during his visit in 1998 .
But , according to more than a dozen people interviewed in Yang village , the man is an impostor .
He was manager of a factory making replicas of the Terracotta Army visited by Clinton and used the image of his handshake to make money from tourists ever since .
" If the government gave us certificates to prove we are the real finders of the warriors , it would be different , " said Zhifa .
He and the other members of the original team also sign books , but with a monthly income of around £ 65 , they earn less than the girls who work on the cash tills .
A manager of one of the gift shops admitted the complex was full of bogus discoverers conning tourists .
" The shops here sell thousands of books every day and everyone wants them signed by one of the men who first found the warriors , " he said .
" How can shops sell enough signed books to pay the rent unless they employ impostors ? "
When asked why the farmers have been denied recognition , a spokesman for the Shaanxi provincial relic and cultural bureau said : " It is not important who discovered these relics . "
Despite the apparent injustice of the situation , Quanyi insisted he was n't angry .
" These relics have brought many people to the country .
" We only discovered them .
They belong to our country . "
But his wife , Liu Xi Qin , 70 , said her husband still pondered over the superstitions that surrounded their discovery and has vowed never to set eyes on the Terracotta Army again .
" My husband always worries if they did something wrong by discovering the warriors , " she said .
" He is afraid they might have brought misfortune in some way -- and does still wonder if maybe the soldiers should have been left beneath the ground . "
The Korean War lasted from June 1950 to July 1953 .
It served as the basis of the 1968 book MASH : A Novel About Three Army Doctors by Richard Hooker ( pen name of former army surgeon H. Richard Hornberger ) , describing the experiences of surgeons at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the war .
This was adapted into a film ( MASH ) starring Donald Sutherland in 1970 , which in turn inspired the TV series M* A * S* H starring Alan Alda .
The finale of the television series M* A* S * H remains one of the most - watched episodes in the history of the medium , with more than 100 million viewers .
By that time , the series had spanned 251 episodes over 11 seasons from 1972 to 1983 .
The Korean War , by contrast , lasted three years .
What does this have to do with junk DNA ?
As I have been attempting to show by referencing the scientific literature in a series of Quotes of interest , there was a diversity of views on the functional significance of noncoding sequences of all sorts before and after the terms " junk DNA " and " selfish DNA " were introduced .
In fact , it is clear that the default view for many authors was adaptationist and therefore that noncoding elements must have a function by virtue of their very existence .
Not knowing the function of noncoding DNA stimulated , rather than stifled , research in this area .
Also , it is clear that Ohno ( 1972 ) had minimal impact at least up to the time when the selfish DNA hypothesis was proposed ( 1980 ) , because at that time the assumption of function was still pervasive -- that 's why selfish DNA was presented in the first place , as an alternative to strict adaptationism .
Moreover , two other points must be borne in mind : 1 ) introns , pseudogenes , satellite DNA , and various kinds of transposable elements were not characterized , or indeed in some cases not even discovered , until at least the late 1970s , and 2 ) the tools necessary to study noncoding elements , most notably DNA sequencing , did not arise until the late 1970s and early 1980s .
In other words , the most common assumption at least up to 1980 , made on the basis of Darwinian adaptationist logic , was that most or all noncoding DNA was functional , and the tools for testing functional ( or non-functional ) hypotheses about noncoding DNA were not available until the 1980s .
What this indicates is that the only period during which one could possibly argue that noncoding DNA was dismissed when it should have been studied begins around 1980 .
As I have tried to demonstrate , there was intense interest in noncoding DNA , much of it related to searches for function , during the 1980s .
( Note : I have not even begun to discuss the history of thoughts about possible functions , or at least effects , of total DNA content on the cell , which traces to the 1870s . )
Nevertheless , in 1989 or 1990 there is a switch in the discussion to claiming that noncoding DNA had long been dismissed as inconsequential junk , first in scientific review papers , and then in science news stories beginning by 1994 .
We have been told ever since that scientists long neglected noncoding DNA .
Creationists have expanded this to include the absurd and supremely illogical argument that " Darwinism " is at fault in this , even though Darwinian adaptationism was the basis for assuming that noncoding DNA must be functional from the time noncoding sequences were first identified .
To summarize , then , there was a period of about 9 - 10 years during which it is conceivable that noncoding DNA could have been ignored when it should have been studied as biologically relevant .
The period of telling us that it was ignored but is now thought to be important , by contrast , has been going on for about 18 years and shows no signs of abating .
Nevermind the fact that there was no such period during which functions were not postulated and tested , or the fact that the originators of the ideas of junk DNA and selfish DNA unambiguously noted that a non-trivial portion of noncoding sequences would be functional for the organisms carrying them .
M*A*S*H was entertaining , thought - provoking , and served as a statement about the horrors of war in general .
It is really just an interesting afterthought that it lasted nearly four times longer than the war on which it was based .
The repetitive claim that scientists have long ignored noncoding DNA , on the other hand , serves no function and refers to a period of history that never actually happened .
Is the hype worth ?
Even before the release , iPhone is challenged by Ocean from Helio .
Ocean is a fantastic smart device that innovated the world 's first dual slide model .
It is probably underrated and flooded away by Nokia and iPhone strom .
This is slider one :
This is slider two : Note that it is a QWERTY keyboard .
Ocean is a mobile machine as they claim .
It is true .
Ocean has almost everything you would imagine .
It is a rocking phone , I would say .
On the eve of of the iPhone release , Helio has released a comparison chart of iPhone and Ocean .
And the chart is a big speed breaker for my friends in US from buying iPhone .
The biggest difference is the price .
i Phone comes at $ 499 ( for 4 GB memory ) and Ocean could be yours for $ 295 .
And on the positive side for iPhone , the unbeatable touch screen system .
Ok , here is the chart for you .
This is the right time to think before we spend huge bucks on iPhone .
There is a lot missing in iPhone .

Jennifer Aniston's Los Cabos Man is Jason Lewis
We 've been hearing about 's Los Cabos mystery man .
Nowis saying the man wearing the fedora and sporting a goatee is likely model turned actor
The rumors have been flying for weeks that the Sex in the City friend of Courteney Cox and David Arquette , 36 year old Lewis , is dating Aniston , He likely spent holiday time between Christmas and New Year 's with the Arquette 's and Aniston in Mexico .
Bitten and Bound reported previously that the National Inquirer believes Aniston is living with and pregnant by the actor .
These latest reports have us hungering for some sightings of the couple .
In the meantime we 'll have to be satisfied with gazing at photos of these extremely attractive celebrities .
Republicans like Sen. Barack Obama nearly as much as they like their own likely presidential nominee , Sen. John McCain , according to a new Fox 5 / The Washington Times / Rasmussen Reports poll .
Photos : Clinton , Obama , McCain campaign
The survey determined that a quarter of self - identified Republicans rated Mr. McCain most likable , but nearly as many — 23 percent — chose Mr. Obama as most likable .
And among all adults surveyed , Mr. Obama was rated likable by more people than Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr. McCain combined , underscoring the Illinois senator ’s appeal to voters across the political spectrum .
“ There is something about Barack Obama that is hard to capture in polling and it ’s an enthusiasm , it ’s a freshness , it ’s an excitement he can generate that will certainly be a factor in the campaign , ” said pollster Scott Rasmussen .
Mr. Obama said his message and his brand of campaigning will help him compete in states traditionally hostile to Democrats , and the poll numbers suggest an opening for that approach .
By contrast , likability has never been Mr. McCain ’s strong suit — even long - shot Republican candidate Mike Huckabee was rated more likable in the poll , both among all adults and Republicans specifically .
Mr. McCain instead is betting on his national - security credentials , and there the survey shows him topping both Democrats combined .
Mr. McCain led with 39 percent to Mr. Obama ’s 17 percent and Mrs. Clinton ’s 19 percent when those surveyed were asked who “ will be the toughest on matters of national security . ”
Even among self - identified Democrats , Mr. McCain fared decently with one in five rating him toughest .
Mr. McCain is well - aware of his advantage on that score , accusing Mr. Obama last week of misreading the terrorist threat in Iraq .
“ I ’ve been involved in every major national security challenge for the last 20 years , ” the Arizona senator said .
Mr. Obama responded last week that Mr. McCain ’s experience did n’t help him make the right judgment on the war by supporting the invasion in the first place .
Mr. McCain will wrap up the Republican nomination if he sweeps primaries in Vermont , Rhode Island , Texas and Ohio today .
Mrs. Clinton , meanwhile , trails Mr. Obama in delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination , and is looking for wins today to help her regain momentum .
Mr. Rasmussen said part of the New York senator ’s strategy has been to try to poke holes in Mr. Obama ’s veneer , and that has paid off in the past few days by removing some of the shine .
“ That ’s the sort of challenge that Barack Obama is going to face — he ’s got to convert that intangible into something when the questions come , ” Mr. Rasmussen said .
But Mr. Obama brings more than just likability .
Despite facing candidates with far more experience in government , he was rated smartest by 26 percent of those polled , more so than Mrs. Clinton , who won 22 percent , and Mr. McCain , who garnered 17 percent .
Mr. Huckabee , a former Arkansas governor , was fourth with 10 percent .
Even among Democrats , Mr. Obama was rated smartest by nearly half — a full 10 percentage points more than Mrs. Clinton .
Mr. Obama also was wildly popular among independents and third - party members , 41 percent of whom rated him most likable .
The poll of 1,000 adults was taken Feb. 26 and 27 , and found independent candidate Ralph Nader trailed on every measure , coming in below Rep. Ron Paul , Texas Republican , on likability , toughness on national security and on smarts .
A plurality of those polled said they thought Mr. Nader ’s new presidential bid will hurt Democrats most , with more than half of self - identified Democrats thinking he will hurt their chances this year .
In 2000 , many Democrats blamed Mr. Nader ’s independent bid for siphoning off votes from their candidate , Al Gore , helping then - Gov. George W. Bush win the White House .

KANAB , Utah ( CNN ) --
Ellen does n't look like a top - fighting dog .
Michael Vick agreed to pay nearly $ 1 million to subsidize the various facilities caring for his 47 pit bulls .
She wags her tail and gives kisses to anyone who greets her .
But the deep scars on her face are permanent reminders of her difficult and violent past .
Ellen is one of the 47 pit bulls seized from an illegal dog fighting ring on property owned by disgraced NFL quarterback Michael Vick .
The dogs were bred to fight to the death .
Of course , if trained properly they can be gentle loyal pets .
Twenty - two of the pit bulls now reside at sanctuary at the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in the mountain town of Kanab , Utah .
The 25 other dogs have been placed at rehabilitation shelters across the country .
All of them are lucky to be alive .
The Humane Society of the United States and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals wanted the dogs euthanized .
But rescue operations won their fight to give these animals a second chance at life .
" There 's a belief by a lot of people that these dogs cannot be rehabilitated , " said the facility 's veterinarian , Dr. Frank McMillan .
" It 's true that they can't all be [ rehabilitated ] , but we 're finding out here and elsewhere , that they can and they become very nice pets . "
Watch how the dogs are learning to interact with people »
The dogs have only been at the shelter about a month and their caregivers have already seen signs of progress .
" I was surprised at how many were shy .
There were quite a few that were under socialized and pretty shut down , " said Michelle Besmehn , who oversees the dogs at the sanctuary .
" I 've been really pleased at how quickly they 're coming around .
It 's actually been fun to see personalities are starting to show . "
One of the most affectionate and lovable dogs at the shelter is Lucas -- Vick 's champion fighter .
Shelter staff believes the scarred , brown 65 - pound pit bull won praise and special treatment for winning fights and money , perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars for Vick and his associates .
Despite his good nature , a court ruled that Lucas can never leave the sanctuary because of his violent past .
Dogs that did n't fight well were beaten , drowned , shot and even electrocuted by Vick and his associates , according to court records .
Thought it 's nearly impossible to know the extent of the emotional and physical abuse these dogs endured , in some cases it 's apparent .
One dog , Georgia , had all 42 of her teeth pulled .
Caregivers believe it was to prevent her from attacking male dogs during forced breeding .
" We do n't know who did it .
We assume it 's because she was such a valuable breeding dog , " McMillian said .
" Very often females will not accept males in breeding and will attack . "
The National Geographic Channel will profile Georgia and three of the other pit bulls as part of an ongoing television series , " Dogtown , " which follows the rehabilitation and resocialization of the worst cases .
The hope is that six months from now , some of the dogs will become normal , lovable pets that are safe enough to adopt .
Even if they never get adopted , the dogs will always have a home at Best Friends , which does n't euthanize for behavioral reasons .
The former Atlanta Falcons quarterback is serving a 23 - month sentence at maximum - security prison in Leavenworth , Kansas .
The NFL suspended Vick indefinitely without pay .
He agreed to pay nearly $ 1 million to subsidize the various facilities that are caring for his former pit bulls .
" To me , and to those of us that care about animals , it 's more than fair and maybe not enough , " said McMillan .
" If he wants to play football , none of us here care about that .
But we do n't want him ever owning a dog again . "

Stockhausen was a member of the avant - garde movement
Born in Modrath , near Cologne , the prolific musician wrote more than 300 works from orchestral pieces to pure electronic music during his career .
He also appeared on the cover of The Beatles ' Sergeant Pepper album - with Paul McCartney one of his numerous fans in the world of rock and pop .
The composer died in Kuerten , western Germany , on Wednesday , the Stockhausen Foundation announced in a statement .
Ambitious opera
Best known for his avant - garde electronic work , Stockhausen was an experimental musician who utilised tape recorders and mathematics to create innovative , ground - breaking pieces .
His Electronic Study , 1953 , was the first musical piece composed from pure sine wave sounds .
Electronic Study II , produced a year later , was the first work of electronic music to be notated and published .
But the composer rejected the idea that he was making the music of the future , writing in 1966 : " What is modern today will be tradition tomorrow . "
Stockhausen 's most ambitious work was the seven - part operatic cycle Licht , each part of which is named after a day of the week .
Stockhausen , pictured in 1974 , was at times controversial
It took Stockhausen 25 years to compose , beginning in 1977 , and is due to be performed in full for the first time next year at The European Centre for the Arts Hellerau in Dresden , Germany .
The composer studied at the State Academy for Music in Cologne and the University of Cologne from 1947 to 1951 .
In 1952 he went to Paris , where he worked under the composers Olivier Messiaen and Darius Milhaud .
Musicians such as Miles Davis , Frank Zappa and Bjork have cited him as an influence .
But he was not universally popular .
The conductor Sir Thomas Beecham was once asked whether he had conducted any Stockhausen .
He replied : " No , but I once trod in some . "
The composer also attracted controversy after the terrorist attacks on New York on 11 September 2001 , which he reportedly described as " the greatest work of art there is in the entire cosmos " .
He apologised for the upset caused by the comments , but denied making the statement , saying he had been misquoted .
Stockhausen , who was married twice and had six children , will be buried in the forest cemetery in Kuerten .
A Manhattan personal assistant has told investigators that she fatally bludgeoned her boss , the well - connected real estate agent Linda Stein , in the woman ’s opulent Fifth Avenue apartment because Ms. Stein swore at her , waved a stick at her and blew marijuana smoke into her face , the police said today .
The assistant , Natavia Lowery , 26 , of Brooklyn , was arrested this morning .
At an afternoon news conference , Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said Ms. Lowery had told the police that she struck Ms. Stein six or seven times on Oct. 30 with a four - pound exercise stick .
Mr. Kelly said that in Ms. Lowery ’s account , Ms. Stein had used “ profanity and derogatory language ” and refused to stop blowing smoke at her even though the smoke was making her sick .
Ms. Lowery had worked for Ms. Stein for about four months , but said Ms. Stein had not verbally abused her until the day of the killing .
Ms. Lowery , who was held at the Seventh Precinct on the Lower East Side , was to be charged by the Manhattan district attorney ’s office this evening .

The US and many EU countries plan to recognise Kosovo 's independence
Vuk Jeremic said Serbia would not use force to stop the secession but warned that allowing it would give a green light to other separatist movements .
The ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo is expected to announce its breakaway from Serbia within days .
Russia has warned that recognition of Kosovo would be illegal and immoral .
[ Independence for Kosovo ] would lead to an uncontrolled cascade of secession
Vuk Jeremic
Putin repeats missile threat
Speaking after the closed session , Serbia 's foreign minister said that is was not too late for diplomats to prevent Kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence .
He called on the Security Council to continue to negotiate , and he claimed that a majority of member states agreed that the search for a compromise should continue .
But Mr Jeremic also warned that independence for Kosovo would set a precedent across the world , leading to " an uncontrolled cascade of secession " .
Earlier on Thursday , at an international news conference , Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed claims that Kosovo was a " special case " .
He said Russia - a permanent member of the UN Security Council and traditional ally of Serbia - has " a ready - made plan and we know what we are going to do " .
The BBC's Matt Wells at the UN headquarters says Security Council members France , Britain and the US are just as firm in their view that Kosovo should make up its own mind , and that individual member states should decide whether or not to support an independent Kosovo .
As far as they are concerned , the UN has no real role left to play , although the UN mission will remain in Kosovo for the foreseeable future , our correspondent says .
EU mission
The United Nations has administered Kosovo since a Nato bombing campaign in 1999 drove out Serb forces accused of persecuting the province 's majority ethnic Albanians .
A civilian police and justice mission for Kosovo is expected to be given the go - ahead by EU member states by the end of the week .
A senior official told the BBC's Oana Lungescu in Brussels that deployment of the 1,800 staff would be staggered over four months .
By early June , 1,500 police officers including special anti-riot units and 250 judges , prosecutors and customs officials would be in place to maintain stability in the self - proclaimed state .
The police and judges are expected to come from Germany and Italy as well as other countries , including the United States , Turkey , Croatia , Norway and Switzerland .
In Iowa , many hundreds of volunteers worked day and night for our campaign .
College kids took their Christmas vacations in the snow for freedom .
Thousands of people donated to make it all possible .
We had many phone calls , brochures , mailings , advertising .
Revolutionaries from all over the country sent handwritten letters to every voter , and despite national media attacks and censorship , we got more than 10 percent of the vote .
We also soundly beat a certain ex-mayor who started off the first debate by attacking a pro-American foreign policy and the explanatory doctrine of " blowback , " the CIA 's term for foreign intervention that causes trouble for us in return .
The Golden Rule applies to nations as well as to individuals .
And speaking of debates , FOX blocked my participation in its last New Hampshire debate , but I think that hurt FOX more than us .
We had a terrifically successful townhall meeting at the same time , and Jay Leno invited me on the Tonight Show again to discuss it .
Many members of our movement were galvanized to overcome the bias , including me !
In our Iowa campaign , since it was a caucus , we were dealing with party activists for the most part , not the people .
And some of the activists were very unhappy to hear our views , trying to scream them down !
Others thought that peace violates Christianity .
But New Hampshire is another story .
There is a state and a people tailor - made for us .
Live Free !
Then there are Michigan , South Carolina , and Super Tuesday and its nearly 20 primaries .
Frankly , we need $ 23 million more to have a chance of beating the establishment candidates .
I am working hard for our ideas , as I know you are .
The attacks and even smears will increase as we do better .
But they will not defeat our ideas .
They can not defeat out ideas .
At this moment of urgency for America , with spending , taxes , spying , inflation , and wars out of control and threatening all we love , let us rededicate ourselves to freedom , prosperity , and peace .
Already , I owe you all my thanks .
Join me in this great endeavor in New Hampshire and beyond .

Spending less than you earn is a core component of good money management , and a vital part of any wealth building strategy .
This guide is intended to provide readers with ideas , how - to ’s , and resources on frugal living and expense reduction .
It will explore aspects of frugality and provides practical ideas on how to save money and reduce your expenses .
What Is Frugal Living ?
Being frugal is not the same as being cheap .
And frugal living does n’t condemn you to a life of deprivation and sacrifice — if it does , then something is wrong .
Frugal living means that you are smart about how you spend your money — i.e. , you know how to get more value for less money .
Frugal Strategies
There are many ways you can approach frugality .
There ’s no right or wrong way , and you can adopt any number of strategies .
Addressing Your Needs Before Wants
I think Maslow ’s Theory of Needs defines wants versus needs perfectly .
Fundamentally , you are putting money toward food ( for sustenance ) , shelter , clothing ( functional not fashion ) , and health before you spend it on other things .
Here are some more articles that talks about wants versus needs :
Smart Money Decisions Based On Value
Being frugal does n’t mean buying the most inexpensive thing you can find .
It ’s about getting the most value for what you buy , and saving money on what you have to spend .
Sometimes this involve sacrificing the bells and whistles , and focusing on buying what you really need .
Here are some examples :
Buying a Timex instead of a Rolex
Using the basic cell phone that comes free with the plan instead of spending money on an iPhone
Buying a used car instead of a new car
Minimize Waste
As a society , we throw out a lot of stuff that could be reused , repaired , or repurposed .
Here are some great articles to help you get started :
Minimizing waste also means not spending money unnecessarily when you have a lower cost alternative — this usually means giving up some of the convenient factors .
For example , walking another block to use in - network ATM machine , finding street parking instead of heading straight for the parking lot , etc .
Expense Reduction
Leading a truly frugal lifestyle is not for everyone ; however , reducing expenses should be within everyone ’s reach ; and cutting costs is a great thing to do during periods of poor economy .
Here are some fun and creative ways to reduce your expenses :
Pareto Principle
You can use the Pareto Principle , or the 80 - 20 rule to work on your biggest financial drains and then work your way down ( read the full article ) .
You can create a graph like the one above easily , by loading your information into free software like Mint.com .
Quick Wins
Instead of going crazy categorizing everything , another easy way to reduce expenses is to just sit down , brainstorm , and figure out the easiest ways to cut costs — this is called Quick Wins .
You can even make this a family game where the winner figures out the most ways to save money , or save most money .
Be sure to turn your ideas into actions !
If you want to be technical , here ’s a chart that rate easy versus outcome .
For example , anything that requires a low effort to implement is a quick win ( read the full article ) .
Scattergram
The third and last geeky way you can cut your expenses is through the use of a Scattergram .
This is a little more complicated , but it does give you more control than the other two methods .
Here ’s what a scattergram looks like ( read the full article ) .
Other Ways To Save Money
Here are some more money saving ideas for you to work with :
A Caution About Frugality
In parting , I ’d like to caution that there ’s only so much you can do to save money .
Frugality has its limitation — it ’s called deprivation .
Therefore , being frugal is a good thing for your financial health , but in the long - term , effort put into developing income streams to earn extra money is what you should be doing .
According to The Earth Policy Institute production of photovoltaics ( PV ) jumped to 3,800 megawatts worldwide in 2007 , up an estimated 50 percent over 2006 .
At the end of the year , according to preliminary data , cumulative global production stood at 12,400 megawatts , enough to power 2.4 million U.S. homes .
Growing by an impressive average of 48 percent each year since 2002 , PV production has been doubling every two years , making it the world ’s fastest - growing energy source .
A key force driving the advancement of thin - film technologies is a polysilicon shortage that began in April 2004 .
In 2006 , for the first time , more than half of polysilicon production went into PVs instead of computer chips .
While thin films are not as efficient at converting sunlight to electricity , they currently cost less and their physical flexibility makes them more versatile than traditional solar cells .
Led by the United States , thin film grew from 4 percent of the market in 2003 to 7 percent in 2006 .
Polysilicon supply is expected to match demand by 2010 , but not before thin film grabs 20 percent of the market .
As he continues his campaign , John McCain is reminded daily that he has a problem with conservatives who have dominated the Republican Party for the past three decades and are a powerful force among the rank - and - file today .
At one level , this is very strange .
Mr. McCain sports a lifetime 83 percent vote rating from the American Conservative Union , and while campaigning in South Carolina he was accompanied by Sen .
Tom Coburn of Oklahoma — a stalwart conservative and tireless fighter against virtually every effort to expand the federal Leviathan .
Moreover , Mr. McCain demonstrated extraordinary political leadership and courage in making the case for the very successful “ surge ” strategy in Iraq when few other Republicans would do so .
But despite all of this and his reputation for “ straight talk , ” Mr. McCain has on numerous occasions spoken out of both sides of his mouth while trying to explain his voting record — particularly on issues that rile conservatives .
McCain vs. McCain :
On illegal immigration , Mr. McCain said that anyone who says he supported amnesty is “ a liar ” and says he has “ never ” supported Social Security benefits for illegals .
However , in 2006 and 2007 , he joined with Ted Kennedy to support Senate bills that would have granted amnesty to millions of illegals .
In 2006 , Mr. McCain denounced in a floor speech and cast the deciding vote against an amendment by Sen. John Ensign , Nevada Republican , that would have denied Social Security benefits to illegals who work under a Social Security number obtained through identity fraud .
He cosponsored the Dream Act providing in - state tuition for illegal - alien college students , but , in the face of intense opposition to the bill from grass - roots conservatives , Mr. McCain announced that he would have voted against the legislation had he been in attendance when it was voted on late last year ( he was absent ) .
Another issue where Mr. McCain has clashed with conservatives was over campaign finance reform , also called the McCain - Feingold bill , which instituted a series of regulations that limit the ability of independent groups not associated with the Democratic or Republican parties to participate in the political process .
These regulations , which violate the First Amendment , bar the use of corporate or union money to pay for broadcast advertising that identifies a federal candidate within 30 days of a primary or nominating convention or within 60 days of a general election .
These days , Mr. McCain is not talking much about the issue on the campaign trail .
But Mr. McCain ’s advocacy of the legislation has created a bitter political divide between the senator and the National Right to Life Committee , which views it as a hindrance to its ability to get its message out .
Last year , the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Wisconsin Right to Life group and overturned the above - mentioned section of McCain - Feingold .
On abortion , Mr. McCain has a generally pro-life voting record ( although he has supported embryo - destroying stem - cell research ) .
In a 1998 letter to Roman Catholic bishops , Mr. McCain declared himself to be a “ lifelong , ardent supporter of unborn children ’s right to life . ”
But in 1999 , he told the San Francisco Chronicle editorial board that “ in the short term , or even the long term , I would not support repeal of Roe vs.
Wade , which would then force X - number of women to undergo illegal and dangerous abortions . ”
Later that year , he sent a letter to the National Right to Life Committee stating his “ unequivocal support for overturning Roe v. Wade . ”
On Jan. 22 of this year , the 35th anniversary of Roe , Mr. McCain sent a letter to pro-life marchers in Washington praising them and criticizing the seven Supreme Court judges who made up the majority in Roe .
On judicial appointments , Mr. McCain promises to nominate strict constructionists to the federal bench .
But two years ago , he was one of the “ Gang of 14 ” — seven Democratic and seven Republican senators who joined forces to block Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist ’s effort to end the objectionable strategy of filibustering judicial nominees that was employed by the Democrats .
On taxes and spending , Mr. McCain has a mixed record .
He supports extending President Bush ’s tax cuts .
He opposed tax increases pushed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990 and President Clinton in 1993 and voted in 1997 to cut capital - gains taxes .
The senator also broke with the White House and Senate Republican leadership by voting against the Medicare prescription - drug entitlement and he supports permitting workers to invest part of their Social Security savings in higher - yielding private accounts .
But according to the Club for Growth , “ his overall record is tainted by a marked antipathy towards free markets and individual freedom , ” which includes support for raising Social Security taxes and a 282 percent tax increase on cigarettes .
Mr. McCain has been disingenuous in explaining his opposition to Mr. Bush ’s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts .
He claims to have cast these votes to protest the fact that the tax cuts were not accompanied by spending cuts .
But the fact is that in opposing these measures , Mr. McCain joined liberal Democrats like Sens.
Jay Rockefeller and Tom Daschle in employing class - warfare rhetoric and pushing in favor of higher taxes — voting on the pro-tax side on 14 different occasions .
Mr. McCain also differs with free - market conservatives on numerous environmental issues .
He opposes oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) in Alaska and has joined with Sen .
Joe Lieberman to cosponsor legislation that would require that greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to 2000 levels by 2010 — a measure sure to result in substantial increases in electricity and gasoline costs .
McCain vs. Mitt Romney : Mr. Romney has been sharply critical of the 2006 and 2007 amnesty bills supported by Mr. McCain , and opposes the Dream Act and Social Security for illegals .
Mr. Romney opposes McCain - Feingold , calling it a violation of the First Amendment .
Unlike Mr. McCain , Mr. Romney was pro-choice until several years ago , when he became pro-life .
He favors overturning Roe and returning authority over abortion to the states .
Mr. Romney describes Justices John Roberts and Samuel Alito as “ ideal examples for what we should select ” for Supreme Court justices .
Mr. Romney has a mixed record on taxes and spending .
He previously refused to endorse Mr. Bush ’s 2003 tax cuts .
Today , he favors making them permanent .
He has put forward a plan to hold increases in federal non-discretionary spending below the inflation rate .
As governor of Massachusetts , Mr. Romney , inheriting a state in fiscal collapse , made a far - reaching attempt to streamline state government , but many of his efforts were stymied by a liberal , overwhelmingly Democratic legislature .
He signed into law a universal health care plan that is a mix of free - market reforms and big - government mandates .
Mr. Romney favors drilling in ANWR and withdrew Massachusetts from an initiative sponsored by neighboring liberal New England governors to reduce greenhouse - gas emissions .
McCain vs. Mike Huckabee : Like Mr. McCain , Mr. Huckabee has supported in - state tuition for illegals .
As governor of Arkansas , he dragged his feet on signing an immigration enforcement agreement with the federal Department of Homeland Security .
Now Mr. Huckabee says he favors securing the border and opposes sanctuary cities .
Mr. Huckabee is strongly pro-life and favors appointing strict constructionists to the federal bench .
He opposes McCain - Feingold .
While he has not spoken in great detail about the federal tax and budgetary policies , as governor of Arkansas Mr. Huckabee presided over numerous spending and tax increases , including higher taxes on gasoline , cigarettes , groceries , medicine and the Internet .
Mr. Huckabee favors drilling in ANWR and has been praised by the National Wildlife Federation for his support of a “ cap - and - trade ” system to limit greenhouse gases .
McCain vs. Rudy Giuliani : As New York mayor , Mr. Giuliani accused the Immigration and Naturalization Service of “ terrorizing innocent people ” and sued all the way up to the Supreme Court to defend the city ’s sanctuary policies .
Unlike virtually every other Republican candidate , he is pro-choice on abortion .
Mr. Giuliani has said he would nominate Supreme Court justices like John Roberts and Samuel Alito .
He has supported McCain - Feingold .
Mr. Giuliani opposes a federal cap - and - trade system and has yet to take a position on ANWR .
He has unveiled a far - reaching package of tax cuts but has not been nearly so specific when it comes to the federal budget — particularly the spiraling costs of entitlements .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Hillary Clinton refused to count herself out of the U.S. presidential race on Tuesday as her hard - fought duel with Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination faced the judgment of voters in Ohio and Texas .
Turnout was expected to be strong in Ohio , Texas , Vermont and Rhode Island -- the states voting on Tuesday .
Polls close in Ohio at 7:30 p.m. EST and all voting in Texas will be over by 9 p.m. EST .
First results could be available immediately after the polls close , although tight races could take hours to resolve .
Clinton , a New York senator battling to snap Obama ’s string of 11 state - by - state victories , needs wins in both Ohio and Texas to rejuvenate her campaign and justify staying in the race until the next major contest -- Pennsylvania which votes on April 22 .
Losses in either Texas or Ohio could set off a stampede of party support for Obama , raise pressure on Clinton to drop out and make it even tougher for her to cut Obama ’s lead in the pledged delegates who will choose the Democratic nominee to contest November ’s presidential election .
Tuesday ’s contests also could put Arizona Sen .
John McCain , the Republican front - runner , close to clinching his party ’s nomination .
McCain is favored to beat his last major rival , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , in all four states .
“ I believe that with your help today that we can secure enough delegates to make sure that we can secure the nomination , but we have to win and we have to win big here in the state of Texas , ” McCain told supporters in San Antonio .
TIGHT RACES
Opinion polls show Clinton and Obama in close races in both Ohio and Texas -- the biggest prizes on Tuesday .
A cautious - sounding Obama told reporters on his campaign plane that he thought the race would be “ very , very tight . ”
“ We started 20 points behind in Texas and Ohio , ” he said on the flight from Houston to San Antonio .
“ We ’ve closed the gap but whether it ’s going to be enough to actually win is going to depend on what turnout looks like in both states . ”
“ What my head tells me is we ’ve got a very sizable delegate lead that is going to be hard to overcome , ” he added , when asked if the race would continue on through Pennsylvania .
The former first lady , who would be the first female U.S. president , refused to mull how she would respond to a loss .

“ I do n’t think like that .
We ’re working hard , ” Clinton told reporters .
“ We think we ’re going to do really well here in Texas and in Ohio . ”
Clinton had a slim lead in Texas over Obama , an Illinois senator who would be the first black president , and pulled even in Ohio , according to a Reuters / C- SPAN / Houston Chronicle poll released on Tuesday .
Obama noted that pundits have said Clinton must win Ohio and Texas in a landslide in order to make up for his 11 - state streak .
“ I do n’t think that ’s going to happen , ” he said .
Slideshow ( 27 images )
Clinton ’s campaign aides have been tamping down expectations , easing away from talk that she needed to win both Ohio and Texas , with their combined 334 delegates .
Obama noted the stakes in a rally on Monday night .
“ So here we are with the possibility of winning the nomination , ” Obama said in Houston .
“ One of the things that I ’ve learned is that what makes this powerful is not that things always go easy , but rather that we are willing to go forward when it ’s hard . ”
Like her husband , former President Bill Clinton , who nicknamed himself “ The Comeback Kid ” for his improbable rise to the White House in 1992 , Clinton has dodged disaster before .
In January , Obama appeared ready to deal her a knockout blow in New Hampshire after his big win in Iowa , but she defied opinion polls and won .
After a landslide loss in South Carolina , Clinton battled Obama to a draw in Super Tuesday contests around the country on February 5 , winning some of the biggest prizes of the night in California , New York and New Jersey .
Under Democratic rules allowing the losers in each state to win a proportional amount of delegates , Clinton cannot close the gap on Obama among pledged delegates unless she wins in Ohio and Texas by margins that appear beyond her grasp .
An MSNBC count gave Obama 1,194 delegates to Clinton ’s 1,037 before Tuesday ’s showdowns , well short of the 2,025 needed to win the nomination .

Jingle Mail ?
Forget that !
Its so 2007 .
For 2008 , let 's try a little reverse financial engineering : Squatting in $ 3 million dollar waterfront mansion in Florida and paying nothing .
At least , that 's a new and growing problem we learn of via MW in South Florida .
MW is a local developer , and claims this has become " very serious . "
( I have been able to independently verify this with a local resident , who tells me the local papers are filled with such tales ) .
He writes :
" There is a very important phenomena that is occurring that has only been covered in an only " glancing " manner .
Beyond the concept of " jingle mail " -- which suggests that folks who can pay their mortgages may just choose to walk away given the dramatic loss of equity due to housing 's collapse -- consider the following :
As a developer , I had stepped to the sidelines and rented beginning in 2005 , because I was sure that housing was unsustainable and was bound to collapse ; it took 2 more years for it occur .
Nonetheless , as I have followed several of the homes that my wife and I were interested in a few years back , they are all on the market now .
What is shocking , that in each and every case , I have been told by brokers and banks that the owners , have ceased paying their mortgages in some cases for nearly 2 years and have continued to occupy these homes .
Now , these are homes in excess of $ 2,000,000 in the very best neighborhoods in South Florida .
Brokers have added that these buyers further complicated things by putting huge home equity lines on top of their mortgages and now have no possibility of selling their homes for amounts needed to cover their accumulated debt .
This may not seem like news , but understand what this means :
There is currently an 8 - 10 month wait to get a court date to have a foreclosure filing heard in Dade and Broward counties .
The bankers have non-performing loans on their books to the best heeled borrowers in multi-million dollar amounts with no immediate means for recovery ; with a non-secured second mortgage in place , there is no possibility for a " short sale " that will satisfy all of the borrower 's debt .
They are reluctant to take a haircut knowing that they have the home equity debt still around their neck and are likely to frustrate any near - term sale .
There is no clean way to sell the home that would guarantee " clean title " hence a foreclosure is the only means to separate the property from the dead - beat speculator / squattor .
Banks do not want to spend the $ 50,000 required to take a home through a foreclosure and clear the title -- only to put the house back on the market for a deeper loss afterwards .
Most likely , they have not revealed these owner occupied defaults to their shareholders , thanks to the sheer numbers of non-performing loans on their balance sheets , and the daunting task of foreclosing on all of them .
This is the ultimate seizure and full stop of the market whereby everyone is standing in a stalemate .
As one broker said to me , " these bums sitting in $ 3,000,000 homes overlooking the water are likely to be left alone by the banks for 2 years before the banks even get serious about foreclosure . "
In recent years , beer - making has become a seriously competitive industry .
In addition to the regional and national manufacturers we 're all familiar with , there are literally thousands of microbreweries out there , with thousands more planned .
Every single one produces one or more craft beers in relatively small amounts for the discerning beer drinker , each different in its own way .
The only thing they have in common is that they need beer bottle labels — both primary bottle labels and bottleneck labels .
And on the increasingly crowded craft beer shelves , each needs every edge it can get to attract the attention of the public .
Beer bottle labels that do n't practically leap out and throttle the consumer may result in a washed - up , forgotten has - been of a beer .
Shy and retiring just wo n't cut it in this market .
We can help you make your beer command attention , pulling eyes straight to your brew so your fans can find it without any trouble , and adventurous imbibers will see something new they want to try .
Whether we 're talking standard 12 - ouncers or the larger " growler " or " bomber " beer bottles , it 's a beer - drink - beer world out there — especially since a good craft beer usually costs more than a traditional pilsner or ale .
While the big guys are n't likely to lose their customer base of diehard fans who care more for cost and conformity than the occasional pleasant surprise , a craft beer label can make or break a brand .
What 's in Your Beer ?
Nearly all beer starts with malted barley or wheat and hops , but modern craft brews have taken beers to a different level — and a different beer level needs a different beer label .
Fruit beers like raspberry ales are fun , but nothing new ; the Belgians have been doing it for centuries .
Even honey beers , better known as the divine elixir called " mead , " are thousands of years old .
But now some beers are made with hot peppers , chocolate , donuts , maple syrup , molasses , cucumbers , gingerbread , pizza spices , and more .
If those do n't sound " bright " enough for your custom printed craft beer labels , you can emulate some of the more unusual beer ingredients out there , like yeast collected from the master brewer 's beard , ingredients that have been ( ahem ) " predigested by elephants , " and even crab claws .
Then comes the beer bottle label design , which can also determine whether your brewski stands out or fades into the background .
Wood - grain patterns on beer bottle labels have been surprisingly popular lately , as have those beer labels with shiny metallic lettering , custom printed bottle labels that actually look handwritten or drawn , and mostly transparent beer bottle labels that make the foreground elements — letters and images — really jump out at you .
No longer are beer labels just for identification ; they 've become part of a beer 's identity , even the normally plain nutritional facts labels now mandated by the government .
To some extent , this has always been true ; the famous Budweiser label , for example , is instantly familiar to millions of Americans .
Which brings up another point : Budweiser is known for tweaking its label multiple times over the course of 140 + years .
If your craft beer is underperforming , come to us with your ideas and we can help you craft an eye - popping beer label that sticks in the memory .
But Wait , There 's More !
In many countries , you 're allowed to produce a certain amount of beer for your own personal use , as long as you do n't sell it ; in the U.S. , it 's up to 200 gallons per household .
That translates into dozens of cases of beer .
If you 're a productive homebrewer , we'd be happy to provide custom printed beer bottle labels to help you keep track of your batches .
We can also provide partially printed or standard blank beer bottle labels , bomber labels , growler labels , and whatever else you need .
If you choose washable labels that come off easy when soaked in water , you can even reuse your bottles .
Hey , we 're all for recycling when it requires us to drink some good beer first !
The Pentagon has launched a preventive strike against a target that military chiefs presumably regard as one of the most active current threats to U.S. and world security — namely , the office of the vice president of the United States .
Thrusting back hard against Vice President Dick Cheney ’s warmongering , the head of U.S. forces in the Mideast declared that an attack on Iran “ is not in the offing , ” and more or less urged the vice president and his political allies to shut up .
In a front - page interview published on Nov. 12 by the Financial Times , Admiral William Fallon , who heads the U.S. Central Command , spoke in diplomatic tones , as top military officers usually tend to do when they make strong political statements .
Yet there was no mistaking the admiral ’s message .
While Iran certainly poses a “ challenge , ” he said , U.S. policymakers must engage Tehran to encourage changes in the regime ’s behavior .
But the Iranians wo n’t “ come to their senses ” while under threat of bombardment , invasion or worse .
“ None of this is helped by the stories that just keep going around and around and around that any day now there will be another war , which is just not where we want to go , ” he said with a degree of exasperation .
“ It seems to me that we do n’t need more problems .
It astounds me that so many pundits and others are spending so much time yakking about this topic [ of war against Iran ] . ”
Most of that bellicose speculation can be traced back to vice presidential circles , including the neoconservative ideologues ( or as the admiral put it , the “ pundits ” ) , who popularized the notions that Iran is an imminent threat to the United States , Israel and the world and that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is the next Hitler .
Those themes certainly have a familiar ring ; the last imminent threat was Iraq , and the last next Hitler was Saddam Hussein .
Not content with the great success of their Mesopotamian misadventure , the same people have been urging action against Iran .
Admiral Fallon ’s remarks follow in the wake of recent statements by both President George W. Bush and Vice President Cheney .
Not long ago , the president blurted a strange warning that if other nations wish to avert “ World War III , ” then they had best ensure that Iran never obtains “ the knowledge ” to construct nuclear weapons .
“ We will not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon , ” growled the vice president , muttering about the “ serious consequences ” that the Iranians would suffer .
Since nobody believes that Tehran will come close to acquiring a nuclear weapon before the Bush administration leaves office , the ominous comments were taken as signals that the White House is contemplating preemptive action .
Those signals have emanated for years from the office of the vice president and those associated with him .
More important , the nation ’s military leaders seem determined to block any rush to war , no matter what the vice president may desire .
The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reportedly expressed strong opposition to any military strike on Iran ’s nuclear facilities , and little enthusiasm for even limited action against Iranian forces .
Their reluctance stems from tactical concerns about the impact of conflict with Iran on U.S. forces in Iraq , and strategic worries over waging wars in three Muslim nations in the region simultaneously .
For now , the influence of sane and sensible officers appears to be ascending .
Only a few days before Admiral Fallon spoke out , an Associated Press dispatch noted that American officials are quietly reducing our force profile in the Gulf region — for instance , by withdrawing an aircraft carrier that was sent earlier this year to emphasize the American regional security commitment .
As for President Bush , if his own words are to be believed , then he too has decided to pursue the diplomatic option rather than engage in reckless bombing .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has explicitly rejected the idea that the Senate authorized war last September by designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a “ terrorist organization . ”
She went on to say “ the president has also made very clear that he’s on a diplomatic path where Iran comes into focus . ”
If calmer counsel is prevailing , however , tensions are certain to rise again when the U.S. moves for United Nations sanctions against Tehran .
It would not take much to provoke fire on either side , which is why rhetorical tone is so important .
“ You certainly do n’t want to encourage any kind of a miscalculation or misstep by talk , ” said Admiral Fallon , who seems to understand how swiftly foolish fantasies of war can be transformed into lethal realities .

Republicans are the Society of Christian Socialists ?
http://rexcurry.net/commentary/Bellamy.html
A lot of fascinating research examines the influence of religion and theocracy on government and socialism .
Many authors worry still about the potential for a future filled with religious persecution and totalitarianism .
Those worries have relevance to the enormous size and scope of government in the USA and its growing police state .
Most people do not know that a cross was worshiped as the notorious symbol of the National Socialist German Workers ' Party .
The group called their symbol the Hakenkreuz , not the swastika .
Hakenkreuz means " hooked cross . "
It is one of the biggest cover -ups in history .
The swastika became known as the Socialist Cross because of Christian Socialists in the USA , including Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy .
Edward Bellamy also worked closely with the Theosophical Society .
http://rexcurry.net/swastika3clear.jpg
Swastikas were used to denote overlapping S - letters for " socialism " in the USA and later under the National Socialist German Workers Party and elsewhere .
The double - S letters of the hooked cross also denoted the socialist dogma of self - sacrifice , even to the ultimate degree ( the cross or crucifix was used as a means of execution and / or self sacrifice ) .
Through the hakenkreuz crusaders , the symbol also gained quasi-religious status as the cross of socialism through its use in the worship of government and socialism .
http://rexcurry.net/theosophy-madame-blavatsky-theosophical-society.html
In the USA the hooked cross was a common symbol and was referred to as a cross ( armed cross , twisted cross , lucky cross , crooked cross , hooked cross ) before " swastika " became dominant .
The eventual dominance of " swastika " occurred in part to distance the cross from German Christian Socialism , by slandering a foreign symbol .
The hooked cross became a symbol of Christian Socialism because , as a cross , it represented two separate pieces overlapping , and those pieces were S - shaped , and served as letters for " socialism " combined with the religious features of the cross .
The symbol was then used to promote persecution of people of differing religious faiths and also people of differing philosophies ( the socialist swastika was an anti capitalist symbol to persecute anyone judged a " capitalist " ) .
Although the swastika was an ancient symbol , the noted cryptographer and symbologist Dr. Rex Curry ( author of " Swastika Secrets " ) discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent " S " letters for their " socialism . "
With a 45 degree turn of his Hakenkreuz , the leader of German National Socialists used the " swastika flag " to combine the cross with collectivism , merge church and state , mesh religion and socialism , and mandate the worship of government .
He altered his own signature to use the same symbolism and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens .
http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html
Support for Dr. Curry 's work comes from other authors who believe the Holocaust under the Knight of the Hakenkreuz was an inquisition ( including religious persecution ) undertaken by the leader of Knights of the Hakenkreuz under his religious beliefs .
In the 1930's , religious people were persecuted for refusing to give the straight - arm salute to the national flag .
That persecution occurred in the USA ( to the stars and stripes ) and in Germany ( to the swastika flag ) at the same time .
Today , most people in the USA were educated in government schools ( socialist schools ) , so they are ignorant of the fact that it was happening in both Germany and the USA .
It is odd that historians of theocracy overlook that startling fact .
http://rexcurry.net/jehovahs-witnesses-fight-socialism-in-USA.html
The early Pledge of Allegiance used a straight - arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers ' Party , as shown in recent discoveries by the historian Dr. Rex Curry ( author of " Pledge of Allegiance Secrets " ) .
The USA used the straight arm salute to the national flag for three decades before German National Socialists started doing the same thing .
Religious children and children of various races and backgrounds were required by law to perform the straight - arm salute in government schools in robotic chanting every morning at the ring of a government bell ( just as it is done today but with a different gesture ) .
Many people considered the raised - arm salute to the national flag to be sacrilegious worship of government and socialism .
Religious people had good reasons to consider the pledge / salute to be sacrilegious , in that Germans used the ritual toward their Hakenkreuz symbol , the " hooked cross .
"
The Protestant Reich Church was formed by under the National Socialist German Worker 's Party in 1933 , by merging 29 regional churches into one church .
The founding of the church was the result of work by the German Christian Socialists .
During the war , Alfred Rosenberg drew up a thirty - point program for a new " National Reich Church . "
One point declared that the " Hakenkreuz " ( hooked cross or swastika ) would be the type of cross used in the Church .
The straight - arm salute was created by Francis Bellamy , a minister who lost his position because he used the pulpit to push what he called " Christian Socialism " in sermons on themes like " Jesus the Socialist . "
http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html
Francis was cousin and cohort to Edward Bellamy , author of " Looking Backward " an international bestseller that was known as the Bible of National Socialism .
Edward also authored " The Religion of Solidarity " and other articles and books with similar ideas .
Both Bellamys worked together to promote Christian Socialism and they wanted the government to take over all schools to spread their dogma .
Both Bellamys descended from a long line of ancestors who touted similar dogma for generations .
http://rexcurry.net/bookchapter1a1i.html
Christian socialists were like all socialists in that they hated the U.S. Constitution and wanted to destroy it because , back in the old days , people actually thought that the U.S. Constitution was supposed to limit the size and scope of government .
" Looking Backward " was so popular that it was translated into every major language , including German , Russian , and Chinese .
It immediately inspired a supportive political movement with “ Nationalism Clubs ” worldwide .
In 1939 the National Socialist German Workers ' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics joined as allies to invade Poland in a pact to divide up Europe .
Armageddon , the apocalypse , and the Great Wars against humanity were visible in the socialist Wholecaust ( of which the Holocaust was a part ) : 65 million slaughtered under the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR ) ; 49 million under the Peoples ' Republic of China ( PRC ) ; 21 million under the National Socialist German Workers ' Party ( NSGWP ) .
Their satanic leaders would not separate church and state , they combined religion with socialism , and they worshipped government .
After WWII , Stalin and Mao went on to kill even more people .
Socialism is hades .
http://rexcurry.net/wholecaust-museum.html
It all shows how close the USA came ( and is still coming ) to the socialist Wholecaust .
Many Americans are sad examples of how places like that come into existence , grow so large , last so long , and kill so many .
Historians make their work relevant to current events .
Such stories are relevant to the fact that the present government in the USA is anti libertarian and is out - socializing the previous administration by more than double and growing ( in social spending ALONE ) .
The demonic dogma of socialism , sacrifice , and self - sacrifice is still growing all over the world .
The government should not run Sunday school , nor Monday school through Friday school .
The First Amendment should be enlarged to state that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of education nor an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof .
The separation of school and state is as important as the separation of church and state .**************************
It is a wonder why putting references to God on money and on the socialists 's pledge is not considered blasphemous .
It is a wonder why there is no movement to put " under God " on the flag itself ( it is already on coins and in the socialist 's pledge ) .
It would be similar to " God is Great " written on the flag of Iraq .
The Capitalist philosopher Ayn Rand once said that she felt like the only adult in a world full of children .
She might have added that she felt like the only adult in a world full of children robotically chanting the Pledge of Allegiance .
Or she might have said " I feel like the only adult in a world full of children robotically chanting the Pledge of Allegiance with the early stiff - arm salute .
"************************** Citizen : Senator , I have sinnedSenator :
What did you do my son ?
Citizen : I had impure thoughts about government schools indoctrinating children for national socialism .
Senator :
Do you repent your sin ?
Citizen : I do SenatorSenator : Instead of your mandatory 5 Pledges of Allegiance in your government school this week , you should do 8 Pledges of Allegiance and attend a flag raising ceremony every day this week .
Now go forth and sin no more .************************** There are many types of crosses .
The swastika was a type of cross and it was also called the Hakenkreuz or Hooked Cross .
It was also known as Crux Gammata , Fylfot , Suastika , Tetraskelion , Twisted Cross , , or ( in heraldry ) , as each arm resembles aor angle - iron .
( Comparein German ) ; ( Greek : τ έτραγαμμάδιον ) or just gammadion , as each arm resembles the Greek letter gamma ( Γ ) .

Pope Benedict 's Swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastika-lambach-pope-ratzinger-regensburg-germany2006.jpg
Broken Cross http://rexcurry.net/swastika-lambach-extreme-unction-rogier-van-der-Weyden.jpg
Swastika style designs worn by Pope Benedict ( Ratzinger ) on his trip to Regensburg , Germany in 2006 is interesting in light of the fact that Ratzinger was a member of the Hitler Youth .
http://rexcurry.net/swastika-lambach-pope-ratzinger-regensburg-germany2006.jpg
The head of the National Socialist German Workers ' Party was raised as a Roman Catholic by his parents , as was customary where he lived .
His mother wanted him to become a priest .
He saw the swastika symbol while he was a young student with the Benedictins at the Abbey of Lambach - am - Traum , in upper Austria .
The symbol was engraved on the four corners of the monastery .
It was not called a swastika .
German National Socialists called the symbol that they worshippd a Hakenkreuz .
It was a type of cross .
" Hakenkreuz " translates as " hooked cross .
"
In some ways , the head of the NSGWP did become a priest .
He became a priest of Christian Socialism and a hakenkreuz Crusader .
He used his cross , the Hakenkreuz / swastika , as overlapping S - letters for " socialism " in the National Socialist German Workers Party .
There are many types of crosses and many uses .
To this day the symbol of the Knights of Columbus prominently displays an Iron Cross underneath a fasces ( including the ax ) as its centerpiece .
A fasces is an ancient Roman symbol and is the origin of the term “ Fascism . ”
It is a bundle of rods bound together about an ax with the blade projecting .
http://rexcurry.net/fascism=socialism.html#AMERICAN_SOCIALISTS_SPREAD_FASCISM
The emblem of the Order dates from May 12 , 1883 , when James T. Mullen , who was then supreme knight , designed it .
According to the Knights of Columbus ’ official website , the emblem indicates a medieval knight ’s shield mounted upon what the KOC calls a Formée cross ( having the arms narrow at the center and expanding toward the ends and is also known as the Cross Pattee ) .
That definition is also the definition of the Iron Cross or ritterkreuz ( rider ’s cross or knight ’s cross ) made notorious by the National Socialist German Worker ’s Party ( Nazis ) .
Mounted on the knight ’s shield are three objects : a fasces standing vertically and , crossed behind it , an anchor and a dagger or short sword .
The fasces from Roman days , carried before magistrates as an emblem of authority , is symbolic of authority which must exist in any tightly - bound collective organization .
The anchor is the mariner 's symbol for Columbus , patron of the Order , while the short sword or dagger was the Knight ’s weapon of violence .
Thus , the shield expresses Knighthood and with the letters , K of C , it proclaims this specific form of activity .
The Knights of Columbus was also intended to provide an alternative for Catholics to membership in a Masonic lodge - Freemasonry , which was an organization that consisted of many anti-Catholics at the time .
Membership was discouraged by church hierarchy , and banned by Pope Leo XIII in 1884 .
The Knights of Columbus group is sometimes called Catholic Freemasons .
Francis Bellamy authored of the Pledge of Allegiance .
It was the origin of the stiff - arm salute adopted later by the National Socialist German Workers ' Party .
( see the work of the historian Dr. Rex Curry , author of " Pledge of Allegiance Secrets " ) .
Bellamy was a Freemason and a Christian Socialist in the Nationalism movement who touted " military socialism . "
Bellamy used the Freemasons and other civic groups to spread his Pledge of Allegiance , and that also caused the stiff - arm salute to spread .
The " Catholic Freemasons " ( the Knights of Columbus ) also helped to spread the socialist 's Pledge of Allegiance ( and its stiff - arm salute ) and , in 1954 , the Knights lobbied to insert the phrase " under God " into the quasi-Gregorian children 's chant .
The Knights of Columbus have been active in attempts to retain the phrase and the Pledge during recent controversies in Court and in Congress .***************************** Collar of Esses http://rexcurry.net/swastika_collar_of_esses_livery_hans_Holbein.jpg

The S - shapes of the swastika led to other uses of S - symbolism in jewelry and elsewhere .
The symbolism is shown a 1527 painting " Portrait of Thomas Morus " or " Sir Thomas More " as Lord Chancellor , by the Artist Hans Holbein the Younger ( in the Frick Collection in New York ) .
The painting depicts a livery collar known as the Collar of Esses ( or S S ) , due to the S - shapes .
Note the three - armed swastika - style center piece holding the pendant .
This famous livery collar , which has never passed out of use , takes many forms , its Esses being sometimes linked together chainwise , and sometimes , in early examples , bestowed as the ornamental bosses of a garter - shaped strap - collar .

The “ Collar of Esses ” is also said to be from the Order of the Garder .
It is said that the coupled “ S.S. ” means the “ Sanctus Spiritus , ” or “ Holy Spirit , ” or the “ Third Person . ”
The “ Fleurs - de - Lis , ” or “ Lisses , ” or the “ Lilies of the Field , ” invariably appear in close connection with St. John , or the “ Sanctus Spiritus , ” and also with the Blessed Virgin Mary , in all Christian symbola or insignia .
The Prince of Wales ’ triple plume appears to have the same symbolism as the “ Fleur - de - Lis . ”
The “ Fleur - de - Lis ” is stylized in the “ Three Feathers , ” the crest of the Prince of Wales .
” The head of the NSGWP was raised as a Roman Catholic by his parents , as was customary where he lived .
His mother wanted him to become a priest .
He saw the swastika symbol while he was a young student with the Benedictins at the Abbey of Lambach - am - Traum , in upper Austria .
The symbol was engraved on the four corners of the monastery .
It was not called a swastika .
German National Socialists called the symbol that they worshippd a Hakenkreuz .
It was a type of cross .
It translates as " hooked cross . "
In some ways , the head of the NSGWP did become a priest .

A monastery is a community of persons who give up individuality to live collectively , through self - sacrifice , and they often take vows to live in poverty , and give up private property .
The term " monastery " comes from the root " mono " as meaning living as one .
In a free society , such a manner of living is voluntary and rare .
Under socialism , such a manner of living is involuntary and is imposed on everyone by government .
It results in widespread poverty .
The leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party ( NSGWP ) was believed to be of Christian faith by many people .
He was influenced by the Christian Social movement and its founder Karl Lueger , after Luerger 's rise to power in Vienna in 1897 .
Vienna mayor Karl Lueger was credited in ' Mein Kampf ' as a role model and inspirational figure to the leader of the NSGWP .
The bookis by John W. Boyer and he traces the movement 's evolution from a dissident political group of disparate ward politicians , through its maturation into the largest single party in the Austrian parliament by 1907 , to its major role in Imperial politics during the First World War .
In the historic film " Triumph of the Will , " the leader of the National Socialist German Workers '
Party states : " The Party will be like a religious order .
" In his book The Holy Reich ( NSGWP Conceptions of Christianity , 1919 - 1945 ) Richard Steigmann - Gall argues persuasively that the the National Socialist German Workers ' Party ( NSGWP ) did not reject Christianity ,
In addressing the rabid socialism of the NSGWP in The Holy Reich , Steigmann - Gall writes about Joseph Goebbels and Goebbels ' novel " Michael " ( 1923 ) :
Joseph Goebbels , for whom the “ socialism ” in National Socialism was of particular importance , was a notable example in this regard .
Sacrifice is intrinsic to socialism .
Goebbels ’ reference to “ Christ Socialists ” ( Christussozialisten ) as opposed to “ Christian Socialists ” ( Christliche Sozialisten ) emphasizes the nearly evangelical nature of the struggle :
An unadulterated return to Christ ’s teachings , free of the temporal church , is the only way to German salvation .
“ The modern man is intrinsically a seeker of God , perhaps a Christman ....
We modern Germans are something like Christ Socialists . ”
Even in private , without the requirements of political expediency that otherwise might have compelled him to cynical posturing , Goebbels similarly wrote : “ Speaking does not help .
Action !
Be socialists of action .
There is too little of that .
Be true Christians ! ” ’
This emphasis on an active morality , a “ practical ” Christianity , would be a continuous theme for Goebbels well into the Third Reich .
Goebbels seriously believed his own disturbing statement — there is no evidence that he ever said anything different in private when he would have had the freedom to reveal his “ genuine ” feelings , if they differed from his public comments .
Instead , his private statements and his public statements were consistent .
The following is about the leader of the National Socialist German Workers ' Party :
[ I ] n a private meeting on NSGWP economics with his inner circle , held in 1930 , [ The NSGWP leader ] elaborated his ideas on “ real ” socialism once again , but now with explicit reference to Christ : “ It is such a far - reaching and complete conversion that the adult is no longer capable of it .
Only youth can be converted , newly aligned and adjusted to the socialist sense of obligation toward the community .
For almost two thousand years the Gospel of Christ has been preached , for two thousand years the sense of community has been taught .
. . .
But today , at the end of these two thousand years , economic liberalism flourishes as never before ! ” ...
For [ the NSGWP leader ] , the answer to the current state of affairs lay in a resurrection of Christ ’s ideas : “ As Christ proclaimed ‘ love one another ’ , so our call — ‘ peoples ’ community ’ , ‘ public need before private greed ’ , ‘ communally - minded social consciousness ’ — rings out through the German fatherland !
This call will echo throughout the world ! ”
Without reference to a particular variety , “ positive ” or otherwise , [ the NSGWP leader ] insists that Christianity is at the center of [ National Socialist German Workers ' Party ] social thought .
As with Buch and Goebbels , [ the NSGWP leader ] regards the teachings of Christ as direct inspiration for the “ German ” socialism advanced by the party .
Many Socialists and Christians in modern America may have difficulty understanding how their ideas were used in the National Socialist German Workers ' Party .
The New Testament describes the early Christian communities as if they were socialist :
All that believed were together , and had all things in common ;
And sold their possessions and goods , and parted them to all men , as every man had need .
( Acts 2:44 - 45 )
It is a line that long pre-dated Marx ’s notorious recipe for death : “ From each according to his ability , to each according to his need . ”
************************** It is frightening how far the USA joined in the depravity .
The major Supreme Court cases about the pledge involved religious children in government schools who were being forced to robotically chant the pledge to the national flag with the straight - arm salute .
Those cases began in the 1930's but did not reach decision until 1940 & 1943 .
At first the children were unsuccessful in the USA .
Socialists persecuted the children , expelled them from the socialist schools , arrested their parents , seized children from parents on allegations of " unfit parenting , " and many children had to flee and use the many better alternatives , including home - schooling and their own church schools ( but they and their schools were often persecuted by socialists there also ) .
At the height of National Socialism abroad , the USA 's government deliberately fell farther into the same abyss with national numbering of humans imposed in 1935 with the social security system .
The federal government was growing massively and attempting to nationalize the economy in many ways .
The US Supreme Court struck down much of the new legislation as unconstitutional until justices were pressured by the " switch in time that socialized nine .
"
It is sad to note that during the same time period in the USA , religious people who were fleeing the National Socialist German Workers ’ Party ( NSGWP ) were turned away from the USA , and knowingly sent to suffering and death .
That happened because of socialists who support restrictions on immigration and on every American ’s right to hire , to do business , and to freely associate .
It was similar to today .
Socialists in the USA still support restrictions on immigration and they reject the right of every American in living with , marrying , renting to , selling to , buying from , hiring ( as housekeeper , lawn man , doctor , nanny , teacher etc ) any person with whom that American wishes to associate .
Little has changed .
The USA still follows similar anti libertarian policies promoted by the Bellamys .
Many socialist Bellamy policies caused the USA ’s big , expensive and oppressive government and its growing police - state .
The Bellamys promoted the U.S. disaster of old prohibition , as well as modern prohibition .
It caused the Great Socialist Depression ( from the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , the Smoot - Hawley Tariff Act 1930 etc ) that persisted and even lasted through U.S. involvement in WWII .
Socialism 's quest for omniscience was enlarged with social security numbers in 1935 to track and tax everyone , as the USA followed the path of German National Socialists at the height of their power .
The federal government grew massively and nationalized the economy in many ways .
The Pledge still exists along with laws mandating that teachers lead the robotic pledge chanting every day for twelve years of each child ’s life ( though the salute was altered ) .
The government still owns and operates schools .
The U.S. practice of imposing segregation by law in government schools and teaching racism as official policy outlasted the National Socialist German Workers '
Party by over 15 years .
After segregation in government 's schools ended , the Bellamy legacy caused more police - state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities .
Those schools still exist .
Infants are given social security numbers ( socialist slave numbers ) that track and tax them for life .
Government schools demand the numbers for enrollment .****************************** The Bellamys were bigots and racists and they obsessed about immigrants coming into the USA .
They wanted to impose a heavy - handed method of brain - washing immigrants and all Americans into accepting their socialist dogma .
Because of the Bellamys , the USA has a long history of turning immigrants away from being good Americans and independent capitalists , and in turning immigrants into socialists who are dependent on government .
The Bellamys promoted a government takeover of schools , and when the government granted their wish , the government schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official government policy .
It is also true that German National Socialists did not refer to themselves with the hackneyed shorthand n-word , nor the f-word , and there is no such use innor in .
Modern writers , on the other hand , cover - up the truth and never use the actual name of the horrid Party , and deceitfully use the shorthand terms , exclusively to perpetuate widespread ignorance , and that is why those terms are trite .
The Hakenkreuz ( hooked cross ) was an ancient religious symbol in Germany , related to the un-hooked cross and to the Prussian - German Iron cross and to other crosses .

On Monday 's Hardball Chris Matthews talked with Jim Walsh from MIT and Joshua Muravchik from the American Enterprise Institute to discuss Iran and whether or not the U.S. should attack .
In what was one of Matthews ' more palatable segments , he grills Muravchik , who says he does n't care when we attack Iran just as long as we do it soon because , in his words , there are no alternatives .
Both Matthews and Walsh fail to mention Sunni militants , supported by Saudis , who are actually responsible for the majority of attacks on U.S. soldiers and the fact that the Bush administration does n't seem to want to acknowledge it .
Walsh did warn that invading Iran would be a giant mistake :
The case was brought by lawyers working for a Swiss bank
Wikileaks.org , as it is known , was cut off from the internet following a California court ruling , the site says .
The case was brought by a Swiss bank after " several hundred " documents were posted about its offshore activities .
Other versions of the pages , hosted in countries such as Belgium and India , can still be accessed .
However , the main site was taken offline after the court ordered that Dynadot , which controls the site 's domain name , should remove all traces of wikileaks from its servers .
The court also ordered that Dynadot should " prevent the domain name from resolving to the wikileaks.org website or any other website or server other than a blank park page , until further order of this Court . "
Other orders included that the domain name be locked " to prevent transfer of the domain name to a different domain registrar " to prevent changes being made to the site .
Wikileaks claimed that the order was " unconstitutional " and said that the site had been " forcibly censored " .
Web names
The case was brought by lawyers working for the Swiss banking group Julius Baer .
It concerned several documents posted on the site which allegedly reveal that the bank was involved with money laundering and tax evasion .
The site was founded in 2006
The documents were allegedly posted by Rudolf Elmer , former vice president of the bank 's Cayman Island 's operation .
A spokesperson for Julius Baer said he could not comment on the case because of " pending legal proceedings " .
The BBC understands that Julius Baer asked for the documents to be removed because they could have an impact on a separate legal case ongoing in Switzerland .
The court hearing took place last week and Dynadot blocked access from Friday evening .
Wikileaks says it was not represented at the hearing because it was " given only hours notice " via e-mail .
A document signed by Judge Jeffery White , who presided over the case , ordered Dynadot to follow six court orders .
As well as removing all records of the site form its servers , the hosting and domain name firm was ordered to produce " all prior or previous administrative and account records and data for the wikileaks.org domain name and account " .
The order also demanded that details of the site 's registrant , contacts , payment records and " IP addresses and associated data used by any person ... who accessed the account for the domain name " to be handed over .
Wikileaks allows users to post documents anonymously .
Information bank
The site was founded in 2006 by dissidents , journalists , mathematicians and technologists from the US , Taiwan , Europe , Australia and South Africa .
It so far claims to have published more than 1.2 million documents .
It provoked controversy when it first appeared on the net with many commentators questioning the motives of the people behind the site .
It recently made available a confidential briefing document relating to the collapse of the UK's Northern Rock bank .
Lawyers working on behalf of the bank attempted to have the documents removed from the site .
They can still be accessed .
Dynadot was contacted for this article but have so far not responded to requests for comment .
Well Hello [ Oct. 19th , 2009 | 05:38 pm ] Jeremy Wilson
Sorry for the lack of posting this year .
It 's been mostly about the explosion of funny photo LJs and other sources of images - things like Space Ghetto et al - that has stemmed my tide of posting .
It is almost impossible for me to get the scoop on anything new , and I 'm not keen on just reposting photos everyone has seen and the resulting " OLD NEWS " replies .
Also , I got myself a girlfriend and I 've changed jobs a couple of times , so I do n't have the free time I used to .
Sorry Interweb , you take a backseat to real life .
If only LJ allowed batch posting so I could queue up a bunch of them ahead of time .
Anyway , thanks for the birthday wishes , it 's much appreciated !
The photo is totally related to this post .
Liberal California Dem endorses Clinton Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday January 29 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Hillary Clinton received the endorsement of Rep. Maxine Waters , a California Democrat who could provide crucial support when Democrats there vote in next week 's Super Tuesday slate of primaries and caucuses .
Waters praised the New York senator and former First Lady as " no nonsense , articulate and experienced policymaker " who will be ready from her first day in office to make " dreams a reality . "
Clinton and Waters spoke to reporters on a conference call Tuesday , 24 hours after Barack Obama scored a publicity coup when he was endorsed by Ted Kennedy , the " liberal lion " of the Senate and one of the most influential Democrats on the national stage .
Clinton said the Waters endorsement was especially cherished because of her " connection to her constituents . "
Waters ' Los Angeles - area district is a bastion of Democratic support in California populated primarily by black and Hispanic voters .
Waters , who is in her ninth term in the House , is one of its most liberal members , a member of the Progressive Caucus and co-sponsor of a resolution aimed at impeaching Vice President Dick Cheney .
She also is a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus , and her backing comes as Clinton 's campaign faces charges that it has inappropriately inserted race into the primary contests .
Waters predicted Clinton would win California , which holds its primary Feb. 5 along with more than 20 other states .
Clinton also said she was " proud " to receive the endorsement of three children of Robert F. Kennedy , the brother of Ted Kennedy and former President John F. Kennedy who was assassinated during his own presidential campaign .
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend , Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Kerry Kennedy wrote in the Los Angeles Times that Clinton was " the strongest candidate " for America and the Democratic party .
" Democrats believe that America should not be torturing people , eavesdropping on our citizens or imprisoning them without habeas corpus or other constitutional rights .
We should not be an imperial power .
We need healthcare for all and a clean , safe environment , " they wrote .
" The loftiest poetry will not solve these issues .
We need a president willing to engage in a fistfight to safeguard and restore our national virtues . "
Regardless of who is endorsing whom , though , Clinton said the election ultimately came down to a choice between individuals .
" I trust the voters to sort this out for themselves , " she declared .
The tallest wind turbines in the U.S. have been installed in Texas — the Vestas V90 turbines are 345 feet high , and are rated at 3 megawatts each .
They are part of the 63 megawatt Snyder Wind Project , a wind farm that ’s just been installed in western Texas .
Texas is already home to Horse Hollow , the world ’s largest wind farm with 421 wind turbines that generate a total capacity of 735 megawatts .
The turbine towers at Snyder are so tall because wind conditions are best at that height — will produce energy sufficient to power more than 12,000 average Texas homes annually .
The wind farm was built by Enel SpA and GE Energy Financial Services .
The two companies are also working together on another 101 megawatt wind farm project in Kansas .
Workers repair a 1.5 MW wind turbine — the turbines at Snyder are twice this size .

We had been working on this story all day – the controversy over Barack Obama ’s pastor , Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
Anderson talks with Democratic Presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama , responding to his pastor ’s firestorm of controversy .
360° Tonight , 10 p ET .
Rev .
Wright recently had this to say , " Hillary was not a black boy raised in a single parent home , Barack was .
Barack knows what it means to be a black man living in a country and a culture that is controlled by rich white people .
Hillary , Hillary ai n’t never been called a n*****!
Hillary has never had her people defined as a non-person . ”
Harsh words from a man Obama has called his spiritual mentor ( he officiated the Obamas ’ wedding and baptized their two children ) .
Yesterday , Sen. Obama was not commenting , so our plan for tonight was to run a story looking at the history of this kind of rhetoric in black churches and what Rev.
Wright ’s comments could mean for the his most famous congregation member .
But late in the day , the Obama campaign had a change of heart , offering up the Senator himself to address the issue .
So we ’ll have that tonight , Anderson and Senator Obama responding to his pastor ’s firestorm of controversy .
Program note : Anderson Cooper 360° airs live at 10 p ET on CNN
Top leaders of the “ new government ” called for in the COG would entirely or largely go into hiding , and would govern in hidden locations
Those within the new government would know what was going on .
But those in the “ old government ” – that is , the one created by the framers of the Constitution – would not necessarily know the details of what was happening
Normal laws and legal processes might largely be suspended , or superseded by secretive judicial forums
The media might be ordered by strict laws – punishable by treason – to only promote stories authorized by the new government
Is It Possible ?
As everyone jokes about , Dick Cheney has largely been hiding in “ an undisclosed location ” since 9/11 and the anthrax attacks
Congressman Peter DeFazio , on the Homeland Security Committee ( and so with proper security access ) , inquired about continuity of government plans , and was refused access .
Indeed , DeFazio told Congress that the entire Homeland Security Committee of the U.S. Congress has been denied access to the plans ( video ; or here is the transcript ) .
He concluded :
Habeas corpus and other fundamental legal safeguards have been abandoned .
More and more people who question the government are being labeled as “ terrorists ” , and people are increasingly falling into black holes and being subject to judicial decisions made by secret bodies no one has even heard of before .
Increasingly , the executive branch is “ above the law ” ( for example , the Attorney General has basically stated that he wo n’t enforce the law ) .
John Conyers has acted like a schizophrenic off his meds by sitting on his hands on impeachment , even though he has said that Bush and Cheney must be impeached .
The corporate media has censored -- or delayed by years -- stories of the government .
While the mainstream American media has always been lousy , it has become exponentially worse since 9/11
No Way
order
not
believe
looked very different from Nazi Germany
looked
already
As pure fiction , imagine that the U.S. government has already implemented its “ continuity of government plans ” .
As you probably know , the continuity of government ( “ COG ” ) plans are contingency plans which create a new government in the case of an alleged threat to the ability of the American government to continue operations .
America 's COG plans were created to deal with nuclear war , but they have been discussed in many other contexts as well .
What would things look like if the COG plans were already being implemented ?
You might ask what could have triggered the implementation of COG plans .
Well , 9/11 and the anthrax attacks would almost certainly qualify as large enough events to trigger COG .
You might also argue that the above scenario is impossible because we would know if continuity of government plans had been implemented .
However , consider that the COG plans themselves maythe media , Congress and everyone else under penalty of treasonto discuss the plans .
Why ?
Because the government can prevent panic and keep control if peoplethat the three branches of government are still functioning .
It is standard operating procedure for governments to underplay the severity of crises , so as to prevent panic .
And if people -- hypothetically – did want to institute martial law , they would be smart enough to institute a police state that .
In this age of media manipulation , social psychology , marketing savvy , and psychological operations , planners of a police state in modern America would want to ensure that itlike America - as - usual , so that people did not realize what was really happening .
Is that why the Homeland Security Committee was denied access to the COG plans ?
Because they included laws ordering people to keep the COG program secret , and to pretend that it was business - as - usual ?
Or because they havebeen implemented ?
Is that why the federal government is basically “ deputizing ” corporations to act as sheriffs in the event of martial law ?
And training pastors to preach obedience to martial law Remember also that provisions of the Homegrown Terrorism are already being implemented , even though the Senate has not yet approved that law ( and see this ) .
How could that happen if COG plans were not in effect ?
Switzerland 's ambassador knew his country had an image problem .
It was in the headlines for the wrong reasons , with the banks being accused of hanging on to Nazi gold , and he wanted to do something positive .
So Bruno Spinner invited some young graffiti artists into the embassy 's underground car park and let them do what they wanted .
They could even have a rave there a few days later , he decided .
The ambassador 's rebranding exercise has had an extraordinary unintended consequence : one of the car park graffiti kids went on to become an artist collected by the rich and famous whose works command eye - popping prices at auction .
The works at the embassy in London are by Banksy and are worth more than £ 1 m .
They are shown here and on the Guardian 's website today for the first time .
There are about 10 pieces obviously by the Bristol - born artist .
The most striking is a montage of 21 mohican - haired Lenins with the words " vulture capitalists " stencilled underneath .
It is on the wall next to the car park exit and has suffered a few noticeable bashes - the consequence of tight underground car park corners .
Other works include a French poodle having a dream - or perhaps a nightmare - about a nasty - looking bulldog - faced poodle .
Another has Mona Lisa with a green rifle sight on her forehead .
Mickey Mouse is there too while one of the car park pillars has a threatening policeman and the words : " Laugh now , but one day we 'll be in charge . "
The Banksys , barring the odd flaking bit of paint , have held up well and have remained a secret known only to regular users of the car park
Spinner 's idea was to get some of the UK and Switzerland 's leading graffiti artists to spraypaint the walls and then have a rave once all the fumes had gone .
The party in 2001 was , a statement from the Swiss embassy said , " part of a series of events organised at the beginning of this century aimed to engage with the next generation of people and artists who will largely shape and determine the future " .
The plan was to whitewash the walls but the embassy was pleased with the results and decided to keep the graffiti .
Switzerland 's current ambassador , Alexis Lautenberg , said : " I was somewhat surprised when I drove in .
The Swiss embassy obviously has many layers .
This seems to be a particularly important and solid one and should be a source of inspiration every time you drive in or out . "
Banksy has , remarkably , managed to keep his " they seek him here , they seek him there " anonymity throughout a career which has seen his fanbase widen and prices of his works rocket .
At Sotheby 's in 2006 a stencil of a green Mona Lisa with paint dripping from her eyes sold for £ 56,700 .
Earlier this month a stencil of a sandwich - board wearing monkey called Laugh Now sold for £ 228,000 at Bonhams .
Banksy's own view of these auctions is probably summed up by a picture he put on his website last year : " I Ca n't Believe You Morons Actually Buy This Shit , " it said .
He also has many celebrity fans .
Damien Hirst is said to collect Banksys .
Angelina Jolie paid £ 200,000 for one and other stars such as Jude Law and Keanu Reeves have been reported as buyers .
The Swiss embassy can probably claim now to have the coolest car park in London so it was appropriate that last night it was used for the launch of the 2008 Your Game scheme , a charitable project run by the BBC and the Football Foundation to help young people who might be at risk of getting involved in gang culture , gun crime or substance abuse .
Caj Sohal , the project founder of Your Game admitted his jaw dropped when he saw the car park .
" We agreed to go there not really thinking it was right but when you go in and see the quality of the work , it 's a perfect fit for our project . "

Dome - shaped feature known as lobate debris apron
The Sharad radar experiment , on Nasa 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) spacecraft made the discovery in the planet 's mid-latitudes .
The ice is found in distinctive geological structures on Mars ' surface that are hundreds of metres thick .
The radar data suggest that some of these features consist mostly of ice .
The latest evidence was presented at the 39th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference here in Houston , Texas .
Sharad ( SHAllow RADar ) is able to probe up to 1 km beneath the Martian surface to seek out liquid or surface water .
We would say , robustly , more than 50 % ice by volume - but it could be much more
Dr Jeff Plaut , JPL
Built and supplied by the Italian Space Agency ( ASI ) , it sends out pulses of radio waves to the Martian surface and analyses the time delay and strength of the waves that return .
Analysis of those waves that penetrate the soil and bounce back can give information on transitions between materials with different properties , such as rock and liquid water , beneath the Martian surface .
Mission scientists used Sharad to probe Martian surface features known as lobate debris aprons ( LDAs ) .
These distinctive , dome - shaped structures are concentrated around mid-latitudes in the planet 's northern and southern hemispheres .
Geological clues
One team of researchers looked at LDAs in the Deuteronilus Mensae region of Mars ' northern hemisphere , where the features can be found at the bases of valley walls , craters and scarps of mesas .
Another group of scientists studied these features in the eastern Hellas region of Mars ' southern hemisphere .
Scientists have long suspected that LDAs were flows consisting of mixed up rock and ice .
The radar penetrated these geological features with very little attenuation ( reduction in signal strength ) , suggesting they were predominantly made of ice .
" We would say , robustly , more than 50 % ice by volume - but it could be much more , " said Dr Jeff Plaut , who presented the Sharad findings from Mars ' northern hemisphere .
Dr Jack Holt , from the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics in Austin , discussed the results from the planet 's southern hemisphere on behalf of his research team .
He told BBC News : " The radar sees through [ an LDA ] with very little attenuation .
The fact that there are n't lots of reflections coming from inside indicates that it 's pretty much massive ice .
" Maybe there is dust and some small rock content mixed in throughout .
But it 's not a lot and it 's not layered .
There 's not much structure to it . "
He added : " There 's a pretty significant amount of water locked up in these things . "
If confirmed , the discoveries could have important implications for the history of water and climate on Mars , because it suggests there were large reservoirs of subsurface ice when the lobate debris aprons formed .
Amazonian times
Dr Plaut said the LDAs he had studied probably formed in mid- to late Amazonian times - the Amazonian being the cold , dry period of Martian history which began around 1.8 billion years ago and lasts to the present day .
" In the mid-latitudes of Mars , there were large volumes of ice that were deforming , at least , during Amazonian times ... and maybe they were in place during Amazonian times .
And much of this ice is preserved today , " explained Dr Plaut , from Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , California .
He suggested these thick ice deposits should be targets for future robotic or manned missions to explore .
" These are certainly intriguing targets for in situ exploration , conveniently placed at mid-latitudes , " the JPL scientist told the conference .
The radar data complemented other evidence presented at the conference on the icy nature of these geological features on Mars .

Months after third parties were able to demonstrate that Comcast was throttling some BitTorrent ( and Lotus Notes , since fixed ) traffic , the cable giant has quietly changed its terms of service .
Comcast updated the ToS on January 25 — the first update in two years , according to company spokesperson Charlie Douglas — to more explicitly spell out its policies on traffic management .
According to Section III of the revised ToS , Comcast " uses reasonable network management practices that are consistent with industry standards . "
The company points out that it is not alone in the practice , saying that " all major " ISPs engage in some form of traffic shaping .
Comcast does it to keep its subscribers from suffering the heartaches of " spam , viruses , security attacks , network congestion , and other risks and degradations of service " and to " deliver the best possible Internet experience to all of its customers . "
The revised language exactly mirrors that of the FCC's 2005 Internet Policy Statement , which allows ISPs to engage in " reasonable network management . "
At the same time , subscribers are entitled to run lawful applications and services , access their choice of lawful content , and hook up any hardware as long as it does n't harm the network .
Not long after Comcast 's traffic management practices came to light , the company was hit with a class - action lawsuit by a disgruntled subscriber .
Online video provider Vuze complained to the FCC , and the Commission officially opened its investigation of the cable company in mid-January .
Since the investigation began , the FCC has been bombarded with comments from angry users .
" If you so much as open a BitTorrent client on a computer on the Comcast network , your entire connection drops to almost a crawl , " says one comment .
Another user : " I have experienced this throttling of bandwidth in sharing open - source software , e.g. Knoppix and Open Office .
Also I see considerable differences in speed ftp sessions vs. html .
They are obviously limiting speed in ftp as well . "
Comcast has denied throttling BitTorrent traffic , saying that the ISP just " delays " or " postpones " it on occasion .
One analogy used by a Comcast executive was that of trying to make a phone call and getting a busy signal for a time , until the call actually goes through .
A more accurate explanation of Comcast 's use of TCP reset packets , to build on the phone analogy , would be talking on the phone with someone and then both of you hearing the other 's voice saying " hang up . "
That 's the effect of the forged reset packets : convincing the BitTorrent clients that the other (s ) have stopped responding .
Douglas told
Ars that the change in the ToS was made to better clarify the company 's policies .
" We updated the terms of service as part of our normal course of business , " he said .
Comcast 's decision to affirm its traffic management practices in the newly revised ToS is a welcome baby step towards greater transparency .
Subscribers ( disclosure : Comcast is my ISP ) would love to see even more transparency from the company , which remains cagey when it comes to its nebulous usage caps as well as what type of traffic is liable to be " delayed . "

THE POWER ELITE PLAYBOOK : POPULATION REDUCTION THROUGH GENOCIDE
PART 6

U.S. foreign policy consistently thwarted any independence movements in Southeast Asia by claiming that it endangered our " national security . "
Meanwhile they backed governments and armies that engaged in profitable drug trafficking .
In addition to U.S. interference in Viet Nam as early as 1945 , top brass at the Pentagon suggested that soldiers and bombers be sent to western Laos in 1959 .
Secret military plans stated that the U.S. government was prepared to use nuclear weapons for these military operations .
Perhaps this is the reason the U.S. refused to sign the Declaration on the Prohibition of the Use of Thermo - Nuclear Weapons in 1961 . [ 1 ]
Biological and chemical weapons were banned on June 17 , 1925 at the Geneva Convention and entered into force on February 8 , 1928 .
However , under Operation Ranch Hand , from 1961 to 1971 , the U.S. , in a historically unprecedented level of chemical warfare , abhorrent when utilized by others , began a full - scale " defoliation " project in Viet Nam .
Defoliation , simply stated , is chemical genocide .
The U.S. indiscriminately sprayed 19,395,369 gallons of poisonous herbicide over 6,465,123 acres and 30,305 square miles ( 1981 figures ) . [ 2 ]
Aircraft , hand sprayers , trucks , helicopters and boats were used for the " defoliation " of the forests and the inhumane destruction of food crops and their distribution .
Monsanto's profitable Agent Orange contains dioxin , one of the most toxic substances ever produced , an irremovable chemical that accumulates in the body of animals and humans . [ 3 ]
Recently released Department of Defense records indicate that the extent of the contamination and concentration was far greater than previously thought .
Viet Nam is the site of the " world 's largest dioxin contamination . "
" At least 2.1 million and as many as 4.8 million people were directly sprayed . "
South Vietnamese forces continued using the toxic chemicals until 1975 .
In addition to objectives in North Viet Nam , areas in Laos and Cambodia were also targeted . [ 4 ]
Our military used 27 times more herbicide than typical domestic applications , used to prevent weed growth . [ 5 ]
" The vestigial effects of chemical warfare poisoning continue to plague the health of adult Vietnamese ( and ex- GIs ) while causing escalated birth defects .
Samples of soil , water , food and body fat of Vietnamese citizens continue to reveal dangerously elevated levels of dioxin to the present day . " [ 6 ]
Dioxin accumulates as it moves up the food chain .
An animal or fish will have a higher concentration than the plants they have consumed . [ 7 ]
Dioxin exposure results in high infant mortality , congenital malformation , miscarriages , and premature birth . [ 8 ]
Compare this to the horrific incidences of the same kind in Afghanistan and Iraq from the current atrocities of radioactive depleted uranium .
While the U.S. government has minimally compensated some U.S. veterans and their affected children , they have yet to compensate their victims in Viet Nam , Korea , or anywhere else . [ 9 ]
In Viet Nam , new generations of Agent Orange victims number at least a million people including fifty thousand children . [ 10 ]
Ngo Dinh Diem , South Viet Nam 's ruthless puppet dictator , behaved according to the Power Elite Playbook .
He replaced the constitution that Ho Chi Minh had proposed for a united Viet Nam .
Ho 's was virtually a carbon copy of America 's constitution .
Dictator Diem 's included Article 98 which prohibited freedom of the press , free speech and other liberties - claiming that these despotic measures would ensure greater security .
His Order 46 stated : " Individuals considered dangerous to the national defense and common security may be confined by executive order to a concentration camp . "
Buddhist monks ( those who did n't immolate themselves in protest ) and nuns were considered especially dangerous ; hundreds were imprisoned . [ 11 ]
By 1963 , the U.S. already had 16,300 military " advisors " in the south and wanted to increase that number .
Diem must have resisted !
Therefore , he was eliminated and replaced by a more cooperative " leader . "
Instead of a bloodless , Kennedy - approved military coup , Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother were assassinated on November 1 , 1963 on the instructions of the very elite W. Averell Harriman ( CFR , Marshall Plan Administrator ) , who deftly managed American policy ( behind the scenes ) for Viet Nam .
CIA operative , E. Howard Hunt , faked cables in an attempt to implicate Kennedy in Ngo Dinh Diem 's assassination . [ 12 ]
Another minion , McGeorge Bundy ( Skull & Bones ) , was National Security Advisor to both Kennedy and Johnson .
His brother William P. Bundy ( Skull & Bones ) , a chief architect of the Viet Nam War , coauthored the Tonkin Gulf Resolution . [ 13 ]
Later William Bundy was a part - time columnist for Newsweek , rotating with George Ball ( Bilderberg , CFR , Under Secretary of State - Johnson administration , Lehman Brothers ) and Zbigniew Brzezinski ( CFR , Trilateral Commission ) . [ 14 ]
At the request of CFR Chairman , David Rockefeller , William Bundy served as editor or the CFR magazine Foreign Affairs from 1972 to 1984 . [ 15 ]
The U.S. government and the media was / is infested and contaminated with parasitic Power Elite agents from the top down !
The other principal , John F. Kennedy , also balked and could n't be sold on a full scale " intervention . "
Rather , he wanted to withdraw troops .
He distrusted the CIA , an " above - the - law organization devoted to protecting the interests of Wall Street .
He had caught the Agency in numerous lies regarding an invasion of Cuba , and had lost all confidence in them . [ 16 ]
Attacking a sovereign nation is against international law and Kennedy was concerned about international repercussions over such an unprovoked attack .
The CIA , taking orders from the Power Elite , proceeded with the " Bay of Pigs " anyway .
Kennedy fired the CIA Director , Allen Dulles , on June 28 , 1961 .
He then signed National Security Action Memoranda , NSAM 55 and NSAM 57 which stripped the CIA of all power . [ 17 ]
Kennedy also rejected Lyman L. Lemnitzer 's ( CFR , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ) Operation Northwoods , the 1962 Department of Defense 's terrorist plan against Cuba .
Operation Northwoods was written in response to a request from the Chief of the Cuba Project , Col. Edward Lansdale , Dulles ' top - notch terrorist in Viet Nam who helped set up the puppet government in Saigon , disseminated propaganda for the Catholic 's mass exodus ( adequately filmed to support the claim that people were fleeing communism ) and participated in the dreaded Phoenix Program , a CIA torture operation directed by William Colby ( CFR ) , the Chief of Station in Saigon .
That program alone killed as many as 70,000 civilians who were even remotely " suspected of being part of the political leadership of the Viet Cong . " [ 18 ]
Three - fourths of South Viet Nam was a " free fire zone " which " justified the murder of virtually anyone in thousands of villages in those vast areas .
At the time , Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara ( CFR , Bilderberg ) cited a 1967 memo in which he estimated the number of Vietnamese civilians killed or seriously injured by U.S. forces at 1000 per week . " [ 19 ]

So , in the same month and same year , two national leaders were assassinated : Diem on November 1 and Kennedy on November 22 , 1963 .
Those who challenge the Power Elite and their associates in their exploitations of third world countries automatically become a threat to " national security . " [ 20 ]
Johnson , Kennedy 's obedient replacement , escalated the war through the false - flag Tonkin Bay attack .
He endorsed Eisenhower 's ( CFR ) devised Domino Theory . [ 21 ]
Kennedy had , for a time , also . [ 22 ]
Despite efforts by the National Security Agency , recently declassified documents were released through the National Archives ( December 1 , 2005 ) .
Documents confirm that there was no second attack on U.S. ships in Tonkin on August 4 , 1964 .
On August 2 , 1964 , North Vietnamese torpedo boats attacked the USS Maddox " under questionable circumstances . "
It may actually have been lightening !
Intelligence was " skewed " with false documents of a second attack on August 4 , 1964 which was used to persuade Congress to approve a retaliatory response .
Evidence of this skewed intelligence was available in 2001 . [ 23 ]
In 1970 , sky high infra-red sensors , developed by Advanced Research Projects Agency ( ARPA ) , an arm of the Pentagon were tested in Viet Nam .
These sensors could detect individuals on the ground .
This was the beginning of the government 's satellite surveillance . [ 24 ]
This technology is selectively beneficial - for government use against citizens .
Did the 9/11 commission , staffed by Power Elite minions , evaluate any satellite evidence ?
Colby assumed the job of Executive Director of CIA in 1971 and was called to testify before Congress that same year .
He cooperated with Congress in an effort to save the Agency but his testimony damaged the CIA 's image .
Other insiders felt that the CIA should not be subject to congressional intrusion .
Colby became CIA Director in 1973 when James Schlesinger ( CFR ) became Secretary of Defense .
Gerald Ford ( CFR , Bilderberg , Master Mason , Warren Commission ) , the nation 's first unelected vice president and president , * as incoming president , reorganized on November 4 , 1975 .
He fired Colby ( who later died under suspicious circumstances ) and replaced him with George H. W. Bush ( Skull & Bones , Bohemian Grove , CFR Director ) at the suggestion of Machiavellian minion Henry Kissinger ( CFR Director 1977 - 1981 , Bohemian Grove , Bilderberger , Trilateral Commission , National Security Advisor 1969 - 1975 , and Secretary of State ( September 22 , 1973 - January 20 , 1977 ) .
Ford appointed Bush as CIA Director during a very crucial time .
The House Select Committee on Assassinations was investigating CIA - FBI links to the murders of John F. Kennedy , Robert Kennedy , and Martin Luther King .
Countless witnesses were conveniently murdered just before their scheduled appearances to testify .
Ford , while on the Warren Commission , secretly reported to FBI Director Hoover on Commission activities .
According to declassified files , Ford admitted that he instructed the Warren Commission to move Kennedy 's back wound up by several inches .
Gerald Ford and Arlen Specter , another member of the Commission , were the cover - up architects and promoted the implausible single bullet theory . [ 25 ]
Ford also fired James Schlesinger and replaced him with Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld ( CFR , Bilderberg ) , the Prince of Poison .
Rumsfeld 's deputy , Richard B. Cheney ( former CFR Director , Trilateral Commission ) , moved up as Chief of Staff .
As further CIA atrocities were revealed , a commission headed by the unelected Vice President Nelson Rockefeller ( appointed to V.P. by the unelected Ford ) was called to investigate in 1975 .
He was recommended by Henry Kissinger .
Naturally , the CIA was cleared of all wrong doing - their considerable crimes were / are carried out for our " national interests . " [ 26 ]
The Power Elite control all commissions and tribunals where they can protect each other , conceal and / or dismiss evidence , suppress witnesses , and incarcerate and quickly kill opponents who could offer conflicting testimony .
" Knowledge is power .
Secrecy insures that knowledge and power are controlled by those controlling the secrets .
If crimes remain secret , there is no punishment , just rewards . " [ 27 ]
Senseless slaughter and destruction continued in Viet Nam until the alleged cease fire agreement on August 14 , 1973 when the southern capital of Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese .
Young men were slaughtered by the South Vietnamese army , a skeleton crew , whose members reported in once a month to sign a pay voucher so " the colonel could pocket the money . "
Half of the remaining helicopters , compliments of U.S. taxpayers , were used to transport heroin . [ 28 ]
Repression and corruption was rampant .
Those who could leave , about three million , fled the country .
In April 1975 , South Viet Nam formally surrendered to North Viet Nam .
Elections in 1956 , as stipulated at Geneva but rejected by the U.S. , would have been easier but that was n't the Power Elite goal - kill as many people in the third world as possible , including the apolitical - those labeled communists but unable to even define the word .
Apparently , according to Washington , the only good communist is a dead communist which is reminiscent of a statement attributed to General Phillip Sheridan :
The only good Indian is a dead Indian . "
So it is tolerable to kill a few million people , as long as they are branded communists ( or terrorists or savages ) ; people are killed , in our name , for our " national security , " simply because they have the misfortune of living in resource - rich areas . [ 29 ]
At the completion of the Cold War Viet Nam experiment there was a series of secretive " peace " conferences in Paris .
Henry Kissinger met with Viet Nam's Le Duc
Tho over a period of two years .
Kissinger , a " genocidist " and " noted war criminal " won the Nobel Peace Prize ( 1973 ) along with Viet Nam's Le Duc
Tho who rejected the award stating that there was no peace in his country . [ 30 ]
Amazing hypocrisy - Kissinger received the Nobel Peace Prize after Viet Nam and the precedent - setting secret bombing of neutral Cambodia over a four year period of time , " to protect Americans in Vietnam .
Since October 1970 the Congress had included in every military appropriation bill a proviso expressly forbidding bombing in Cambodia except for that purpose . " [ 31 ]
Nixon and Kissinger , along with John Negroponte ** ( Kissinger aide , officer in charge of Vietnam at the National Security Council ) arranged a chaos - creating government coup in Cambodia in March 1970 .
Generating further resentment , the U.S. installed Lon Nol who collected millions in U.S. economic aid .
He declared himself Chief of State , Prime Minister and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces after he disbanded the Assembly in October 1971 in order to declare emergency rule .
He then permitted the U.S. to carpet bomb Cambodia . [ 32 ]
Lon Nol retired to Hawaii on April 1 , 1975 with a half million dollars , compliments of the American taxpayers . [ 33 ]
What followed ?
- Pol Pot 's Khmer Rouge , the killing fields , the liquidation of the middle class , famine , the destruction of the economy and concentration camps .
From those Indochina experiments , the Kissinger of Death , Henry , on behalf of President Nixon , oversaw the drafting by the National Security Council of the deadly depopulation plan beginning with Memorandum 200 , to that Council dated April 24 , 1974 and declassified February 8 , 2007 .
The results : The National Security Study Memorandum , NSSM 200 , Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests dated December 10 , 1974 which was adopted as official U.S. policy on November 26 , 1975 with Memorandum 314 by President Ford .
It has not been rescinded .
It was declassified in 1990 under George H. W. Bush when the " American public had grown more tolerant of covert activities overseas . " [ 34 ]
" The purpose of population control was to serve the U.S. strategic , economic , and military interest " at the expense of the developing third world or Lesser Developed Countries ( LDCs ) .
This plan claims that their population growth was / is detrimental and a grave threat to U.S. " national security " in four ways :
1 . Large nations may gain " political power . "
2 . The U.S. and its allies need the " strategic materials " from those countries .
3 . A high birth rate means more young people " who are more likely than older people to challenge global power structures . "
4 . " Population growth in relatively - disadvantaged countries jeopardizes U.S. investments . " [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ]
The Population plan was initially implemented by Brent Scowcroft ( CFR , Vice - Chairman Kissinger Associates ) , National Security Advisor under Ford from 1974 - 1977 and George H. W. Bush from 1989 - 1993 .
CIA Director George H. W. Bush ( November 1975 to January 1977 ) was to assist Scowcroft .
Scowcroft co-authored A World Transformed with George H. W. Bush .
In addition to the National Security Advisor , the Secretaries of the Departments of State , Treasury ( destroy the economy ) , Defense ( kill the citizens ) , and Agriculture ( destroy food ) are responsible for executing the plan .
Each administration determines its own strategy for depopulating the planet .
Need we even ask how the current Bush administration is executing the plan in the Middle East ?

Many Rwandan Catholics believe the Church let them down in 1994
Athanase Seromba had appealed against a 15 - year sentence over the deaths of hundreds of Tutsis who had sought refuge in his church .
But the United Nations - backed tribunal decided he was even more closely involved than previously thought .
Father Seromba was the first Catholic priest to face genocide charges at the court , sitting in Arusha in Tanzania .
He had denied charges that he organised the massacre of 1,500 Tutsis at the church in Nyange in the west of Rwanda .
Prosecutors said that after he ordered the church to be demolished by bulldozers , he sent in militiamen to kill any survivors with machetes and guns .
All those inside the building are said to have died .
The appeal judges ruled that his responsibility went beyond helping and encouraging the killings , which is the basis on which he was originally sentenced in December 2006 .
Some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered in the 1994 killings .
The Cheshire Cat is a fictional cat appearing in Lewis Carroll 's Alice in Wonderland .
It appears and disappears at will , engaging Alice in amusing but sometimes vexing conversation .
The cat sometimes annoy Alice when pointing out philosophical points .
It does , however , appear to cheer her up when it turns up suddenly at the Queen of Hearts ' croquet field , and when sentenced to death baffles everyone by making its body disappear , but its head remain visible , sparking a massive argument between the King , the Queen and the executioner about whether or not something that does not have a body can indeed be beheaded .
At one point , the cat disappears gradually until nothing is left but its grin , prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat .
This has become a point of notability for the cat : most people remember it most strongly performing its vanishing act .
Prion diseases like CJD affect the brain
New Scientist magazine reports the genetic make - up of a 40 - year - old woman who may have died from variant CJD was different from all previous patients .
But the University College London study 's lead researcher said it was too early to say for sure .
And a government advisor on CJD said many cases needed to emerge to confirm a new wave and people should not panic .
There 's certainly no need to panic
Professor Chris Higgins
Chair , SEAC
CJD is a fatal brain condition , with dozens of cases every year .
However , the BSE crisis in cattle in the 1980s and 1990s coincided with the emergence of a new form of the disease , variant CJD .
It is thought that this new form - which has so far been confirmed in only a relatively small number of humans - may have been linked to eating meat infected with BSE , although the human illness often did not emerge until years later .
After a slaughtering programme removed infected cattle from the food chain , deaths from variant CJD were thought to have peaked in the first half of this decade , falling steadily since 2003 .
However , the latest find opens a small possibility that the " incubation period " for some people may be longer , and that there could be a second upsurge in deaths to come .
Gene link
Every person who has died from variant CJD before this point has one thing in common - they carry a gene variant called MM .
About four in 10 people have this variant , and some experts believed it was possible that in humans , only these people may ever have been vulnerable to variant CJD .
The latest death is the first recorded involving a different variant - VV - found in approximately one in 10 Britons .
Lead researcher Dr Simon Mead , from the Prion Unit at University College London , whose work was originally published in the journal Archives of Neurology , said that at the moment it was too early to say whether this signalled the beginning of a rise in cases among other VV carriers exposed to BSE - infected meat .
He said : " We can't say for sure whether this is actually variant CJD , or simply a case of " sporadic " CJD in a younger - than - expected patient - it does not have all the features of either .
" It could be a new type of variant CJD affecting VV people , but we would need to see a lot more cases than at present to confirm this .
" What we are doing at the moment is asking people to stay alert and look out for other cases . "
Evidence lacking
Professor Chris Higgins , the Chair of the government 's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee ( SEAC ) , which advises on variant CJD , played down fears that cases could rise again .
He said : " There 's certainly no need to panic .
This could simply be a case of sporadic CJD , in which case the genetic makeup is irrelevant , as this is found in MM and VV people .
" At the moment there is n't enough evidence to conclude one way or the other .
" We know that it is possible to infect VV mice with variant CJD , but it is actually much harder than infecting MM mice , so even if there were to be a rise , it would not a big rise . "
To date there have been 114 deaths from variant CJD in the UK , with another 47 deaths thought likely to be due to the disease .
Outwit a Mechanic
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Nobody likes to be fleeced by a greedy grease monkey , so arm yourself with knowledge to keep your mechanic from blinding you with science .
Pick up a shop manual or subscribe to an online service like AllDataDIY.com .
Even if you 're stranded , you can still get a second opinion by phoning another shop and asking what it would charge for the same repair .
If possible , hit the Web to price out parts your mechanic needs to replace .
Do n't be afraid to call him out under the guise of clueing him in to a good deal you saw .
On major parts , markups of more than 25 percent should set off alarms .
And ask your mechanic to keep the old pieces so he can show you what broke — for your own education , of course .
This should keep him from faking a problem or from charging you for a new part and then simply repairing your old one .
Use a Slim Jim
If you rock a Nixon - era ride , you can pop the lock with a tool called a Slim Jim .
Here 's how :
1 . Wedge a matchbook or rubber doorstop between the window glass and the outer rubber seal .
This opens a gap to maneuver in without breaking the window or damaging the seal .
2 . Insert your Slim Jim through the gap and feel around behind the keyhole for a plate called the tailpiece .
You need to hook one of the tool 's notches on it .
3 . To unlock the door , you 'll need to either push down or pull up on the Jim .
You 're trying to rotate the tailpiece and turn the lock cylinder .
4 . If it does n't rotate easily , it 's probably one of the modern ones that will snap if forced — rendering the lock useless .
Of course , you can always just smash the window .
Get 50 mpg in a Buick
They do n't call Wayne Gerdes the king of the hypermilers for nothing .
Not only can he pull 200 mpg in a Honda Insight but he can coax 59 miles per from a garden - variety Accord .
Gerdes says no single technique will max your mileage .
You need the whole toolbox : No brakes !
In traffic , maintain a slow creep instead of accelerating and braking .
Ignore the horns .
Drive with the engine off .
Shift into neutral , turn your key back a notch so the engine shuts down , then forward a click , so you can still have lights .
Draft .
Gerdes urged us not to reveal this ( dangerous ) move .
But we trust you :
Inch up behind , say , an 18 - wheeler , and kill the engine as you enter its slipstream ( you 'll feel it ) .
You 're drafting now , getting pulled along by the truck 's gas instead of your own .
Wire Your Car Stereo for an iPod
Driving with your headphones on is dangerous , and those FM adapters blow .
Good thing it 's easy to install an auxiliary jack that you can plug directly into your MP3 player .
1. Rip it out Most dash panels attach with screws or clips , so if you can't find screws , try pulling carefully or prying at the sides with a flathead screwdriver .
Wrap the tip with tape to avoid scratches .
2 . Find aux input Most aftermarket stereos have RCA jacks — those red and white female connectors — at the back for hooking up extra audio sources .
Some factory - installed ones have 'em for a CD changer or satellite radio input .
For some models you might need a special adapter , but it 's gettable ( Internet ! ) .
3. Install a cable Ask the guys at RadioShack for a Y cable .
This will connect those RCA jacks to your iPod 's 3.5 - mm stereo jack .
4 . Find your spot
Plug the cable into the RCA jacks and snake the plug to a convenient location — like inside the glove box or popping up from center console .
( Be sure to leave some slack . )
Do n't drill any holes if you ever want to sell the car .
5 . Put it back Replace the dash panel .
Be careful not to crimp the new wires .
Change Your Oil
You do n't need the Apple genius bar to swap out your RAM , so why waste $ 50 at Greasy Lube when you can swap out your own sludge ?
Lift the car .
Never trust a jack — drop $ 30 on a set of stands or ramps instead .
Position a catch tub under the oil pan and unscrew the drain plug .
Remove the oil filter .
You should be able to loosen it by hand , but if you 're too much of a wuss , you can buy a $ 5 oil filter wrench at any auto parts store .
Smear some clean oil onto the new filter 's rubber seal and screw it into place .
Hand - tighten it only — if you strip the threads it 'll cost a mint in repairs .
Reinstall the drain plug and pour in the new stuff .
Your manual knows what kind to use and how much .
Run your car for 30 seconds to circulate the oil .
Then check the dipstick to gauge the level .
Remember : Overfilling is just as bad as underfilling .
Recycle !
Most auto parts chains or repair shops should take the old sludge off your hands and not charge you a dime .
Make a Glowstick
Ingredients : 2 liters distilled water , 50 milliliters hydrogen peroxide ( 3 percent concentration ) , 0.2 gram luminol , 4 grams sodium carbonate , 0.4 gram copper sulfate pentahydrate , 0.5 gram ammonium carbonate .
You can order the chemicals online at Science Stuff .
In a medium - size mixing bowl ( fig. 1 ) , add the hydrogen peroxide to 1 liter of water .
In another bowl , dissolve the luminol , sodium carbonate , copper sulfate , and ammonium carbonate in the second liter of water .
Lay out a few sealable , clear containers — test tubes with stoppers or Nalgene bottles are good .
Pour in equal measures of each solution ( fig. 2 ) — and watch with glee as it lights up ( fig. 3 ) .
The hydrogen peroxide solution oxidizes the luminol , producing 3 - amino phthalic acid .
As its electrons settle to a more sedate quantum state , they emit photons at wavelengths between 430 and 470 nanometers — purplish blue .
Camp With Less Gear
Being a hardcore backcountry trekker requires a tolerance for discomfort .
We do n't have that .
Les Stroud , star of TV's Survivorman , does .
So we asked him for the secret to toughing it in the wild .
His answer :
Do n't take a lot of stuff — just take the right stuff .
What 's that ?
Start with a butane lighter or flint - and - striker kit to make a fire — first priority is staying warm , dry , and fed .
A light tarp will suffice for shelter .
You 'll need a flashlight to set up camp at night .
And bring at least two full sets of layered clothing ( one you wear , one in a water proof bag ) , so you always have dry duds .
If you 're going to rely on finding your food , fishing is more dependable than hunting and gathering ; bring a good collapsible rod and a set of lures ( you can forage for bait ) .
You 'll want a small camping pot to boil stream water .
Look for one with a locking lid and a hook so you can suspend it from a tripod over a fire .
Oh , and bring a friend .
There 's an undeniable romance in braving the wilderness alone , but a buddy can save your life if something goes wrong .
And anyway , the best trips are usually the ones you share .

Decorate Like a Pro
Why does n't your apartment look like those fancy TV houses ?
Because you can't afford Todd Oldham , the celebrity - designer host of TV's Top Design .
We pinged him for some tips .
1 . Mix two shades .
The laws of interior design say you should never mix different shades of the same color — especially not green .
Ignore them .
Trimming a pastel with a darker tint says confident , not clueless .
2 . Think big .
Do n't pick small pieces for small spaces ; that creates clutter .
Instead , stretch the visual space with one or two large items — like an oversize headboard .
" Fewer gestures is a great idea , especially in bedrooms , " Oldham says .
3 . Show some wires .
People do ugly things trying to hide their cables and cords .
But in a clean space , a few exposed wires just make the place look lived in .
4 . Work the walls .
If you 're renting , think of your security deposit as a " creativity fee " — and then go to town .
For example , use strips of adhesive shelf paper ( especially wood grains ) on your kitchen walls and cabinets to make a motif that brings the space together .
5 . Be crafty .
If you 're stuck with fluorescents — " the ugliest light in the world , " Oldham says — sheath them in plastic tubing to create the " poor man 's neon . "
Or try leaving half the tube exposed and alternating 6 - inch strips of pink and orange over the other half .
" It 'll look like it 's always 5 o'clock in your house . "

Life is too short to let indecision or inexperience cut into your drinking .
When you belly up to the bar , it 's go time .
1 . Watch your timing .
Friday night when the bar is four people deep is not the moment to admire the flavored vodka selection .
This is n't a social call ; this is business .
2 . Know what you want .
Unless you 're getting wine , do not ask for recommendations .

Get Backstage at a Concert
Finally , you 've made it to the show of your dreams .
Now it 's time to meet the band .
If you 're not a groupie or a music biz insider , there 's only one surefire way to get behind the scenes :
Woo the opening act .
Before the show , do your research by checking out the opener 's Web site and label .
Actually , you know , listen to their music so you have something to say about it .
Show up in time to see their set , and be enthusiastic about their performance .
Often , the opening act heads to the show floor to watch the headliner .
This is your chance .
Start with a compliment , but do n't get all freaky or stalker -y .
Offer them something — controlled substances , including but not limited to tobacco and alcohol , will quickly endear you to many musicians , or so we are told .
Here 's the key move :

When they return backstage to pack up , offer to lend a hand .
Once you 're in , you 're in .
Bake a Wii Cake
You rock at Wii Sports , but Wii baking ?
That takes a little more practice — especially if you want to make a ginormous cake like the one on our cover .
Here are a few pointers for creating the perfect confectionery console .
Serve with Mii sugar cookies and chocolate milk for extra points .
1. Prepare two sheet cakes , but — critical tip — omit the baking soda .
You 're building narrow and high , so you need dense , structural material .
Chill overnight in the refrigerator .
2 . Carve the rough shapes of the Wii , the base , and the remote , and stand the Wii piece upright .
While they 're still separate , frost everything with butter cream icing ( heavy on the egg whites ) .
Let dry .
Chill for an hour in the freezer .
Then — second critical tip — give the Wii another coat of buttercream for more solidity .
3 . Place the base on a serving platter .
Roll out fondant icing to a quarter - inch thick and drape it over the base , then trim .
Fold fondant around the remote , too , and trim .
4 . Make buttons out of fondant cutouts , stuck on with melted chocolate .
Or use buttercream instead , piping it on with a round - tipped pastry bag .
5 . Use metallic luster dust dissolved in a little orange or lemon extract to paint on your arrows and writing .
Or use a little melted chocolate .
Let dry for half an hour .
6 . Third critical tip : Internal reinforcement is key .
Insert straws ( trimmed to below the frosting line ) inside the base to add rebar - like strength .
Put the Wii on top of the base and poke dowels or a few more straws vertically through the whole thing .
7 . Do not eat !
Your Wii cake is full of sticks and , absent the baking soda , will taste like old Atari cartridges .
Make Ice Cream Like a Mad Scientist
Ingredients : 3 liters liquid nitrogen , 1 pint heavy cream , 1 pint milk , cup sugar , vanilla , fruit puree or other flavors of your choosing .
1 . Buy the liquid N 2 ( $ 25 ) from an industrial gas supply company .
Or cadge some off your friendly neighborhood scientist — they 've got that stuff on tap , and they 'll have the container to keep it at minus 320.4 degrees Fahrenheit .
Do n't touch the nitrogen !
It 's frostbite in a can .
2 . Mix the sugar into the milk and cream .
Add fruit , jam , chocolate , whatever .
Try flash - freezing drops of flavoring in the N 2 and adding the resulting chunks to the mix .
3 . Pour the milk mixture into the bowl of a standard 6 - quart mixer set on the lowest speed .
Slowly add the N 2 .
Cackle as huge clouds of cold - sublimating gas billow forth .
After about 5 minutes , the mix will turn stiff , light , and creamy - looking .
Eat .

Abraham rides a horse out of an explosion to save Lot .
Og , king of Bashan , looms like an early Darth Vader .
The Sermon on the Mount did not make the book , though , because there was not enough action to it .
The Manga Bible sold 30,000 copies in Great Britain , according to Doubleday .
The print run in this country is 15,000 , and it sells for $ 12.95 .
Mr. Akinsiku , 42 , who uses the pen name Siku , grew up in England and Nigeria in an Anglican family of Nigerian descent .
He recently graduated from theology school in London .
For years , he has worked as an artist , and a rendering of the Bible was the best way of glorifying God , he said in a telephone interview from London .
While younger adults and teenagers are the most avid consumers of manga , Mr. Akinsiku said he had heard from grandmothers who picked up the book as a gift for their grandchildren .
The book is meant to be a first taste of the Bible , which many feel too intimidated to read , Mr. Akinsiku said .
Every few pages , a small tab refers to the biblical verses the action covers .
“ For the unchurched , the book is to show that this thing , the Bible , is still relevant , ” he said , “ because it talks about what human beings do when they encounter God . ”
This much , at least , is certain : Jamie Lynn Spears , the 16 - year - old star of the Nickelodeon series “ Zoey 101 , ” is pregnant .
( Or the British tabloid OK ! , which paid a reported $ 1 million to announce the fact , will be wanting its money back . )
As to just when and with whom , rumors keep arising to buffet what were yesterday asserted as facts .
It is a fluid story whose meaning keeps changing as new grist is poured into the gossips ’ mill .
There are a lot of pregnant teenagers in this country -- more than in any other developed nation -- and many more are having sex and not getting pregnant , of course , or getting anyone pregnant .
In that context , Spears ’ situation is regrettable but not unusual and , almost by definition , not unnatural .
You will decide for yourself whether it is immoral or whether it is your business to decide that at all .
But Jamie Lynn Spears is also a teenager on a hit television show -- as of November , the No. 1 series among viewers 9 to 14 -- and the sister of Britney Spears , whose capacity for calamity is matched only by everyone else ’s desire to read about it ; with her sister and her manager - mother , Lynne Spears , she ’s part of the larger , strange story of a family that , from a distance , seems remarkably oblivious to its own dysfunction .
And although she is surely not the only sexually active teenage tween idol , she ’s the one who ’s having a baby .
Even in this she is not quite unique .
In October 2006 , New Zealand actress Keisha Castle - Hughes , then 16 and Oscar - nominated three years earlier for “ Whale Rider , ” announced that she was pregnant .
( She had just finished playing the Virgin Mary in “ The Nativity Story , ” appropriately . )
Castle - Hughes declared herself to be happy , had her baby and went back to work .
But Spears is a different sort of actress -- she ’s more of a brand in a franchised world , inseparable from the single role she ’s played for the last three years and from all the young heads in which she and Zoey live intermingled .
So it is also a story about Our Children and , by extension , Our Nation , blogged and reported and op - edited to a fare thee well .
( I am on the verge of apologizing for bringing it up again . )
It is also a business story pierced by a health crisis , a tale of money and morals and even public policy , somewhere deep inside of which resides an actual girl who , through some combination of thought and action , of thoughtlessness and inaction , is with child .
Nickelodeon has been supportive of the actress while remaining silent as to their shared future .
While speculators speculate as to whether the network will air the fourth season of “ Zoey 101 " -- already completed and planned as the last -- they are continuing to air the third and have been heavily promoting the now ironically titled season - ending special , “ Goodbye , Zoey , ” in which Spears ’ character decides whether to stay at her boarding school or move to London with her parents .
“ There ’s something I got to talk to you about , ” Spears says in the trailer , with unintended resonance .
Over the past year , Jamie Lynn has come to be seen as the anti-Britney , the Spears who could .
A first - time offender , as it were , who seemed heretofore a responsible citizen , her few public statements on the pregnancy comprise a measured taking of responsibility , without the kind of craven apology that often accompanies such events .
She remains , for the moment , in most versions of this story , a sympathetic character , even a victim : of show business itself ( which , “ sources say , ” she was never that interested in to begin with ) ; of the rumored “ older man ” for whom official father - to - be and possibly ex-boyfriend Casey Aldridge is theoretically taking the fall ; and of her mother , of whom one may say at least she is engaged ( as putative protector and factual exploiter ) in a troubling conflict of interest .
“ I want to be known as a good actress , ” Spears told Newsweek not long before crisis management became her main occupation .
For some , the story will be one of sinning against her own stardom , of throwing away not her life but her livelihood .
But there ’s no reason to think she ’s finished .
Drew Barrymore was in rehab by 13 , after all .
One poster on the still - active “ Zoey 101 " message board at Nick.com , wrote , “ She might be back in a couple of years we all love her and wish her well right so do n’t be sad . ”
And Jamie Lynn ( or some proxy ) left a last note herself , on her own website , three long months ago when she was still , to all appearances , a child :
“ Sept. 26 , Hey ya’ll ,
“ Right now I ’m getting ready for the US Weekly ‘ Hot Hollywood ’ event tonight .
I ’m so excited because I was nominated for an award at the event !
I ’m going to post some pics as soon as I can !
Other than that , I ’ve just been really busy with school .
Well , keep an eye out for those pics !
TTYL ! ”

( 2 ) acting pursuant to the Constitution and Public Law 107- 243 is consistent with the United States and other countries continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations , including those nations , organizations , or persons who planned , authorized , committed , or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 .
Tortured Logic
who
A CIA memo written on October 2 , 2002 , concluded there is “ incontrovertible evidence that there is support for these terrorists within the Saudi government ” ( page 169 )
28 pages of the Congressional Joint Inquiry 's report were blacked out and classified ( the redacted portions supposedly include funding by Saudi Arabia of the hijackers )
In addition , Saudi intelligence was " actively following " most of the September 11 , 2001 , plotters " with precision " prior to the attacks
According to a Pakistani weekly newspaper , Pakistan bribed the 9/11 Commission to remove damaging information linking Pakistan to 9/11
According to the president of Pakistan , one of the one of the main perpetrators of 9/11 worked for British intelligence
The former president of Italy said that Israeli and other western intelligence services were behind the 9/11 attack

Spying and Loss of Liberties
Is History Repeating ?
root
Conclusion
should have been
Some people argue that questioning 9/11 is a waste of time -- which distracts us from the manyproblems our country is facing .
There 's the economic downturn , the Iraq war , terrorist threats , loss of liberties and a lot of other problems that need fixing .
So stop wasting time and distracting everyone with all this stuff about 9/11 , right ?
Well , before I address that argument , let me ask you one question : how did we ?
How did we get into the economic downturn , the Iraq war , the war on terror , spying and the loss of liberties , and the other problems ?
Let 's start with Iraq .
Why are we in Iraq ?
WMDs , you say !
Actually , President Bush 's March 18 , 2003 letter to Congress authorizing the use of force against Iraq , includes the following paragraph .
In other words , it was actually the White House 's false linkage of Iraq and 9/11 which allowed the Bush administration to claim that Congress had voted for the Iraq war .
So looking at who was actually behind 9/11 ( not Saddam Hussein ) is important in connection with the Iraq war .
Likewise , torture is based upon the belief that we can stop future acts of terrorism if we get information from bad guys , and that torture is a good way to get that information .
What has allowed Americans to accept torture - something that runs contrary to traditional American values ?
9/11 .
The September 11th attacks scared Americans into think that terrorists were out to get us , and that we had to get tough to stop them .
But knowingreally attacked us is important if we are to stop them , right ?
Remember the old saying : " You have to know your enemy to beat him " ?
The following facts are therefore important : ( See also this video ) .
Without even going into the claims by many high - level military leaders , intelligence officials , scientists , engineers and others that rogue elements within the U.S. government aided and abetted the 9/11 attack , it is clear from the above - described claims that agovernment may have done so .
It would thus be important to determine which government or governmentsinvolved , so that we know who to interrogate .
Does n't that make sense ?
( Note :
It is beyond the scope of this essay to discuss the fact that the government has overblown the entire terror threat , or that torture does n't actually work ) .
Until we determine with certainly which governments or nationalities were actually behind 9/11 , then how can we determine which countries we should treat as close allies and which countries we should treat as enemies ?
The economy is on everyone 's mind right now .
What possible connection can there be between the economy and 9/11 -- when 9/11 occurred years ago ?
Well , many top economists - such as Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz - say that the high cost of war in Iraqof the current slowdown in the U.S.
Therefore , if the false linkage of Iraq and 9/11 was the reason Congress " authorized " war , and if the war is the reason for the current economic downturn , then false statements about 9/11 are one of the reasons our country is currently in an economic slump .
The government claims that it is spying on Americans and otherwise curtailing our rights because it is a new , " post - 9/11 world " , and they have to keep us safe .
The government is spending many billions of dollars to carry out its spying and other supposed anti-terror programs .
( It is beyond the scope of this essay to go into detail about the fact that the government 's spying on Americans began before 9/11 -- confirmed here and here -- or that many other programs related to the " war on terror " including the drafting of the Patriot Act , actually commenced before 9/11 ) .
Would n't the spying and anti-terror programs be more effective if we had confidence in who we should be watching out for ?
By way of analogy , let 's say that the spying efforts had been justified on the anthrax attacks which occurred shortly after 9/11 .
Because the letters which contained the anthrax sounded like they were written by a radical Muslim , a spying program based on the anthrax attacks would probably focus on arabic folks , right ?
Well , it is now beyond dispute that the anthrax actually came from a U.S. military base and was of a type that can only be manufactured by the military Similarly , if we want to protect America , would n't it make sense that we'd want to be 100 % certain we know who was behind 9/11 ?
Imagine , if you would , that you were a citizen in Germany right after the Reichstag fire had occurred .
As you might know , the Reichstag fire was the burning down of the German parliament building by Hitler 's men , which was then blamed on the communists in order to justify wars against neighboring countries .
See this History Channel video ( if you have trouble playing the clip , it is because the website hosting the clip requires you to download the clip before playing it ) .
Similarly , the Nazis , in Operation Himmler , staged murder on their own people and attacks on their own resources which they blamed on the Poles , to justify the invasion of Poland .
Do you believe you could have stopped the government from torturing communists after the Reichstag fire , by convincing people that Germans are a good people who do not torture others ?
Do you think that you could have prevented the spread of disinformation about the hostile intentions and military capabilities ?
Do you imagine you could have stopped the brownshirts and loss of domestic rights ?
I believe not , not without first exposing that the Reichstag fire - the single thing which allowed the German parliament and other institutions to hand Hitler total power .
The German 's were in shock , and rallied around their " strong " leader .
Or not exposing that Operation Himmler -- the event which caused the German people to rally around the invasion of Poland -- was a false flag operation .
Similarly , Americans are crazed by the fear of Arab terrorists just like Germans were terrified of communist and Polish terrorists .
Both peoples have handed over all of their power to their leaders in order to buy an imaginary security .
Both peoples have forgotten to look at thecauses of their troubles , and have thus let themselves be manipulated and repressed .
Given the fact that the Iraq war , the war on terror , the economic downturn , torture , spying and other loss of liberties all have strong connections to 9/11 , any reasonable person must conclude that knowing with certainty exactly what happened on September 11th is vital for America .
As vital as investigating the Reichstag fire and Operation Himmlerfor the German people .
Will we make the same mistakes that the German people did , by trying to fight with the surface manifestations of their problems ?
Or will we investigate the root cause of our problems , the place where our country lost its way , the justification for all of the bad things which are happening to us and which our government is doing : September 11th ?
The choice is ours .
During the two year investigation into The Pirate Bay , several people connected to the site were questioned .
The Swedish police allegedly used some of the harshest ( Jack Bauer like ) interrogation tactics to get them to talk , with surprising results .
When The Pirate Bay was raided back in 2006 , three men were brought in for questioning , and the interrogations continued in the months that followed .
The police ’s goal was obviously to let the people behind the site confess to something they did n’t do .
This led to a series of the most hilarious interrogation transcripts I ’ve ever read .
Not surprisingly , “ the confessions ” of the Pirate Bay three did n’t help the police much .
Earlier this week , the Swedish prosecutor HÃ¥kan Roswall charged four individuals involved with The Pirate Bay for “ assisting copyright infringement ” .
Actually , this is a surprisingly mild accusation if you consider that he called the Pirate Bay “ terrorists ” only a few months ago .
The response of Brokep ’s lawyer sums it up quite nicely : “ My client will plead not guilty , but i’m not sure if what he ’s being charged with , is a crime at all , ” he said .
Below you can read some of the transcripts of the interrogations of Brokep , Anakata and TiAMO , translated from a Swedish article published by IDG.se. ( thanks Jens and Billy )
Brokep
I : Interrogator
B : Brokep ( Peter Sunde )
I : You are under suspicion of assisting copyright infringement between 2005 - 07- 01 – 2006 - 05 - 31 by running and maintaining The Pirate Bay , and thereby assisting in other peoples ’ copyright infringement .
Another accusation is conspiracy to commit copyright infringement during the same period of time .
This has been done through The Pirate Bay where a large amount of so called torrents of copyrighted files or content are made available .
It ’s customary to ask the person being interrogated if he admits or denies committing a crime ?
B : I deny .
I : You deny .
B : Definitely !
I : Yes .
And this thing with The Pirate Bay .
I do n’t know your position on anything about what you have been accused of , but I say you are one of the people who run this site , The Pirate Bay .
What do you say about that ?
B : I have no comment .
I : Why not ?
B : I do n’t want to make a statement about it .
I : What do you want to make a statement about ?
B : I ’ll probably not make statements about very much .
I : Okay .
Then what are we doing here ?
B : Well it was you who wanted to ( not recognizable , laugh ) interrogate me .
I : Yes , because you have the opportunity to explain you ideological position .
B : But I think …
I : .. the purpose of The Pirate Bay etc .
B : Oh , well I do n’t think my ideology has anything to do with an interrogation .
My ideology and my views on things are …
Well it ’s my political opinion and I can keep that to myself .
I : I ’m not asking about your political opinion , I ’m asking about your stance on … .
B : But I think copyright is a political issue .
So if you ask me about my opinion on a copyright policy issue , I will answer that I do n’t wish to make a statement on my policy and my political views .

Anakata
I : Interrogator
A : Anakata ( Gottfrid Svartholm )
I : Well !
What do you know about this site , The Pirate Bay ?
A : Well it is a site .
I : Yes …what is it ?
A : Yes bits and trackers and related services .
I : What is your part in this site ?
A : No comment !
I : No. Anakata – Who is that ?
A : No comment !
I : No .
Do you know how long this has been going on , The Pirate Bay ?
A : Like a couple of years !
I : Were you involved in starting it ?
A : No comment ?
I : No , I will ask a lot of questions !
A : Okay , you will have to annoy me then !
I : Do you have any idea how many users per day The Pirate Bay gets ?
A : No comment !
I : Do you have any idea who maintains the homepage ?
A : No comment !
I : How can one translate the word tracker ?
( Note : same in Swedish )
A : It is not possible to translate .
[…]
I : Okay !
Is there anything else that you want to say , that we might find valuable to know ?
A : No ! Yes … there … you can tell Roswall that he is a damn clown , he can … can stop abusing the judicial system !!!
I : You have said this before !
A : Yes .
It is the third or fourth time i have said it !
I : Okay !
A : I said it in the media earlier !
I : Well !
Then I will end the interrogation at 12.25 .
[…]
In a later interrogation Anakata was questioned about an interview with IDG .
I : Okay .
During last year , or maybe it was this year , there was an interview in the Hot chair at IDG where you talked openly about The Pirate Bay ’s operation .
Have you got any comments on ..( interrupted )
A : No ! No comment .
I : Is it correct that you where in this ..( interrupted )
A : No comment !
I : …interview .
Okay .
I : We have been talking about this nickname Anakata , and we still claim that is you .
A : No comment !
I : You do n’t want to comment on that either .
Okay , then lets move on and make this effective instead !

TiAMO
I : Interrogator
T : TiAMO ( Fredrik Neij )
I : This has been a police investigation for a long time .
The prosecutor ’s case is one of copyright infringement , assisting in copyright infringement and conspiracy to commit copyright infringement .
What is your position on this ?
T : That he is wrong .
That if we are guilty , then Google is guilty too .
I : You mean you can compare Google to The Pirate Bay ?
T : Almost .
I : What the difference between them ?
T : Well …
One difference is that you can upload torrents on The Pirate Bay , but it ’s really the same thing because if you have a site with copyrighted material , you can add the link to be indexed on Google .
It ’s the same level as both sites are handling user - generated material .
We do n’t have any views on what the content is , we just provide a search engine .
I : But these torrents ..
Uhm ..
I do n’t know what it is in plural ( ED :
The word “ torrent ” sounds weird in plural in Swedish )
T : Files of meta data ..
I : Yes , I know but what … torrents .
If we talk about torrents as more than one , they actually end up on The Pirate Bay ’s servers .
That ’s different to Google ?
T : But in the same way it ’s … we have a torrent file that is a reference to the material .
Someone who only uses a meta link and does n’t host the file but the file is still available on the filesharing network .
Should that be less illegal or more legal ?
Just because you store the binary data for the hash file locally on a server ?
I : But that ’s more than Google provides .
They only provide a link in that case .
While a user or a specific computer in another network provides with the actual … meta data .
That has nothing to do with …
T : But then you had to decide whether meta data in itself is illegal or not .
I : But surely it ’s not !
T : No .
I : I do n’t believe so either , but the summary I mentioned , assisting to commit a crime , that is supplying or owning certain things that can be used for a crime .
In this case , it ’s providing a tracker , providing a collection of torrent files , you have …
It ’s about a search engine and so on .
That ’s more than Google does ?
T : Yes
I : And furthermore there was a change of legislation July 1 2005 , which means the copyright law has been made tougher than before .
I do n’t know if you are familiar with the mp3 trial that many refer to in this context , that it is not permitted to link to copyrighted material ?
T : Yes .
I : That sentence may be obsolete now , it ’s not relevant anymore since the legislation has changed .
That ’s the foundation of the crime we investigate today .
So this thing with Google , it is n’t quite the same thing .
T : I still do n’t believe the way we have interpreted it , and we have consulted law people on this .
They say that torrent files are not illegal and providing them is not illegal .
Since we have n’t actively encouraged the users to upload copyrighted movies and not ( not recognizable ) .
We have n’t said anything .
We have created an empty site where the only condition was that you cannot upload something where content does n’t match the description , or if it blatantly is criminal in Sweden .
I : But at the same time , you ridicule Microsoft etcetera on another page of The Pirate Bay ?
T : That ’s because they try to apply US laws to Sweden .
I : Yes , but what they are really doing is making you aware that there is copyright infringing content on the site .
T : Yes .
I : It comes as no surprise to you that such content is available there ?
T : No ..
I : So you are not unaware that there is copyright infringing content , but still you chose to remain passive and not remove it ?
T : There are links to copyrighted content !
I : Yes exactly , there are links to copyrighted content !
T : Yes .
I : And you are aware of this ?
T : We have always had the policy not to interfere with the content on the site .
I : Ok .
T : Since the site was created by PiratbyrÃ¥n , who stand for free speech and freedom to share without some bully trying to interfere , the policy ( not recognizable )
I : That ’s what we have left here ( not recognizable ) .
You say yourself that PiratbyrÃ¥n is not a part of it anymore and that the ideological thing has faded during later years ?
T : Yes , but I believe Gottfrid for example is ideologically in line with PiratbyrÃ¥n .
Peter as well .
I : And you are n’t ?
T : I agree with much of what they say , but it ’s not like I would go out on a cold rainy autumn day and protest with a sign against something ( not recognizable )

Yesterday , DS2 , a leading provider of chipsets for powerline networking devices , hosted a demonstration of its next - generation equipment for the press and financial analysts .
The hardware was impressive , handling data at sustained rates of well over 400 M bps while maintaining backwards compatibility with earlier generations of the company 's hardware .
But , while powerline networking is a promising solution for a number of problems , there are some substantial challenges to its adoption by the broader market .
Built for speed
DS2 , based in Valencia , designs the processors and creates integrated chipsets that enable OEMs to produce networking solutions ; they do n't actually sell end - user hardware themselves .
The previous generation DS2 chipset , introduced four years ago , enabled communications at 200 M bps over standard power lines .
That generation has been widely deployed by European telcos , and displaces earlier equipment in consumer hardware .
The new generation doubles the bandwidth to 400 M bits a second .
Even after control , error correction , and quality of service information are subtracted , the end users will have access to well over 200 Mbps of usable bandwidth .
That 's double 100 - BaseT Ethernet and better than 802.11n can do under most conditions .
The demonstration hardware came in a carrying case that was roughly the size of an unabridged dictionary .
It was shown handling data transfers at 230 Mbits / s between two laptops , happily sending its signal through surge protectors and power strips .
Hopefully , production units will be more compact than DS2's test equipment
DS2 has ensured that its hardware is backwards compatible with earlier products , and showed the new device talking to current consumer wallplug adapters at about 100 Mbps .
In contrast to wireless solutions , where the presence of earlier hardware pulls the entire network down to its level , each device on a powerline network negotiates its connections independently .
Thus , a 400 M bps device can communicate at full speed with whatever generation hardware is present .
The presentation emphasized other advantages over wireless .
802.11 hardware constantly has to readjust its signal and contend with environments ( such as New York City , where the demo took place ) with many other wireless signals .
As a result , data transfer using 802.11n was erratic ; in contrast , the powerline transfer shot up to full speed and stayed there .
DS2 also implied that differences in the underlying technology meant that powerline data transmission had fewer limitations for future bandwidth increases — they have a lead over wireless , and expected to keep it .
DS2 's hardware will also come with some niceties on the software side .
256 - bit AES encryption will be handled on the fly , and wo n't limit transmission speeds in any way .
Pairing devices for encryption is vaguely similar to the process of pairing a phone with a Bluetooth headset .
The chipset will also host a lightweight , POSIX - compliant operating system that will allow remote management ; they demonstrated it hosting a web server that displayed performance data .
Although the hardware is primarily being sold through its use of powerlines for data transmission , it will also work over coaxial cables and twisted - pair wiring , adding to the flexibility of its deployment .
Who needs the speed ?
It 's pretty easy to view 400 M bps as overkill , but the company 's CEO , Jorge Blasco , did his best to argue otherwise .
He pointed out that , four years ago when the 200 M bps hardware was introduced , everyone viewed that as excessive .
Due to market realities , however , the 200 M bps equipment has only recently reached the point where it represented the majority of the powerline hardware sold .
They want the hardware on the market as soon as possible , so that it 's common and cheap by the time that bandwidth needs catch up .
Besides , Blasco said , " speed is never high enough if you can deliver it at the right cost . "
Planning for the adoption curve : NPD Group data shows that it takes some time for new equipment to displace earlier generations .
DS2 also has some pretty clear ideas of what will drive future bandwidth needs : delivery of HD content and IPTV .
Chano Gomez , one of the company 's VPs , expects HD movie downloads " very soon , " and highlighted IPTV self - install kits offered by BT that include powerline hardware .
According to DS2 , the new hardware will allow IPTV providers to send 10 HD channels down the pipes simultaneously .
Gomez also suggested that 400 M bps hardware would be even more critical once content makes its way inside the home , as home networks are going to need roughly three times the bandwidth of their connection to the outside world .
That 's because of centralized storage devices , such as HD - DVRs and NAS boxes , that are going to need to be able to send HD streams to several locations in the house while simultaneously supporting computer backups and internet access .
Suddenly , 400 M bps does n't seem like overkill .
Remaining barriers
So , why are n't we all using powerline network equipment ?
In Europe , DS2 equipment is used by telcos serving a total of nearly 400 million customers , but they are very unevenly distributed : over half are customers of the Spanish company Telefonica .
The presentation did not indicate how many of them relied directly on DS2 equipment , however .
In the US , regulations can vary from state to state ; in some cases , power companies are prohibited from using their wiring for anything other than the delivery of power .
On the national level , the FCC already considers powerline broadband to be just another information service , so the states appear to be the big hold up .
For the home user , cost of equipment has been a major factor .
802.11 hardware is good enough for most common uses , and its volume of sales and bundling as standard hardware have caused prices of even the most current equipment to drop rapidly .
A set of four powerline adapters , in contrast , can run well over $ 100 .
That situation is unlikely to change until bandwidth needs outpace 802.11 's capacity .
Performance has been disappointing as well .
Some of the recent HomePlug AV powerline networking equipment we 've tested at the Orbiting HQ has failed to impress , with speeds lagging 802.11g , let alone 802.11n .
Worse still for both consumers and ISPs are compatibility problems among the equipment from the three main providers — the DS2 execs were happy to point out that some of their competitors make equipment that 's not even compatible with their own earlier generations , much less anyone else 's .
DS2 is trying to work with the IEEE to define a powerline standard , but the proposal currently under consideration would allow different " flavors " of the standard that remain incompatible .
As things stand now , however , buying equipment from different companies can be a crapshoot .
1 « The Effect of Country Music on Suicide »
( S. Stack and J. Gundlach ; Wayne State University and Auburn University ; 1992 )
“ The greater the airtime devoted to country music , the greater the white suicide rate ”
According to the authors , Steven Stack and Jim Gundlach , the paper “ assesses the link between country music and metropolitan suicide rates .
Country music is hypothesized to nurture a suicidal mood through its concerns with problems common in the suicidal population , such as marital discord , alcohol abuse , and alienation from work .
The results of a multiple regression analysis of 49 metropolitan areas show that the greater the airtime devoted to country music , the greater the white suicide rate .
The effect is independent of divorce , southernness , poverty , and gun availability .
The existence of a country music subculture is thought to reinforce the link between country music and suicide .
Our model explains 51 % of the variance in urban white suicide rates . ”

2 « Love and Sex with Robots »
( D. Levy ; University of Maastricht ; 2007 )
“ Human - robot marriages will be legal by 2050 ”
“ My forecast is that around 2050 , the state of Massachusetts will be the first jurisdiction to legalize marriages with robots , ” artificial intelligence researcher David Levy at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands told LiveScience .
Levy recently completed his Ph.D. work on the subject of human - robot relationships , covering many of the privileges and practices that generally come with marriage as well as outside of it .
At first , sex with robots might be considered geeky , “ but once you have a story like ‘ I had sex with a robot , and it was great ! ’ appear someplace like Cosmo magazine , I ’d expect many people to jump on the bandwagon , ” Levy said .
In his thesis , “ Intimate Relationships with Artificial Partners , ” Levy conjectures that robots will become so human - like in appearance , function and personality that many people will fall in love with them , have sex with them and even marry them .
“ It may sound a little weird , but it is n’t , ” Levy said .
“ Love and sex with robots are inevitable . ”

4 « Chickens Prefer Beautiful Humans »
( S. Ghirlanda , L. Jansson , M. Enquist ; Stockholm University ; 2002 )
“ The animals showed preferences for faces consistent with human sexual preferences ”
Authors at the Stockholm University explain it : “ We trained chickens to react to an average human female face but not to an average male face ( or vice - versa ) .
In a subsequent test , the animals showed preferences for faces consistent with human sexual preferences ( obtained from university students ) .
This suggests that human preferences arise from general properties of nervous systems , rather than from face - specific adaptations .
We discuss this result in the light of current debate on the meaning of sexual signals , and suggest further tests of existing hypotheses about the origin of sexual preferences . ”
5 « Safe and Painless Manipulation of Penile Zipper Entrapment »
( Satish Chandra Mishra ; Charak Palika Hospital ; 2005 )
“ A quick , simple and non-traumatic approach to penile zipper entrapment ”
Author Satish Chandra Mishra , about his enlightening paper : “ Entrapment of penile foreskin is quite a distressing situation for the child and the parents and can be a frustrating management problem .
Any overzealous intervention would simply worsen the situation .
Also , attempts to cut open the zip fastener are time taking and may not be either helpful or feasible in all the situations .
The approach to the zipper manipulation should be quick , simple , non-traumatic and reproducible irrespective of the age of the child , mechanism and site of entrapment , presence of the local edema and zipper size or design . ”

6 « Pressures Produced When Penguins Poo — Calculations on Avian Defecation »
( V. Breno Meyer - Rochow and J. Gal ; International University of Bremen and Lorand Eotvos University of Hungary ; 2005 )
“ They get up , move to the edge of the nest , turn around , bend over … and shoot ”
Ever wondered how far a penguin can fire waste from its anus ?
Wonder no more .
Victor Breno Meyer - Rochow of International University , Bremen , and Jozsef Gal of Lorand Eotvos University , Hungary , used the basic principles of physics to calculate the pressure that builds up inside a penguin .
Dr. Meyer - Rochow explained that the research began in 1993 , when he led the first , and so far only , Jamaican expedition to the Antarctic .
Later , while showing students pictures of faeces - lined penguin nests , he was asked how the elaborate displays were created .
“ They get up , move to the edge of the nest , turn around , bend over – and shoot , ” he said .
That ’s when he got the idea to calculate the pressure produced by penguin poo .
7 « Farting as a Defence Against Unspeakable Dread »
( Dr. M. Sidoli ; Washington DC ; 1998 )
“ When feeling endangered , Peter used his bodily smell and farts to envelop himself in a protective cloud ”
According to it ’s author , “ this paper describes some features of the behaviour of a severely disturbed adopted latency boy .
Peter was born premature , suffered several early hospitalizations and surgical operations , and at 2 months of age was removed from his mother ’s care by Social Services for neglect and abandonment .
When feeling endangered , Peter had developed a defensive olfactive container using his bodily smell and farts to envelop himself in a protective cloud of familiarity against the dread of falling apart , and to hold his personality together . ”
8 « Navigation - Related Structural Change
In the Hippocampi of Taxi Drivers »
( E. A. Maguire and others ; University College London ; 1999 )
“ The brains of London taxi drivers are more developed than those of their fellow citizens . ”
Aothors at the University College London , about their research : “ Structural MRIs of the brains of humans with extensive navigation experience , licensed London taxi drivers , were analyzed and compared with those of control subjects who did not drive taxis .
The posterior hippocampi of taxi drivers were significantly larger relative to those of control subjects .
A more anterior hippocampal region was larger in control subjects than in taxi drivers .
Hippocampal volume correlated with the amount of time spent as a taxi driver ( positively in the posterior and negatively in the anterior hippocampus ) .
These data are in accordance with the idea that the posterior hippocampus stores a spatial representation of the environment and can expand regionally to accommodate elaboration of this representation in people with a high dependence on navigational skills .
It seems that there is a capacity for local plastic change in the structure of the healthy adult human brain in response to environmental demands . ”
9 « Ultrasonic Velocity in Cheddar Cheese as Affected by Temperature »
( A. Mulet , J. Benedito and J. Bon ; Polytechnic University of Valencia ; 2006 )
“ The most reliable temperature interval to carry out ultrasonic measurements in Cheddar cheese is identified as 0 to 17 °C . ”
10 « Impact of Wet Underwear on Thermoregulatory Responses and Thermal Comfort in the Cold »
( M. K. Bakkevig and R. Nielson ; Sintef Unimed and Technical University of Denmark ; 1995 )
“ The thickness of the underwear has the most influence on thermoregulatory responses ”
The paper reads : “ The ultrasonic velocity in Cheddar cheese is temperature dependent .
This relationship can be used to make corrections when determining ultrasonic texture or to determine mean temperatures in cooling / heating processes .
At 0 < T < 35 °C ultrasonic velocity was 1590 to 1696 Ms , at 0 and 35 °C , respectively .
Differential Scanning Calorimetry thermograms linked the temperature dependence of ultrasonic velocity to fat melting .
Three parts are distinguished in the curve as a consequence of the fat melting and the appearance of free oil .
The most reliable temperature interval to carry out ultrasonic measurements in Cheddar cheese is identified as 0 to 17 °C . "
The authors explain : “ The purpose of this study was to investigate the significance of wet underwear and to compare any influence of fibre - type material and textile construction of underwear on thermoregulatory responses and thermal comfort of humans during rest in the cold .
The tests demonstrated the significant cooling effect of wet underwear on thermoregulatory responses and thermal comfort .
The thickness of the underwear has more of an influence on the thermoregulatory responses and thermal comfort , than the types of fibres tested . ”
The army is ready for a large - scale counter - terrorist operation in Gaza , but is waiting for the government to give the go - ahead , IDF Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi said Monday at a conference of senior army officers .
Government leaders say the army is free to act in defense of Sderot , Ashkelon and other southern towns .
The year 2008 , Lt. Gen. Ashkenazi explained , will be a year of many ... challenges on the military front .
Meanwhile , Palestinian Authority rocket attacks continue .
Speaking at a gathering of hundreds of IDF officers on Monday , Lt. Gen .
Ashkenazi declared that the IDF is " prepared to expand and extend its operations [ in Gaza ] as needed and in accordance with [ government ] decisions . "
He went on to say that he has " complete faith " in the ability of the army to meet the security needs of the State of Israel .
The year 2008 , Lt. Gen. Ashkenazi explained , will be a year of many such challenges on the military front .
Earlier in the day , Prime Minister Olmert said , " The security establishment has the tools and all of the necessary confirmations to deal with [ the ] threat " of rocket attacks on Israel .
Defense Minister Ehud Barak told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday that Israel would not rule out any possible course of action .
" IDF operations are continuing day and night and will even be expanded , " he said .
Last April , the Chief of Staff told the government at a cabinet meeting that " the only solution to continued Palestinian rocket fire into the western Negev is to implement a ground incursion into the Gaza Strip . "
However , as of Tuesday , the IDF is continuing to implement a policy of targeted airstrikes against terrorist cells and leaders in the Gaza region .
This week , Israeli intelligence sources warned that Hamas terrorists , including senior leaders , will now be targeted in response to rocket attacks .
The head of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza , the Hamas 's Ismail Haniyeh , has reportedly gone into hiding in order to avoid Israeli retaliation .
On Monday , an Air Force strike in Rafiah targeted a vehicle carrying Hamas terrorists .
The car was hit and two people were reportedly injured .
PA attacks continue , however .
Gaza terrorists fired two rockets at Ashkelon and a second Israeli town on Monday .
The rockets landed in open areas .
Early morning Tuesday saw seven rockets and mortar attacks in the area of the Negev communities Alumim and Nachal Oz .
No injuries were reported in the shellings , but a Golani Brigade soldier was lightly injured in a shootout with a group of armed terrorists in northern Gaza .
He was transported to a hospital for treatment .
Overnight , IDF infantry , tanks and combat engineering forces entered northern Gaza to carry out operations against the terrorist infrastructure there .

" STIMULUS " , AKA ECONOMIC CRANK slang , noun .
" Stimulus " is slang for a sordid economic nostrum administered on the advice of bankers and academics , many of them carrying the title of " Dr. " .
But do n't mistake these " Doctors " for devotees of the Hippocratic Oath .
" Stimulus " or economic crank , like any other economic panacea , is a fake cure that gives its victims a temporary but false sense of well - being , even as it sets about causing long term damage to users and the economic community at large .
The opium of the economists know as " stimulus " acts directly on bread winners and investors by misdirecting them into production plans and consumption levels which cannot be successfully coordinated or sustained across time .
As a consequence , the " high " of this political drug lasts for only a few months , often followed by a depressing " crash " period , which cannot be avoided without further and ever increasing quantities of " stimulus " .
The drug received its proper name " crank " because it was most often smuggled into policy debates by monetary cranks , the most famous of whom was John Maynard Keynes .
" Stimulus " is taken by fiscal injection , monetarily ( directly snorted by banks and borrowers ) , and through the consumption of pork .
A common misconception among politicians and the public is that some administration methods are safer than others , while in reality all act on the economy the same exact way .
Economic " crank " damages the coordinative function of prices across the structure of production and consumption , which cause naturally occurring price signals -- e.g. interest rates , stock prices , etc. -- to be ineffective .
Because price signals are responsible for facilitating the coordination of production plans and consumption choices , withdrawal from sustained periods of artificial " stimulation " is extremely painful to economic actors and the economy system , with businesses and households thrown back into economic reality after having functioned for a time in a circus mirror , government - altered state without any naturally produced and undistorted relative prices to guide their plans .
" Stimulus " withdrawal is said to be one of the most painful experiences an economy can endure , and users of economic " crank " should consider other safer ways to buy the support of voters .
Hat tip to the Urban Dictionary .
For more on the topic see Russ Roberts , " The Science of Stimulus " .

“ We think that Pippin represents the Next Generation of a lot of the things you ’ll be seeing from Apple ” .
That is eerily prophetic , as the parallels are clear between the Pippin and the Apple TV , and more so with the more widespread contemporary trend of the set - top media box .
And from a developer ’s standpoint , this promotional video highlights a lot of the the same things that Steve Jobs extolled during the iPhone introduction —
It ’s running the full version of Mac OS !
Development is easy !
However the parallels between the Pippin and the 3DO are also easy to draw , and it ’s easy to see why the system failed .
A third party , Bandai , manufactured and marketed the device .
It was developed in the pre-NeXT acquisition mid 1990s , a grim time for Apple .
To start the device , you had to insert a system disc into the 4x CD - ROM drive and wait for a streamlined version of Mac OS System 7 to boot .
The graphics were all done in a PowerPC native version of QuickDraw , a graphics API that in its more than 20 years of existence , never supported more than a 1 - bit alpha channel !
So many nightmares .
But the kernel of the idea was good .
And it ’s especially ironic today as the Xbox 360 , Playstation 3 , and Wii are all running on PowerPC architecture .
The Pippin ’s PowerPC 603e is the forebear of these consoles ’ brains .
Watch carefully , and you will see the Pippin port of Bungie ’s Marathon in the video — a game which you can now play on XBox Live Arcade .
Here ’s a full list of Pippin software releases .

Why do Liberals hate Bush ?
Morse Code ^ | May 28 | Chuck Morse
Posted on by Chuckmorse
Im driving my 8 - year - old daughter home from school along with some of her fellow students and I hear giggling in the back seat .
Asking to be let in on the joke , a young girl blurts out a vulgar and ugly little ditty about President Bush , the type of limerick that might have been told by a Nazi child about a Jew back in the 1930s .
This is not the first time Ive heard a little child spew hateful trash about the President .
The impressionable child no doubt picked this little gem up at the breakfast table of her good liberal parents .
What drives this hatred that causes otherwise enlightened liberals to fill the minds of their young children with such disrespect and contempt for the President of the United States ?
Ive asked this question many times of liberal friends , family members , and associates and I have yet to get a coherent and rational answer from any of them .
What exactly is driving this ?
Certainly it couldnt be the war in Iraq .
President Bush initiated the war to enforce United Nations sanctions that were being ignored by Saddam Hussein , an infamous dictator and a notorious human rights abuser .
Liberals revere the United Nations , claim to abhor human rights abuse , and have from time to time called for American military intervention to deal with intolerable situations of suffering and oppression in the world .
Bush went into Iraq softly and with a minimum of loss of innocent life .
A more conservative approach , one that I wouldve supported , wouldve been a strategy of swift and total military victory against the enemy .
Bush proceeded to turn oil revenues over to the new Iraqi government and to preside over democratic elections .
The American show of force in Iraq contributed to a decision by Libya to suspend its nuclear program .
I thought the stemming of nuclear proliferation was a devoutly held liberal goal .
While continuing with a soft approach in Iraq , Bush has aided the new democratic government , the first ever in the region , in its difficult fight against religious fanatics .
For a liberal , whats not to like ?
Certainly liberals couldnt accuse the Bush administration of cutting the size of the government or of cutting any government programs .
In seven years the President has still failed to veto a single pork - barrel spending bill submitted by Congress .
Under the Bush administration , the government has continued to expand , always a liberal goal .
The Bush administration has increased spending on education more than any administration in history through the no child left behind act endorsed by Senator Ted Kennedy .
If there is one thing liberals love , its big and expensive government .
Could liberals be upset about the immigration policy of the Bush administration ?
The President has demonstrated a complete lack of will when it comes to controlling the border with Mexico and stopping the massive flow of illegal aliens .
Building a fence along that border would be an obvious and cost - effective solution yet nothing has been done by this administration in this regard .
The worker - visa program , as advocated by Bush , couldve been taken word for word right out of the liberal playbook .
Yet liberals continue to wallow in this inexplicable hatred .
I would suggest that liberals hate Bush more for what he represents than for who he actually is which is a centrist who governs slightly to the right of center .
Perhaps liberals would prefer a President who both espouses liberal ideas and governs liberally .
I shudder to think of how such a President would approach the war in Iraq , the budget , the growth of government programs , and the influx of illegal aliens .
While Bush has not governed as conservatively as I would prefer , at least his liberal tendancies are tempered with a few conservative convictions .
The answer to the question why do liberals hate Bush  is one that I will continue to pose to liberals and I m sure I will continue to hear a lot of double talk and non-answers .

When Hillary is elected and the Congress is solid Democrats , they will reap the fruits of their folly .
Unfortunately , we will become France ( which is their role model , for some odd reason ) .
1 ) Economic changes ( higher taxes , increased labor union powers , etc ) that choke the economy
2 ) Increased regulations on business
3 ) Socialized medicine leading everyone but the top 10 % to suffer .
The Dems always adopt child - like changes in a complex world , because they “ feel good . ”
Republicans are the mean , Hitler - like characters because they do n’t give everyone a free ride .

That 's easy - because he is n't a Democrat .

Uh , what conservative convictions ?
Libs hate Bush because hatred is their their irrational religion .
They do n’t even see that he is one of them .
He ’s in charge and has beaten them all around the block in because of the faithful yet irrational support he received from GOP leadership who put him in place because they thought “ he could win ” .
Conservative principle be darned .

When you see the vitriol that was spewed after Falwell ’s death , you realize that “ hate ” is a very real part of the liberal ’s mindset toward certain conservative issues ( Falwell was best known for his pro-life , pro-family stands . )
Bush may not be the embodiment of a “ conservative ” ... but he speaks out against the evil of abortion , embryonic stem cell research , and is pro-family , and I think that is what elicits much of the hate .

Liberals apparently find Bush threatening .
Their hatred then , becomes a defense mechanism .
This kind of hatred cannot exist within a sane person , perhaps some of what we see is really self - loathing .
Last night 's Law and Order was about a serial killer .
The killer turned out to be a big - government - fearing , religious , gun and flag - toting survivalist ; this is their nightmare , yet , in reality they have more to fear from sociopaths created by liberal " education " .
To : Chuckmorse
I believe liberal socialists hate Bush because they simply do n’t like an obvious capitalist in the White House .
Even worse , a capitalist that seems willing to act unilaterally in America ’s best interest ( as he understands it ) .
That violates their desire for the US to be folded into their vision of a world socialist utopia .
Additionally , they distrust the corporation culture that springs from a strong capitalist system , and believe that just as that same system selfishly exploits the world ’s resources and remains preeminent on the backs of workers , it stole their Gore election victory in Florida .
I do n’t think it ’s Bush , per say .
He ’s simply the face of what bothers them .
To : Chuckmorse
otherwise enlightened liberals
With all due respect , Mr. Morse , you 're starting with a false premise here .
These people are some of the biggest fools of the millenium ( and the last millenium as well ) .
Unless you meant it as sarcasm and I was n't sharp enough to pick that up .

Also , because he ’s from Texas .

Conservatives like me arent happy with Bush either .
This hard core Republican wouldnt vote for him again .
I wont vote Democrat , but I wont vote for any Republican who carries his stinking , rancid immigration bill either .

The disgrace that is Bush ’s Housing Department
Picking the single worst , most ineffective , most scandal - ridden Bush cabinet agency is n’t easy .
Sure , Alberto Gonzales ’ Justice Department has to get the top spot , but there ’s Rumsfeld ’s Pentagon , Paige ’s Department of Education , and Chertoff ’s DHS .
But let ’s not overlook Alphonso Jackson ’s HUD , for my money , every bit as corrupt and ridiculous as any cabinet agency in decades .
We learned last month that Jackson , who has a history of allowing political considerations to dictate policy matters , demanded that the Philadelphia Housing Authority transfer a $ 2 million public property to a friendly developer at a substantial discount .
When the housing authority balked , Jackson retaliated , including threats about the availability of federal funding .
Today , there are some additional details , which make Bush ’s HUD look even worse .
After Philadelphia ’s housing director refused a demand by President Bush ’s housing secretary to transfer a piece of city property to a business friend , two top political appointees at the department exchanged e-mails discussing the pain they could cause the Philadelphia director .
“ Would you like me to make his life less happy ?
If so , how ? ” Orlando J. Cabrera , then - assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development , wrote about Philadelphia housing director Carl R. Greene .
“ Take away all of his Federal dollars ? ” responded Kim Kendrick , an assistant secretary who oversaw accessible housing .
She typed symbols for a smiley - face , “ : - D , ” at the end of her January 2007 note .
Cabrera wrote back a few minutes later : “ Let me look into that possibility . ”
The similarities between Bush administration agencies and organized - crime families are routinely striking , but this is ridiculous .
Paul Kiel added :
Greene is suing Jackson for retaliating against Philadelphia because he ’d denied Jackson ’s buddy , conservative soul songwriter Kenny Gamble , a city property .
“ On the date these e-mails were sent , ” the Post reports , “ HUD notified the [ Philadelphia ] housing authority that it had been found in violation of rules requiring that 5 percent of housing be accessible to disabled residents . ”
But it gets better .
Cabrera abruptly resigned from his post last November .
It was later reported that Cabrera had spoken to the feds as part of their investigation , and that he was not on “ speaking terms ” with Jackson .
It was no coincidence : “ HUD insiders say that the secretary was angry with Cabrera for speaking to investigators and considers him ‘ a snitch , ' ” National Journal reported .
You can imagine Jackson ’s chagrin , since Cabrera seems like such a team player .
But it ’s a rough place , HUD .
Keep in mind , Jackson is already the focus of a federal investigation for awarding housing contracts to his friends and a federal grand jury investigated whether Jackson lied to investigators when he told them that he does n’t “ touch contracts . ”
And yet , no one at the White House , and not a single Republican in Congress , believes Jackson should resign .
The GOP has lowered the bar considerably on what constitutes a firing offense .
There is a reason why every creature survives , and this one does not look like food worth fighting for

BBC News , Buenos Aires
One of the joys - and difficulties - of being a foreign correspondent is learning and adapting to local customs .
Buenos Aires looks , on the surface at least , pretty much like a European city .
You would think then that British journalists would not have too much difficulty blending in with the locals , but that is not always the case .
Argentines are famous for their passionate embraces
But there is an awful lot of it going on in Buenos Aires and sometimes I do not know if I have got it quite right .
You kiss pretty much everybody - one peck , right cheek to right cheek - when you greet them and when you say goodbye .
" What ?
Everyone ? " I asked my Argentine wife on my first visit to the country .
" Yes , everyone , " she replied .
I was doubtful .
That day we went to see her dentist - an elderly , very conservative woman who I was told had once scraped the plaque from the teeth of none less than the glamorous Evita Peron , wife of the former president , Juan Peron .
We met in the doorway , I stooped to kiss the diminutive dentist , she recoiled in horror , a door closed , hitting me on the back and pushing me closer towards her as she managed to duck and slip from my grasp in a move worthy of an international rugby player .
Charlie Chaplin could not have done it better .
" Well , perhaps not absolutely everyone , " my wife explained afterwards .
Friendly kiss
Some years ago the custom developed for men to kiss men .
Family members and very close friends had always done so .
But in such a macho , sometimes homophobic society , this was a radical move .
When dropping my children at school in the mornings , I kiss all the mums and all the dads ... insurance salesmen , architects , lawyers and teachers .
Then we kiss again to say goodbye .
The kissing between men is done in a very macho , Argentine sort of way
I kiss colleagues , male and female , on my arrival and departure from work .
I have kissed the cleaner , the bank manager , the receptionists and secretaries at the offices of people I have interviewed .
But not the refuse collectors , my barber or the ticket collectors on the train - although I might if they were a little more friendly .
And everyone kisses children , enthusiastically and often .
My own boys are well - trained to proffer their cheeks to all visiting adults .
Although on return trips to Britain they find they are often left hanging , with their necks arched , while stuffy , distant British adults look at them in confusion .
" Oh !
You were expecting a kiss , " they 'll say .
Argentines are definitely more friendly .
But sometimes , it is just too much .
Too many lips and too many cheeks .
The kissing between men is done in a very macho , Argentine sort of way .
When two friends meet in the street , there will be the quick peck and a hearty slap on the upper arm accompanied by a loud : " Che !
Que tal ? -
Hey mate !
how 's it going ? "
You can still offer a handshake but that might be seen as a sign that you want to keep your distance , that you do not want to become too friendly in what is a very friendly , sociable society .
Too British
Kissing in public is important to Argentines .
Standing in the queue for the cinema the other day I heard frantic slurping and near drowning noises behind me .
I turned to find a not - so - young couple quite openly and unashamedly indulging in a passionate kiss .
That is something I see frequently on park benches , outside offices and in restaurants .
So if you should visit Argentina , have your lips at the ready
In fact now I think about it , Argentines in general like to get much closer than I am accustomed to .
While in queues at the supermarket check - out for instance , I have elbowed many an elderly lady as I stoop to sign my credit card slip since they were standing too close .
Worse still is when they are practically in my back pocket while I take money from the bank cash machines .
" Perhaps you 'd care to dance madam , " I feel like saying .
" Although I do n't know you and I 'm not sure this is the appropriate time or place to do a tango . "
The guide books all say the same - that Buenos Aires looks , on the surface , like a mixture of Paris , Milan and Barcelona .
And the immigrant mix of the residents reflects the same , with the subsequent evolution of a kissing culture .
Which is better ?
One kiss or two or three ?
On greeting and departure or just greeting ?
The portenos , as the residents of Buenos Aires are known , have evolved their own style .
So if you should visit Argentina , have your lips at the ready , beware of diminutive elderly dentists and , gentlemen , please shave first .

According to 20 - plus years of data collected by Thomson Financial , early , or seed stage , private equity investing has over the long - term , outperformed all other investment classes — with average annual returns of over 20.6 % .
Individual , or “ angel ” investors are the largest source of seed and startup capital .
In 2007 , angel investors infused $ 25.6 billion into private companies , almost as much as the $ 26 billion invested by venture capital funds .
Venture capitalists only invested in 4,000 U.S. businesses while angel investors invested in more than 51,000 companies .
According to the best available statistics , in 2007 , there were approximately 234,000 active individual , private company investors and approximately 49,500 private companies received funding from individual investors .
Many of these investors ’ experiences are frustrating .
Strong evidence indicates there are a small number of individual investors in private companies that do very well while the significant majority do not .
From Growthink ’s advisory experience of working with hundreds of early - stage companies financed via “ friends and family ” and angel investors , the following three investment challenges are often present :
Diversification .
Private equity investing is inherently variable — with a relatively small percentage of companies building themselves to successful exits and investment harvesting .
Most individual investors in private equity significantly under - diversify their portfolios — investing in one or only a handful of companies and thereby greatly increasing their risk profile .
Valuation .
Pre -and early - revenue traction private companies often raise money at valuations far above fair market given their early stage and risk factors .
Monitoring .
The real progress of small , closely - held companies is extremely difficult to monitor and measure .
Communications between private company management and their investors too often is mostly of a promotional form — with investors rarely getting a balanced review of the growth and profitability challenges of the companies .
Our view on the secret of successful private company investing is :
Invest in a portfolio of companies , not just one or a handful
Do so at favorable , negotiated valuations
Post - investment , make sure that monitoring dynamics — an independent board for example — and access to high level professional service partners are in place .
While of course the outsize potential returns of private company investment requires an understanding of the risks involved and should only be undertaken by accredited investors capable of withstanding a loss , when done following these guidelines ( and with fortune smiling on you ) , the return on investment can be both breathtaking and life - changing .

After suffering a beating from their exposure to home loans , banks and securities firms are about to take their lumps from office towers , hotels and other commercial real estate .
And the losses could last longer than those from the subprime shakeout .
As the economy wobbles and financing costs rise because of the credit crunch , commercial - real - estate values are starting to slide , with analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. projecting a decline of 21 % to 26 % in the next two years .
That means misery for securities firms with exposure to commercial - real - estate loans and commercial - mortgage - backed securities .
William Tanona , a Goldman analyst , expects total write - downs of $ 7.2 billion by Bear Stearns Cos. , Citigroup Inc. , J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. , Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , Merrill Lynch & Co. and Morgan Stanley in the first quarter .
Those firms had combined commercial - real - estate exposure of $ 141 billion at the end of the fourth quarter .
A team of Goldman analysts predicts the financial damage from commercial real estate could last as long as two years , which would mean " a significantly longer tail than subprime . "
That is because only 28 % of commercial - real - estate loans have been packaged into securities since 1995 , while about 80 % of subprime loans have been securitized ; the higher level of securitization subjects the subprime assets to more - immediate mark - to - market accounting , which is playing out in the form of the write - downs that are dominating headlines .
Wall Street has set itself up for a hard fall in commercial real estate .
Banks and securities firms are facing exposure from loans and financing commitments made on commercial - real - estate projects , property they own directly and commercial - mortgage - backed securities that no one wants to buy .
Noise under a flight path can be a major problem
Researchers monitored 140 sleeping volunteers in their homes near Heathrow and three other big European airports .
Volunteers ' blood pressure increased after exposure to a noise louder than 35 decibels - whether it came from overhead aircraft , or snoring .
In response to the European Heart Journal study , the UK government said noise at Heathrow was improving .
Also , night - time flights at the London airport were strictly controlled the Department for Transport said .
" However , we are aware of people 's concerns which is why the government has set out strict local noise conditions on expansion at Heathrow , " a spokesman added .
Restrictions apply at Heathrow between 11 pm and 7am .
Blood pressure
Measures need to be taken to reduce noise levels from aircraft , in particular during night - time , in order to protect the health of people living near airports
Dr Lars Jarup
Imperial College London
The researchers measured the volunteers ' blood pressure remotely at 15 - minute intervals .
Aircraft noise caused an average increase in systolic blood pressure of 6.2 mmHg and an average increase in diastolic blood pressure of 7.4 mmHg .
Similar increases in blood pressure were seen also for other noise sources such as road traffic .
One resident who lives near Heathrow , Margaret Thorburn , told the BBC how noise due to the airport affected her .
There was " no point " trying to sleep before 11 pm , she said .
" And that 's standard because background noise has died down and any aircraft that goes over when everything else is quiet you notice an awful lot more and it's disturbing in a particular way , " she said .
" If it 's in the summer when the windows are open then you 're going to wake up ... and what 's more you do n't go back to sleep because you 're waiting for the next one to come over . "
Louder noises worse
The study also found the louder the noise , the greater the increase in blood pressure .
For every five decibel increase in aircraft noise at its loudest point , there was an increase of 0.66 mmHg in systolic blood pressure .
The researchers had previously shown that people who have been living for at least five years under a flight path near an international airport are at greater risk of developing high blood pressure than people living in quieter areas .
Taken together , the two studies suggest that living under a flight path could almost double the risk of hypertension .
The researchers have calculated that for every extra 10 decibels of aircraft noise the risk of hypertension is increased by 14 % .
The mechanism by which aircraft noise acts to raise blood pressure is unknown , but the researchers plan further tests to examine the theory that the brain reacts to noise by ramping up levels of the stress hormone cortisol .
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
Associated with a raised risk of heart disease , stroke , kidney disease and dementia Defined by World Health Organisation as being 140/90 mm Hg or more
Researcher Dr Lars Jarup , from Imperial College London , said : " We know that noise from air traffic can be a source of irritation , but our research shows that it can also be damaging for people 's health - which is particularly significant in light of plans to expand international airports . "
Ellen Mason , a cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation , said : " Noise pollution may be the latest in a long line of issues that the airline industry needs to tackle . "
But she added : " High blood pressure is far more likely to be influenced by the fact that many of us eat far too much salt , do n't take enough exercise and are fast becoming overweight . "
Professor Graham McGregor , an expert in blood pressure , said the study was interesting , but more work would have to be done to confirm the link .
He said people who lived close to airports tended to be poor , and high blood pressure was associated with poverty .
The US Navy has just completed a 10 - megajoule test fire of their huge rail gun .
For the first time ever , they fired a projectile with a velocity of 8,270 feet per second .
That 's an amazing 5,640 mph , and the gun is only firing at a third of its potential power .
The other video shows you what the projectile looks like when loaded .

The Navy is researching rail guns because they would weigh less than conventional ones , and since they rely on electromagnetics to fire rounds , you would n't need a big , dangerous pile of explosives stored in a magazine .
All of that means a lighter ship , and a much more deadly ship : a combat - ready rail gun would be able to fire Mach 5 projectiles over 200 miles with pinpoint accuracy , hitting 5 meter targets .

Yesterday 's test firing at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division used just some of the potential 32 - megajoules the laboratory test gun is capable of , and that 's only half the 64 - megajoules the Navy is aiming at for the final weapon .
Expect even more dramatic videos , sometime soon .
[ Navy Times and Danger Room ]
The string of newspaper endorsements just continued to roll in for Senator John McCain , getting the nod on Sunday of the Nashua Telegraph , the 26th newspaper in the region to endorse his candidacy .
Normally , newspaper endorsements have only limited value , encouraging supporters and getting voters to perhaps give a candidate another look .
But Mr. McCain ’s sweep of the New Hampshire area newspapers is something altogether different .
Mitt Romney , leading in the most recent polls in the state , has scored zero endorsements .
In fact , only Rudolph W. Giuliani has won the endorsement of any other newspaper in the state , securing the nod of Foster ’s Daily Democrat and the newspaper that serves the Laconia lakes region .
It was no accident .
While Mr. Romney and Mr. Giuliani aggressively courted editorial boards , none did it with the determination of Mr. McCain , who visited some papers two or three times .
Charlie Black , a McCain adviser , said that the campaign made the calculation that because of the compressed primary schedule , the holiday and the saturation television advertising they expected from Mr. Romney , editorial endorsements could prove a way to break through the clutter .
Of course , the most coveted was the conservative New Hampshire Union Leader , which has not only endorsed Mr. McCain , but has followed up with a series of blistering front - page editorials disparaging Mr. Romney .
“ You ca n’t buy that kind of thing in a media message , ” Mr. Black said .
He said that when he first started as a political consultant three decades ago , it was possible to buy ads on the major networks and reach some 95 percent of the voters .
Now , he said , you could spend a billion dollars buying television time and not have that kind of penetration .
For all the campaign ’s efforts to secure endorsements , however , even Mr. McCain himself at times seems somewhat surprised that they all lined up so completely his way .
And at the same time , many of the editorials have echoed a central criticism of the way Mr. Romney has presented himself to voters here .
“ At a time when some candidates present themselves to voters as something they have n’t always been , we find the Arizona senator to be the genuine article , ” the Telegraph wrote in Sunday ’s endorsement .
“ You might not always agree with his answers , but you wo n’t leave a conversation wondering where he stands . ”

So it has come to this .
Years of spending , inflating , taxing , and redistributing has left the US economy teetering on a recession that our best and brightest — meaning the ones who created this mess — claim requires a multibillion - dollar economic - relief package to quell fears , promote confidence , and spur recovery .
And , one might add , to keep things calm past election time , which is the real purpose of this bipartisan proposal .
It leaves you wondering about what happened to the 1990s boom , a credit - fueled expansion also influenced by a peace dividend .
The end of the Cold War produced a floundering federal government that lost its rationalization to grow and found itself unsure of its purpose , thus promoting an era of relative peace and prosperity .

Oh , how things changed in the 2000s , with new monsters to destroy and new justifications for centralized power !
Table 1 lists just a few of the results of these policies , and it explains why the presidential candidates are all about the change - change - change !
Unless you are long on gold or short on bank stocks , who benefits from the status quo ?
The difference between the 1990s and the 2000s expansions is that while the former relied less on the fiscal tool of debt , fiscal and monetary tools defined the latter — economic interventionism 's double whammy of debt expansion and money creation .
Both tools are preferred by pols who receive short - term benefits from growing the government while not forcing the current generation to pay for it .
Both also are preferred forms of taxation because they shield the full cost of government from current voters .
Debt shifts tax obligations to future generations , while inflating the money supply is a pernicious consumption tax because it makes you pay for big government in the form of higher prices .
The end result , however , is an unsustainable boom followed by an inevitable bust , the beginning of which we are starting to see right now .
Yet , the solutions being aired by establishment thinkers on the Left and the Right call for more of the same .
Boys and girls , the word for January 2008 is " stimulus " — a new round of debt and inflation to forestall the inevitable correction .
The plans are still murky at this point , but the total size of the economic stimulus package should fall between $ 125 to $ 150 billion in tax cuts , targeted spending , and rebates .
Check your mailbox .
You may find a government check between $ 800 and $ 1,600 sometime before the April 15 tax deadline .
One certainty is that we 'll know the details soon .
Both parties want some deal to be announced by the time of the State of the Union address .
Let 's recall the economic justification for such policies .
They are based on myths that have persisted since the Depression that sticky prices cause markets not to clear , resulting in an oversupply of goods and a disincentive by firms to expand production and hire labor .
This inability by the price system to adjust downward when market conditions change reflects a failure inherent in the market system , thus requiring extramarket intervention by central planners , whose solution involves policies meant to increase consumption .
If that happens , the resulting increased demand for goods and services allows markets to clear , notwithstanding price rigidities .
Or so goes the justification .
The many problems with this scenario include the fact that prices actually do adjust downward — rigidities are rare in competitive markets and more common in regulated ones .
So if markets are not clearing in the midst of a correction , the problem is outside the market .
The culprit is interventionism , not the price system .
Say you run an automobile factory and no one is buying your cars at the average price of $ 20,000 each .
Your dealers ' lots are growing and your supply chains are getting clogged — both indicators of a downward pressure on prices .
You can either ( a ) cut back production and lower your average price , or ( b ) wait for consumer demand to increase .
The planners now formulating stimulus packages assume that you and millions of other economic actors facing similar choices will opt for the second strategy .
Since markets would fail us when this happens , they require some manipulation of consumer demand for them to work .
An objection to such policies — besides the obvious ones dealing with their similarity to those of Italy , circa 1933 — is that they set the stage for a more significant correction in the future .
Policies that force consumers to spend are also policies that force them not to save , and saving is essential for long - term , sustainable economic growth .
When people do n't save today , they consume less in the future , again causing inventories to rise and supply chains to become clogged .
At best , forced spending can only postpone market corrections , and the more it depletes saving , the more severe the eventual correction .
It does n't help that such demand - side policies themselves became sticky , entrenched as Keynesian policy institutions .
While much of economics as a science has moved on from Keynesian theory — meaning that it has moved closer to the Austrian position , which was contra Keynes from the beginning — old policy levers maintain political value .
They often show up in the form of calls for economic stimuli .
The problem for free - market economists is that their policy recommendations at the dawn of recession are not too sexy to the political mindset .
They involve either doing nothing to hinder price adjustments , or actively removing extramarket barriers to price adjustments that already exist .
This often involves short - term pain in exchange for long - term solutions , when politics rewards short - term solutions that result in long - term pain .
History proves this point .
Prior to the creation of such barriers , economic corrections were much shorter affairs .
Recessions were called panics and they rarely lasted more than three months .
Massive , sustainable wealth was created — indeed , the Industrial Revolution occurred under these conditions .
It was only when those who would obstruct necessary price and wage adjustments during a correction became a permanent part of government bureaucracy that real growth rates tapered and business cycles began to measure longer and more painful corrections , each requiring a new round of so - called stimulus .
That is what we are experiencing today .
It is the folly of governments to spend , inflate , tax , and redistribute .
There is nothing new under the sun .
Back in about 2000 - 2001 , I was doing first tech support and then configuration management work for a big company in Chicago , and , basically because I was lazy and curious I would spend more time than I should have reading , on the web , about programming , especially programming languages , especially unusual ones .
That was when I first started getting interested in Ruby , and read the online Pickaxe Book ; that ’s when I read beating the averages and wanted to be an Eager Young Lisp Cadet ( much like the inimitable Bruce ! ) , I downloaded Squeak and learned a little Smalltalk ; and I got geeked about pure functional programming by reading John Hughes ’ paper , Why Functional Programming Matters .
Hey , anything but do the work I was being paid to do !
The Hughes paper led me to Haskell , and I read the Gentle Introduction to Haskell , at least up to the IO chapter , which linked forward to the Monads chapter , which was too much for my poor little brain .
The thing was , at the time , I was n’t programming professionally or really much at all .
I ’d read about programming , done tiny little fun programs , done a lot of system scripting in Perl , and learned about the languages , but I ’d never been a “ real ” programmer .
This kept my mind open to wacky languages but it kept my understanding shallow .
A couple jobs later , I was doing actual programming for a living , but in Perl ( the first language I ’d actually used on the job , and so the one I was best at ) .
While I was n’t paying attention to it , Ruby suddenly became really popular thanks to this “ web application framework ” called Rails , maybe you ’ve heard of it .
Now it seems like Haskell is starting to accumulate buzz .
There ’s almost as much jibberjabber on Reddit about Haskell ( especially Monads ) as there is about Ron “ we can safely assume 95 % of black males are criminals ” Paul .
I ’ve recently gone back to it , got a copy of the compiler working on my , and followed some of the good tutorials , and I finally realized that Haskell ’s “ monads ” were n’t really as hard to understand or weird as I had thought .
I even wrote a little program that rolled dice .
It compiled .
It used the IO Monad .
It used the Random Monad ( indirectly — you can just pull random numbers into an IO Monad ) .
It was maybe a dozen lines long , and verbose at that .
I rewrote every part of it several times , so I was n’t just cut and pasting code , butunderstood exactly how it was doing its thing , and I played around with the monad operators and “ do - notation ” and all that .
In the end it all turns out not to be a big deal .
OK , now what ?
I ’d love to go learn more about Haskell .
But you know what ?
I do n’t actually program in my spare time much .
Just stupid little utility scripts from time to time .
Convert videos from flv to mpg using mencoder .
Generate clever passwords ( I have a command line script that does what this does ) .
Automate an rsync backup .
I guess I could try writing those in Haskell instead of shell or Ruby , which is what I usually use .
Maybe eventually it will lead to something interesting .
We ’ll see .
Haskell is n’t the only language that fascinates me but it ’s the one I ’ve had a long fascination with and done very with , mostly because of the silly “ oh no I ca n’t grok monads ” hurdle .
I was prompted to write this up because I just started following the fascinating notes on haskell blog , whose author , Adam Turoff ( a pointy - headed comp sci sounding name if there ever was one ) , wrote up a spiffy three - part intro to Haskell for ONLamp.com , beginning here .
Do n't you wish being gay came with an owner 's manual sometimes ?
Would n't it make things so much easier if we just had a checklist ?
In that spirit , I thought I 'd share what I consider the top ten things every gay man should know .

The Silent Coup
How a nation ruled by law , becomes a nation ruled by man
“ We are living in an era of extraordinary expansion of executive authority … . ”
Arlen Specter
United States Senator ( Republican Pennsylvania )
“ [ the Adminstration ] asserted a broad doctrine of presidential “ inherent authority ” to ignore the laws passed by Congress when prosecuting the war on terror .
In other words , the rule of law is suspended , and the President is above the law , for the uncertain and no doubt lengthy duration of the undefined war on terror ”
Patrick Leahy
United States Senator ( Democrat Vermont )
“ If Congress does n’t have the power to define the contours of the President ’s Article II powers through legislation …//… If the President ’s legal theory , which is shared by some of our witnesses today , is correct …// … Under this theory , we no longer have a constitutional system consisting of three co-equal branches of government , we have a monarchy ”

Once the war against Saddam begins , we expect every American to support our military , and if they ca n’t do that is to shut up ”
Bill O’Reilly
There is a battle far from getting the attention it deserves considering the stakes – the rule and governing of the USA .
You would only notice with great difficulty and after spending a lot of time viewing hearing in various congressional committees , picking up a piece here and another there , and painstakingly putting them into a historical context in a far from obvious manner .
At the center is the question of presidential power vis-à - vis the congress , a group of embittered individuals set on making right what they consider a violation of the constitution . .
When many Americans saw a restoration of balance of power when Congress went after and eventually reined in the Executive Branch in the Iran - Contra Affair , others saw an unconstitutional and deeply offensive act of neutering .
The same people saw the same unconstitutional usurpation of executive powers when , following the Vietnam War , laws were passed and investigations were launched attempting to explore and rein in what was seen as abuses of the executive branch ’s wartime powers ( e.g Church Committee , Pike Committee , War Powers Act ) .

( UPDATED : See 70 Signs of Intelligent Life at YouTube
It 's been a constant lament that YouTube offers its users scant little intellectual content .
And that content is itself hard to find .
Just visit YouTube 's so - called Education Section , and you 'll be hard - pressed to find anything actually educational .
But the good news is that we 're seeing some recent signs of intelligent life at YouTube .
The video service hosts an increasing number of intellectually redeemable video collections .
And so we figured why not do some heavy lifting and bring a few your way .
If YouTube wo n't make them easy to find , then we will .
( Also see 10 Ways to Make Your iPod a Better Learning Gadget . )
1. ) UC Berkeley :
We have mentioned this collection before , but we might as well mention it again .
UC Berkeley launched in October a YouTube channel that contains over 300 hours of academic programming .
And , most notably , you 'll find here a series of university courses that can be watched in their entirety ( for free ) .
It 's a deep collection worth starting with .
2. ) @ GoogleTalks : Many big names end up speaking at Google .
That includes political figures and cultural figures such as Paul Krugman , Steven Pinker , Joseph Stieglitz , Jonathan Lethem and more .
Since Google owns YouTube , it 's good to see that they 're making an effort to record these talks and raise the intellectual bar on GooTube just a bit .
Have a look .
3. ) The Nobel Prize : TheNobelPrize channel presents current and past Nobel Laureates -- courtesy of Nobelprize.org , the official web site of the Nobel Foundation .
The collection features official Nobel Prize Lectures and also more casual presentations .
It looks like talks by the 2007 winners are being added slowly .
4. ) TED
Talks :
Every year , a thousand “ thought - leaders , movers and shakers ” get together at a four - day conference called TED ( which is short for Technology , Entertainment and Design ) .
In recent years , the list of speakers has ranged from Sergey Brin and Larry Page to Bill Gates , to Herbie Hancock and Peter Gabriel , to Frank Gehry , to Al Gore and Bill Clinton .
In this collection , you 'll find various talks presented at the conference .
They usually run about 20 minutes .
5. ) FORA.tv :
In case you do n't know about it , FORA.tv is a web service that hosts videos featuring important thinkers grappling with contemporary cultural , social and political questions .
It 's like YouTube , but always intelligent .
You can find extended videos on FORA 's site , and a decent sampling of their content on YouTube .
6. ) Philosophers and Theorists : The European Graduate School ( or EGS ) hosts a video collection on YouTube that includes talks by some very important theorists / philosophers of the past generation -- for example , Jacques Derrida and Jean Baudrillard .
There are also some filmmakers mixed in — take for example , Peter Greenaway and John Waters .
7. ) Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting :
This channel promotes coverage of international affairs , " focusing on topics that have been under - reported , mis-reported - or not reported at all . "
Most of these videos were featured on the public television program " Foreign Exchange with Fareed Zakaria . "
8. ) BBC Worldwide :
The leading British broadcaster is now live on YouTube , and there 's some good content in the mix , although it wo n't leap off of the homepage .
The trick is to look at their playlist where you will find more educational pieces of video : documentaries , science , drama , travel , and more .
The notable downside is that the videos typically fall within YouTube 's customary 10 minute video limit .
( Many others cited here run longer . )
Too bad more could n't have been done with this opportunity .
Other smart media properties that have opted for the soundbite strategy here include National Geographic and PBS .
9. ) UChannel : Formerly called the University Channel , this video service presents talks on international / political affairs from academic institutions all over the world .
It 's spearheaded by Princeton University , and you can find an even more extensive video collection on their web site .
10 . ) Other University Channels on YouTube : UC Berkeley launched the biggest channel on YouTube , but there are some others out there .
Unfortunately , finding them is something of a crapshoot .
We 've managed , however , to pull together a good list of ten .
See 10 University Collections on YouTube
Bonus :
We cobbled together our own playlist of smart YouTube videos that will grow over time .
Have a look .
In putting together this list , one thing became clear : YouTube has enough quality content to keep you busy , and there 's clearly more that I do n't know about ( again , because they do n't make it easy to find ) .
If you want to add other good YouTube collections to our list , please list them in the comments and I can add them selectively to the list .

Trivia
Dillinger is shown serenading his hostages while driving away from the prison escape by singing " The Last Round - Up " .
" The Last Round - Up " was published in 1933 .
It became songwriter Billy Hill 's biggest hit .
It was n't long before the song became Number 1 , and stayed there for nine weeks .
According to Lee Hill Taylor , while her father was working on a ranch in Montana , he asked one of the cowboys why they continued to ride in a round - up when they got older .
The cowboy told him there was a time when they had to stop , and that would be their " last round - up . "
Right after their brief conversation this cowboy was riding his horse and was accidentally knocked off and trampled to death .
Hill never forgot that terrible accident , and used it as the basis for his memorable song .

( CNN ) -- Illinois Sen. Barack Obama won the first battle of the Super Tuesday showdown when Democratic Party voters in Indonesia -- where Obama spent four years of his childhood -- picked him over Sen. Hillary Clinton .
Seventy five percent of the nearly 100 votes cast by expatriate Americans a minute after midnight Indonesia time ( 12 p.m. Monday EST ) went to Obama .
The rest were cast in favor of Clinton , said Arian Ardie , country committee chair for Democrats Abroad .
Ardie said he was not permitted to disclose the exact number of votes cast , and added that the results were preliminary and still need formal verification .
Ardie said that Obama 's time in Indonesia was part of his appeal among expatriate voters in the southeast Asian country .
" I think it factored in to the extent they saw someone with strong international experience , " he said .
" But I do n't think it was the primary factor . "
The voting at a hotel in Indonesia 's capital city of Jakarta was the first in - person casting of ballots in a coast - to - coast contest for Democratic and Republican presidential hopefuls Tuesday .
Voters will go to the polls in 24 states and American Samoa .
Some 6 million Americans living abroad are eligible to vote in U.S. elections , The Associated Press reported , but only a fraction have done so in the past .
Ardie said Democrats in Indonesia wanted to create the same kind of buzz that the New Hampshire hamlet of Dixville Notch generated when it kicked off the presidential primaries on January 8 .
Super Tuesday Live from the CNN Election Center , the best political team covers every race 40 hours nonstop .
Tuesday , beginning 6 a.m. ET see full schedule »
The midnight voting in the hamlet of about 75 people near the Canadian border was closely watched by the media and the campaigns .
There too , Obama won -- garnering seven of 10 votes cast .
Clinton won none .
More than four - fifths of the 2,025 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination are at stake Tuesday in what amounts to a national primary .
The delegates will in turn choose the party 's presidential candidate at their August convention .
For the millions of Americans living around the world , Democrats Abroad is the official Democratic Party organization .
It is recognized as a " state " party by the Democratic National Committee .
It will send 22 delegates to the convention at which time they will have a combined 11 votes .

Ardie said the excitement for the presidential elections this go - round was tremendous .
The country committee tripled its membership in the last six months and doubled it in the last two , he said .
He would not say how many party members are registered but placed the number in the hundreds .
" We have people who are first - time voters .
We have people who were out of the voting process for many years , " he said . .
Prior to the vote , Democrats who had gathered at the central Jakarta hotel heard from both campaigns .
Gen. Wesley Clark spoke on behalf of Clinton .
" He had a very comprehensive and strong message in support of Hillary Clinton based upon his time he first met her in Arkansas , " Ardie said .
Obama 's sister Maya Soetoro - Ng " had a more personal description of her brother , " Ardie said .
She talked about why he would make a great president and " tied it back to some of his multi-cultural experiences while growing up in Indonesia . "
Obama lived in Indonesia as a child with his mother and step - father .
In his two books -- " Dreams From My Father " and " The Audacity of Hope " -- Obama noted that he spent two years in a Muslim school and another two years in a Catholic school while living in Indonesia from age 6 to 10 , starting in 1967 .
At a campaign stop in November , Obama told an Iowa audience that " probably the strongest experience I have in foreign relations is the fact that I spent four years living overseas when I was a child in Southeast Asia . "
Obama said his time there , and the fact that his father was from Kenya , gave him the knowledge " of how ordinary people in these other countries live . "
Later , Obama said the point he was trying to make in Iowa is that his time overseas " gives me some judgment and perspective around what other people think about America and how they might react or respond when we make some of the decisions that we make . "

All About Indonesia • Barack Obama • Hillary Clinton • U.S. Politics
SOME light was shone this week on the vexed question of the genetics of race in humans .
Lluís Quintana - Murci and his colleagues at the Pasteur Institute , in Paris , published a study in Nature Genetics that looked at which genes have undergone recent natural selection at different rates in different parts of the world , and might thus contribute to any biological differences between races .
Given the fraught nature of the subject , the results are gratifyingly uncontroversial .
Several of the differences
Dr Quintana - Murci detected are in genes for the superficial racial markers of skin colour and hair form .
Most of the others whose functions are known are connected either with diet or with resistance to disease .
Dr Quintana - Murci 's data were drawn from a project called HapMap , which catalogues what are known as single - nucleotide polymorphisms , or SNPs .
These are places where individual human genomes routinely differ from one another by a single genetic “ letter ” .
If such a variation happens inside a gene , as opposed to occurring in part of the “ junk ” DNA that pads the genome out , the result can be a change of function of the gene in question — the raw material of evolution .
Applying various statistical techniques to the 2.8 m SNPs so far catalogued by HapMap , Dr Quintana - Murci found 55 genes that showed evidence of having undergone significant localised evolution .
Six controlled skin pigment and hair development .
Four helped the immune system combat disease - causing organisms , such as malarial parasites , that are a problem in some places , but absent from others .
A further six regulated metabolism in various ways , probably in response to the different diets enjoyed by different people .
( Some of these genes are of wider interest as they are involved in obesity , diabetes and hypertension . )
Nine others had various other jobs that were also of no political significance .
All in all , the school of thought which holds that humans , for all their outward variety , are a pretty homogenous species received a boost .
There were , however , 30 locally selected genes whose functions are as yet unknown .
And it is possible that others have been overlooked .
This result promotes the brotherhood of man .
But it is probably not the last word on the matter .
