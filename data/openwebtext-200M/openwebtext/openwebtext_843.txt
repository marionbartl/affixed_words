Listen to the NORML Audio Stash today ( March 25 ) for a discussion of Massachusetts ’ tax and regulate proposals with Richard Evans .
Click here to tune in .
California ’s highly publicized effort to legalize the commercial cultivation and sale of cannabis is getting some well - deserved company !
A pair of bills — House Bill 2929 and Senate Bill 1801 — seeking to “ tax and regulate the cannabis industry ” have just been introduced in the Massachusetts legislature .
These proposals seek to legally regulate the commercial production and distribution of marijuana for adults over 21 years of age .
Like California ’s proposal , they would impose licensing requirements and excise taxes on the retail sale of cannabis .
By some estimates , these taxes could raise nearly $ 100 million in annual state revenue .
Adults who possess or grow marijuana for personal use , or who engage in the non-profit transfer of cannabis , would not be subject to taxation under the law .
You can read more about these bills at the new website : http://www.cantaxreg.com.
If you live in Massachusetts , we urge you to write your elected officials in support of H. 2929 and S. 1801 by going here .
“ Decades of whispered grumblings about the wisdom and efficacy of prohibition is rapidly giving way to a serious — really serious public discussion about how to replace it , ” said former NORML Board Member Richard Evans , who assisted in drafting the landmark legislation .
“ Those who consider themselves leaders in government and the media have the obligation to either show how prohibition can be made to work , or join in the exploration of alternatives . ”
We ca n’t think of a better place to begin this discussion on the east coast than Massachusetts , where last November 65 percent of voters endorsed a statewide initiative reclassifying marijuana possession as a fine - only offense under state law .
Will a majority of Bay State voters also support legalization ?
We may soon find out !

Suicide rates in the U.S. have increased for the first time in a decade , according to a report published in October by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health .
But what leads a person to commit suicide ?
Three new studies suggest that the neurological changes in a brain of a suicide victim differ markedly from those in other brains and that these changes develop over the course of a lifetime .
The most common pathway to suicide is through depression , which afflicts two thirds of all people who kill themselves .
In October researchers in Canada found that the depressed who commit suicide have an abnormal distribution of receptors for the chemical GABA , one of the most abundant neurotransmitters in the brain .
GABA ’s role is to inhibit neuron activity .
“ If you think about the gas pedal and brakes on a car , GABA is the brakes , ” explains co-author Michael Poulter , a neuroscientist at the Robarts Research Institute at the University of Western Ontario .
Poulter and his colleagues found that one of the thousands of types of receptors for GABA is underrepresented in the frontopolar cortex of people with major depressive disorder who have committed suicide as compared with nondepressed people who died of other causes .
The frontopolar cortex is involved in higher - order thinking , such as decision making .
The scientists do not yet know how this abnormality leads to the type of major depression that makes someone suicidal , but “ anything that disturbs that system would be predicted to have some sort of important outcome , ” Poulter says .
Interestingly , this GABA receptor problem is not the result of abnormal or mutated genes .
Rather the change is epigenetic , meaning some environmental influence affected how often the relevant genes were expressed — that is , made into proteins .
[ For more about epigenetics , see “ The New Genetics of Mental Illness , ” by Edmund S. Higgins ; Scientific American Mind , June / July 2008 . ]
In the frontopolar cortex of suicide brains , the gene for the GABA - A receptor often had a molecule called a methyl group attached to it , the team found .
When a methyl group is attached to a gene , it keeps that gene hidden from cells ’ protein - building machinery — in this case , preventing the cells from manufacturing GABA - A receptors .
The addition of this methyl tag , called methylation , occurs more extensively in rodents that are handled by humans than in rodents that are not .
Less is known about what causes methylation in the human brain , but another recent study suggests it could be related to abuse during childhood .
In May researchers at McGill University reported that the gene responsible for creating cells ’ protein - building machinery is more frequently methylated in the hippocampus — the brain region responsible for short - term memory and spatial navigation — of depressed suicide victims who suffered child abuse than in the brains of nonsuicide victims who were not abused .
Again , the researchers do not yet know how problems with protein - building machinery lead to depression and suicide .
But “ it makes sense that if you have some limited capacity for protein synthesis , you gradually are depriving yourself of building critical synapses , ” or connections between neurons , which could be important for staying happy , says co-author Moshe Szyf , a pharmacologist at McGill .
“ Our hypothesis is that there are social events early in life that kind of epigenetically program the brain , ” he says .
He and his colleagues are now comparing the brains of suicide victims who were abused with those of suicide victims who were not abused to see if their methylation patterns differ .
Even in the womb , epigenetic influences can change the developing brain in ways that increase the risk of eventual suicide .
In February 2008 a study revealed that baby boys who are born either short or with low birth weight are more likely to commit violent suicide as adults than longer and heavier babies are , irrespective of their height and weight as adults .
Similarly , baby boys born pre­maturely are four times more likely to attempt violent suicide than those born at full term .
The researchers , publishing in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health , suggest that the chemical serotonin , which is involved in fetal brain growth , may play a role .
A stressful or deprived womb environment may interfere with the development of the fetus and its serotonin system ; other studies have shown that the brains of people who exhibit suicidal be­haviors have reduced serotonin activity .
Ultimately , these findings reveal that suicide brains differ from other brains in multiple ways — in other words , “ we ’re really dealing with some sort of biological imbalance , ” Poulter says .
“ It ’s not an attitude problem . ”
And because epigenetic changes typically occur early in life , it may one day be possible to identify young people at risk for suicide by studying their methylation patterns and then to treat them with drugs that regulate this mechanism , Szyf notes .

For nearly 20 years emerging filmmakers from Winnipeg and across the country have benefited from The Canadian Independent Film and Video Fund , but this week the federal government announced it will shut the program down to cut costs .
Alberta filmmaker Wendy Walker is in Winnipeg this weekend shooting part of her upcoming documentary .
It 's an educational film that examines the relationship between aboriginal people and the rest of Canada .
" The disservice they 're doing to Canadians as a whole is horrific , " she told CTV News .
" How are we going to tell our stories ? "
The Canadian Independent Film and Video Fund was created in 1991 to help emerging filmmakers create social justice and educational films .
Walker says it 's going to be tough on her young colleagues .
Since its launch the fund has given money to 1,000 projects from across Canada .
In 2008 it supported 59 film and video projects .
The Conservatives announced this week that the fund will be terminated at the end of March , along with $ 9 million worth of other arts funding .
Its money the federal government says it needs for its $ 40 billion economic stimulus package .
Phyllis Laing , producer of The Stone Angel and Guy Madden 's My Winnipeg says the funding should not be considered expendable .
" A country should never cut off its voice , " she says .
Laing , who is also president of Winnipeg 's Buffalo Gal Pictures , says the fund helped her as a young producer .
" A lot of new directors and filmmakers got their start through this fund and that 's going to be a significant loss . "
Canadian Independent Film and Video Fund plans on appealing the decision .

If you thought that the pilot who landed US Airways flight 1549 on the Hudson River was cool , you have n't seen this simulation with the real FAA voice recordings .
I 'm absolutely stunned by his nerves .

The captain of Cactus 1549 — the codename for flight 1549 — is cooler than Batman , Iron Man , and frikkin Admiral Adama all rolled into one .
Chesley " Sully " Sullenberger , 57 , is a former US Air Force fighter pilot who left the military in 1980 .
Couple that with the fact that he is also a safety expert and a glider pilot , and you will understand why his nerves are made of steel .
Jump to minute 1:26 , when the birds hit the fans and all the action starts .
Then , keep listening until he decices to go down onto the Hudson river rather than going to Teterboro airport 's runway one :
AWE1549 : Ah this is Cactus 1549 hit birds .
We lost thrust in both engines .
We 're turning back towards Laguardia
L116 ( NY departure radar contact ) : OK , yeah , you need to return to Laguardia .
Turn left heading of uh two two zero .
AWE1549 : Two two zero .
L116 ( to Laguardia tower ) : Tower stop your departures .
We got an emergency returning .
LGA : Who is it ?
L116 : It 's 1529 ( sic ) .
He got a bird strike .
He lost all engines .
He lost the thrust in the engines .
He 's returning immediately .
LGA : Cactus 1529 which engines ???
L116 : He lost thrust in both engines , he said .
L116 : Cactus 1529 if we can get it to you , do you want to try to land runway one three ?
AWE1549 : We 're unable .
We may end up in the Hudson .
L116 : Alright Cactus 1549 , it 's going to be left traffic to runway three one .
( First he got the number wrong and now he 's not listening .
Is this guy this thick ? )
AWE1549 : Unable .
L116 : OK , what do you need to land ?
( big iron balls , that 's what )
L116 : Cactus 1549 runway four is available if you want to make left traffic to runway four .
AWE1549 : I 'm not sure we can make any runway .
What 's over to our right ?
Anything in New Jersey ?
Maybe Teterboro ?
L116 : OK , yeah , off to your right side is Teterboro airport .

L116 : Cactus 1529 ( again ? ) over the George Washington Bridge wants to go to the airport right now .
TEB : He wants to go to our airport .
Check .
Does he need any assistance ?
L116 : Ah yes , he was a bird strike .
Can I get him in for runway one ?
TEB : Runway one , that 's good .
L116 : Cactus 1549 turn right two eight zero .
You can land on runway one at Teterboro .
AWE1549 : We can't do it .

Lord Stern , the economist who produced the single most influential political document on climate change , says he underestimated the risks of global warming and the damage that could result from it .
The situation was worse than he had thought when he completed his review two - and - a - half years ago , he told a conference yesterday , but politicians do not yet grasp the scale of the dangers now becoming apparent .
" Do politicians understand just how difficult it could be , just how devastating rises of 4C , 5C or 6C could be ?
I think , not yet , " Lord Stern posed to the meeting of scientists in Copenhagen .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" A rise of 5C would be a temperature the world has not seen for 30 to 50 million years .
We 've been around only 100,000 years as human beings .
We do n't know what that 's like .
" We have n't seen 3C for a few million years , and we do n't know what that looks like either . "
Lord Stern said new research done in the past two or three years had made it clear there were " severe risks " if global temperature rose by the predicted 4C to 7C by 2100 .
Agriculture would be destroyed and life would be impossible over much of the planet , the former World Bank chief economist said .
Now a professor at the London School of Economics , Lord Stern referred to the higher temperature rises several times at the conference .
The scientists are meeting in the Danish capital as a precursor to the major UN meeting in December which aims to find a successor to the Kyoto Protocol climate treaty .
Commissioned by Gordon Brown when Chancellor , and issued in October 2006 , the 700 - page Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change is the single most influential political document on global warming yet published .
It has been closely studied by the governments of every major country .
The report said the costs of acting to counter climate change , by stabilising emissions of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , might be about 1 per cent of annual global GDP by 2050 .
But the cost of doing nothing was found to be far greater – risking up to 20 per cent of the world 's wealth .
Yesterday , Lord Stern revised this prediction , saying the cost of inaction would be " 50 per cent or more higher " than his previous highest estimate – meaning it could cost a third of the world 's wealth .
The conference has been hearing detail on research done following the Stern review , including claims sea levels are likely to rise twice as fast as predicted in the last UN climate change report in 2007 .
Lord Stern said the world 's population needed to be aware of the implications of climate change , with many areas devastated by hurricanes and others drying out .
" Much of southern Europe would look like the Sahara .
Many of the major rivers of the world , serving billions of people , would dry up in the dry seasons or re-route . "
Billions of people would have to relocate as a result , he said .
" What would be the implication of that ?
Extended conflict , social disruption , war essentially , over much of the world , for many decades .
" This is the kind of implication that follows from temperature increases of that magnitude .
I think it 's vital that people understand the magnitude of the risks , but also that they understand that [ by cutting emissions ] we can reduce the probability of going there very dramatically , " Lord Stern said .
Then and now : How Stern 's view changed
Temperatures
A central assumption of the 2006 Stern Report was global temperatures would rise by between 2C and 3C over the current century if nothing was done to counter global warming .
Stern also mentioned the possibility of a 4C rise .
Yesterday , Stern said 4C , 5C , 6C and even 7C degree rises were a real possibility by the end of the 21st century , taking the world into new territory - agriculture would be destroyed and life impossible in many areas .
Costs
Stern created a sliding scale in the 2006 report which measured the costs of doing nothing on climate change .
At the upper limit was the chance the damage would amount to 20 per cent of global Gross Domestic Product – a fifth of the world 's wealth .
Yesterday , Stern revised his estimate saying the cost would be 50 per cent higher " or more " than the previous highest guess – risking a third of the world 's wealth or a 30 per cent plus reduction in consumption per head .
One - time security consultant and significant black hat John Schiefer has been sentenced to four years in federal prison after pleading guilty to multiple counts of fraud last April .
Schiefer 's case began in 2007 when he was charged with having installed malware on computers without the consent of the owner .
The responsibilities and permissions granted to Schiefer as a security consultant during his day job afforded him ample opportunity to play black hat on the side ; Schiefer and his associates were charged with creating a botnet of up to 250,000 zombies .
Both the case and today 's ruling are the first of their kind in the United States ; presiding Judge Howard Matz apparently wanted to send a strong message to anyone engaged in similar activities .
Schiefer 's transgressions were standard ; the Department of Justice ( DoJ ) reported in April that " Schiefer ’s ... malware allowed him to intercept communications sent between victims ’ computers and financial institutions , such as PayPal .
Schiefer sifted through those intercepted communications and mined usernames and passwords to accounts ... Schiefer made purchases ... transferred funds ...[ and ] also gave the stolen usernames and passwords , as well as the wiretapped communications , to others . "
Finally , Schiefer pled guilty to defrauding a Dutch advertising company , which hired him to install its software only on the systems of customers who chose to use it .
Instead , the former security worker installed the program unilaterally and picked up a $ 19,000 check for his efforts .
Part of his sentence today involves making restitution on that fund .
As the recession has sunk its teeth into the economy , various web security companies have made headlines by predicting that out - of - work techies will turn to botnet mastering or various other illegal businesses to earn a living .
His sentence may have a chilling effect on someone who might be contemplating a move to the dark side : it 's hard to provide for one 's family without a job , but it 's even harder to do so from inside a federal prison .

That ’s fabulous !
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Bernard Madoff , accused mastermind of a $ 50 billion investment fraud , is expected to plead guilty to criminal charges next week , three months after his arrest shocked his customers worldwide .
A court document signed on Friday by prosecutors and Madoff ’s lead attorney indicated the once - respected Wall Street trader and investment manager would waive an indictment and plead guilty to criminal charges .
A March 12 hearing was scheduled for Madoff to appear in court for arraignment on the charges , said a clerk for Judge Denny Chin in U.S. District Court in Manhattan .
Defendants enter a plea of guilty or not guilty at arraignments .
Madoff , who authorities said confessed to his scheme in December , has not formally answered any charges .
Madoff is under house arrest .
He is also is set to appear at a March 10 hearing on a potential conflict of interest involving his main lawyer , Ira Sorkin .
Legal experts said all signs indicate that a guilty plea has been negotiated in what authorities have called the biggest Ponzi scheme in Wall Street history .
The purported swindle ran for decades but collapsed in last year ’s market meltdown .
In a separate court document filed on Friday , the government asked the judge to require notice of one day before the “ plea proceeding scheduled for March 12 from potential victims who wish to be heard during that proceeding . ”
In Washington on Friday , the agency established by Congress to help investors in failed brokerages , including Madoff ’s firm , said it had sent out the first checks to his former customers .
The Securities Investor Protection Corp said it had sent four checks , but no amounts were disclosed .
Investors are eligible to receive up to $ 500,000 from SIPC .
The deadline for claims is July 2 .
Madoff ’s lawyers and the U.S. Attorney ’s Office in Manhattan declined to comment directly on any plea deal .
“ This is the first step in order to enter a plea agreement , ” said Peter Henning , a professor at Wayne State University Law School in Detroit and a former federal prosecutor .
Prosecutors charged and arrested Madoff on December 11 after the FBI said he confessed to running a “ giant Ponzi scheme ” with $ 50 billion in losses over many years .
A Ponzi scheme is one in which early investors are paid with the money of new clients .

OTHERS INVOLVED ?
One legal expert said it is likely that any plea deal would include Madoff ’s agreement to cooperate with the government ’s investigation into the purported swindle , which bilked banks , wealthy clients , small investors and charities worldwide .
If other people were ultimately charged and put on trial , Madoff ’s sentencing could be delayed until those cases were resolved , legal experts said .
No one else has been charged , but few believe that Madoff could have carried out a complex scheme on his own .
“ Federal conspiracy law can reach far and wide , and undoubtedly the government is going to be looking to charge a conspiracy , ” said Bradley Simon , a white - collar criminal defense attorney not involved in the Madoff case .
Madoff was charged in December with one count of securities fraud and faces up to 20 years in jail .
The 70 - year - old could spend the rest of his life in prison .
In the meantime , he is out on $ 10 million bail and under house arrest in his $ 7 million New York apartment with 24 - hour surveillance .
Madoff ’s assets and those of his firm , Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC , have been frozen by court order as a trustee works to recover money for former customers .
Less than $ 1 billion has been recovered so far .
The Madoff scandal has been one of the biggest white - collar criminal cases in recent memory .
His clients included numerous celebrities , according to court documents .
Investors say he lured them through his reputation for posting amazingly consistent returns that prosecutors now say were fiction .
If Madoff pleaded guilty , that would not put an end to the wave of private litigation stemming from the scandal .
Besides the March 12 hearing , he is also to appear in court on Tuesday before the same judge to address a potential conflict involving his lawyer .
Madoff must tell the judge at that hearing that he is aware that 17 years ago his lawyer Sorkin represented two accountants who invested with Madoff in a civil case that was settled .
The case is USA v Madoff 08 - mj-02735 in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ) .

Blood type link to pancreatic cancer risk
People with type O blood have a lower risk of developing pancreatic cancer , say US researchers .
The researchers believe the study may also help explain what causes one of the deadliest kinds of cancer .
The study found that compared to people with type O blood , those with type A have a 32 % higher risk of pancreatic cancer , those with type AB have a 51 % higher risk and those with type B have a 72 % higher risk .
The findings , appearing in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute , were based on 107,503 men and women whose health has been tracked since the 1970s and 1980s .
The findings are not likely to have immediate value for doctors and patients dealing with the disease , but could play a role in the future in developing useful screening methods , says Dr Brian Wolpin of the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and Harvard Medical School , who led the study .
New insights
Finding this association between blood type and pancreatic cancer risk gives scientists new insight into the biological mechanisms involved in the disease , says Wolpin .
" There are very few known genetic risk factors for pancreatic cancer , " he says .
" What this study shows is that blood type , which is defined by a gene on your ninth chromosome , appears to be associated with risk of developing this disease . "
" It may indicate that either this gene that defines your blood type , or a nearby gene on chromosome nine , is important and may actually be an inherited risk factor for pancreatic cancer . " .
According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare , approximately 2000 Australians die of pancreatic cancer every year , making it the sixth leading cause of cancer death in Australia .
Pancreatic cancer often spreads quickly and in many people is not detected until it is in an advanced stage when surgical removal is not possible .
* Bankers express support for Obama plans
* Bankers say March was “ a little rough ”
* Obama says he asked bankers to ‘ show some restraint ’ ( Adds Obama quote , paragraphs 5 - 6 ) )
WASHINGTON , March 27 ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama won support from top bankers on Friday for his efforts to rid financial institutions of bad debts , but differences remained over broader U.S. plans for the financial industry .
Chief executives from Wells Fargo WFC.N , JP Morgan Chase JPM.N and other financial giants met Obama at the White House and echoed his call for cooperation to help the economy .
But their statements about tough trading conditions in March overshadowed the positive spin the executives and the White House sought to give to the meeting .
“ The basic message is we ’re all in this thing together , ” Wells Fargo Chief Executive John Stumpf told reporters after the meeting , with other bank executives at his side .
Obama , in an interview later with CBS News , said he told the bankers they should be more sensitive to how Wall Street ’s actions look to the rest of the country .
“ Show some restraint , ” he said he told them .
“ Show that you get that this is a crisis and everybody has to make sacrifices . ” [ n N27519377 ]
Obama saw the meeting as productive and frank , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said , adding the president stressed the importance of dealing with “ toxic assets ” -- bad loans many banks are stuck with thanks to the collapse of the U.S. housing market .
“ The president opened up by talking about the importance of dealing with toxic assets and getting banks lending again , ” Gibbs told a briefing .
The meeting came just days after the U.S. Treasury Department provided details on a government plan to cleanse banks ’ balance sheets of up to $ 1 trillion in distressed loans and securities , a plan the banks will have to support in order for it to work .
White House advisers said the president wanted to get a snapshot of the economy from the banking chiefs , and the message they sent was lukewarm .
" March was a little rough , " said JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon .
Bank of America's BAC.N Ken Lewis said his institution 's " trading book for March was not as good " as it was the first two months of the year .
The comments pushed bank stocks and the overall market lower . [ n N27359180 ]
The White House meeting came ahead of next week ’s G20 summit , at which Obama is expected to pitch his plans to rescue the recession - hit U.S. economy to fellow world leaders .
[ n N26491633 ]
BONUSES , TARP MONEY
The executives , who have often found themselves bearing the brunt of Obama ’s criticism about the financial mess and the bonuses many executives in the struggling industry accepted , said not all issues were agreed upon at the meeting .
One hot topic involves government bailout funds and executive compensation limits .
Financial analysts are concerned that if healthier banks return government money to get out of newly imposed executive pay rules , weaker banks that cannot afford to return the funds will be stigmatized .
Dimon said Obama did not instruct the bankers to stop considering an early return of some of the bailout funds that they received as part of the government ’s $ 700 billion rescue plan for the financial industry .
Disagreements aside , the two sides acknowledged the need for regulatory reform .
“ It ’s fair to say that they agreed on the need to update the framework of regulations , ” Gibbs said .
The Obama administration announced on Thursday its plan to rewrite financial rules , including creating a single regulator to monitor any firm whose failure could threaten the financial system . [ n N26587221 ]
Officials said executive compensation was discussed , although it did not dominate the conversation , and bankers indicated a public outcry over the issue had sunk in .
“ We know mistakes were made ” around executive compensation , JPMorgan ’s Dimon told CNBC after the meeting .
Bank of America ’s Lewis said everyone understood the “ golden age ” of bank pay was over .
About 15 chief executives attended , according to the White House , including Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs GS.N and Vikram Pandit of Citigroup C.N .
Others on the list included chiefs from Freddie Mac FRE.P , Bank of New York Mellon BK.N , Northern Trust NTRS.O , PNC Financial PNC.N , State Street STT.N , Morgan Stanley MS.N , American Bankers Association and Independent Community Bankers .

These experiments may help explain the “ Obama effect ” on the test performance of African - Americans .
Adult subjects in a study ( still unpublished ) answered comprehension questions from the verbal sections of the Graduate Record Examinations before and just after the presidential election .
The black participants who were tested before the vote performed worse than whites ; those tested immediately afterward scored almost as well as whites .
If simple interventions can have big effects , one might assume that bigger interventions would always be even better .
But the truth is that some big interventions in education have had only minimal effects .
Head Start , which places 3 - and 4 - year - olds in supposedly enriched classroom settings , and Early Head Start , which works with 1 - to 3 - year - olds , for example , have been found to have only modest effects on the children ’s academic achievement , and these often fade by early elementary school .
Likewise , “ whole - school interventions , ” in which teams of education engineers descend on a school and change its curriculum , introduce new textbooks and train teachers  often at great expense  typically produce little in the way of educational gain .
Some bigger programs have worked well , however .
The Perry Preschool , which was set up in Ypsilanti , Mich. , in the early 1960s , is a good example .
In this school , highly trained and motivated teachers worked with groups of only six black preschoolers in educationally intensive sessions intended to help the severely disadvantaged children develop both cognitively and socially , and the teachers visited the children ’s families for 90 minutes every week .
By the time these students reached high school , almost half of them scored above the 10th percentile on the California Achievement Test , compared with only 14 percent of students in a control group .
Almost two - thirds of the students who had been in the program graduated from high school , compared with only 43 percent of control students .
And by age 27 , one - third of the Perry children owned their own home ; only 11 percent of the control students did .
James Heckman , a Nobel Prize - winning economist at the University of Chicago , has estimated that for every dollar spent on a prekindergarten like Perry , $ 8 has been gained in higher incomes for participants and in savings on the costs of extra schooling , crime and welfare .
Similarly , a program called KIPP ( for Knowledge Is Power Program ) is having remarkable success with poor minority children in middle schools .
KIPP students attend school from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. , their term is three weeks longer than normal , and every other Saturday they have classes for half a day .
The curriculum includes sports , visits to museums and instruction in dance , art , music , theater and photography .
During one academic year , the percentage of fifth - graders at KIPP schools in the San Francisco Bay Area who scored at or above the national average on the reading portion of the Stanford Achievement Test rose to 44 percent from 25 percent .
And while only 37 percent started the year at or above the national average in math , 65 percent reached that level by spring .
Such creative programs must be tested to ensure that they work as they are meant to .
The United States Department of Education ’s What Works Clearinghouse , which was established by the Bush administration , has the job of making public all significant evaluations of educational interventions .
The Obama administration should heed the Clearinghouse ’s reports .
Stimulus money should be spent only on programs that work well  and on creating new programs , which in turn should be properly tested for effectiveness .
President Obama is in a position to not only inspire black youngsters by his example , but also make an enormous difference in their schooling  as long as he supports successful educational interventions , from the smallest to the most ambitious .
WEB WORRY WORDS : THE NEW THREAT TO OUR CHILDREN INTERNET SAFETY EXPERTS REVEAL THE TEN WORDS EVERY PARENT SHOULD FEAR
As children as young as five now use the internet without supervision , how can mums and dads be sure that their child is not taking part in conversations or messaging that will lead them into danger ?
Research published today by internet safety experts Sentry Parental Controls reveal the ten most common words that parents are blocking their children ( under 16s ) from using or searching for in order to help keep their child safe from internet predators , exposure to inappropriate material or dangerous social networking groups .
The top ten words that parents are monitoring are :
1. Suicide
2. Alone
3. Dope
4. EMO
5. Bully
6. Depressed
7. Skinny
8. Breasts
9. Willy
10 . Hate
The ten chosen worry words were drawn from Sentry 's extensive work in the US and UK looking at what words parents most frequently have to block on their home computers using the Sentry software .
Blocked words then send an alert signal to parents when children use or are sent messages featuring these words .
While parents naturally worry about their children accessing explicit sex sites or finding out more about drugs , there are other far more subtle aspects of our children 's behaviour - such as searching for skinny celebrities or taking an unusual interest in death - that should act as red flags for us to start talking to them about their concerns .

WHEN PUTIN WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT
of Russia in 2000 , Russia was bankrupt .
The nation owed $ 16.6 billion to the Rothschild - run International Monetary Fund while its foreign debt to the Rothschild - controlled Paris & London Club Of Creditors was over 36 billion dollars .
But Putin took advantage of the current boom in world oil prices by redirecting a portion of the profits of Russia ’s largest oil producer Gazprom so as to pay off the country ’s debt .
The continual surge in oil prices greatly accelerated Russia ’s capacity to restore financial sovereignty .
By 2006 Putin had paid off Russia ’s debt to the Rothschilds .
Russia ’s financial dependence on the Jewish financiers was now over .
Putin could then establish what became his Russian Unity Party ’s 2007 campaign slogan : Putin ’s Plan Means Victory For Russia !
This slogan continues to make the New World Order Jews very nervous …
Here .
PUTIN WINS THE BATTLE FOR OIL OVER THE ROTHSCHILDS
ROTHSCHILD AGENT MIKHAIL KHORDORKOVSKY , a Russian Jew , gained his fortune along with many other Jewish oligarchs , by exploiting the Yeltsin era ’s privatizations .
With the backing of Jacob Rothschild , Khordorkovsky started the bank Menatep Banking Group just prior to the fall of communism in 1990 .
The Menatep Banking Group is associated with the Rothschild - Soros Carlyle Group Here .
In 1995 , Khordorkovsky bought Yukos Oil for $ 350 million .
He became one of the world ’s richest men with a personal worth of at least $ 1 billion .
In October of 2003 Khordorkovsky was arrested for embezzlement .
As most wealthy Jews who use their financial power to subvert their host nation , Khordorkovsky set himself up as a critic of Putin ’s efforts to unite Russia politically , culturally , and spiritually .
Khordorkovsky spent millions of dollars to overthrow Putin by funding “ democratic reforming parties ” by which Jews take control of their host nation .
THE ROTHSCHILDS & THEIR RUSSIAN JEWISH AGENT
THAT THE ROTHSCHILDS WERE BEHIND Khordorkovsky ’s acquisition of Menatep Banking & Yukos Oil is proven by the following :
* In February of 2004 , right after Khordorkovsky ’s arrest , Khordorkovsky ’s Menatep Bank was revealed to be operating out of the Isle of Man , a UK offshore tax haven .
At this time , Menatep offered Yukos shares to Putin in exchange for Khordorkovsky ’s freedom .
But Putin did not need to wheel & deal with the Jewish financiers .
Putin simply nationalized Yukos Oil shortly after the Menatep offer .
* The British press reported that Khordorkovsky ’s shares in Yukos Oil were passed to Jacob Rothschild just prior to Khordorkovsky ’s arrest .
* But Menatep denied that Jacob Rothschild had any power in the Group .
Their statement declared that Jacob Rothschild had close links with Menatep only through the Open Russia Foundation whose trustee membership included Henry Kissinger .
But Menatep failed to mention that the Open Russia Foundation was founded by Yukos Oil Here .
PUTIN’S PLAN TO UNITE RUSSIA UNDER CHRISTIANITY
JEWS DESPISE a nation committed to Christianity .
Vladimir Putin , now in full control of Russia as Prime Minister , wishes to build a strong Christian nation .
In a televised Christmas message on January 7 2008 Putin said :
— “ The Russian Orthodox Church contributes to the promotion of moral values in society .
One should not completely draw a line between the culture and the church .
Of course by law in our country the church is separate from the state .
But in the soul and the history of our people it ’s all together .
It always has been and always will be . ” —
Here .
Indeed , Putin aspires to unite the state of Russia with the Orthodox Church .
A debt - free nation fused with a strong Christian ethic is what the Rothschilds & all Jews fear most …

JANUARY 23 -- Add heroin to the scores of products that have been branded with President Barack Obama 's name .
Cops in upstate New York this week broke up a drug ring that allegedly sold heroin under several brand names , including " Obama " '
As seen in Sullivan County Sheriff 's Office photos , the president 's surname was stamped in red ink on small glassine wrappers that were peddled by street dealers .
Investigators arrested five suspects for their alleged roles in the narcotics distribution activity .
The branding of illicit drugs is a favorite of pushers , who have previously sold bin Laden heroin , Harry Potter Ecstasy , bricks of Teletubbies cocaine , and green - tinted crack in recognition of St. Patrick 's Day .

I was reading an article elsewhere which suggested that " there 's some nasty conspiracy theories going around about the surprising lack of funding for the thus - far - successful Airborne Laser program .
Once lasers get rolling , combat aircraft suddenly become a LOT less viable ... " .
the conspiracy being that the US Air force would only be human if they were leery about seeing a weapon developed that could put them out of business .
We have also been seeing increasing numbers of cases where kids with laser pens have been seriously interfering with pilots landing at international airports .
Scale that up & I find you get .... Anything that can shoot down shells can clearly knock down aircraft which are larger , slower & stay there longer .
Look at the time frame here as well - this was done in 2004 , which in terms of high tech electronics is a generation ago .
If it could be put on a trailer back then it could probably be put in a van next year .
Think what could be put on a destroyer !
I do n't know exactly what armed forces are going to look like when such things are widely deployed & I 'm sure that is worrying the USAF too .
However history is full of nations that invested purely in the sort of weapons they had in the last war & of how they lost the next one .
There are further articles on laser weapons here but most of them are not currently practical like THEL .
Talking of which Britain 's military flag carriers on which we are spending billions are to be ... This is also going to ( or perhaps already has ) made the SDI programme realistic .
After all it only requires scaling up & if the batteries on a truck can destroy incoming shells a 1GW nuclear reactor , diverted for a few seconds , could destroy incoming ICBMs or even spy satellites .
One happy result of this is that the threat of a military dictatorship based on the fact that in a space war those in space always have the physical high ground ( common to Heinlein 's Starship Troopers , Moon is a Harsh Mistress , Space Cadet ) may be gone because lasers are not affected by gravity .
And an entirely different piece of military hardware is this exoskeleton enabling somebody to run at 10 mph or carry a 200 lb backpack which , if the bugs have been worked out of it will revolutionise infantry war & ultimately is a step towards the battle suits of the aforementioned Starship Troopers .
It is known as the HULC ( Human Universal load Carrier so no copyright infringment ) & the video is here
There are other directions in which military capacity is changing - computer war , genetically modified diseases , miniaturised remotely handled bombs & assassination devices & I 'm sure many more .
None of these will , fortunately , enhance the power of scientifically backward terrorists like al Quaeda , quite the opposite .
But they certainly will not enhance the power of states which think that " punching above our weight " in purely conventional weaponry , rather than scientific & economic progress will maintain a " top nation " status .
History does not come to an end .

ATLANTA , July 7 , 2015 / PRNewswire / — ICD - 10 Charts ( www.icd10charts.com) announced today that after 6 months of development , it has officially launched its newest line of ICD - 10 preparation resources , the ICD - 10 Charts Training Academy and the new 4 Step ICD - 10 Implementation Plan .
Both of these resources , as well as all other ICD - 10 Charts resources and mobile apps , are available to any medical practice in America , completely free - of - charge .
With the release of these resources , the company has created a revolutionary new solution to the mounting concerns surrounding the transition from the ICD - 9 to ICD - 10 coding system , which is set to take place on October 1 , 2015 .
The state - of - the - art ICD - 10 Charts implementation resources and training modules are the very first of their kind to ever be released in the ICD - 10 industry , and are unparalleled in usefulness and innovation .
The 4 Step Program , delineated below , provides a unique platform for physicians and coders to learn their relevant ICD - 10 codes , a means to integrate these codes into their practice , and over 15 hours of comprehensive ICD - 10 training modules which are custom - tailored based on the specialty of the medical practice in question .
Any practice can go through these 4 Steps at any time by clicking “ Begin ” on the ICD - 10 Charts homepage .
To watch a brief informational video about the new 4 Step Program and the ICD - 10 Charts Training Academy , go to www.icd10charts.com/4steps or click below .

Step 1 : Convert
The first step in any practice 's personalized implementation plan is to convert all of their ICD - 9 codes to ICD - 10 .
While the traditional method for doing this requires weeks of manually searching and converting ICD - 9 codes , with help of the ICD - 10 Charts Bulk Converter , up to 10,000 ICD - 9 codes can be converted instantly , at the touch of a button .
These codes are then automatically arranged by body - system , and organized as either “ 1:1 conversions ” ( red ) which require no additional specificity , and “ increased specificity ” conversions ( blue ) which do require increased specificity in ICD - 10 .
This allows physicians and coders to rapidly identify which of their practices relevant ICD - 9 codes will require additional detail in ICD - 10 .
Step 2 : Organize
All of the ICD - 9 and ICD - 10 codes from Step 1 are automatically populated into the ICD - 10 Charts , ChartBuilder , which is widely considered to be the most user - friendly and technologically advanced conversion platform to ever exist for ICD - 10 .
ChartBuilder can be used to organize and customize your chart in numerous different ways including :
Searching / Converting for additional codes by ICD - 9 , ICD - 10 - CM , the diagnosis description or ICD - 10 PCS
Adding , removing , and rearranging codes from your chart
Editing diagnosis descriptions to use the same medical terminology used in your practice
Sorting diagnosis codes by ICD - 9 , ICD - 10 , or alphabetically
“ Combination Coder ” tool consolidates all the ICD - 9 codes that combine together to a single ICD - 10 code , thus allowing for quick identification of the various combination codes in ICD - 10
Step 3 : Integrate
ICD - 10 Charts offers a wide range of options for integrating your personalized ICD - 10 Chart into your practice .
Print your chart immediately for distribution around your practice
Save an unlimited number of charts , and access all your saved charts at anytime through My Charts
Export your chart to excel format , for integration into various EMR systems .
Practices will soon also be able to export their charts to .pdf format , and share their charts via email or on Facebook to help other colleagues with their ICD - 10 implementation
Step 4 : Training
The final step for any practice 's ICD - 10 preparation is the ICD - 10 Charts Training Academy .
The Training Academy is a free ICD - 10 training portal which creates custom - tailored ICD - 10 courses for every different medical specialty .
The program is made up of 6 professionally - narrated “ Stages , ” filled with general ICD - 10 information , followed by 20 unique “ Chapters ” of specific ICD - 10 coding information which are separated by body system .
The training modules were developed by a team of ICD - 10 experts and software engineers , and were built using the best eLearning software in the industry .
The modules themselves are fully - interactive and filled with numerous coding practice problems , to maximize content retention .
ICD - 10 Charts also offers the only training program on the market that has integrated Search / Convert functionality built - in to each coding practice problem , which simulate real - life ICD - 10 coding scenarios in the field .
To learn more about the ICD - 10 Charts Training Academy , go to training.icd10charts.com .
While the founders , Parth Desai and Will Pattiz , are committed to providing all of these resources completely free - of - charge , they do accept donations on their website for use of their services .
However , perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this project , is that in lieu of keeping any of the donations for themselves , the two young men send 100 % of all contributions given to ICD - 10 Charts , to support earthquake relief efforts in Nepal .
Founder and medical student Parth Desai , who himself was on his way to provide clinical aid to the impoverished nation following today 's ICD - 10 Charts product release , preferred not to comment on the altruism of his company , and instead deferred to the quotation by the Saint Basil the Great .
“ A tree is known by its fruit ; a man by his deeds .
A good deed is never lost ; he who sows courtesy reaps friendship , and he who plants kindness gathers love . ”

Stressful experiences in early childhood can have long - lasting impacts on kids ' health that persist well beyond the resolution of the situation .
The conclusion comes from a study revealing impaired immune function in adolescents who , as youngsters , experienced either physical abuse or time in an orphanage , when compared to peers who never experienced such difficult circumstances .
The report from the University of Wisconsin - Madison appears online the week of Jan. 26 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" Even though these children 's environments have changed , physiologically they 're still responding to stress .
That can affect their learning and their behavior , and having a compromised immune system is going to affect these children 's health , " says senior author Seth Pollak , a professor of psychology and pediatrics at UW - Madison .
As director of the Child Emotion Laboratory in the UW - Madison Waisman Center , Pollak focuses on how experiences early in life affect children 's subsequent development .
In the current work , he and fellow Wisconsin psychology professor Chris Coe , an expert on the links between stress and immunity , turned to the immune system as a way to isolate the consequences of early events .
" The immune system is not preset at birth , " says Coe .
" The cells are there , but how they will develop and how well they 'll be regulated is very much influenced by your early environment and the type of rearing you have . "
Led by Elizabeth Shirtcliff of the University of New Orleans when she was a postdoctoral fellow at UW - Madison , the authors evaluated immune - system strength among adolescents who had experienced either typical or unusually stressful childhoods .
The researchers looked for high levels of antibodies against the common and usually latent herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV - 1 ) .

While roughly two - thirds of Americans carry this virus , which causes cold sores and fever blisters , people with healthy immune systems are able to keep the virus in check and rarely if ever have symptoms — typically , only when stress or illness taxes the immune system .
However , people with weakened immune systems may have trouble suppressing HSV - 1 and produce antibodies against the activated virus .
" We can use the control of latent viruses as one way of assessing the competence of the immune system , " Coe explains .
" During times of stress or if the immune system is not appropriately regulated , the herpes virus is more likely to reactivate . "
A group of adolescents with documented incidents of past physical abuse and stressful home environments had higher levels of HSV - 1 antibodies , showing that their immune systems were compromised .
" That is very unfortunate , but it was not surprising , " Pollak says , since stress is widely known to have negative impacts on immune function .
" It suggests that children 's emotional environments are having widespread repercussions on their health . "
What was more surprising , however , was that another group of adolescents in the study , who spent time in orphanages in Romania , Russia or China before being adopted by U.S. families , showed a similar impairment of immune regulation .
advertisement
" These children began their lives in a stressful environment , but they 're now adolescents , and for a decade , they 've been living in stable , affluent , loving environments .
And yet , their immune systems are compromised as well .
In fact , they look just like the physically abused kids , " says Pollak .
While antibodies are typically measured in blood , the researchers used saliva instead to eliminate any acute stress related to collecting the samples .
There was no difference among the groups in likelihood of carrying HSV - 1 , so the results reflect a difference only in the ability to fight its activation .
" The bottom line is that these early stressors can really have long - term implications , " Pollak says .
He is particularly concerned about the implications of his findings given the current economic downturn .
International adoptions are expensive and will likely become harder for many U.S. families , leaving greater numbers of children in institutional settings for longer periods of time .
The work was supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Creators of the U.S. television show “ Family Guy ” did not infringe copyright when they transformed the song “ When You Wish Upon a Star ” for comical use in an episode , a U.S. judge ruled on Monday .
Animated characters Stewie ( L ) and Brian from the series ' Family Guy ' are shown on the screen at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles , California September 16 , 2007 .

Music Publisher Bourne Co. , the U.S. copyright owner of the song made famous in Walt Disney ’s “ Pinocchio , ” sued Fox Broadcasting Co. , creator Seth MacFarlane and producers in October 2007 for copyright breach .
The lawsuit said the song “ I Need a Jew , ” featured in one of the animated show ’s episodes , was a thinly veiled copy of the music from ‘ When You Wish Upon a Star ’ coupled with “ new anti-Semitic lyrics ” and had done damage to the original .
But U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts ruled that the lyrics and tone of the song used in “ Family Guy ” were “ strikingly different . ”
The judge also said it was fair for it to be imitated for humorous effect since the music publisher had benefited from the song ’s association with other more “ wholesome ” shows like “ Pinocchio . ”
“ It is precisely that beneficial association that opens the song up for ridicule by parodists seeking to take the wind out of such lofty , magical , or pure associations , ” she said .
The song , by composer Leigh Harline and lyricist Ned Washington , was introduced in 1940 in the movie “ Pinocchio ” and won an Academy Award for Best Original Song that same year .
It has been recorded by more than 100 artists and orchestras .
Fox , owned by Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp , initially did not distribute the controversial “ Family Guy ” episode in recognition of how offensive it was , the suit claimed .
It was eventually broadcast on the Cartoon Network in 2003 and has run at least 36 times in syndication and reruns .
Bourne Co. did not return a call seeking comment .
Congress will hold a hearing next month into why Postmaster General John E. Potter has gotten a nearly 40 percent pay raise since 2006 and was awarded a six - figure incentive bonus last year , even as the U.S. Postal Service faces a multibillion - dollar shortfall that threatens a day of mail delivery .
“ Last year , the Postal Service took a loss of nearly $ 3 billion and recommended that the public take austere cuts in service to allow it to operate , including cutting a day of mail delivery and raising the price of stamps , ” Rep. Stephen F. Lynch , Massachusetts Democrat , said Friday .
“ All things considered , I think most postal customers feel that the huge increase in pay for Mr. Potter is incongruent with the post office ’s recent performance .
I assure you that our subcommittee will look into this matter at a hearing in March , ” said Mr. Lynch , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee that oversees the Postal Service .
On Tuesday , The Washington Times reported that Mr. Potter had received nearly 40 percent in pay raises since 2006 and about $ 135,000 in incentive bonuses last year .
For fiscal 2008 , including increases to the value of his two pensions , Mr. Potter ’s entire compensation package totaled more than $ 800,000 , according to Postal Service financial records .
RELATED :
• Postmaster got $ 800,000 in pay , perks
The subcommittee on the federal work force , Postal Service and the District of Columbia will take up the issue at a hearing set for March 25 .
In addition to executive compensation , members will review the Postal Service ’s economic troubles and competitiveness , officials said .
Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah , the subcommittee ’s ranking Republican , said he , too , questions the timing of the big pay packages , given the Postal Service ’s financial woes .
“ On the surface it just does n’t smell right , ” Mr. Chaffetz said .
“ Rewarding people for performance is acceptable , but things kind of seem to be going in the wrong direction .
I ’m looking forward to that hearing . ”
The Postal Service ’s board of governors informed the Postal Regulatory Commission about Mr. Potter ’s compensation in an annual financial filing in December .
Six weeks later , Mr. Potter testified before Congress that the Postal Service ’s worsening finances could prompt officials to cut a day of mail delivery .
The Postal Service also recently announced a pending 2 - cent increase in the price of stamps .
Mr. Potter said the Postal Service ’s losses occurred despite cutting more than $ 2 billion and setting records for on - time delivery .
He blamed the financial problems on a weakening economy , required health plan payments and increased use of electronic mail as a means of communication .
Among other top postal officials , Deputy Postmaster Patrick Donahoe got $ 600,026 in total compensation , more than half of which was an increase to the value of his retirement annuities .
His base salary was $ 238,654 .
Postal officials defend the pay packages , saying their counterparts in private industry earn far more money .
The chief executive of FedEx , for example , earned more than $ 10 million last year , according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings .
Gerald J. McKiernan , a spokesman for the Postal Service , said Friday that postal officials briefed the subcommittee last year .
He said additional briefings on the compensation of top postal officials took place last week .
“ It ’s an educational process , ” he said of the briefings .
“ We ’re prepared for the hearing . ”
Postal officials also note that outside reviews have recommended increased compensation for postal executives .
Under federal rules , the postmaster ’s pay is capped so he cannot earn more than 20 percent above the salary of the vice president of the United States .
But the board of governors , which oversees the Postal Service , can pay additional money to Mr. Potter as long as it ’s deferred until later years , according to the board .
For example , the board gave Mr. Potter a “ pay for performance ” award of $ 18,300 last year as well as a performance incentive award of $ 116,741 .
Both bonuses came on top of Mr. Potter ’s $ 263,575 salary .
Mr. Potter wo n’t be paid the incentive award money until after he leaves the Postal Service , records show .
In awarding the incentive awards , the board of governors noted that it “ considered Mr. Potter ’s effective leadership during the difficult economic challenges of 2008 , his implementation of a number of process improvements that led to record service levels at a lower cost , the steps he took that strategically positioned the Postal Service to maintain its viability for the future , and his achievement of personal goals . ”

Advertisement Pope Benedict XVI has urged Catholics in Angola to woo people " living in fear of spirits " into the church .
In a Mass celebrated in Angola 's capital , Luanda , he said Catholics should reach out to those who believe in witchcraft and spirits .
Human rights groups say many children in Angola have been abused after being accused of possession by spirits .
The pontiff , who arrived in Angola from Cameroon on Friday , is on the last stop of his week - long African tour .
He will later meet youths at a city football stadium .
On Friday , he made a powerful attack on corruption , which analysts say is rife in oil - rich Angola .
The climax of the visit will be on Sunday , when two million people are expected to hear the Pope address an outdoor service .
' Threatening spirits '
The Pope urged Angola 's Catholics to reach out to those who had joined the burgeoning number of sects .
" Today it is up to you , brothers and sisters , following in the footsteps of those heroic and holy heralds of God , to offer the risen Christ to your fellow citizens , " the Pope said to 1,500 Angolan clergy and laypeople at Luanda 's Sao Paulo church .
" In today 's Angola , Catholics should offer the message of Christ to the many who live in the fear of spirits , of evil powers by whom they feel threatened , disoriented , even reaching the point of condemning street children and even the most elderly because - they say - they are sorcerers , " he said .
Pope 's visit raises hopes Can Catholicism help Africa ?
Belief in witchcraft has spread rapidly in some parts of central and southern Africa , including Angola , over the last few years , say analysts .
Thousands of people lined the streets of Luanda to cheer the Pope as he travelled in the Popemobile through the capital after the Mass .
After arriving in Angola on Friday , the 81 - year - old pontiff spoke out against corruption .
In a televised address , the Pope said that Africans needed " a firm determination to change hearts and finally put a stop , once and for all , to corruption " .
Benedict 's speech was echoed by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos , who has been Angola 's leader for the past three decades and through a civil war which has left hundreds of thousands dead .
Mr dos Santos ' party won elections last year that critics said were marred by fraud and corruption .
Angola , a former Portuguese colony , is rich in diamonds and oil , but war has left most of its people in poverty .
The Pope sparked controversy earlier on his tour for remarks refusing to advocate condoms as a way to help stop HIV / Aids , prompting France , the Netherlands and even the pontiff 's native Germany to express concern .

The urgent need for more drones has meant bypassing usual procedures .
Some of the 70 Predator crashes , for example , stemmed from decisions to deploy the planes before they had completed testing and to hold off replacing control stations to avoid interrupting the supply of intelligence .
“ The context was to do just the absolute minimum needed to sustain the fight now , and accept the risks , while making fixes as you go along , ” Colonel Mathewson said .
It is easier , of course , for the military to take more risks with unmanned planes .
Complaints about civilian casualties , particularly from strikes in Pakistan , have stirred some concerns among human rights advocates .
Military officials say the ability of drones to observe targets for lengthy periods makes strikes more accurate .
They also said they do not fire if they think civilians are nearby .
The Predators were still undergoing basic testing when they were rushed into use in Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s and then hastily armed with missiles after the September 2001 terrorist attacks .
But it was only after the military turned to new counterinsurgency techniques in early 2007 , that demand for drones became almost insatiable .
Since then , Air Force Lt. Gen. Gary North , the air - component commander for the combined forces in Iraq and Afghanistan , said the service has gone to “ amazing lengths ” to increase their use .
The Predators and Reapers are now flying 34 surveillance patrols each day in Iraq and Afghanistan , up from 12 in 2006 .
They are also transmitting 16,000 hours of video each month , some of it directly to troops on the ground .
The strains of these growing demands were evident on a recent visit to Davis - Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson , Ariz. , one of four bases where Air National Guard units have been ordered to full - time duty to help alleviate crew shortages .

It has been 46 years since Sylvia Plath gassed herself to death in her kitchen , and it was worldwide news when her daughter Frieda Hughes announced that Plath ’s 47 - year - old son , Nicholas Hughes , a fisheries biologist in Alaska , killed himself last week .
Why , of all the stories of creative , brilliant people who have suffered from fatal depressions , does Plath ’s tragic legacy resonate so widely ?
Here , Joyce Carol Oates , Peter D. Kramer , Erica Jong , Andrew Solomon and Elaine Showalter offer their thoughts .
Her Reputation Rises , as Others Fade
Joyce Carol Oates , the Roger S. Berlind Distinguished Professor of Humanities at Princeton University , is the author , most recently , of “ Dear Husband , ” a story collection .
The suicide of Sylvia Plath was and is obviously of enormous cultural significance because Plath was a brilliant poet — at the time of her death she was already considered a very important poet and since her death , her reputation has risen continuously while others who were her gifted contemporaries —
Anne Sexton , John Berryman , even the much - acclaimed Robert Lowell — appear to have faded .
Also ,
Plath wrote specifically about suicide — her own suicide , much - meditated and plotted — and her much - publicized ill treatment at the hands of her husband Ted Hughes made her into a feminist martyr of a kind .
( Though Plath herself was contemptuous of feminism and of most other women . )
It is probably not the case that “ creative ” people commit suicide to a degree beyond that of the general population but this is the popular stereotype .
It is known that a suicide in a family may precipitate subsequent suicides in the family ; one can surmise that for the children or relatives of suicides , especially those who are prominent and whose suicides have been much dramatized , self - destruction provides an “ exit ” that seems ready - made , as it would not be for others .
( I cannot comment on Plath ’s and Hughes ’s son , because I do n’t know his personal history . )
Ernest Hemingway , who committed suicide at the age of 62 , has the father in his short story “ Indian Camp ” offer an explanation of an Indian ’s suicide — “ Maybe he just could n’t take it any longer . ”
A young person associated with both Plath and Hughes would have had to contend with the literary - journalist ’s equivalent of Tabloid Hell ; maybe he could n’t take it any longer .
( The kindest response would be a sympathetic silence on the part of the media . )
Serve the Sufferers
Peter D. Kramer is the author of “ Against Depression . ”
Suicide is humbling for us , the observers .
In the case of Sylvia Plath , we have all the narrative information anyone could wish : her prose fiction , her poetry , her correspondence , her journals , and then the Husband ’s , too .
With all this testimony — brave , generous , self - aware , subtle , forceful — we do not know .
Does
Ted drive her to it , and his next wife as well ?
Or is it progressive deterioration of the brain ?
( Now that we ’re better at examining them , we can say that the brains of suicides look very bad . )
Both , is the sophisticated conclusion , environment and genes , social circumstance and biology , cognition and animal drive — which is to conclude vaguely indeed .
“ Of course there are two , ” Plath writes in her poem “ Death and Co. , ” meaning the wife and the husband — but now one might think of the mother and the child .
Two turns out to be a low estimate .
What we know most about is the horror of suicide , for the agent , for the survivors .
Advocates who speak on these matters say that death from suicide is about as frequent as death from the common cancers — only a bit rarer than death from breast cancer , for example — but that while there are breast cancer centers , for treatment , for prevention , for research , at many hospitals , there are suicide centers at almost none .
Tonight , that mundane observation seems to me as thoughtful a response as any to these losses .
As doctors , given copious testimony , we should be able to comment with more wisdom ; as a culture , we should to be able to serve sufferers better .
An Exemplar of Inexorable Fate
Erica Jong is the author , most recently , of ” Love Comes First , ” her seventh collection of poems .
Star - crossed lovers always fascinate , and Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes were surely star - crossed .
Their attraction was fierce and they both chronicled it with brilliance .
Sylvia
Plath wrote powerfully of her attraction to suicide , then killed herself .
Ted Hughes was also no slouch when it came to the pull of mortality ( witness his book , “ Crow ” ) .
We are often drawn to characters who seem to be exemplars of the inexorability of fate , of destiny .
And they were such .
In their lives , in their work , they seemed to express the darkest workings of the unconscious .
People born to do that are not often steady parents .
And we know that suicidal parents often produce suicidal children .
I knew Ted a little , did not know Sylvia , but was very sad to hear of their son ’s death .
The legend of tragic , fated lovers seldom includes happy children .
The Lure of a Birthright
Andrew Solomon is the author , most recently , of “ The Noonday Demon : An Atlas of Depression ” and of the forthcoming “ A Dozen Kinds of Love : Raising Challenging Children . ”
Suicide runs in families .
It ’s not entirely clear to what extent this is a genetic predisposition , and to what extent having a parent who has killed himself or herself simply makes the option feel more readily available , though both are certainly true .
Suicide is the end point of many depressions , but there are plenty of people who , though acutely depressed , do not become suicidal .
Committing suicide requires a mix of depression and impulsivity ; so much of depression is passive and meek and deactivating .
The pain may be intolerable , but the prospect of doing anything as deliberate as suicide is overwhelming .
The model of the literary suicide , of the writer whose thrall to craft is either the consequence or the cause of most dire depression , is a frequent one ; David Foster Wallace is the latest link in this sorry chain .
Sylvia Plath wrote about depression so explicitly and so beautifully in “ The Bell Jar , ” where she described how :
I could n’t get myself to react .
I felt very still and very empty , the way the eye of a tornado must feel , moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo .
For anyone who has been depressed , that description rings astonishingly true .
She had talent and looks and was married to a great poet , but these externals cannot assuage that eye - of - the - storm despair .
For a long time , all of Plath ’s work ( as Virginia Woolf ’s ) was read through the lens of her suicide .
She is in fact a remarkable poet , whose writing would warrant our attention even if she had lived her days out happily taking her children to soccer practice in suburbia .
Now her son has killed himself , after a long battle with depression .
It ’s sad to think that in this time of psychopharmacological and cognitive - behavioral wonders , he was not able to get above his illness .
I do not know what treatment he received or sought , but I do know that he had a birthright to the dull eye , and to that sadly final way of dealing with it .
Parents who suffer from depression cannot help passing along that illness .
Those who commit suicide implant the idea that this is a viable option , but it seems likely that Nicholas Hughes was beset by demons he can rightly call his own .
And every life that is lost to suicide is tragic , be it associated with poetry or not .
A Rare Genius
Elaine Showalter is professor emerita of English at Princeton University and the author of “ A Jury of Her Peers : American Women Writers from Anne Bradstreet to Annie Proulx . ”
Sylvia Plath , who killed herself at the age of 30 , was one of the great American poets of the 20th century .
No other poet in English except Keats , and no American poet , produced so much enduring work in such a brief lifetime .
Plath ’s ambition to become what she called “ the Poetess of America ” and her fierce preparation to fulfill that ambition added to the unique intensity of her life and legend .
Plath ’s poetry and fiction , appearing during the decades when women were demanding liberation from secondary lives , spoke to its readers with searing immediacy .
Our sorrow at the waste and loss of a brilliant writer , and our anger at the restrictions and prohibitions Plath faced as a woman artist , fueled her legend .
In short , Plath was not just “ talented and creative ” but a rare genius .
Her story will continue to compel attention for a very long while .

WASHINGTON  Obama administration officials worked Sunday to persuade reluctant private investors to buy as much as $ 1 trillion in troubled mortgages and related assets from banks , with government help .
The talks came a day before the Treasury secretary , Timothy F. Geithner , planned to unveil the details of the administration ’s long - awaited plan to purchase troubled assets , meant to remove them from the balance sheets of banks and , in turn , spur banks to lend more money to consumers and companies .
The plan relies on private investors to team up with the government to relieve banks of assets tied to loans and mortgage - linked securities of unknown value .
There have been virtually no buyers of these assets because of their uncertain risk .
As part of the program , the government plans to offer subsidies , in the form of low - interest loans , to coax private funds to form partnerships with the government to buy troubled assets from banks .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A sculpture of a giant white horse taller than the Statue of Liberty is set to tower over the countryside as part of an unusual scheme to help revive the fortunes of a depressed region of England .
The 50 - meter high horse will dominate the landscape around Ebbsfleet .
The 50 - meter equine artwork was Tuesday announced as the winner of a competition to design a landmark to dominate the skyline of the Ebbsfleet Valley , set to be a new stop on the Eurostar London - to - Paris rail link .
Designed by artist Mark Wallinger -- whose previous work has included dressing in a bear suit and wandering around a gallery in Berlin -- the £ 2 million ( $ 3 million ) horse will be one of the largest artworks in the UK .
Wallinger 's horse -- which echoes ancient white horse symbols carved into hillsides around Britain -- beat a shortlist of designs that included a tower of stacked cubes and giant steel nest .
Victoria Pomery , head of the panel that selected the design , described the 33 - times normal size horse as " outstanding . "
" Mark is a superb artist of world renown and his sculpture will become a real landmark for Ebbsfleet Valley and the whole region , " she said .
It drew a less favorable response from readers of local Web site Kentnews.com , who described it as a " waste of money , " an " abomination " and " depressing . "
One correspondent , Andy Smith , added : " This horse looks extremely silly . "

Jack Cafferty says Obama is getting things done even though he 's made some mistakes .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
What a welcome change to feel like someone is running the country instead of running it into the ground .
President Obama has done more in eight weeks than George W. Bush did in eight years -- unless you include starting a couple of wars .
While the armchair quarterbacks second guess the new president , he gets up every day and does things , lots of things .
Whether it 's creating commissions for women and girls , ordering the investigation of President Bush 's use of signing statements , or jamming a huge stimulus package through Congress , the man is working his tail off .
And he seems to be loving every minute of it .
It 's almost as though our president was born to do exactly what he 's doing .
He 's leading , and boy , is that refreshing .
I remember many times when Bush was in office wondering who the hell was running the country .
Then he would appear somewhere in front of a handpicked audience to utter some banalities or say something utterly stupid and I would be reminded .
I do n't miss him .
That 's not to say President Obama has n't stubbed his toe here and there .
Signing that omnibus spending bill with all those earmarks in it after campaigning so hard against pork was probably a mistake .
The opportunity was right there to send that bill back to Congress with a note that read , " I told you I am against earmarks and I meant it .
Now do it over and send me something clean . "
Nancy Pelosi's head would have probably exploded , but the American people would have been ready to crown him king .
There are serious questions about whether Tim Geithner has what it takes to solve the banking crisis .
Either nationalize the big ones in trouble or let them fail .
It does n't seem that just continuing to hand them money is working .
Better background checks on some of his appointees would have saved him some embarrassment .
There 's no excuse for asking someone like Tom Daschle with his problems to do anything .
But the point , I guess , is this : President Obama is attacking our country 's problems on several fronts .
He 's got ambitious ideas on how to solve them , and he communicates a sense of calm and confidence to the rest of us as he goes about his business .
Will all his ideas work ?
Of course not .
But if you throw enough stuff at the wall , some of it will stick .
And at least I do n't go to bed at night worried that I 'll wake up in the morning to find out we 're about to invade someone .

All About Barack Obama • Timothy Geithner • Nancy Pelosi
CAMP MAKOMANAI , Japan – Col. Kenji Sawai , commander of Japan 's 18th Infantry Regiment , stands in his headquarters dressed from head to foot in white camouflage .
Skis clutter the hallways of his outpost in the snow - covered mountains of northern Japan , along with stacks of white ponchos , gloves and boots .
For decades , the mission for Japanese officers such as Sawai has been fairly straightforward : Defend the homeland .
Narrowly defined , for Sawai and his infantrymen , that means protecting the island of Hokkaido , where the regiment is based , from invasion .
Now that definition is changing .
The political leadership and military planners — with the blessing of Washington , their closest ally — are cautiously moving the military away from its longtime role as a stay - at - home force .
The new stance , while still centered on national defense , allows troops to be sent all over the world for a broad range of operations .
Lawmakers are mulling calls from the United States for Tokyo to send " boots on the ground " to bolster President Barack Obama 's stepped - up efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan .
The U.S. has said that it would welcome a dispatch of soldiers .
While such a move would set off controversy among the public and is unlikely anytime soon , the government has taken a number of steps that would have been unthinkable a decade ago .
It sent 600 troops to Iraq , albeit in a noncombat role ; it has a refueling mission in the Indian Ocean that supports U.S. forces in Afghanistan ; and it has sent two naval ships to the waters off Somalia to help battle pirates .
The tentative transition is reshaping the balance of power in northeast Asia — one of the world 's most volatile and heavily armed regions — and could be a key to Japan 's security as China 's military rises and North Korea continues to be a nuclear - capable wild card .
Sawai's remote command , a series of drab beige barracks surrounded by sprawling marching fields , is already seeing the trickle - down effect .
At this year 's " North Wind " exercises , annual maneuvers held with the United States , U.S. commanders said training involved more joint attacks , more collaboration , closer command and control — just the kind of thing that would be needed if the Japanese were to be fighting alongside the U.S. in Iraq or Afghanistan .
" We have never actually been to war , and there are many things that we want to learn from the U.S. soldiers , " Sawai said after addressing his troops and several hundred U.S. National Guard soldiers who came to his base from Kentucky for the 11 - day maneuvers .
It was a striking contrast : Many of the American guardsmen have been sent to war zones two or three times , while no Japanese soldier has fired a bullet in combat since Tokyo's 1945 surrender ended World War II — thanks largely to a pacifist constitution written by U.S. occupiers to keep Japan from rearming .
Sawai stressed that the exercises were not directly intended to ready the Japanese for deployment overseas .
" Defense is our mission , " Sawai said .
" That has not changed . "
Still , the new , more aggressive , role of Japan 's military is hard to ignore .
Japan has about 240,000 uniformed troops , with about 130,000 of them in the army , which is formally known as the Ground Self - Defense Forces .
Because of sensitivities left over from the last century , the military itself is known as the Self - Defense Force .
Constitutional restrictions have barred the military from acquiring an aircraft carrier or some air - to - air refueling capabilities needed for long - range strikes , which are crucial for the projection of force but are considered too aggressive to meet the constitutional defense - only rules .
Unlike China 's double - digit defense spending growth , Japan 's has remained flat for years .
China has for years outspent Japan — $ 70 billion to $ 49 billion in 2009 .
Even so , Japan has one of the best - funded and highly regarded militaries in the world .
Its navy , in particular , is regarded as the best operating in the region , after only the U.S. Navy .
Earlier this month , after much haggling in parliament , two Japanese naval destroyers were dispatched to the sea off Somalia to join the multinational fight against piracy .
Two more destroyers were sent to the Sea of Japan to monitor North Korean missile activity .
And late last year , Japanese troops ended a four - year humanitarian and airlift mission in Iraq , the military 's biggest overseas operation since World War II .
On the home front , Japan has worked closely with the United States to erect a multi-billion dollar ballistic missile shield to protect the country — and the 50,000 U.S. troops stationed here — from a potential attack by its unpredictable and often belligerent neighbor , North Korea .
Elements of that shield could soon be tested if North Korea , as expected , test launches its first long - range ballistic missile since a failed attempt in 2006 .
North Korea claims the launch is intended to put a satellite into orbit , but Japanese officials have said they are prepared to respond if the missile 's trajectory poses a threat to Japan 's territory .
Sending troops to Afghanistan or elsewhere would likely stir up opposition from many Japanese who recall the disaster of the previous century 's militarist misadventures and strongly resist any action that might lead Japan again into war .
" I would anticipate the SDF ( Japanese Self - Defense Force ) taking a significantly larger role on the international stage in the years to come .
There are any number of international and domestic factors that all point in the same direction on this point , " said Eric Heginbotham , a political scientist with the U.S. - based RAND Corporation .
But raising the question of Japan sending troops to Afghanistan , he added : " I would say it is unlikely , unless the situation there stabilizes or the SDF can identify a safe corner of the country in which to operate .
Japan is still extremely casualty sensitive . "
Japan 's neighbors are also wary of such moves .
But political opposition at home is eroding .
Japan's two biggest parties both advocate the country taking a higher - profile role on the world stage , largely for nationalistic reasons .
And the new mood dovetails with pressure from the United States , which would welcomes a stronger Japan that could assist thinly spread U.S. forces and serve as a counterbalance to the growing military strength of China .
" Gradually , Japan is moving toward that direction , " said Tsuneo Watanabe , a senior fellow at the Tokyo Foundation .
" There is vague consensus among the policy circle .
However , there is no consensus among ordinary citizens and politicians , " he said .
" The bridging role should be played by politicians , the policy research community and media . "

Once we had evolved the necessary brain architecture , we could “ do ” religion , brain scans indicate .
The research shows that , to interpret a god ’s intentions and feelings , we rely mainly on the same recently evolved brain regions that divine the feelings and intentions of other people .
“ We ’re interested to find where in the brain belief systems are represented , particularly those that appear uniquely human , ” says lead researcher , Jordan Grafman of the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda , Maryland .
The researchers found that such beliefs “ light up ” the areas of our brain which have evolved most recently , such as those involved in imagination , memory and “ theory of mind ” – the recognition that other people and living things can have their own thoughts and intentions .

“ They do n’t tell us about the existence of a higher order power like God , ” says Grafman .
“ They only address how the mind and brain work in tandem to allow us to have belief systems that guide our everyday actions . ”
Core elements
In the study , the researchers gave 40 religious volunteers functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) brain scans as they responded to statements reflecting three core elements of belief .
For each statement , they had to say on a scale how much they agreed or disagreed .
The volunteers were believers in monotheist religions such as Christianity , Islam and Judaism .
First , volunteers responded to statements about whether God intervenes in the world or not , such as “ God is removed from the world ” .
Here , brain activity was focused mainly in the lateral frontal lobe regions of the brain where theory of mind takes shape , enabling us to interpret other people ’s intentions .
The regions link to mirror neurons which enable us to empathise with other people .
Second , the volunteers mulled statements on God ’s emotional state , such as “ God is wrathful ” .
Again , and as the researchers predicted , the activated areas were those where theory of mind enables us to judge emotion in others , such as the medial temporal and frontal gyri .
Finally , the volunteers heard statements reflecting the abstract language and imagery of religion , such as “ Jesus is the Son of God ” or “ God dictates celebrating the Sabbath ” , or “ a resurrection will occur ” .
Here , volunteers tapped into areas of the brain such as the right inferior temporal gyrus , which decodes metaphorical meaning and abstractedness .
Recently evolved
Overall , the parts of the brain activated by the belief statements were those used for much more mundane , everyday interpretation of the world and the intentions of other people .
Significantly , however , they also correspond with the parts of the brain that have evolved most recently , and which appear to which give humans more insight than other animals .
“ Our results are unique in demonstrating that specific components of religious belief are mediated by well - known brain networks , and support contemporary psychological theories that ground religious belief within evolutionary adaptive cognitive functions , ” say the researchers .
“ It ’s not surprising that religious beliefs engage mainly the theory - of - mind areas , as they are about virtual beings who are treated as having essentially human mental traits , just as characters in a novel or play are , ” comments Robin Dunbar , an anthropologist at the University of Oxford .
“ But it nicely reinforces my claim that it is the higher orders of intentionality that are crucial in the development of fully fledged religion as we know it , ” says Dunbar .

Two signs of the times : First , a banker friend remarked to me that you know your bank is in trouble when its share price is less than the cost of taking money out of one of its A.T.M.’s .
Second , go to Google and type in these four letters : m-e-r-e .
Before you go any further , Google will list the possible things or people you ’re searching for , and at the top of that list will be the name “ Meredith Whitney . ”
She comes up before “ merengue ” and “ Meredith Viera . ”
Who is Meredith Whitney ?
She is a banking analyst who became famous for declaring last year , long before others , that Citigroup was up to its neck in bad mortgages and would not likely survive in its present form .
Do you know how many people have to be searching for you if all you have to do is put in four letters and your name pops up first ?
A lot !
But I am not surprised .
Our banking system is in so much trouble that everyone is searching for the silver - bullet solution  and the person who can describe it .
Alas , there is no silver bullet .
I ’m worried .
We ’ve just elected a talented young president with many good instincts about how to propel our country forward , extend health care to more people , make our tax code fairer and launch a green industrial revolution .
But do you know what I fear ?
I fear that his whole first term could be eaten by Citigroup , A.I.G. , Bank of America , Merrill Lynch , and the whole housing / subprime credit bubble we inflated these past 20 years .
Blindness , renal failure , stroke and heart disease are potential complications of type 2 diabetes , which currently afflicts more than 15 million Americans .
Now research from Tel Aviv University has found more worrying news ― type 2 diabetes can be a risk factor accelerating cognitive decline and dementia .
Dr. Tali Cukierman - Yaffe , a physician and researcher from TAU 's Sackler School of Medicine , found that people with diabetes were 1.5 more likely to experience cognitive decline , and 1.6 more likely to suffer from dementia than people without diabetes .
Her recent publication in the journal Diabetes Care suggests that higher - than - average levels of blood glucose ( blood sugar ) may have a role in this relationship .
Her work is part of the ongoing Memory in Diabetes ( MIND ) project , a sub-study of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes ( ACCORD ) trial .
First Step Towards New Treatments
" Our results send an important message to the public , " says Dr. Cukierman - Yaffe .
" We have shown conclusively that there is a relationship between diabetes and cognitive dysfunction .
This should be known by diabetics and their doctors .
Knowledge is the first step towards action .
" Intact thinking is essential for managing the disease , " Dr. Cukierman - Yaffe adds .
Clinicians today work with the patient to prevent complications of diabetes .
Early detection of visual problems , for example , can be treated with laser surgery if diagnosed early enough , and blindness can be avoided in some cases .
" Today , diabetes can not be cured .
We can however delay or prevent many of its complications , " says Dr. Cukierman - Yaffe .
" Diagnosing cognitive dysfunction at a pre-clinical stage is the first step in finding new treatment options . "
A New Association with Poor Cognitive Performance
Dr. Cukierman - Yaffe's work opens a new opportunity for researchers to better understand the cognitive risks associated with diabetes and dysglycemia .
She points out that diabetes , unlike other chronic disease states , is a complex disease to manage and one that requires intact cognition in the patient .
As the mind starts deteriorating , so does the patient 's ability to treat the diabetes effectively .
Disease management can then spiral out of control .
Findings in her recent study show that in people with type 2 diabetes , higher levels of haemoglobin A1C ( a measure of average blood glucose ) are significantly associated with poorer performance on three cognitive tasks which require memory , speed and ability to manage multiple tasks at the same time .
A higher A1C level was also associated with a lower score on a test of global cognitive function .
The results of the study suggest that lowering A1C levels could slow the accelerated rate of cognitive decline experienced by people with diabetes .
However prospective studies and clinical trials are needed in order to prove this .
The ongoing ACCORD - MIND study , in which study patients are followed over time and are tested three times during the trial will test the hypothesis that lowering A1C could result in improved cognitive function .

Arizona pharmacists who cite a moral objection could refuse to fill prescriptions for emergency contraception , according to legislation introduced this week at the state Capitol .
Similarly , the proposal - House Bill 2564 - would allow any hospital worker or health professional to refuse to participate in an abortion or dispense medication to abort a pregnancy .
For advocates of the legislation such as Ron Johnson of the Arizona Catholic Conference , it 's a matter of " rights of conscience " for the health - care workers .
But opponents argue that the bill would place women at risk - especially in rural areas where pharmaceutical options are few and with emergency contraceptives that must be administered within 72 hours of unprotected sex .
" Women have far fewer options , especially when you 're talking about rural areas , " said House Minority Leader David Lujan , D - Phoenix .
" As pharmacists , they have a professional duty .
It 's an issue of women 's health and safety . "
The prime sponsor of the legislation , state Rep. Nancy Barto , downplayed any hurdles the provision would represent .
" Certainly , people in rural areas are accustomed to traveling long distances for services , " said Barto , R - Phoenix .
" This is n't going to keep women from receiving these prescriptions . "
Barto's legislation combines provisions from a handful of anti-abortion bills vetoed by former Gov. Janet Napolitano in past years .
Among them , the proposal would :
��Require that minors seeking an abortion first receive written , notarized consent from a parent or guardian .
� �Mandate a 24 - hour " reflection period " before any adult woman could undergo the procedure .
� �Bar any individual who is not a physician from performing a surgical abortion .
" We believe these are very common - sense , middle - of - the - road ideals that most Arizonans agree with , " Johnson said .
Barto's proposal also would require the informed consent of any adult seeking an abortion .
That means the patient would have to be informed of alternatives to abortion , the medical risks associated with both having an abortion and carrying the fetus to term and the probable gestational age and physiological characteristics of their fetus .
Also , the woman would have to be told of medical benefits and government assistance available pre- and post-natal .
" You do n't need the Legislature to tell doctors how to help women with their medical health , " said Pam Grissom , chairwoman of the board for a Tucson - based abortion - rights group known as Arizona List .
" I think they 're treating women like they do n't have a brain of their own . "
Barto suggested that , in many cases , women in Arizona inquire about an abortion and undergo the procedure in the same day - often without being told everything they should to make an informed decision .
Does she hope the 24 - hour wait will result in a woman having second thoughts about a planned abortion ?
" Obviously I do , " Barto said .
" I would love for her to consider the ramifications of that choice . "
Abortion opponents in the Legislature frequently found themselves at odds with Napolitano in recent years .
The Democrat vetoed at least nine proposals limiting abortion since becoming governor in 2003 .
But with Napolitano replaced by Republican Gov. Jan Brewer , Barto expressed hope that this will be the year the abortion restrictions are signed into law .
Brewer spokesman Paul Senseman would n't address the specifics of Barto 's proposal , except to note that " the governor has a very consistent pro-life track record . "
The Identity and Passport Service has signed up an advertising agency to develop campaigns for its services .
Abbot Mead Vickers BBDO won the contract following a three - way pitch organised by the Central Office of Information against CHI & Partners and VCCP .
It will work in all media across the agency 's entire area of work , including identity cards , passports and the General Register Office ( GRO ) .
The contract is set to last three to four years and has no firm value .
A spokesperson for the IPS told GC News that the agency is not on a paid retainer , but will obtain a commission from the advertising it places for the IPS .
No firm plans are yet in place .
The spokesperson said : " The next step is working to develop a campaign to support all the products the IPS offers . "
James
Hall , IPS chief executive , said : " IPS needs an agency to support the development of a creative strategy targeting a variety of audiences across all our work , including the National Identity Scheme .
Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO has shown a high degree of creativity and some excellent long term strategic thinking . "
Meanwhile , immigration minister Phil Woolas has said that by 26 February 2009 the IPS had issued 10,596 identity cards to foreign nationals in the UK since it began the process in December .
He was responding to a parliamentary question from Conservative MP Michael Ancram .

A major talking point of the Republican governors who are not going to take the unemployment funds in the stimulus bill is that it is a permanent tax increase , but by looking at the bill , it is clear that potential 2012 Republican presidential candidates Bobby Jindal , Haley Barbour , and Mark Sanford are at best wrong , or even worse , lying .
Here is what Gov. Jindal ( R - LA ) said on Meet The Press today , “ Well , it , it ’s–no .
The $ 100 million we turned down was temporary federal dollars that would require us to change our unemployment laws .
That would ’ve actually raised taxes on Louisiana businesses .
We as a state would ’ve been responsible for paying for those benefits after the federal money disappeared …
If you actually read the bill , there ’s one problem with that .
The word permanent is in the bill .
It requires the state to make a permanent change in our law .
Law B–our employer group agrees with me .
They say , “ Yes , this will result an increase in taxes on our businesses , this will result in a permanent obligation on the state of Louisiana . ”
Gov. Barbour ( R - MS ) said on CNN ’s State of the Union , “ There is some ( stimulus money ) we will not take in Mississippi .
If we were to take the unemployment insurance reform package that they have , it would cause us to raise taxes on employment when the money runs out , and the money will run out in a couple of years .
Then we ’ll have to raise the unemployment insurance tax , which is literally a tax on employment .
I mean , we want more jobs .
You do n’t get more jobs by putting an extra tax on creating jobs . ”

Gov. Sanford ( R - SC ) said that the bill would require his state to cover part - time workers , “ What we would be required to do would be , for the first time , increase the level of benefit for part - time workers .
Right now , it ’s full - time workers — increase it to part - time workers .
We ca n’t pay for the benefits already in the program , but to get the stimulus money , we ’ve got to increase the program ’s size and scale . ”
Here is the text of the bill ’s unemployment section , which can be found in Title VII of the bill , “ For an additional amount for ‘ State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service Operations ’ for grants to States in accordance with section 6 of the Wagner - Peyser Act , $ 400,000,000 , which may be expended from the Employment Security Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund , and which shall be available for obligation on the date of enactment of this Act : Provided , That such funds shall remain available to the States through September 30 , 2010 . ”
First off , someone needs to tell Gov. Jindal that the word permanent does not appear in the text .
The question is where are Republicans getting the lie that this is a permanent tax increase ?
The answer can be found in Section VI of the Wagner - Peyser Act , which says , “ No State ’s allotment under this section for any fiscal year shall be less that 90 percent of its allotment percentage for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made . ”
Jindal and the others are making a very faulty assumption here .
They are assuming that the unemployment rate will stay high in 2010 , and they also make the assumption that the federal government will not provide any additional funding .
Their first assumption is possible , but the second wo n’t happen .
It would be unprecedented for the federal government to cut funding while unemployment is high .
No matter what party is in control , this does n’t happen .
What is really going on here is that these governors are willing to put their own political ambitions ahead of the needs of the people of their state .
All three of these gentlemen want to run for the Republican nomination in 2012 , and they think that they will endear themselves to the GOP base by taking a hard line against the stimulus .
If this means twisting the truth and hurting the unemployed in their states , so be it .
Their position is based on cold political calculus , which may benefit them with Republicans , but would destroy them if any one of them were lucky enough to become the GOP nominee .

Of late , the dogmatically left - wing media apparatus here in Vermont has been broadcasting with great zeal the fact that the Brady Campaign , and the New England Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence , have just unilaterally denounced the lack of gun laws in Green Mountain country as ' the worst in the nation . '
Here 's a brief laundry list of the facts these wonderful folks do n't like in the least :
' Vermont requires no license or permit to carry a concealed or unconcealed , loaded or unloaded , handgun on one 's person and / or in one 's vehicle .
' Vermont has no gun registration , and sale or transfer of firearms between private parties , including at gun shows , requires no federal ' Brady Check . '
' There is no ban on semi-automatic military style so - called ' assault weapons . '
' There is no limit on how many firearms one may purchase at one time , or how frequently one chooses to purchase a gun .
' There are no bans on various types of ammunition , such as armor - piercing rounds , or ' exotic ' shotgun shells .
In fact , Vermont is the most free ' State ' in the ' nation ' with regard to firearms ownership and self - protection ( with only Alaska as a close second ) , and was given a score of 4 out of a possible 100 by the Brady Campaign .
Ed Cutler , president of Gun Owners of Vermont , in a recent interview , quipped that he would 've been happier if the Brady Campaign 's score had been zero .
Note also that this callous denunciation by the Brady and NECPGV crowd flies in the face of the fact that Vermont enjoys one of the very lowest crime rates out of all 50 ' states , ' yet their ' perfect ' rating of 100 would reflect a society in which only bureaucrats ' and other criminals ' would be armed .
One look at crime rates in the neighboring People 's Republic of Marxachusetts explodes the Brady crowd 's myth in a single blow .
Why wo n't the diehard leftist media report on the fact that major gun rights organizations , like Gun Owners of America and Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership , hail Vermont as the crown jewel flagship of firearms freedoms , and routinely hold Vermonters forth as an example for all Americans to follow in this regard ?
After all , why portray the very people who purchase newspapers such as the Rutland Herald and Brattleboro Reformer as misguided and irresponsibly violent , when all the statistical evidence is to the contrary ' unless a misguided and irresponsible disarmament agenda is afoot ?
Hmmm ?
Vermonters should take these recent assaults by the Brady gun-grabbing crowd as a Red Badge of Courage .
That is to say , the courage to remain armed , and hence , in a condition of greater liberty than many others .
I could say much about the statism of other Vermont policies : taxation , public schools , a ridiculous continuing drug war ' but those things are perhaps for other essays .
Vermonters have thus far done the correct thing by resisting gun control , and the ever - encroaching hand of government on our self - ownership it also represents .
The right of defending life and property should never rest with government , but always with the individual .
Reflect upon the fact that the United Nations routinely laments the widespread proliferation of small arms worldwide as ' threatening to the legitimacy of the State . '
News for the UN tyrants ( as if they did n't already know ) : Governments ' ' States ' ' have no legitimacy to begin with .
You 're a fraud , all liars , and you know it .
Laws are nothing but opinions backed up by many guns .
So , all I 'm doing by owning guns is backing my opinion that I ought to be free ' and the opinion that so should everyone else be .
Vermonters have thus far stood tall on this issue .
And they should and must always continue to reject and defeat the Sarah Bradys of this world by never compromising their stand on unimpeded gun rights .
They should also praise Alaskans for joining the resistance ' and they should be calling out loudly to inhabitants of the other 48 arbitrary political jurisdictions to muster and follow suit .
It is both the correct , and hence , courageous , thing to do .

Bucket - Wheel Excavators : The Most Destructive Machines on the Planet ?
March 4th , 2009 by Timothy B. Hurst
The bucket - wheel excavator has long scoured the lignite fields of western Germany , erasing whole villages and leaving a trail of bad soil and salty water .
With all sorts of claims being made about clean energy and clean tech , it is more than a mere academic exercise to explore what those terms really mean .
One way of defining something is by defining what it is not .
For example , the large bucket - wheel excavators like those used in the open - cast lignite mines of western Germany are not clean tech .
And here ’s why …
At 300 feet tall and 600 feet long , the largest bucket wheel excavators are the biggest land vehicles ever made .
Though they only dig at a maximum of 0.37 mph , these machines move 240,000 cubic meters of material daily , about as much as a football field dug to 100 feet deep .
Because they continuously dig , transport , and dump material twenty - four hours a day these machines require 16 megawatts of externally supplied electricity ; and there are twenty - two currently in use in the four open - cast lignite mines in the state of North Rhine - Westphalia .
Bucket wheel excavators have been working these lignite fields since 1933 , playing an instrumental role in fueling the Hitler machine with coal - based synfuel .
Over the years , the mining activities have scarred the land and created massive canyons , reaching up to 500 metres deep and over 10 Km wide ( see a 360 degree panorama of the lignite coal mine in Garzweiler ) .

Ever wondered about all those games that were announced but never released ?
Or games that have been discovered over the years that no one even knew existed ?
Or have you discovered a new prototype that no one 's seen yet ?
Here 's the place to talk about prototype games , led by Tempest of AtariProtos.com .
Okay , so we have n't talked about it here despite the hoopla .
Slumdog Millionaire that is .
But today I came across this hilarious video that is worth posting .
I am flummoxed by the mass appeal of the movie which swept this year 's Oscars and a bit amused when people ask me slightly breathlessly if I am happy about its stupendous success .
Friends of my age have n't bothered but two young people at my gym made the friendly overture of mentioning the Oscars " miracle " to me .
I am wondering if other Indian Americans are being asked about Slumdog too .
I know , I know , it is just a harmless icebreaker .
I thought it was cute that the two young acquaintances approached me with a smile and kind of " congratulated " me for the success of Slumdog .
Of the three , only I had hated the movie .
And why did n't the film sit well with me ?
Well , not because it exposed the seamy side of India Shining .
India is a huge , complex and multi-faceted country .
People anywhere can believe what they wish about India .
I myself harbor many complaints and much anger in my heart about the inequities of Indian society .
What director Danny Boyle showed in the movie about the heartbreaking squalor of Indian slum life is exaggerated but not entirely incorrect .
But that is not what the movie is about and why it won awards and accolades .
It was the puerile , unrealistic and gaudy triumph of the underdog in the story that made it a hit - with just enough sexual tension , cruelty and filth thrown in the mix to complete the image of India that appeals to much of the world .
Here is Indian journalist Tarun Tejpal expanding on what I said .
( link : Usha Alexander , another non-fan of the Slumdog )
One feels awe not for the film , but for its miraculous journey .
Clearly , in an increasingly low - brow ocean of publicity and hype , the idea of true excellence is a drowned raft .
Not shorn of the hype , but because of it , to an Indian , the film ought to disappoint .
It tells me nothing that I do n’t already know ; and it tells me things I know to be not true .
Unlike Amitabh Bachchan
I have no problems with the film focusing on India ’s abject poverty .
That focus is salutary , and crying out for further exploration .
My problem is the opposite — that it trivialises it .
Uses its excreta and chopped limbs to tell a dubious story that leaves the viewer not disturbed but cheerfully smug .
You leave the seat exhilarated , not in pain .
The film tells a very big lie : that India ’s poor have a happy shot at leaping out of their misery into affluence and joy .
One day you can be in the crap heap — diving into excreta — and the next running down a slum girl who may have failed to make school but seems to have managed to walk through Vogue ’s offices on her way to teenage .
With a stunning lack of plausibility you see the slum child Jamaal grow into a refined public schoolboy who must surely be eating cucumber sandwiches for lunch .
India ’s wannabe wealthy — billionaires among them — would slice their fingers to boast such a sophisticated son .
For that accent alone , they would throw in their toes too .
Aw !
Gee !
The camera is shaking , the story is sprinting — there is no way anyone can tell if a few chapters have fallen out , several links of logic lost .
You have to be grateful Jamal only grows up to be Dev Patel .
Given the absence of any need to explain the miraculous transformation , he could well have become Brad Pitt or Prince Charles .
To further celebrate the carnival of implausibility , Master Dev acts with the cool flatness of the cucumber sandwich ( that he surely must be eating ) — no neuroses of the slums tarnishing his soul .
For those celebrating the authenticity of the film , here ’s a secret : the makers clearly had no interest in verisimilitude .
It ’s been the rough approach of artists working the India material for the last hundred years .
It arises from a clear understanding of “ audience ” .
The awgee mobs filling theatres around the world , and paying in dollars or some such muscular currency , cannot tell the difference between Hindi and Hindu or the vast distance between Mumbai and Agra .
Much like the American tourists at the Taj Mahal , who cannot distinguish between an unlettered , ignorant urchin and a licensed guide .
Update : I wonder if African - Americans are becoming similarly wary of being congratulated on Obama 's election to the presidency .
Apparently , they are :-)
With jQuery 1.3.2 out the door I ’ve been looking for more ways to profile and optimize jQuery .
Previously I did a survey of jQuery - using sites to figure out which selectors they were using .
This led to the construction of the new Sizzle Selector Engine which targeted those selectors for improvement .
Additionally , I constructed a deep profiling plugin for jQuery which helped to spot methods that were taking a long time to run in live jQuery sites .
This helped bring about the improvements in jQuery 1.2.6 , 1.3 , and 1.3.2 .
What do we tackle next ?
A good place to start would be to tackle optimizing methods that are obviously inefficient – but how do we determine that ?
One way would be to measure the number of function calls that occur every time a method is run .
Firebug provides this information in its profiling data ( along with how long it takes to run each method ) .
Unfortunately it ’s very clunky to manually type out code , check the results in the console , and determine if they ’re bad or if they ’ve changed .
If only there was a way to progamatically get at those numbers .
FireUnit Profiling Methods
Yesterday I did some work to make getting at the profiling data possible , adding two new methods to FireUnit .
fireunit.getProfile ( ) ;
Run this method after you ’ve run console. profile ( ) ; and console.profileEnd( ) ; to get a full dump of the profiling information .
For example , given the following profile run :
You ’ll get the following JavaScript object returned from fireunit.getProfile ( ) :
{ " time " : 8.443 , " calls " : 611 , " data " : [ { " name " : " makeArray ( ) " , " calls " : 1 , " percent " : 23.58 , " ownTime " : 1.991 , " time " : 1.991 , " avgTime " : 1.991 , " minTime " : 1.991 , " maxTime " : 1.991 , " fileName " : " jquery.js ( line 2059 ) " } , // etc. ]}
fireunit.profile ( fn ) ;
The second method added to FireUnit provides an easy way to execute and profile a single function .
Roughly , this method starts the profiler , executes the function , stops the profiler , and then returns the results from getProfile ( ) .
Additionally , it watches for any exceptions that might be thrown and makes sure that the profiler is cleanly turned off anyway ( a frequent frustration of mine ) .
You would use it like this :
fireunit.profile( function ( ) { document.getElementsByClassName(" foo " ) ; } ) ;
How To Use
First , you ’ll need to be sure to have the latest copy of FireUnit installed .
I ’ve built a copy of the latest code , into an extension , if you wish to install it :
When running it you ’ll need to make sure that :
Both the Console and Script tabs are enabled in Firebug That the ‘ extensions.firebug.throttleMessages ’ property in ‘ about : config ’ is set to ‘ false ’ .
The Results
I put up a test page so that I could quickly run through some jQuery methods to see how they stacked up .
Here are the results of running against jQuery 1.3.2 ( “ Method ” is the jQuery method that was called , with the specified arguments , “ Calls ” is the number of function calls that occurred when executing the method , “ Big - O ” is a very rough Big - O Notation for the function calls ) :
Method Calls Big- O .addClass ( “ test ” ) ; 542 6n .addClass ( “ test ” ) ; 592 6n .removeClass ( “ test ” ) ; 754 8n .removeClass ( “ test ” ) ; 610 6n .css ( “ color ” , “ red ” ) ; 495 5n .css ( {color : “ red ” , border : “ 1px solid red ”} ) ; 887 9n .remove ( ) ; 23772 2n+n2 .append (“ < p>test </p > ” ) ; 307 3n .append ( “ < p>test</ p><p>test</p>
< p>test</p><p>test</p><p>test</p > ” ) ; 319 3n . show ( ) ; 394 4n .hide ( ) ; 394 4n .html ( “ < p>test </p > ” ) ; 28759 3n+n2 .empty ( ) ; 28452 3n+n2 .is( “ div ” ) ; 110 . filter ( “ div ” ) ; 216 2n . find ( “ div ” ) ; 1564 16n
We can immediately see , by looking at the big- O notation , that most jQuery methods execute at least one function for every element that they have to operate against .
addClass runs about 6 functions per element , filter runs about 2 , and ‘ is ’ runs only 1 .
We can see the problematic functions sticking out like a massive sore thumb : .remove ( ) , .empty ( ) , and .html ( ) – they all run over n2 function calls , which is a huge issue .
( These numbers are all large for a simple reason : .html ( ) uses .empty ( ) , .empty ( ) uses .remove ( ) , and .remove ( ) is obviously inefficient . )
While function calls do not , necessarily , indicate slow code ( a lot of jQuery ’s internal functions are pretty lightweight ) it is very likely to indicate inefficiently - written code .
I poked around the code for a little bit and realized that .remove ( ) could be dramatically simplified .
I filed a ticket and landed a patch which resulted in these much - improved numbers :
Method Calls Big- O .remove ( ) ; 298 3n .html ( “ < p>test </ p > ” ) ; 507 5n .empty ( ) ; 200 2n
I ’m really excited by this new tool .
Automating the process of code profiling opens up whole avenues of exploration .
Even using nothing more than the above tool I can immediately see room for improving just about every jQuery method .
It ’s also be very interesting to have this running in some sort of continuous integration setting , to catch any egregious regressions – but I ’ll leave that for another day .
Israeli ambassador to Washington resigns
Sallai Meridor , the Israeli ambassador to Washington , is resigning , the Israeli Embassy has confirmed .
“ Israel ’s Ambassador to the United States , Sallai Meridor , this week informed Prime Minister Olmert , Foreign Minister Livni and Prime Minister Designate Netanyahu of his intention to end his term of service as Ambassador and to return to Israel in the near future , ” the embassy said in a statement .
“ Meridor informed each of the above mentioned Israeli leaders of his intentions during the course of personal meetings which he had with them on Monday , before he joined the US Secretary of State on her visit to Israel . ”
“ The bigger story of Sallai resigning may portend that he wants to get out of the ship before the hurricane hits , ” said one Washington Middle East policy analyst informed of the news .
“ I think that these are two governments on a collision course . ”
“ You have an American administration which for the first time in eight years wants to accelerate the peace process , while in Israel you have a new administration that wants to turn it around , ” he added .
“ That ’s a sure - fire formula for collision . ”
Israeli daily Ha’aretz reported Thursday that Israeli prime minister designate Benjamin Netanyahu asked Meridor to leave the room during a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Middle East peace envoy George Mitchell .
Meridor had already offered his resignation in advance of that meeting , a Washington source said .
He suggested it was normal for the ambassador appointed by the outgoing Israeli prime minister to offer his resignation when a new prime minister comes in .
Some analysts in Israel and Washington also thought Meridor might have wanted to resign in advance of the possibility that Netanyahu could offer the foreign minister job to Avigdor Lieberman , the leader of the right - wing Yisrael Beitenu Party .
The embassy statement said Meridor hoped his replacement would be appointed as soon as possible , and that he would continue to serve in his position until his replacement arrived .
Meridor has served as Israel ’s ambassador to Washington since 2006 .
The deputy chief of mission , Jeremy Issacharoff , is also scheduled to leave this summer , The Cable was told .

NEWS Ltd boss John Hartigan admits his newspapers were wrong to publish nude photos that falsely claimed to be of Pauline Hanson .
But he says the mistake should n't hurt an industry push for greater press freedom .
The News Ltd chairman and chief executive has told a Sydney conference that broader freedoms being sought by the media carry " enormous responsibilities " .
" The media does make mistakes , as some of our newspapers realised last week and more mistakes will happen , " he said .
" But in my 40 - odd years working as a journalist , I can say with conviction that most mistakes happen because journalists are fallible , like everyone else , and very rarely do these mistakes come about because of malice , or an arrogant disregard by the media . "
The Sugar Learning Platform was originally designed to serve as the interactive software environment for the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project 's XO laptop .
The platform offers a unique child - friendly user interface and a growing number of software applications that are intended to facilitate self - directed learning .
Sugar Labs , the organization behind the project , announced this week the official release of version 0.84 .
Sugar Labs , which was founded last year by former OLPC software director Walter Bender , aims to bring Sugar to a broader audience and make it more accessible to students .
The OLPC project recently discontinued its direct involvement with Sugar development and has left Sugar Labs to take over the responsibility of maintaining and improving the platform .
Sugar Labs seems to have gotten off to a pretty good start .
The organization has improved many areas of the platform and has added several features that will make it more practical and effective in a conventional classroom environment .
" We 're excited about this release , which runs on more PCs than before and has great new Activities for kids to explore together , " said Bender in a statement .
" As we approach the 1 millionth child ' learning to learn ' with Sugar on the OLPC XO - 1 , we call for volunteers to join us — a challenge to educate for developers , designers , translators , and deployers . "
Some of the new software programs that Sugar Labs has added to the platform include a mindmap tool for interactive diagramming and a portfolio system that will make it easier for teachers to review student progress .
The Sugar Journal , a unique time - based content tracker that is used in the platform instead of a conventional hierarchical filesystem , has also received several noteworthy improvements .
Bender says that it now provides better support for allowing students to modify and annotate their past work .
One of the major goals on the project 's roadmap is to make it possible for users to boot and run Sugar entirely from a USB memory stick on a wide range of conventional hardware .
This self - contained environment , which they call Sugar on a Stick , would reduce some of the barriers to entry for adopting Sugar .
Bender hopes that volunteers will test Sugar on a Stick on various hardware configurations to help make it more robust .
The latest version of Sugar can be downloaded from the Sugar Labs website .
It is supported on several mainstream Linux distributions , including Fedora , Debian , Ubuntu , and openSUSE .
Sugar Labs has also published instructions that describe how to put the latest version of Sugar on an OLPC XO laptop .
Users who want to help test the experimental Live USB environment can obtain the image and instructions from the Sugar Labs wiki .

Golden Globes Website Oops : Best Actress Winner Revealed ?
The 66th Annual Golden Globes aired on Sunday night , January 11th on NBC , whereserved as Miss Golden Globe 2009 Extra learned of a snafu that occurred on the Golden Globes website earlier in the week that could have been a spoiler
For a short time , the Golden Globes website showed there was a winner in the Best Actress in a Motion Picture category .
The winner was reported to be Anne Hathaway for her role in Rachel Getting Married .
The GG folks indicate it was " accidental " and Hathaway 's rep called it just a " glitch " .
One might assume , therefore , that the website was being prepared in advance so that it could be quickly published for viewers immediately after the broadcast .
As it turned out - it was just a glitch .
The winner was Kate Winslet , who took home two Golden Globes .
Hathaway did win Best Actress at the Critics ' Choice Awards on Thursday night for Rachel Getting Married .

How to Pay Off a Home Mortgage Early
Note : Read our guide on what to do once you pay off your mortgage .
If you are still some ways off towards this goal , we summarize below whether you should pay off your mortgage early or not .
For most of us , our monthly home mortgage payment is our single largest expense .
It allows us a place to call home , to raise our kids , and to live our lives .
But at the same time , it constrains us in many ways .
For example , it may make it difficult for one spouse to leave a job to stay back home with kids .
It creates stress whenever job security is called into question .
For some , the burden of a significant debt such as this can be overpowering and they may be looking to get out of debt completely , regardless of whether it is the best course of action or not .
Unfortunately , there are probably as many good arguments against paying off a home mortgage early , as there are for it .
Bible Money Matters provides an excellent summary of both sides of the arguments and makes a case for paying it off early .
If you are considering paying off your home early , think why ?
Is it because you want to get out of debt quickly , or is it the improved cash flow after the pay off ?
If you are towards the end of your loan term , than it may make sense to pay it off and be done with .
However , if you are within the first 10 years of your loan you may want to crunch some numbers before you decide on a course of action .
Should you invest extra cash or pay down the mortgage
For some , seeing their loan balance dwindle at a fast rate is very powerful .
The true answer lies in three very important numbers .
These are , the rate of interest you are paying on your loan , the remaining term of your obligation and the expected rate of return on the investments you are considering .
Now here is what happens .
You know the parameters of your mortgage : months left to go and the interest rate if you are on fixed .
But you can only guess on your returns on the investments in the future .
This is one of the reasons why you may feel more comfortable making extra house payments compared to investing that money .
It is easier to take an option where the facts are known .
However , if you choose to make history your guide , than you will find that investing in US Large Caps over a long term ( defined as 20 - 100 years depending on the study you look at ) has returned 9 - 10 % in nominal terms or close to 6 % in real terms ( after adjusting for inflation ) .
US bonds on the other hand have returned close to 5 - 6 % over a long term .
Many academics , such as Jeremy Siegel believe that you will not lose money in the stock market ( assuming diversified portfolio of US stocks such as SP500 index ) if you invest for 20 years or more .
This is based on the US historical data and includes market turmoil due to world wars , many recessions , oil shocks and the great depression .
It is however debatable if the US markets will ever perform in the future in the manner they did in the past .
Good news is that as an investor , we are no longer shackled to the US markets and can take advantage of international growth .
Let ’s crunch some numbers , shall we .
First , let me outline my assumptions ( which you may change to fit your situation ) .
Assumptions
30 year fixed rate mortgage of $ 350,000
7 % annual interest , compounded monthly
30 % tax deduction on mortgage interest
$ 1000 available every month to make extra house payments OR to invest
20 + year expected investment returns of 10 % annually , compounded monthly .
The number you use here will depend on your risk profile and asset allocation .
These assumptions yield the following scenarios
At the end of House balance with regular payments
House alance with extra payments of $ 1000 per month
Value of investment of $ 1000 per month
5 years $ 329,460.56 $ 257,867.66 $ 78,082.38 10 years $ 300,343.34 $ 127,258.53 $ 206,552.02 164 months $ 271,517.03 $ 0 $ 350,912.79 15 years $ 259,066.03 $ 0 $ 417,924.27 30 years $ 0 $ 0 $ 2,279,325.32
The following conclusions can be drawn from the table above :
Paying $ 1000 extra every month for the house pays it off completely in little less than 14 years .
We cut down the effective term of the loan by more than 50 %
If you choose to invest , at the end of 164 months ( by the time you would have paid off your home if you had made extra payments ) , you will have $ 350 K in your investment account .
This is enough to pay off the balance of the mortgage at that time if you choose , with almost $ 80 K left over
If you choose to continue to invest and pay only the regular payments on the mortgage , at the end of 30 years you will be paid off with $ 2.3 million in investments
On the other hand if you pay off your home in 164 months and start investing your monthly payments ( including the extra $ 1000 ) , at the end of 30 years you will have $ 1.65 million in investments at the end of 30 years , which is almost $ 630 K less than if you had decided to just make regular monthly payments and invest the excess capital every month .
If you bought your house in early 30s , this extra $ 630 K in 30 years could amount to as much as $ 5 million for your estate assuming you die in your 80s ( also depends on your investment mix )
Other reasons why you should choose to invest your extra cash
Liquidity : Cash that is invested is much more liquid than tying it up in your home .
Very little discussion takes place about liquidity on the blogs and in the financial press , but if you have an emergency you would much rather have investments as opposed to trying to tap your home equity
Opportunity Costs : Investments would allow you to have capital ( and possibly more of it ) when a good business opportunity presents itself .
Tax benefits : Yeah , I know this is a cliche but consider this :
You would pay approximately $ 300 K less in interest over the life time of the mortgage ( in the example ) if you pay it off in 164 months as opposed to 30 years ( and still end up with less savings at the end of 30 years ) .
If you take 30 % of this number as the tax benefit you realize over the life of the loan , and invest it as you accrue this benefit ( in addition to the $ 1000 that you invest ) , you will end up with greater than $ 2.7 million in investments after 30 years , which is more than $ 1 million more if you compare this to paying off your mortgage early .
Now of course there will be taxes on your investment returns ( dividends , capital gains , etc ) so the ultimate benefit may be somewhere in between $ 630 K and $ 1 million , but it is still a good chunk of change .
Earnings interruption :
If you lose your job , or your earnings are interrupted for any reason before your home is paid off , you are still required to continue paying by your bank .
This may become difficult if you are trying to pay off your mortgage early and have not saved much in the process .
If on the other hand you had invested the excess capital , you would have extra savings to fall back on to continue making your payments for some time .
Create a separate investment account for extra mortgage payments
If you are still torn between paying off mortgage early versus investing , here is a quick tip .
Create a separate investment account and pay this extra mortgage payment into this account instead of sending this to your mortgage company .
Select well diversified stock investments like a combination of S&P index fund and few diversified international etfs .
If you want to reduce volatility in this portfolio ( returns will be lower as well ) , you can throw in some high grade bond funds in the mix , but try not to have more than 25 - 30 % of your portfolio in bonds as this will reduce your long term returns .
Once you have settled on your portfolio mix , just keep contributing to this account every month , and once a year , re-balance your portfolio to bring your asset allocation in line .
If at the end of 14 - 15 years , you still want to pay your mortgage off completely , just tap into this account and write the check to the mortgage company .
Or if the stock market has not done too well over this period , you have the luxury of waiting for the right time to sell your investments to pay off your mortgage with this method .
More likely than not , you will find that investing the money has given you much better returns and you would rather continue to invest .
If you want some extra cash flow now , consider refinancing mortgage at the current low rates , and if you are able to do it , invest a large part of the savings in your mortgage investment account .
In the unlikely event 🙂 if you are still convinced that paying off your mortgage early is a great idea , you can refer to fivecentnickle ’s post for ideas on how to pay off your mortgage early .

Bosses at Twitter think they ’ve solved the site ’s major problem : how to make cash without alienating the user base .
The company has confirmed it will offer premium accounts where businesses pay a subscription fee to access extra services , but maintains that the existing system of free accounts for all will remain unchanged .
Co-founder Biz Stone told Reuters he believed firms would pay to access services which will help them get “ even more ” value out of Twitter .
The firm is n’t saying anything else about what services a premium account would include .
One possibility is that it would include getting priority access to Twitter ’s servers , making such users less likely to see the dreaded “ fail whale ” that appears when the site is overloaded .
That would be stretching the promise to maintain services to free account users : the functionality would remain unchanged , but the reliability would potentially deteriorate .
It ’s also possible Twitter could be thinking of offering features such as an enhanced search or monitoring service .
But it ’s tough to see how the site would make those marketable without restricting the access that existing third - party services such as TweetDeck and Twirhl currently enjoy .
The news comes as Twitter announces it ’s first significant revenue stream , a sponsorship deal with Microsoft .
In return for its payment , the Microsoft branding will appear on ExecTweets , a site which carries a stream of Twitter posts from leading business executives .
Twitter has denied its received any cash from people who appear on ‘ Suggested Users ’ , a list which appears alongside the site ’s tools for finding existing friends on the service .
As appearing on the list greatly increases the number of people following your messages , it would be a valuable opportunity for anyone using Twitter as a promotional tool .
However , Stone says spots on the list are not for sale .
Instead the firm uses an automated program for identifying users with lots of followers who post regularly .
Staff then check these results and pick out those which they believe people will genuinely be most interested in .
Collocations –
Do we need them ?
3 March 2009
Posted by Oliver Mason in linguistics
The concept of collocation was introduced in the middle of the last century by J.R.
Firth with his famous quote “ You shall know a word by the company it keeps ” .
Words are not distributed randomly in a text , but instead they stick with each other , their ‘ company ’ .
Starting in the late 1980s , the increased interest in collocation by computational linguists and others working in NLP has lead to a proliferation of methods and algorithms to extract collocations from text corpora .
Typically one starts with the environment of the target ( or node ) word , and collects all the words that are within a certain distance ( or span ) of the node .
Then their frequency in a reference corpus is compared with their frequency in the environment of the node , and from the ratio of frequencies we determine whether they ’re near the node by chance or because they ’re part of the node ’s company .
A bewildering variety of so - called significance functions exists , the oldest probably being the z - score , used by Berry - Rogghe in 1973 ; later , Church and Hanks ( 1991 ) popularised mutual information and t- score , which now seem to have been displaced by log- likelihood as the predominant measure of word association .
The problem is : all these metrics yield different results , and nobody knows ( or can tell ) which are ‘ right ’ .
Mutual information , for example , favours rare words , while the t- score promotes words which are relatively frequent already .
But apart from rules - of - thumb , there exists no linguistic justification why one metric is preferable to another .
It is all rather ad - hoc .
Part of this is that collocation as a concept is rather underspecified .
What does it mean for a word to be ‘ significantly more common ’ near the node word as opposed to be there just by chance ?
In a sense , collocations are just diagnostics : we know there are words that are to be expected next to bacon , and we look for collocates and find rasher .
Fantastic !
Just what we expected .
But then we look at fire , and find leafcutter as a very significant collocate .
How can that happen ?
What is the connection between fire and leafcutter ?
The answer is : ants .
There are fire ants , and there are leafcutter ants , and they are sometimes mentioned in the same sentence .
This leads us to an issue which I believe gets us on the right track in the end : the fallacy of using the word as the primary unit of analysis .
In the latter example , we ’re not dealing with fire and leafcutter , we ’re instead concerned with fire ants .
Once we realise that , then it is perfectly natural to see leafcutter ants as a collocate , whereas we would be surprised to find engine , which instead is a collocate of the lexical item fire .
So , phraseology is the clue .
If we get away from single words , and instead consider multi- word units , then we also have an explanation for collocations .
Single words form part of larger MWUs , together with other single words .
So leafcutter often forms a unit with ants , as does fire .
More generally , MWUs such as parameters of the model are formed of several single words , and here we can observe that parameters and model occur together .
But they form a single unit of analysis , and only if we break up this unit by considering single words , then we can observe that parameters and model commonly occur together .
From this we can define a very simple procedure to compute collocations : from a corpus , gather all the MWUs that are associated with a particular word .
Get a frequency list of all the single word items in those MWUs , sort by frequency , and there we are .
To conclude , collocation is an epiphenomenon of phraseology , a side - effect of words forming larger units .
Phraseological units contain multiple single words , and those are picked up by collocation software , because those are the ones that commonly occur in a text together .
And the reason for occurring together is that they form a single unit .
Once we look at text in terms of MWUs , the need for collocation disappears .
Collocation just picks out the constituent elements of multi- word units .
One could of course argue that this is a circular argument , that we are simply replacing a procedure to calculate collocations by one that calculates MWUs .
But the difference between those two procedures is that MWU - recognition does not require complicated statistics ( which I find hard to see justification for ) , but instead simply looks at recurrent patternings in language .
MWUs are re-usable chunks of texts , which can be justified on the grounds of usage .
Collocation is a much harder concept to explain and integrate into views of language .
And , as it turns out , we do n’t really need it at all .

World Court rules US execution of Mexican national defied international law
By Kate Randall
23 January 2009
The International Court of Justice in The Hague has ruled that the United States breached the court 's order and violated an international treaty when a Mexican national was executed last year in Texas .
The ICJ ruling confirms the flagrant disregard for international law practiced by both federal and state governments in the US , and by the US Supreme Court .
In particular , it demonstrates official American flouting of an international convention governing foreign consular relations and the death penalty .
In its unanimous ruling Monday , the ICJ , also known as the World Court , found " that the United States of America has breached the obligation incumbent upon it under the Order indicating provisional measures of 16 July 2008 , in the case of Mr. Jose Ernesto Medellin Rojas . "
Jose Ernesto Medellin , 33 , was put to death by lethal injection in Texas on August 5 , 2008 .
He was arrested and convicted in the 1993 gang rape and murder of two Texas teenagers , Elizabeth Pena , 16 , and Jennifer Ertman , 14 .
Medellin was executed less than three week 's after the ICJ ordered the US to stay the imminent executions of five Mexicans on death row in Texas .
In that ruling , the World Court ordered that the US should " take all measures necessary to ensure [ they ] are not executed pending judgment ... unless and until these five Mexican nationals receive review and reconsideration [ of their sentences ] .
At issue in these cases was US violation of Article 36 of the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations ( VCCR ) , which mandates that local authorities inform all detained foreigners " without delay " of their right to have their consulate notified of their detention .
Washington ratified the VCCR in 1969 , along with an optional protocol giving the ICJ jurisdiction over the convention .
In 2004 , in response to a petition filed by the Mexican government , the ICJ — the UN 's judicial arm for resolving dispute among nations — ordered new hearings for Mexican death - row inmates who claimed they had been denied the right to contact their consulate in a timely manner .
According to the Death Penalty Information Center , as of October 7 , 2008 , of the 124 foreign nationals on death rows across the US , 56 were Mexican , including 35 in California and 13 in Texas .
It is estimated that a quarter of the more than 22 million people living in Texas , which borders Mexico , are of Mexican heritage .
Mexico formally abolished the death penalty in 2005 , and there is widespread hostility among the Mexican population to the execution of Mexican immigrants in the US .
Jose Ernesto Medellin's case was followed closely in Mexico .
At every stage , the actions of the Bush administration , Texas state authorities and the US Supreme Court served to pave the way for his execution , in defiance of the World Court 's order .
With a combination of cynicism and contempt for international law , they worked hand in hand to achieve the ultimate grisly outcome on August 5 .
Following the 2004 order by the World Court that new hearings be held for the 51 Mexicans on death row who claimed their consular rights had been violated , the Bush administration ordered Texas and the other states with such prisoners to comply with the order .
While serving the appearance of abiding by the ICJ ruling , the practical effect of Bush 's order was to delay any ruling by the US Supreme Court on the issue and stall precedent being set on consular rights .
In March 2005 , the Bush administration then withdrew from the optional protocol to the VCCR .
This meant that while remaining a signer to the Convention , the US would refuse to submit to international law to enforce it .
This signaled the government 's intent to flout the 2004 order , which found its ultimate expression in the execution of Jose Medellin without determining whether the denial of his consular rights had impaired his defense .
Texas , which has claimed all along that the state is not bound by international law , challenged the necessity of holding hearings for the condemned prisoners .
Following the ICJ's July 16 , 2008 ruling , a spokesman for Texas Governor Rick Perry commented : " The World Court has no standing in Texas and Texas is not bound by a ruling or edict from a foreign court .
It is easy to get caught up in discussions of international law and justice and treaties .
It 's very important to remember that these individuals are on death row for killing our citizens . "
The Supreme Court ruled last March that only legislative action by Congress could mandate states to hold the hearings ordered by the International Court of Justice .
On the night of Medellin 's scheduled execution , the lethal injection was held up for four hours while the high court considered a last - minute appeal to spare his life .
The majority on the court argued that since no serious legislative proceedings were under way either in the US Congress or the Texas legislature that might affect Medellin 's case , his execution should proceed .
Two days after Medellin was executed , Heliberto Chi , a Honduran national , was also put to death in Texas .
The US high court also rejected his appeal on grounds that his consular rights had been violated .
And the killing machine in Texas continues to grind on .
Since Medellin 's execution , Texas has sent 15 more prisoners to their deaths , and 12 more are scheduled to die between now and the beginning of April , including four before the end of this month .
It is fitting that the ICJ ruling came down on Monday , the last full day of the Bush presidency .
George W. Bush will be remembered not only for crimes of preemptive war , illegal detention and torture , but for his championing of capital punishment at home in violation of international law and his dismissal of an increasingly revolted world public opinion .
In his five years as Texas governor from 1995 to 2000 , Bush oversaw 152 executions , the most of any modern - day governor .
In addition to foreign nationals , the condemned individuals included the mentally impaired , those executed for crimes committed when they were juveniles , as well as two women .
Farewell to the " executioner in chief . "
Sitting in the ticket booth at Dufferin Station last Friday , Russell Cormier was idly chatting with his partner when he heard a rumbling screech from the tunnel below .
" It was this loud screeching sound , steel on steel , as the brakes went .
Then all of a sudden we heard screaming .
People started running upstairs .
They were yelling , ` Kids !
He pushed the kids ! ' "
By this time , Cormier was out of the booth trying to make sense of what was happening .
That 's when he saw a middle - aged man bounding up the escalator from the eastbound platform .
He looked vacant .
" Someone yelled , ` That 's him !
That 's him ! ' "
Cormier lunged at him as the suspect dashed for the exit turnstiles .
By this time , Cormier 's partner , Joe De Gabrielis , had jumped into the fray .
The suspect wrestled away from Cormier , then swung at De Gabrielis .
He bounded outside and began sprinting down the street , with Cormier at his heels .
" I just needed another six inches of arm 's length .
I was right behind him , but could n't quite get hold , " he said .
At this point , Cormier began questioning whether he should even be chasing him at all .
Cormier , 47 , is a large man , and suffered a heart attack a year and a half before .
" But I just thought of those kids and my own kids and I could n't let this guy get away , " he said .
Just as the suspect was about to slip inside a restaurant , Cormier pounced on him , sending the man to the concrete below .
" I told him to stay down or he 's going to get hurt . "
And he did .
Cormier , who many have hailed as a hero , recounted the harrowing tale yesterday afternoon outside Sick Kids hospital .
Cormier , along with his wife and daughter , had just been to visit one of the victims from the attack , Jacob Greenspon .
The 15 - year - old was one of two teens pushed from the Dufferin subway platform by a stranger during rush hour Friday .
The attack was unprovoked .
The teens survived because of the quick thinking of Greenspon 's friend , who rolled to the crawl space as the train was approaching , pulling Greenspon along with him .
Greenspon miraculously survived , but the train crushed his foot .
He is due back in surgery today and is doing well , said Cormier .
The hospital room was crowded with Greenspon 's classmates and friends .
Everyone seemed in good spirits , said Cormier .
It 's been a difficult year for Cormier .
Almost a year ago , a woman threw herself under the streetcar he was driving .
Then last month , he was attacked by a man at the Dufferin station after asking for a fare .
The man threw the Metropass in his face , then assaulted him .

UN officials warn the so - called " no fire zone " in Sri Lanka , a nearly 14 - square - mile area along the northeast where civilians are trapped between the rebel Tamil Tigers and advancing government forces , is in danger of becoming a humanitarian catastrophe .
Civilians trapped there cannot stay for fear of being shelled by the government , but they can not run for fear of being shot by the rebels .
While scarce water and medical supplies are dwindling , UN officials have been fearful to directly criticize the Sri Lankan government as they expect the government might expel aid groups in response .
Our first rumor and gossip since has emerged since our new design and migration over from tumeroks.com .
Sources say a 5th Blizzard game is in their early development stage .
5th you say–
What was the fourth ?
If you ’re still not clued in yet :
Starcraft II Diablo III New World of Warcraft expansion Next - Gen MMO
A new unannounced game ( New IP ? )
The rumor surfaced last week when Blizzard posted 2 new job opportunities under the “ unannounced ” category for two software engineers .
According to a blue post from Blizzard regarding the new positions :
Update : March 24 — The job openings mentioned in this newspost is indeed a brand - new game that has not been mentioned before .
1 . This brand - new game is not a World of Warcraft expansion , and it is not related to the Next - Gen MMO .
2 . In the present , the brand - new game is using the World of Warcraft engine merely for testing purposes .
3 . The Client Software Engineer job opening is to hire the person that will have the responsibility to develop an engine from scratch for this game .
This new engine will be built depending on the skill and interest of the person hired for this position .
Whether this game is based on the three major franchises ( Warcraft , Starcraft or Diablo ) or a new IP , that remains unknown .
The first time a new IP was hinted was as far back as 2006 , when Paul Sams said the following to Gamespot :
Paul Sams : “ I would n’t be surprised to see a new franchise from us at some time in the future ; there ’s certainly a desire to do so .�?
Two years down the line , Paul Sams announces the Next - Gen MMO is in production but also mentioned interest in a new IP .
So far , Paul Sams has been living up to his words .
Although the title still remains a secret , it is official they are working on the Next - Gen MMO .
A few months ago you offered a job on the official Blizzard webpage , Considering a next gen MMO …
A community manager added that its about a game that has n’t been announced yet .
Is there any new information on that or is Diablo the mentioned next gen MMO ?
Rob Pardo :
No , its obviously not , since it is not an MMO !
We have another development team , that is …
So there is still one project ?
Rob Pardo : Yea , there is still one “ unknown � ?
project … – source : OnlineWelten
Blizzard has very strong IP , but it also seems like all of it was created in the last century .
PS : First of all , that ’s true that we ’ve not introduced any new franchises this century .
I think what it really comes down to is , we ask the teams what they want to make next .
I think the folks at our company are concerned , if they ’re going to do a new franchise , that it be worthy – and that it be something that is equivalent or better than what we ’ve done before , because they do n’t want to do a franchise that ’s not .
These are three of the best - selling franchises of all time , and very well - loved .
So you ’ve got a pretty high bar of trying to figure out what those franchises might be .
What I will say , though , is that the idea of a new franchise is very intriguing to employees of the company .
Are we ever going to release a new one ?
I would absolutely say we will at some point .
I just do n’t know when that day will be quite yet .— source : Gamasutra
When the man says they ’re bringing out a new game or whatever , I believe him .
He has lived up to his word so far and I do feel they have the budget and are in need of banging out a new IP .
Also consider the fact that they ’ve yet to release any new franchise for this century .
Paul Sams :

Are we ever going to release a new one ?
I would absolutely say we will at some point .
I just do n’t know when that day will be quite yet .
So far , Blizzard has pretty much covered almost every genre of games out but a shooter .
I wonder if that ’s within the line of what they ’re looking to develop .
Feel free to share your thoughts and opinion .
Gilad Shalit - Egypt has been leading talks that could lead to his release
Israel will not agree to a truce in Gaza unless an Israeli soldier held by Palestinian militants is freed , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has said .
Gilad Shalit was captured by Palestinian militants in 2006 .
There have been reports that Egypt was close to brokering a long - term truce between Hamas and Israel .
A punishing three - week Israeli assault on Gaza aimed at stopping militant rocket fire on Israel ended with separate ceasefires in January .
The uneasy calm has been punctuated by exchanges of fire between the two sides .
" The position of the prime minister is that Israel wo n't reach any arrangement on a truce before the release of Gilad Shalit , " Mr Olmert 's office said in a statement .
Prisoner swap talks
On Thursday , Hamas officials said they expected a truce with Israel to be announced within days .
Any truce is expected to see Israel gradually open the borders to Gaza , ending the blockade it has enforced since Hamas seized control of the territory in mid-2007 .
In return , Israel wants to see an end to weapons smuggling and attacks from Gaza .
Moussa Abu Marzouk , a deputy leader of Hamas , said his group had agreed to the terms of an 18 - month ceasefire with Israel and that he expected it would be announced within 48 hours .
But Israel reportedly wants any ceasefire to be open - ended .
Separately , Egypt has also been leading negotiations on a prisoner swap that would see Cpl Gilad Shalit released in exchange for several hundred Palestinians held by Israel .
Hamas has refused to link the release of Cpl Shalit with the proposed ceasefire .
The cost of sending text messages while overseas should drop Using a mobile phone abroad in Europe looks set to get cheaper .
European MPs have brokered an agreement that will see the tariffs for making calls , sending text messages and browsing the web fall from July 2009 .
All the prices that have been agreed are regarded as a ceiling and are the maximum that operators will be allowed to charge for the different services .
Before coming into force the tariffs must be approved by member states and the European parliament .
' Disappointment '
The agreement caps the cost of sending a text message at 11 cents ( 10 p ) throughout Europe .
Currently , texting tariffs vary widely across Europe .
On average Europeans pay 29 cents to send a text and some pay as much as 80 cents .
ROAMING COSTS - OUTGOING CALLS 43 cents per minute from July 2009 39 cents per minute from July 2010 35 cents per minute from July 2011
Other data costs , charged to send e-mails or browse the web , will be regulated at the operator level .
The agreement fixes how much a roaming operator can charge a customer 's home operator .
From July 2009 the rate will be a maximum of 1 euro ( 92 p ) per megabyte and will fall to 50 cents ( 46 p ) from July 2011 .
ROAMING COSTS - DATA 1 euro per megabyte from July 2009 80 cents per megabyte from July 2010 50 cents per megabyte from July 2011
In addition mobile owners will be able to agree a spending cap with their operators to ensure they do not rack up huge , unexpected bills while abroad .
Customers will be warned when they have reached 80 % of their spending limit .
The agreement also further pushes down the price of making a phone call while abroad .
For each minute of conversation , customers should be charged no more than 43 cents from July 2009 .
Further falls will follow in 2010 , and 2011 .
Mobile operators will also have to change the way they charge customers for calls .
Currently many round call durations up to the nearest minute before working out charges .
Under the proposed agreement operators will have to move to per-second call charges but can impose an initial minimum charging period 30 seconds in length .
The GSM Association said it was disappointed with some aspects of the deal which brought price caps in earlier and went further than had been initially suggested by the European Commission .
The agreement goes before the European Parliament 's industry committee on 31 March and is expected to be voted on in a full session by 24 April .

Halo 3 players are a popular target for the Xbox attacks Xbox Live is being targeted by malicious hackers selling services that kick players off the network .
The booting services are proving popular with players who want a way to get revenge on those who beat them in an Xbox Live game .
The attackers are employing data flooding tools that have been used against websites for many years .
Microsoft is " investigating " the use of the tools and said those caught using them would be banned from Xbox Live .
" There 's been a definite increase in the amount of people talking about and distributing these things over the last three to four weeks , " said Chris Boyd , director of malware research at Facetime Communications .
Attack tool " The smart thing about these Xbox tools is that they do not attack the Xbox Live network itself , " he said .
He said the tools work by exploiting the way that the Xbox Live network is set up .
Game consoles connecting to the Xbox network send data via the net , and for that it needs an IP address .
Even better , said Mr Boyd , games played via Xbox Live are not hosted on private servers .
The tools mean anyone with a few dollars can boot rivals off Xbox Live " Instead , " he said , " a lot of games on Xbox Live are hosted by players . "
If hackers can discover the IP address of whoever is hosting a game they can employ many of the attacks that have been used for years against websites , said Mr Boyd .
One of the most popular for the Xbox Live specialists is the Denial of Service attack which floods an IP address with vast amounts of data .
The flood of data is generated by a group of hijacked home computers , a botnet , that have fallen under the control of a malicious hacking group .
When turned against a website this flood of traffic can overwhelm it or make it unresponsive to legitimate visitors .
When turned against an Xbox owner , it can mean they cannot connect to the Live network and effectively throws them out of the game .
" They get your IP address , put it in the booter tool and they attempt to flood the port that uses Xbox traffic , " said Mr Boyd .
" Flooding that port prevents any traffic getting out . "
Skill set
The hard part , he said , was discovering a particular gamer 's IP address but many malicious hackers had honed the skills needed to find them .
Some interconnect their PC and Xbox and use packet sniffing software to hunt through the traffic flowing in and out of the console for IP addresses .
The hackers target the way Xbox consoles connect to the net Others simply use con tricks to get the target to reveal their net address .
The technical knowledge needed to hunt down IP addresses was quite high , said Mr Boyd , but many of those who had the skills were selling their expertise to those keen to hit back at their rivals on the Xbox Live network .
For $ 20 ( £ 13 ) some Xbox Live hackers will remotely access a customer 's PC and set up the whole system so it can be run any time they need it .
Some offer low rates to add compromised machines to a botnet and increase the amount of data flooding a particular IP address .
Defending against the attack could be tricky , said Mr Boyd : " There 's no real easy solution to this one . "
Although IP addresses regularly change , people could find it takes hours or days for their ISP to move them on to a new one .
In response to the rise in attacks , Microsoft said : " We are investigating reports involving the use of malicious software tools that an attacker could use to try and disrupt an Xbox LIVE player 's internet connection . "
It added : " This problem is not related to the Xbox Live service , but to the player 's internet connection .
The attacker could also attempt [ to ] disrupt other internet activities , such as streaming video or web browsing , using the same tools .
In its statement Microsoft warned : " This malicious activity violates the Xbox Live Terms of Use , and will result in a ban from Xbox Live and other appropriate action .
It urged anyone falling victim to such an attack to contact their ISP to report it and get help fixing it .
In January 2009 Microsoft announced that Xbox Live had more than 17 m members .

There ’s trouble on a desolate stretch of the Danforth , and , like everything else that has ever gone wrong in the entire universe , it ’s all Barack Obama ’s fault .
When it launched early last month , the Obama Café , at 1226 Danforth Avenue , was the city ’s first Obama - themed business .
But it would n’t be alone for long : just a few doors down , at 1236 Danforth , an internet shop formerly known as the United Internet Café got a new red , white , and blue sign of its own , and a new name , just in time for the American president ’s trip to Ottawa : Obama Cybernet Ltd .
( or , if you go by their website , which advertises that “ yes we can help ! ” with your computer needs , the Obama Cybernet Café ) .

The Obama Café — the first one — is owned by Emmanuel Debass .
Since it opened , the themed restaurant has been serving pastries , soups , snacks , and , Debass told Torontoist , “ a lot of coffees from Kenya . ”
It ’s garnered a whole lot of attention , and Debass is n’t even done setting up the store ’s decor and menus yet : the grand opening will be on March 27 , when he ’ll unveil lots more decorations ( to give the place an inauguration feel ) , as well as Obama combos — menu items based on the food Obama eats for his meals , which Debass composed from details gleaned from the White House .

The Obama Cybernet Café , a few dozen feet away , is run by Amveson Fitsumbrahn .
Though it was created after Debass ’s Obama Café , Fitsbumbrahn told Torontoist that he ’s had the idea for nine months , and that on the Danforth his nickname is “ Obama ” ; “ no - one even knows my real name . ”
Though he could n’t vote in the American election himself , according to Fitsumbrahn he helped coordinate some twelve hundred volunteers over the internet for the Obama campaign .
But that ’s not really cutting it for Debass , who thinks that Fitsumbrahn ’s trying to capitalize on his business ’ fast - found popularity .
“ He ’s bringing a lot of confusion with his name , ” Debass says ; when he saw Fitsumbrahn changing the sign right as his own café started swarming with media , “ I said , ‘ what ’s going on with this guy ? ! ' ”
It ’s the proximity that irks Debass most : another Obama café “ right beside me , ” he says , “ is unacceptable . ”
“ He can not do that ….it does n’t work like that in Canada . ”
Debass got his lawyer to write a letter to Fitsumbrahn , and now the whole thing is “ under litigation . ”
Even though he wants Fitsumbrahn ’s store name changed “ by any means necessary , ” Debass still prefers to think that it ’s all a “ misunderstanding ” ; both men reiterated to Torontoist that they ’re from the same community , and neither seems too interested in a fight .
Debass is pretty sure , anyway , that Fitsumbrahn ’s Obama sign is coming down today , a direct result of the threatened legal action .
Fitsumbrahn , though , told Torontoist that he has n’t decided whether to take it down or not yet .
“ I like the name , ” Fitsumbrahn says .
Debass , of course , scoffs at Fitsumbrahn ’s defense .
“ He ’s saying he likes Obama .
Everybody likes Obama ! ”

( PhysOrg.com ) --
On the nanoscale , things are n’t always what they seem .
What first looked like a continuous plasma jet has turned out to be a train of tiny , high - velocity plasma bullets .
Using a camera with an exposure time of a few nanoseconds , researchers have further investigated the plasma bullets , and have even found a way to control them .
Using a high - speed intensified charge coupled device ( ICCD ) , Professor Mounir Laroussi and his students from the Laser & Plasma Engineering Institute at Old Dominion University in Norfolk , Virginia , has taken an up - close look at the little - known plasma bullets .
Their study is published in a recent issue of the Journal of Physics D : Applied Physics .
The plasma bullets are created by a “ plasma pencil , ” which is a pulsed plasma source that the researchers previously developed .
The plasma pencil is a hollow tube about 2.5 cm in diameter that contains two copper electrodes .
To ignite the plasma , the researchers sent a gas mixture of helium and oxygen through holes in the electrodes , and applied high - voltage electric pulses between the electrodes .
When the gas ignited between the electrodes , it launched a plasma plume through the hole of the outer electrode up to 5 cm into the air .

An externally applied dc voltage causes the plasma plume to bend in the opposite direction .

The plasma plume ( which is actually a train of plasma bullets ) moves at a velocity of up to 100,000 meters per second - much faster than the velocity of the gas coming out of the device , which is just 8 meters per second .
Although previous research has explained that photoionization could be responsible for the high velocity , Laroussi and his students at Old Dominion have now found clues to the bullets ’ original formation .
In their study , the researchers found that the length of the electrically - driven plume depends mainly on two parameters : the applied voltage between the two electrodes and the helium gas flow .
Also , the average bullet velocity increases when the voltage increases .
By analyzing images from the ICCD camera , the scientists also found that the bullets always become extinguished when the voltage pulse ends .
By viewing the plasma bullets at multiple angles , the researchers found another surprise : the bullet is not round , but is shaped like a donut , with a hole in the middle .
Based on this shape , the researchers proposed that the plasma bullets are surface waves that travel along the interface between two media - helium and ambient air .
In addition , the researchers found that they could control the initiation time and distance of the plasma bullets by applying an external dc electric field .
The applied field decreased the bullets ’ average velocity and distance traveled .
Also , by applying the electric field perpendicular to the axis of the plasma plume , the negatively charged plume is deflected away from the negatively charged field .
As Laroussi explained , the aim of the study was to attempt to understand the physics behind the formation and propagation of these cold plasma bullets .
“ There has been a lot of debate as to how these bullets propagate .
So we hope that we have contributed some interesting ideas to this debate , ” he told PhysOrg.com , adding that still more work needs to be done .
Laroussi also said that the plasma bullets could be used for biomedical purposes , such as dental and wound healing applications .
Teaming up with microbiologists , Laroussi has already used the tiny plasma bullets to inactivate bacteria , especially those of dental relevance such as Streptococcus mutans which are implicated in the onset and progression of dental caries ( tooth decay ) .

Massimo Vignelli fue un importante y afamado diseñador gráfico e industrial italiano del siglo XX .
Trabajó en varios trabajos importantes de diseño , diseño de muebles , diseño de salas de exposición y diseño de almacenes .
Creó su propia firma , Vignelli Associates , junto con su esposa .
Basó su obra en el modernismo y simplicidad , que se manifiesta a través de su gusto por el uso de diseño geométricos .
Nació el 10 de enero de 1931 , en Milán .
Asistió a una escuela de en Brera , antes de obtener su título de arquitectura en la universidad porno de Milán .
Durante los años 1953 y 1957 , asistió también a la Escuela de Arquitectura en la universidad de Venecia .
En los comienzos de su carrera profesional , su área de especialización será el diseño gráfico para la creación de productos e identidades corporativas .
A finales de la década de 1950 , obtuvo una beca para estudiar en Estados Unidos , concretamente en Towle Silversmiths , Massachusetts y en el Instituto de diseño de Chicago .
En 1957 se casó con Lella Vignelli , a quien conoció cuando impartía unas clases sobre arquitectura .
Unos años más tarde , y juntos , establecieron su propio estudio de arquitectura , que se especializó en diseño de productos domésticos , accesorios de oficina y logotipos .
En 1965 el matrimonio se mudó a Chicago , donde fundaron Unimar International , que se centró específicamente en el diseño gráfico para las grandes empresas .
Las innovadoras ideas de los Vignellis , fue viral en Estados Unidos .
Creaban unos diseños equilibrados , atractivos y funcionales .
Y ya por aquel entonces contaban con equipos informáticos para realizar dichas labores .
En 1966 , Vignelli expandió su negocio y lanzó otra segunda sede de Unimark en Nueva York .
Pronto se conviertría en la empresa más grande del mundo dentro del sector por su expansión .
La firma consigue crear identidades corporativas de las empresas más famosas del momento .
Vignelli diseñó la señalización del sistema de Nueva York .
Posteriormente , Vignelli y Lella fundaron otra firma , Vignelli Associates .
Una vez más su empresa logró captar de nuevo a las empresas con mayor renombre en todo el país , del nivel de IBM , Knoll , etc .
Además de llevar la dirección de arte en todas sus empresas , Vignelli también escribió un libro titulado : Vignelli , de la A a la Z .
En 2009 también escribió un libro digital , que comercializó de forma gratuita .
Massimo Vignelli murió el 27 de mayo de 2014 , después de un largo periodo luchando contra una enfermedad crónica .
Until Tuesday
I was one of 800,000 innocent people in the UK who had their DNA on the police database .
Most of us had a swab sample taken on arrest and our identifiable cell clusters have languished on police files even if charges were dropped or we were found not guilty in court .
In 2003 I was arrested at a protest against the arms dealer BAE Systems and charged with causing £ 80 worth of damage to a bus .
Leaving aside the irony that if any BAE Systems products only caused £ 80 of damage the purchasers would sue for a refund , seven months later I found myself on trial .
After two days I was acquitted on the legal technicality of being innocent .
More important , the court found there was no evidence for a crime having been committed in the first place .
The experience left me frustrated , with only a 20 - minute comedy routine to take away the pain of injustice .
Now before folk howl that I am a champagne anarchist happy to harp on about civil liberties while murderers run free , let me explain my objections .
I have no problem with those found guilty of a serious criminal offence being on the database , especially those in prison - it seems small beer that the state holds a tiny amount of their DNA on file when the primary clump of their genes is being held at Her Majesty 's pleasure .
Likewise those who have served their time : being on the database is the price you pay for having , as the Sweeney would say , " previous " .
Neither do I object to the police taking my DNA in the first place - but once a person is proven innocent what right and reason do the police have to retain the DNA profile ?
In December 2008 all this changed when the European court of human rights ruled that by retaining the DNA of the innocent , the UK government was in breach of Article 8 of the European convention , the right to family and private life .
A spirit of optimism filled campaigners as Jacqui Smith had three months to comply with the ruling .
However , the one thing we have learnt about Labour home secretaries and civil liberties is that they do n't much like liberty .
Or civility .
Three months passed and nothing changed .
So with my lawyer I sent a letter before claim to the Met commissioner , essentially threatening to issue judicial review proceedings unless my DNA was removed .
We based the claim on a number of points .
One was the European ruling , another was the fact that police commissioners have the discretion to remove DNA samples in " exceptional circumstances " .
Not only was there no evidence of the crime I was charged with but my DNA had been hanging around for over five years with no convictions attaching themselves to it .
These seemed " exceptional circumstances " .
On Tuesday the police replied with one line : " I can confirm that a decision has been made to delete your client 's fingerprints and DNA sample and DNA profile . "
No explanation why .
Victory celebrations , though , might be premature .
As the law remains unchanged it leaves the onus on individuals to write to the police seeking removal .
Helen Wallace , from the NGO GeneWatch , says she has received " copies of letters from lots of individuals who have not been convicted of any offence who are being refused removal from the database " .
As Jacqui Smith has dodged the issue it is up to us .
There are 799,999 of you out there , mostly pissed off , some eligible for legal aid , and everyone with the motivation to do their bit in rolling back the data state .
Go on , write in .
Maybe they would have let him on if he had n’t worn such thick - heeled shoes .
—
Ray was n’t lying on Tuesday when he said we ate pizza together .
We did , and in doing so we employed what literary theorists like to call “ foreshadowing . ”
Following in the tradition of great authors like Jane Austen and Leo Tolstoy –who would often have their characters eat pizza in order to “ foreshadow ” a much bigger pizza party later on in the novel–our single large cheese pizza was only a meager portent of things to come .
I am , of course , referring to Buttersafe Expo 2009 .

** UPDATE ** See http://funcall.posterous.com/ecl-on-iphone-redux for a more up - to - date description of how to get this to work .
**
Common Lisp is finally on the iPhone !
After waaaaay too much time in C and Makefile world , I have gotten ECL to cross -compile for the ARM processor and iPhone OS .
The whole process required some changes to the ECL code itself , the ECL make process , and changes to the garbage collector .
To get ECL cross-compiling was a challenge for someone without much experience building C libraries and dealing with platform dependencies .
I made a script that should make this process easy at least 1000 times less painful than my experience .
Just get ECL from the Floatopian repository and build it with a simple script :
git clone http://floatopian.com/~reddaly/ecl/ecl/.git/
cd ecl
sh make - iphone
The library files should be installed in install_iPhoneOS / lib / .
If they are not , then something probably went wrong during the installation process .
The build script is pretty dumb , so it will keep going even if individual steps encounter errors .
So if you get problems look for the error highest up in the output .
THIS VERSION OF ECL does not have any extra bells and whistles .
It is built without threads , bignum support , and ASDF .
If you add any of these features , let me or the ECL list know so we can all share the wealth .
Some notes on ASDF :
> However , I still do n’t have all the bells and whisltes working correctly .
> My current problem is getting ASDF to properly compile into ECL .
I cannot
> get ECL to build , even for the i386 Darwin non-cross - compiled version of
> ECL , when I have ASDF enabled and the –disable - shared flag set in the
> configuration script . [… ]
> Any idea what ’s going on here ?
The error message does n’t really tell me
> much about what ’s going wrong .
I am even more confused about why the
> –disable - shared flag makes any difference .
–disable - shared means you cannot compile code and load it .
That is
why ASDF is not building .
My question now is , does you iPhone have a C
compiler ?
If not then you will have to install a fake version of
COMPILE -FILE and COMPILE and try to teach ASDF to use it .
It might be
a nice addition to ECL for environments without a C compiler but , as I
said , it is fake : there will be no compilation going on .
Some notes on cross-compiling GMP : http://gmplib.org/list-archives/gmp-bugs/2008-April/000997.html
Finally , I would like to get SLIME working on the iPhone to bring the advantages of REPL development to the iPhone .
If you get that working , let me know .
SUMMARY OF CHANGES :
Ported Boehm garbage collector to iPhone .
I believe I ported everything necessary to get it to work in a threaded environment , but threading is currently broken so the GC part may not be functional .
Look at the changes to gcconfig.h
various fixes to ensure that the build and host ECLs use the same exact built - in symbol table .
( The build ECL is the one with the i386 architecture that you use to cross - compile the ARMV6 architecture host ECL ) ECL uses a tool called DPP to compile lispish C to something gcc can understand .
If the build and host ECLs are not compiled with the same settings , then the symbol tables do not line up and you get strange runtime bugs .
I changed a bunch of C #defines so to make sure the same symbol sets were used .
fixed some problems assumptions that precluded cross-compilation and non-GMP builds
The latest from the newsmakers was the brand change and the newest search interface by Microsoft was “ KUMO ” .
There are various changes done along with more screenshots provided to understand the concept even better .
Yes , the Microsoft has been announcing about its brand change since years leaving people with more anxiety as to what will they finally change to .
The new alteration done is nothing to be excited about as people were waiting for this very special news and that was of great curiosity was to what will they change ?
KUMO , that was something suggested by last November .
I doubt whether that would be the final change as Microsoft has already designated it to be the successor search brand .
The company has proclaimed that it has been using the URL , Kumo.com just for the basic testing purpose and not as a long term one .
With the sharply weaved online offers by the company , they have come up with the idea to straighten the online brands .
Kumo.com was specially sent to Microsoft employees to make a try and send back their feedbacks as to what is to be improved and what is good in it and so called the test program .
This is exclusively open for the corporate network and internal traffic of live.com will be redirected to collect enough feedbacks .
You might be thinking what is Kumo and the officials have the explanation to this as it is just a code name which was titled for the new test program they were into .
According to various studies and estimations conducted , it has been noted and proved that the customers are not happy with the search engines due to varied reasons and they do not end up finding what they need .
Therefore , Microsoft has got into the real task with Kumo.com to help customers search as well achieve the task taken by them .
How to use GHB
The demonisation of GHB in North America : A New Form of Inquisition
GHB in France and North - America
Description of the Psychotropic Effects of GHB ( 1985 )
2 ) GHB gives you a strong desire to touch others , physically and psychologically .
3 ) Communication becomes extremely gratifying as you feel you want to become close to people , not to isolate yourself .
4 ) GHB induces a strong sense of beauty .
Everything looks so beautiful , so vivid , so enjoyable , so pleasurable , so important , so " deep " .
5 ) The perception of movement is enhanced .
6 ) Three - dimensional perception is enhanced and vision seems more clear , better than usual .
7 ) The contrast of colours between objects is increased .
A yellow " pissenlit " ( dandelion ) , or a rose , etc , situated in front of , say , green grass , looks brighter , more real , closer to you .
8 ) If you are a man , a woman will look magnificent and very attractive .
She may become just like a goddess to your eyes .
Women will experience the same feelings towards men .
However , these kinds of feelings depend of your cultural background .
For instance , a simple Siamese woman will not feel such intense feelings but will report that she feels drunk !
GHB is a very important tool in investigating the emotional background of a person .
For instance loving people will become more loving while people devoid of these feelings will just feel in good mood , only .
Some people may cry , which demonstrates that they have a lot of repressed material in themselves , etc .
Crying under GHB is a very liberating experience because you can take out and release things which you normally keep deep inside and which thus hurt you .
Crying under GHB takes away accumulated inner moral pains .
9 ) Sensuality becomes very intense .
You want to touch , to kiss , to caress , to hold , to love , to hug , to make love .
In summary , you want to contact others through any means available because you are just highly sociable !
10 ) According to Henri Laborit , GHB renders the clitoris more sensitive .
Moreover , GHB increases love and sexual desires both in women and men .
11 ) You can sometimes feel a deep sense of " meaningfulness " .
Things become meaningful to you , even you are unable to scientifically define such a mystical feeling .
This meaningfulness of reality is a very interesting phenomenon from a scientific point of view as it seems to show that there exists a " circuit " of meaningfulness in our nervous system .
Non-specific activation of this circuit , under GHB , would give us a " deep " sense of " meaningfulness " which is , of course , imaginary .
12 ) GHB stimulates your recall abilities related to previous GHB experience .
Each time you take GHB you can often clearly remember memories stored under another GHB context .
Emotions are especially well - remembered and reexperienced .
From these and other observations , I think GHB should be a tool of choice in psychoanalysis .
13 ) Some people feel an urge to defecate after GHB , probably because of muscle relaxation !
One of the first reactions from a colleague of mine , after GHB , is to go to the toilet !!!
14 ) In fact , GHB induces a very pleasant sense of muscle relaxation , especially in the legs .
15 ) One of the most remarkable action of GHB is that it gives you a strong desire to live and to remain alive , despite unfavourable conditions .
When is GHB contraindicated ?
Untreated epilepsy , eclampsia , hypokalemia , severe hypertension , alcoholism , association with opiates , antibiotics .
For depressed patients , GHB should be taken only under medical supervision .
The Atlas Shrugged Index
From recession - culture trends we ’ve written about on this blog lately , a recession icon of sorts emerges , wrapped in a Snuggie , puffing on a pipe — and now with a copy of Ayn Rand ‘s Atlas Shrugged on his lap .
The Economist reports that the book ’s sales rank on Amazon is far above what it ’s been in previous years ( and briefly topped Obama‘s The Audacity of Hope ) .
Furthermore , says The Economist , data from TitleZ.com show recent sales spikes of the book coinciding with major political events , such as the passing of the stimulus plan .
The spikes , The Economist surmises , happen when people ( including a handful of bloggers , politicians , and economists ) notice the eerie similarities between real - life events — like the recent spate of sea pirate attacks — and the scenarios Rand described in her book .
As long as the halls of Congress do n’t start ringing with the question “ Who is John Galt ? ” let ’s hope it ’s just a case of life imitating art .
Sue Vago
SHORTLY after he was elected president , Barack Obama sounded a warning : “ We are facing an economic crisis of historic proportions … We now risk falling into a deflationary spiral that could increase our massive debt even further . ”
The address evoked not just the horror of the Depression , but one of the era 's most important thinkers : Irving Fisher .
Though once America 's most famous economist , Fisher is now almost forgotten by the public .
If he is remembered , it is usually for perhaps the worst stockmarket call in history .
In October 1929 he declared that stocks had reached a “ permanently high plateau ” .
Today it is John Maynard Keynes , his British contemporary , who is cited , debated and followed .
Yet Fisher laid the foundation for much of modern monetary economics ; Keynes called Fisher the “ great - grandparent ” of his own theories on how monetary forces influenced the real economy .
( They first met in London in 1912 and reportedly got along well . )
As parallels to the 1930s multiply , Fisher is relevant again .
As it was then , the United States is now awash in debt .
No matter that it is mostly “ inside ” or “ internal ” debt — owed by Americans to other Americans .
As the underlying collateral declines in value and incomes shrink , the real burden of debt rises .
Debts go bad , weakening banks , forcing asset sales and driving prices down further .
Fisher showed how such a spiral could turn mere busts into depressions .
In 1933 he wrote :
Over investment and over speculation are often important ; but they would have far less serious results were they not conducted with borrowed money .
The very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debts increases it , because of the mass effect of the stampede to liquidate … the more debtors pay , the more they owe .
The more the economic boat tips , the more it tends to tip .
Though they seldom invoke Fisher , policymakers in America are applying his ideas .
In academia Ben Bernanke , now the chairman of the Federal Reserve , sought to formalise Fisher 's debt - deflation theory .
His research has shaped his response to this crisis .
He decided to bail out Bear Stearns in March 2008 partly so that a sudden liquidation of the investment bank 's positions did not trigger a cycle of falling asset prices and default .
Indeed , some say the Fed has learnt Fisher too well : from 2001 to 2004 , to contain the deflationary shock waves of the tech - stock collapse , it kept interest rates low and thus helped to inflate a new bubble , in property .
Were Fisher alive today , “ he would tell us we have to avoid deflation , and to worry about all that inside debt , ” says Robert Dimand , an economist at Brock University in Canada , who has studied Fisher in depth .
“ The ideal thing is to avoid these situations .
Unfortunately , we are in one . ”
Fisher was born in 1867 and earned his PhD from Yale in 1891 .
In 1898 he nearly died of tuberculosis , an experience that turned him into a lifelong crusader for diet , fresh air , Prohibition and public health .
For a while he also promoted eugenics .
His causes , both healthy and repugnant , combined with a lack of humour and high self - regard , did not make him popular .
In 1894 , on a trip to Switzerland , he saw , in water cascading into mountain pools , a way to “ define precisely the relationships among wealth , capital , interest and income , ” Robert Loring Allen , a biographer of Fisher , wrote .
“ The flowing water , moving into the pool at a certain volume per unit of time , was income .
The pool , a given volume of water at a particular moment , became capital . ”
Over the next 30 years he established many of the central concepts of financial economics .
In 1911 , in “ The Purchasing Power of Money ” , Fisher formalised the quantity theory of money , which holds that the supply of money times its velocity — the rate at which a dollar circulates through the market — is equal to output multiplied by the price level .
Perhaps more important , he explained how changing velocity and prices could cause real interest rates to deviate from nominal ones .
In this way , monetary forces could produce booms and busts , although they had no long - run effect on output .
Furthermore , Fisher held that the dollar 's value should be maintained relative not to gold but to a basket of commodities , making him the spiritual father of all modern central banks that target price stability .
During the 1920s Fisher became rich from the invention and sale of a card - index system .
He used the money to buy stocks on margin , and by 1929 was worth $ 10 m .
He was also a prominent financial guru .
Alas , two weeks after he saw the “ plateau ” the stockmarket crashed .
To his cost , Fisher remained optimistic as the Depression wore on .
He lost his fortune and his home and lived out his life on the generosity of his sister - in - law and Yale .
But his work continued .
He was prominent among the 1,028 economists who in vain petitioned Herbert Hoover to veto the infamous Smoot - Hawley tariff of 1930 .
And he developed his debt - deflation theory .
In 1933 in Econometrica , published by the Econometric Society , which he co-founded , he described debt deflation as a sequence of distress - selling , falling asset prices , rising real interest rates , more distress - selling , falling velocity , declining net worth , rising bankruptcies , bank runs , curtailment of credit , dumping of assets by banks , growing distrust and hoarding .
Chart 1 is his : it shows how deflation increased the burden of debt .
Fisher was adamant that ending deflation required abandoning the gold standard , and repeatedly implored Franklin Roosevelt to do so .
( Keynes was of similar mind . )
Roosevelt devalued the dollar soon after becoming president in 1933 .
The devaluation and a bank holiday marked the bottom of the Depression , though true recovery was still far off .
But Fisher had at best a slight influence on Roosevelt 's decision .
His reputation had fallen so far that even fellow academics ignored him .
Contemporary critics did poke a hole in his debt - deflation hypothesis : rising real debt makes debtors worse off but creditors better off , so the net effect should be nil .
Mr Bernanke plugged this in the 1980s .
“ Collateral facilitates credit extension , ” he said in June 2007 , just before the crisis began in earnest .
“ However , in the 1930s , declining output and falling prices ( which increased real debt burdens ) led to widespread financial distress among borrowers , lessening their capacity to pledge collateral … Borrowers ' cash flows and liquidity were also impaired , which likewise increased the risks to lenders . ”
Mr Bernanke and Mark Gertler of New York University dubbed this “ the financial accelerator ” .
The downward spiral can start even when inflation remains positive — for example , when it drops unexpectedly .
Consider a borrower who expects inflation of 2 % and takes out a loan with a 5 % interest rate .
If instead inflation falls to 1 % , the real interest rate rises from 3 % to 4 % , increasing the burden of repayment .
Asset deflation can do much the same thing .
If house prices are expected to rise by 10 % a year , a buyer willingly borrows the whole purchase price , because his home will soon be worth more than the loan .
A lender is happy to make the loan for the same reason .
But if prices fall by 10 % instead , the house will soon be worth less than the loan .
Both homeowner and lender face a greater risk of bankruptcy .
Today , debt in America excluding that of financial institutions and the federal government is about 190 % of GDP , the highest since the 1930s , according to the Bank Credit Analyst , a financial - research journal ( see chart 2 ) .
There are important differences between then and now .
Debt was lower at the start of the Depression , at 164 % of GDP .
Mortgage debt was modest relative to home values , and prices were not notably bloated : they fell by 24 % between 1929 and 1933 , says Edward Pinto , a consultant , so were roughly flat in real terms .
Debt burdens shot up because of deflation and shrinking output ; nominal GDP fell by 46 % between 1929 and 1933 .
Debt burdens are high today mostly because so much was borrowed in the recent past .
This began as a logical response to declining real interest rates , low inflation , rising asset prices and less frequent recessions , all of which made leverage less dangerous .
But rising leverage eventually bred easy credit and overvalued homes .
Even without recession , falling home prices would have impaired enough mortgage debt to destabilise the financial system ( see chart 3 ) .
Recession makes those dynamics more virulent ; deflation could do similar damage .
Broad price indices fell in late 2008 .
Granted , that was caused in part by a one - off fall in petrol costs ; but America 's core inflation rate , which excludes food and energy , has fallen from 2.5 % in September to 1.8 % .
Goldman Sachs sees it falling to 0.25 % in the next two years .
That is low enough to mean falling wages for many households and falling prices for many firms .
More widespread and deeper deflation would mean that property prices would have to fall even further to restore equilibrium with household incomes , creating another round of delinquencies , defaults and foreclosures .
What is the solution ?
Fisher wrote that it was “ always economically possible to stop or prevent such a depression simply by reflating the price level up to the average level at which outstanding debts were contracted . ”
Alas , reflation is not so simple .
Although stabilising nominal home prices would help short - circuit the debt - deflation dynamics now under way , any effort to maintain them at unrealistically high levels ( where they still are in many cities ) is likely to fail .
Higher inflation could help bring down real home prices while allowing nominal home prices to stabilise , and reduce real debt burdens .
But creating inflation is easier said than done : it requires boosting aggregate demand enough to consume existing economic slack , through either monetary or fiscal policy .
Though the Fed does not expect deflation , last month it did say that “ inflation could persist for a time below ” optimal levels .
It is mulling a formal inflation target which , by encouraging people to expect positive inflation , would make deflation less likely .
But its practical tools for preventing deflation are limited .
In December its short - term interest - rate target in effect hit zero .
The Taylor rule , a popular rule of thumb , suggests it should be six percentage points below .
The Fed is now trying to push down long - term interest rates by buying mortgage - backed and perhaps Treasury securities .
With conventional monetary ammunition spent , fiscal policy has become more important .
In 2002 Mr Bernanke argued the government could ultimately always generate inflation by having the Fed finance large increases in government spending directly , by purchasing Treasury debt .
Martin Barnes of the Bank Credit Analyst thinks this highly unlikely : “ You 'd have capital flight out of the dollar .
The only way it works is if every country is doing it , or with capital controls . ”
Fisher died in 1947 , a year after Keynes , and remains in his shadow .
Mr Dimand notes that Fisher never pulled the many strands of his thought together into a grand synthesis as Keynes did in “ The General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money ” .
More important , Keynes 's advocacy of aggressive fiscal policy overcame the limitations of Fisher 's purely monetary remedies for the Depression .
Yet Fisher 's insights remain vital .
They have filtered , perhaps unconsciously , into the thinking of today 's policymakers .
On February 8th Lawrence Summers , Mr Obama 's principal economic adviser , called for the rapid passage of a fiscal stimulus “ to contain what is a very damaging and potentially deflationary spiral . ”
His advice bridges Fisher and Keynes .
Starving children eat rats , families turn on each other and farmers kill their own livestock to survive .
Smuggled film brings Mugabe nightmare to world 's attention
A Guardian film smuggled out of Zimbabwe brings home the economic devastation and deprivation Robert Mugabe has wreaked upon his own people .
With Morgan Tsvangirai , the opposition leader , preparing to take up the post of prime minister in a unity government , Sam Chakaipa , at considerable risk to himself and as an act of resistance , returned clandestinely to his village , 125 miles from Harare , to document the plight of his former neighbours .
The opposition activist has produced extraordinary footage of what Zimbabweans have to do in order to survive in a wrecked economy .
As money is worthless – Zimbabwe is plagued by the world 's highest inflation rate – the villagers are reduced to panning for gold in rivers .
Instead of attending school , youngsters from the village scrabble knee - deep in muddy water or dig ever deeper holes in a desperate search for a few grains of gold .
These small supplies of the precious metal have thus become a crucial commodity Zimbabweans can trade for food ; a loaf of bread is worth 0.1 grams .
But only the young have the strength to dig and pan for gold ; the village elders must go hungry , unless they have friends or relatives they can rely on .
Some parents have been forced to feed rats to their children , and hunger has turned family members against each other .
In a particularly wrenching scene in the video , a 15 - year - old girl with a swollen face describes tearfully how her grandmother beat her to drive her away as she was an extra mouth to feed .
She says she has not eaten for three days .
" I 'm hurting all over my body , " she says .
" There is nothing for me . "
Chakaipa says : " I have never seen my people in such a desperate situation . "
Nothing is growing in the fields , and the farmers are killing their livestock , effectively destroying their livelihood .
Chakaipa , a member of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , has suffered personally at the hands of Zanu - PF , Robert Mugabe 's ruling party .
He has been arrested and tortured , and his life was threatened when he wanted to stand as a councillor .
His house has been burned down twice .
As it is unsafe for him to stay in the village , Chakaipa has had to go into hiding in Harare .
His brother , also an MDC supporter , was not so lucky and was killed last year by Zanu - PF thugs .
At one point in the film , in a mixture of reportage and personal testimony , Chakaipa stands in the ruins of his home telling us how the Mugabe government has destroyed his life .
It is too dangerous for the opposition , beaten into submission , to hold meetings or rallies , so Chakaipa chose to make this film as a personal act of defiance .
He wants the world to see what Mugabe , who has been in power since 1980 , has done to Zimbabwe : how he has reduced a once relatively prosperous country to ruin .
Chakaipa does not hold out much hope for the unity government , in which the MDC leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , will be prime minister .
Zimbabwe 's neighbours – particularly South Africa – put enormous pressure on Tsvangirai to accept this poisoned chalice , but many MDC supporters , including Chakaipa , say this was not what Zimbabweans voted for .
He fears that if Tsvangirai works with Mugabe , " the suffering will continue " .
Sam Chakaipa is an assumed name
A hallucinogenic compound found in a plant indigenous to South America and used in shamanic rituals regulates a mysterious protein that is abundant throughout the body , University of Wisconsin–Madison researchers have discovered .
The finding , reported in the Feb. 13 issue of Science , may ultimately have implications for treating drug abuse and / or depression .
Many more experiments will be needed , the researchers say .
Scientists have been searching for years for naturally occurring compounds that trigger activity in the protein , the sigma - 1 receptor .
In addition , a unique receptor for the hallucinogen , called dimethyltryptamine ( DMT ) , has never been identified .
The UW–Madison researchers made the unusual pairing by doing their initial work the “ old - fashioned , ” yet still effective , way .
They diagrammed the chemical structure of several drugs that bind to the sigma - 1 receptor , reduced them to their simplest forms and then searched for possible natural molecules with the same features .
Biochemical , physiological and behavioral experiments proved that DMT does , in fact , activate the sigma - 1 receptor .
“ We have no idea at present if or how the sigma - 1 receptor may be connected to hallucinogenic activity , ” says senior author Arnold Ruoho , chair of pharmacology at the UW–Madison School of Medicine and Public Health .
“ But we believe that the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) may be interested in biological mechanisms underlying psychoactive and addictive drug action . ”
In addition to being a component of psychoactive snuffs and sacramental teas used in native religious practices in Latin America , DMT is known to be present in some mammalian tissues , and it has also been identified in mammalian blood and spinal fluid .
Elevated levels of DMT and a related molecule have been found in the urine of schizophrenics .
Ruoho speculates that the hallucinogen ’s involvement may mean that the sigma - 1 receptor is connected in some fashion to psychoactive behavior .
When his team injected DMT into mice known to have the receptor , the animals became hyperactive ; mice in which the receptor had been genetically removed did not .
“ Hyperactive behavior is often associated with drug use or psychiatric problems , ” says Ruoho .
“ It ’s possible that new , highly selective drugs could be developed to inhibit the receptor and prevent this behavior . ”
The study revealed an additional neurologic link by confirming that the sigma - 1 receptor and some compounds that bind to it inhibit ion channels , which are important for nerve activity .
Work by many researchers — including some from UW–Madison — initially showed this relationship in earlier studies .
Some studies have also linked the receptor to the action of antidepressant drugs , and National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) scientists recently found that it appears to serve as a “ chaperon , ” helping proteins to fold properly .
The Wisconsin researchers found that DMT is derived from the naturally occurring amino acid tryptophan and is structurally related to the neurotransmitter serotonin .
This finding , Ruoho says , illustrates the mantra often used in the biological processing of natural molecules : Nothing goes to waste .
“ Our findings support the idea that biochemical alterations of molecules such as tryptophan can produce simple compounds such as DMT that may target other regulatory pathways served by sigma - 1 receptors , ” he says .
DMT may also reflect the presence of an even larger family of natural compounds that arise from other structurally related amino acids that may further regulate the receptor , Ruoho adds .
“ It may well be that these different , naturally derived chemical forms regulate the sigma - 1 receptor in tissue and organ - specific ways , ” he says .
If Brazilian Archbishop Jose Cardoso Sobrinho had had his way , an innocent nine - year - old girl would be living out a death sentence now .
Carrying twins after being raped by her stepfather , the girl underwent an abortion after complaining of stomach pains four months into the pregnancy .
Sobrinho 's humane and Christian response ?
He excommunicated the girl 's family , excommunicated the doctors who performed the abortion , and on being told that the medics had acted within the law , announced : " The law of God is above any human law . "
He then went on to say : " Abortion is much more serious than killing an adult .
An adult may or may not be an innocent , but an unborn child is most definitely innocent .
Taking that life cannot be ignored . "
I wonder how the death of a nine - year - old would have sat on his conscience .
Unfortunately Sobrinho is n't alone in his antediluvian thinking .
Since Daniel Ortega did a deal with the Catholic church and outlawed abortion in return for votes two years ago , countless Nicaraguan women have died .
What both these men fail to realise is , that whether abortion is outlawed or not , whether their Gods consider it a crime or not , women will always try and find a way to terminate dangerous pregnancies .
And if they do n't , if women listen to their preachers and look to faith to see them through , the chances are , as would probably have been the case for the nine year old girl , both mother and baby will fail to survive the birth .
And the story 's the same across the globe .
Wherever religion and its patriarchs rule , women 's lives are in danger : wherever abortion is outlawed because the religious police deem it a crime against the innocent , thousands upon thousands of women suffer the fatal consequences of religious men's misogynistic edicts .
It 's estimated that 68,000 ( pdf ) women die every year as a result of unsafe abortions , 97 % of those in developing countries ; millions more women suffer complications , which in many cases have long - term consequences and often result in permanent disabilities .
Yet despite the death toll and the maiming , the Catholic church , along with the religious right , continues to advocate abstinence programmes as the only form of family planning it 's prepared to endorse .
Pope Benedict XVI even went so far as to praise the Nicaraguan government for its hardline anti-abortion stance , saying he wanted to express his appreciation to Nicaragua for its position on social issues , " especially respect for life , in the face of considerable internal and international pressure . "
For those of us outside of any church , this statement along with numerous others from the men of the cloth says one thing and one thing only : to the men of religion , women 's lives simply do not matter : " respect for life " never ever means " respect for a woman 's life . "
As far back as 1970 Robin Morgan wrote in her introduction to Sisterhood is Powerful :
Although every organised patriarchal religion works overtime to contribute its own brand of misogyny to the myth of woman - hate , woman - fear , and woman - evil , the Roman Catholic church also carries the immense power of very directly affecting women 's lives everywhere by its stand against birth control and abortion , and by its use of skilful and wealthy lobbies to prevent legislative change .
It is an obscenity - an all - male hierarchy , celibate or not , that presumes to rule on the lives and bodies of millions of women .
Nearly 40 years on , and it 's amazing how little has changed .
I 'm getting past the point now of believing that it 's simply men's interpretation of their holy books that 's the issue , and not the foundational texts of their faiths that are also at fault .
To paraphrase the US - based Freedom from Religion Foundation : the Bible itself is a handbook for the subjugation of women .
But then the Bible , like religion , was created by men for men , and has been used ever since its inception as a tool to keep women in their place .
In response to a piece I wrote recently about anti-feminist religious movements such as the True Woman movement in the States , Jeff Robinson of The Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood said :
Little does she know that she fights not merely against patriarchy , but against an invincible champion whose certain victory purchased for her a season of amnesty called ' today ' in which she and her views might be made new .
Little does Robinson know that the patriarchy and his mythical invincible champion are one and the very same thing .
Medics can help you recover from a broken heart Scientists have found it is possible to mend a broken heart .
US researchers studied 70 patients with " broken heart syndrome " , a recognised condition linked to stressful or emotional events .
All these patients recovered , most after being given aspirin or heart drugs , even though 20 % were deemed critically ill .
The American Journal of Cardiology study says the condition is probably caused by a surge in stress hormones .
Broken heart syndrome , known medically as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy , was first described by Japanese researchers in the early 1990s .
Even though symptoms mimic those of a heart attack such as chest pain and shortness of breath , broken heart syndrome does appear to be temporary and completely reversible - if treated quickly .
The patients studied by the researchers from two hospitals in Providence , Rhode Island were diagnosed with broken heart syndrome between July 2004 and April 2008 .
Spring breaks Around 67 % of patients had been exposed to some sort of physical or emotional distress - such as bad news about a family member , a domestic argument , severe physical illness or a car accident - just before the onset of symptoms .
There does seem to be an association between this condition and a very stressful event
June Davison , British Heart Foundation
Six patients presented with heart - induced shock and three had abnormal heart rhythms which required emergency treatment .
Two - thirds of the patients - almost all post - menopausal women - had experienced a very stressful physical or emotional event just before arriving at the hospital with heart attack - like symptoms .
Overall , the majority of those in the registry were prescribed aspirin or heart drugs such as , beta blockers , ACE inhibitors and statins while in hospital .
Even though a fifth were were critically ill and required emergency treatment to keep them alive , all the patients survived the first 48 hours and experienced a full recovery .
The researchers also discovered that , unlike heart attacks which tend to occur in winter , broken heart syndrome cases tend to occur in the spring and summer months .
' Rarely fatal ' Dr Richard Regnante from the Miriam Hospital , who led the research , said this seasonal pattern could help understand the condition .
" Some believe it is simply a form of a heart attack that ' aborts ' itself early and therefore does n't leave any permanent heart muscle damage .
HAVE YOUR SAY
A broken heart just needs time to digest the pain and get back on track with the help of friends , relatives and some shopping Maeth P , UK " Others say that the syndrome has nothing to do with the coronary arteries and is simply a problem with the heart muscle .
" Since the seasonal pattern of broken heart syndrome that we observed is opposite of what it seen with heart attack patients , our findings suggest - but certainly do not prove - the latter theory may be correct . "
He added that the study could help heart specialists and A&E doctors manage patients with the condition .
" Although there is much we 're still learning about broken heart syndrome , we do know that it is rarely fatal as long as patients are fully supported with medications , respirators and other critical devices in the first 48 hours . "
Dr Regnante and his team are now recruiting patients with broken heart syndrome for a new study which will use ultrasound images to look at whether the condition causes internal damage to the heart .
June Davison , a spokeswoman for the British Heart Foundation , said : " There does seem to be an association between this condition and a very stressful event .
" But not enough people have been affected to provide hard evidence of what happens and what actually causes it .
" However people do seem to make a full recovery . "

Are you feeling lonely , disconnected or alienated ?
It could be making you sick , and , ironically , you ’re not alone .
In 1985 , when researchers asked a cross-section of Americans how many confidants they had , the most common response was three .
When they asked again in 2004 , the most common answer -- from 25 % of respondents -- was zero , nil , nada .
In 1950 , only 9.3 % of American households consisted of people living alone .
By 2000 , that percentage had jumped to a whopping 26 % .
Living alone does n’t necessarily make you lonely .
But it certainly does n’t help .
Individuals have varying levels of need for connection with others .
But when your needs and your situation do n’t match up , you may feel a little pang in your gut to go along with that unpleasant impression that you ’re floating alone on a raft in the middle of the ocean .
A pain .
Literally .
Advertisement
And that ’s a good thing , says University of Chicago neuroscientist John Cacioppo , who recently co-wrote a book called “ Loneliness . ”
In the same way that physical pain helps protect you from physical danger , says Cacioppo , social pain evolved to help keep individuals from the dangers of social isolation .
Just as the discomfort of scalded skin tells your brain to pull your hand away from boiling water , loneliness developed as a stimulus to get humans to pay more attention to the people around them and to reach out and touch someone .
There ’s been a lot of talk in recent years about Americans losing their sense of social connectedness .
But when we speak of the loss of civic engagement , we generally talk of its costs to our democracy and civil society .
What Cacioppo is arguing is that social isolation , and the feelings of loneliness it can cause , do n’t only hurt society at large , they carry physical dangers for individuals .
As the ranks of the chronically lonely grow , it threatens to become a public health problem .
Physical aloneness is already a known problem .
It can be as bad for your health as smoking or obesity .
Isolation can lead to risky behavior , and the absence of friends , colleagues , neighbors , family or caregivers can have serious consequences , particularly for the aging .
But in addition to the dangerous consequences of being alone , the bad feelings engendered by loneliness also can have detrimental effects on the body , and therefore hasten the aging process .
Here ’s how it works :
The empty feeling of loneliness is an alarm signal embedded in our genes that tells us when to reach out to others .
It gives us a heightened sense of wariness and threat , and elicits a chain of physiological reactions that we know as the fight - or - flight response .
Fight - or - flight creates increased resistance in our cardiovascular system and floods our bodies with hormones that pump us up .
Long ago , these hormones helped our ancestors run from danger or fight it off .
Today , however , in the absence of imminent attack by a saber - toothed tiger , these chemicals can be a corrosive force to the body .

In contemporary society , the fight - or - flight response may not be over quickly , the way an ancient physical threat would have been .
We can suffer the same debilitating feelings of loneliness ( or other kinds of high and constant stress ) week after week , year after year , wearing down the body ’s metabolism and muscular efficiency .
All of this means we need to take the problem of lagging civic engagement and growing social isolation out of the realm of the social sciences and put it in the physical sciences .
We have to stop looking at declining civic participation as a primarily political problem that is solvable through increased activism .
Although activism may increase participation , which in turn translates into less social isolation , it does not get to the deeper problem of the quality of connections we form with the people who surround us on a day - to - day basis .
As Cacioppo puts it , “ If civic engagement is to contribute substantially to assuaging the problem of loneliness , then it cannot be something merely akin to networking at a trade show . ”
Nature gave us a warning system that reminds us of the dangers of being isolated from our fellow man .
Millions of alarm bells are ringing .

Visiting adult pornography sites is something I do a lot of lately .
Sometimes I spent a few hours a day checking out hardcore porn videos of naughty babysitters and other content .
At first , I only viewed sex pictures , videos or GIF images of porn , once in a while .
But , everything changed once my parents hired a nanny .
The caregiver whom my parents hired is hot and sexy .
She makes anyone who looks at her drool and want to have sex with her .
The woman seems to drip eroticism out of her pores .
It is one of the many reasons I want to bang my babysitter .
My nanny ’s name is Maya and she is about 36 years old .
She is Latin and Black mix race .
Her hair is long , black and her eyes are brown with hazel .
Maya is light skin , but dark enough that you notice she is mixed .
She has an ass that would make booty lovers go crazy .
If that was n’t enticing enough , Maya also has a great pair of big tits .
Her body is perfect since she works out regularly and keeps in shape .
At first , I never really bothered to pay too much attention to her .
Yet that all changed once I saw how my friends reacted to her .
A few of them would all often come over after school with me .
The minute they saw her , they began whispering ‘ MILF ’ and ‘ babe ’ when referring to her .
When we went to our room , they would all begin telling me “ Dude , your babysitter is hot as fuck ” and other things .
Then , they began searching for hardcore porn videos of hot and sexy MILFs on my computer .
We would all watch the mature women hardcore porn films together .
My friends took turn looking for sexy and beautiful porn videos of milf ebony girls .
I was kind of surprise to see how many different porn movies with gorgeous and erotic mature women there were .
While not all of them looked exactly like Maya , they had similar attributes .
There were some hardcore porn videos of MILFs with big asses .
Others had MILFs with big tits and great bodies .
Once my friends left , I began checking out these porn sites on my own .
Pretty soon I was jerking off at least 3 times a day watching hardcore porn movies featuring milf women .
One day , my parents were going on a business trip together and left Maya watching me and my brother for the weekend .
She was going to sleep over and stay in our guess room .
That night , when Maya was about to take a shower , I made sure I waited to see her .
She came out of the shower with her long black hair wet .
Maya also had a thin tee shirt which allowed me to see her big tits pressed against it .
Her nipples were very hard and were also very visible .
I almost exploded right in front of her as she walked passed me .
Later that night , Maya stayed in the living room watching a movie .
She asked me join her and I was more than happy to .
The moment I sat next to her on the couch , her perfume began to drive me crazy .
All the while I sat there , I would glance at Maya and her big tits .
She caught me looking a few times and simply smiled .
That night , I went upstairs and searched for any ebony or light skin babysitter porn videos .
I also checked to see if I found any on naughty babysitter hardcore movies .
To my surprise , there were thousands of porno movies showing nannies fucking and being fucked .
It appeared as if there were many out there who wanted to fuck their nannies as well .
I found several hardcore porn movies showing babysitter seduces boy .
Those types of porn videos gave me a bit of hope that perhaps one day I could fuck my nanny .
I found a few other hardcore porno movies where a hot milf seduces a teen and teen boy fucks milf .
The more I saw these kinds of videos , the more I wanted to fuck Maya .
There are so many reasons I want to have sex with my nanny , besides the obvious .
Sure , she is beautiful , has a great pair of tits and an amazing ass .
But , I also think I am in love with her .
All I do is think of her while I am at school , work or anywhere else .
My dick is sore from all the times I masturbate thinking of her while I watch babysitter porn videos .
I have tried to watch other types of pornography to see if I could forget about Maya .
There were some lesbian kissing and fucking porn videos .
They had some very hot girls doing lesbian scissoring and lesbian clit grinding .
I even found some lesbian milf threesome hardcore porn videos .
Although I was turned on by the seductive and luscious lesbian girls in porn videos , it was n’t enough .
I wanted nothing but to try my best to fuck Maya , my hot babysitter .
I am hoping that in a few weeks , when my parents leave again for the weekend , I can make my move .
My only hope is that Maya will let me fuck her or at least allow me to suck on those perfect big tits she has .
For now , the only thing I can do is keep looking at hardcore porn videos of milf babysitters .
If I ca n’t fuck Maya for real , at least I can jerk - off to hot porn videos of milf women who look like her .
The nation 's adult mental health system is a mess , according to a report released by the National Alliance on Mental Illness .
( NAMI ) which released its scorecard .
Each of the 50 states were examined on 82 targets such as evidence - based practices or the promotion of consumer - run programs .
These were among the benchmarks established by the 2003 New Freedom Commission .
No state received the highest grade of " A " for its overall work and the advocacy organization also assessed the strengths and " urgent needs " for each state .
For Georgia , the scandal - wrapped state which received a " D , " NAMI recommends strong political leadership ; for New York , it suggests a crisis intervention program ; and for Mass . , it is attention to suicide in the jails .
The expansion of a telemedicine program in Missouri was among the noted innovations .
The report did not address children 's issues .

feel about wine :
It 's not something we generally obsess about .
Cocktails , sure .
Likewise Scotch , cognac , bourbon , and rye .
But those are all luxuries , rewards , the carrot dangling at the end of the stick .
Half the pleasure to be found in such things is in the contemplation .
But wine is a condiment — like salt is a condiment :
It 's essential , but it 's not something to fetishize .
Condiment - grade wines — good and tasty ones , that is — do n't need to age for years in dusty cellars .
This means that theoretically they can dispense with the traditional and costly glass - bottle - and - cork packaging .
While we enjoy the ritual of the corkscrew well enough , offer us something better and we 'll get over its loss pretty quickly .
Like wine in a box .
There 's the European box , which is essentially a one - liter milk carton — no better at keeping air out once opened than a bottle is .
Fortunately , there 's the Australian - style box , a light cardboard structure stuffed with a big , hermetically sealed plastic bag full of wine and fitted with a plastic tap .
Because atmospheric pressure pushes the wine out without allowing air back in , the contents will keep unoxidized for up to a month .
And the standard three - liter size equals four bottles of wine :
That 's two glasses every night for three weeks .
All well and good , but historically — by which we mean since the mid-1960s , when an Australian winery introduced it — this arrangement 's minimal , even negative , snob value has ensured that most of the wine thus packaged has been no better than alkie - grade : heavy , sweet , and nasty .
Recently , though , things have started to get interesting .
There are box wines that have actual character , from French country wines to California and Aussie varietals usually seen only in cork - stopped bottles .
Some of them are even good .
Take , for instance , the VRAC 2007 Côtes du Rhône ( $ 30 ) , a red real enough to be odd , even funky , a thing heretofore confined to glass .
And the 2005 Cuvée de Peña ( $ 30 ) , an unfiltered red from the French Pyrenees that smells faintly and pleasantly of dried apricots .
Then there 's the " From the Tank " Côtes du Rhône ( $ 35 ) , a dark and earthy red with hints of raspberry jam that comes in an utterly plain brown cardboard container .
Put it into a decanter and no one will know the difference .
And when the decanter 's empty , you can refill it another three or four times .
Large liquor stores should carry at least one of these brands or something much like them .
Look for Côtes du Rhône or words like French or country .
Boxed merlot , cabernet , chardonnay , or Shiraz will likely be dull .
Boxed zinfandel — white or red — will likely be awful .
And avoid anything less than $ 20 a box .

Published in : currency - rupee
Most countries in the world have distinct identification symbols for their currency - $ represents the US Dollar and £ is used for GBP but there ’s no official currency sign for the Indian Rupee .
Design the India Rupee Symbol - Public contest
While symbols like Rs and à¤°à¥‚ are commonly used to represent the Indian Rupee , these are no official currency signs and therefore the Government of India has now announced a public contest to pick up a sign that will represent the currency of India .
You may send the symbol on an A - 4 size paper in black and white print and that the size of the final currency symbol design should not be smaller than 36 sq inches .
The symbol has to be either in the Indian National Language Script or a visual representation but should be applicable to the standard computer keyboard .
The Government also wants to ensure that your Indian Rupee design represents the historical and cultural ethos of India .
Update : See the new Rupee Symbol
Members from Reserve Bank of India and art institutes like National Institute of Design , Lalit Kala , Sir JJ Institute of Applied Art , and othre would comprise the jury that will select the winning currency design .
If you are a creative artist or designer , this is your ultimate chance to create history - if your currency design is chosen , you ’ll be forever remembered in history books of the world ( and Wikipedia ) as the “ official designer of Indian currency symbol ” .

41 . Home Depot CEO Nardelli
What kind of screw do you use to screw your shareholders ?
Dodging investors angry over the pay received by Home Depot chairman and CEO Robert Nardelli , who took home at least $ 120 million over five years as the company 's stock price dropped 12 percent , Home Depot 's board fails to show up at its annual shareholders meeting .
The session is presided over solely by Nardelli , who sidesteps all questions ( " This is not the forum in which we would address your comment " ) and cuts the meeting short after half an hour .
The event 's negative fallout , highlighted by demonstrators wearing chicken costumes and orange Home Depot aprons , leads Nardelli to announce days later that , for next year 's meeting , " we will return to our traditional format ... with the board of directors in attendance .
" Nardelli resigns in early January , walking away with another $ 210 million in severance .

It ’s the ISS at its full and final length , with all four sets of solar arrays unfurled , against the limb of Earth .
The STS - 119 mission successfully did its job of bringing up and installing the final set of solar array wings , giving the ISS the “ finished ” look we ’ve all been waiting for .
There are a few more modules to bring up , but none so big as the solar arrays .
And now the space station is the second brightest object in the night sky , second only to the Moon .

Space shuttle Discovery returned home on Saturday , March 28 landing at 3:14 pm EDT .
The weather and winds cooperated , allowing the spacecraft to land on the second opportunity of the day .
Enjoy more images from the highly successful mission below .

Ricky Arnold , STS - 119 mission specialist , works outside the space staton during the mission ’s third extravehicular activity ( EVA ) , doing a few construction and maintenance tasks during the six - hour , 27 - minute spacewalk .
This is a great image that makes you appreciate how big the space station is .
Ricky Arnold ( right ) and Joseph Acaba worked during the third EVA of the mission to help robotic arm operators relocate the Crew Equipment Translation Aid ( CETA ) cart from the Port 1 to Starboard 1 truss segment , lubricated the space station ’s robotic arm and performed a few other “ get ahead ” tasks .
I think almost everyone dreams of doing this : flying .
But this was no dream for astronaut John Phillps — he really was flying through the ISS .
It sure looks like fun !

Holden 's US parent company General Motors says it will cut 47,000 jobs - 26,000 of them outside the United States - as part of a massive restructuring plan this year .
GM says it may need another $ US30 billion ( $ 47 billion ) in government aid - more than doubling its original aid - and will run out of cash as soon as March without new federal funding .
The request for additional aid from the top US carmaker was made in a restructuring plan submitted to the US Treasury this morning .
America 's number three carmaker Chrysler requested an additional $ US5 billion in government aid , saying it expected the brutal downturn in the US market to run another three years .
GM also said it had not reached deals with bondholders and its major union to reduce some $ US47 billion in debt but would work to reach those agreements by the end of March .
The carmaker said it would close five plants in the US and cut its American workforce by another 20,000 jobs by 2012 , with most of those reductions coming earlier .
GM has been kept afloat since the start of the year with $ US13.4 billion in loans from the US Treasury .
Its expanded aid request for up to $ US30 billion includes a $ US7.5 billion credit line in the event that the car market remains depressed .
GM chief executive Rick Wagoner says his company is making the necessary adjustments to stave off bankruptcy .
" Bankruptcy would be a highly risky and very costly process , potentially very time consuming , that should only be undertaken as a last resort , " he said .
" Our primary efforts continue to be on transforming our business and executing GM 's viability plan outside of bankruptcy court . "
Critics of the bailout of GM and its smaller rival Chrysler have urged the US Government to consider financing a court - supervised restructuring for the two ailing companies in bankruptcy .
In its restructuring blueprint submitted to the US Treasury , Chrysler said it planned to cut its outstanding debt by $ US5 billion and reduce fixed costs by $ US700 million in 2009 .
Chrysler also outlined plans to shed 100,000 units of capacity and cut 3,000 jobs .
Chrysler , held and run by Cerberus Capital Management , has taken $ US4 billion in US Government loans .
The carmaker has seen its US sales fall 55 per cent in January after declining 30 percent in all of 2008 .

Far too many things can go horribly wrong when one decides to make his or her own computer .
Most of these problems are minor and involve losing screws or having a broken floppy drive , but some are considerably nastier .
Now , I 'm not saying this happens to everyone : only the incompetent and the unlucky , both of which I am .
Despite this , however , I 've only had a few of these happen to me ; the rest are from others ' experiences .
Remember , with the exception of all but the fourth one on this list , this is what CAN happen , not what will .
The motherboard will rub against the case , make constant contact with the power supply , fall onto a rug , or just make too much contact with your hand .
The power supply will fall off and land on your video card . (*)
If the video card has a particularly heavy heatsink on it and the above happens , the power supply will probably knock it off and fall onto whatever 's below , like your modem , NIC , and / or sound card .
Applicable to sockets that rely on clip heatsinks only ( Socket 370/ A , Super Socket 7 , etc. ) :
The CPU heatsink will take five hours to get on , because its clip mechanism was designed by Satan .
( This is true for all clip - based CPU heatsinks . )
Getting it on will require the use of an absurdly small screwdriver , a considerable amount of brute force , and luck .
The screwdriver will slip and smash into your motherboard at least twice .
No actual damage of any kind will occur , except maybe to your blood pressure .
If the any of the video card 's heatsinks are secured with frag tape , they will promptly fall off and land on the modem / NIC / sound card below .
You will lose at least half of the screws needed to fully assemble the computer .
You put a Celeron in it .
If you have your screws sorted out in a little tray , you will be unable to locate two of them .
One of them will be under the computer , and the other will be on your person .
The latter will only be found when you get up and do a tap - dance .
When you turn the computer on , you will suddenly discover that at least one cable is a little too near a case fan .
The most likely outcome ( a loud scraping noise that will alert you to the problem immediately ) is also the least harmful , which is why it will not happen to you .
Instead , the fan will quietly get stuck on the cable and kill its motor .
Alternatively , one of the fan 's blades may snap off , which is louder and funnier but just as unfortunate .
If you have a heavy ( 450g + ) CPU heatsink on a Socket A or Socket 370 motherboard , it will eagerly demonstrate certain basic laws of physics when the computer is moved around and land on the video card , taking the motherboard 's plastic socket clip with it .
Every single cable in the entire computer will thwart your attempts to insert the RAM .
When you finally fight back the cables , you will spend approximately fourteen minutes lining up the RAM perfectly with the slot .
When you push to get it to go in , it will fall out , and the cables will gleefully return to their former nesting place .
The CD - ROM drive at the top slot will make increasingly worrying noises when turned on .
The more you worry about it , the less likely the possibility that it is a serious problem becomes .
The computer will fail to POST when turned on , and will make several loud beeps .
If you find a guide to beep codes for your particular BIOS , that particular beep code will turn out not to exist .
That does not , of course , stop your BIOS from making it .
You will find that you have bought a 24 - pin ATX power supply and a 20 - pin ATX motherboard .
There are adapters for this , but they are hideous , likely to break , and very clumsy .
You will find that you have bought a 20 - pin ATX power supply and a 24 - pin ATX motherboard .
There are adapters for this , but in addition to being hideous , likely to break , and very clumsy , they do not work .
Applicable to PATA :
You will find two PATA cable sockets , which will be different colors .
Your PATA cables ' plugs will be different colors at both ends , and often the color of one plug will match with the first ATA cable socket and the color of the other plug will match with the second ATA cable socket .**
Applicable to PATA : Your motherboard will deny the existence of an ATA cable in the second plug while booting the devices attached to that cable without trouble .
This is unrelated to the colors of the cable plugs , but changing the plugs around will cause the error message to change slightly while simultaneously convincing your BIOS that you have four ATAPI CD - ROM devices .
The rear case fan will come loose , and the vibration it creates will cause it to fall -- that 's right -- onto the video card , probably making a mess out of some cables on the way .
If you 've made the mistake of working on the computer next to the desk it will be on or under , the keyboard and mouse will fall on your head when you 're trying to get one of the parts into a slot or socket .
If you have a Micro ATX case , you are probably doomed to spend about thirty minutes just screwing in a single goddamned CD drive .
You will mix up the PWRON / STRLED / etc. plugs , due to that the writing on the motherboard as to which part of the big copper plug goes to which plug is all absurdly small and misaligned with where the plug should actually go .
Once everything is operational and the computer POSTs , you will realize that the CD containing the operating system is scratched .
Badly .
Once the operating system and all needed software is installed and fully configured , the hard drive will make loud grinding noises and cease operation , necessitating its exchange for a new hard drive that will do exactly the same thing .
* This happened once when I had finished screwing the PSU in in a cheap midi - tower .
I had made the stupid mistake of using slightly smaller but otherwise identical screws to screw it in , and when I shoved the tower back , wham .
Amazingly , the video card ( a Chaintech GeForce3 Ti200 ) was unharmed .
** In theory , the color - coding for PATA cables is supposed to be simple : blue is the plug that you stick into the motherboard , black is the plug on the other end , gray is the middle plug .
In practice , less than half of the PATA cables I 've seen have been properly color - coded , and some of those that have refuse to work the " right way " .
What 's PATA one letter away from ?
Whoever started the " Someone call the waaaambulance " softlink , you are my hero .
Drug Enforcement agents yesterday raided a medical marijuana dispensary in San Francisco , a week after US Attorney General Eric Holder said federal authorities would no longer prosecute providers that are not otherwise in violation of state laws .
Yesterday , agents raided Emmalyn's California Cannabis Clinic , hauling out plants and growing equipment .
The dispensary , which gives out free marijuana to the poor once a week , had a temporary city permit allowing it to operate .
The DEA special agent in charge told the San Francisco Chronicle that Emmalyn's was skirting state laws as well .
According to Holder 's remarks last week , that would make it a candidate for federal legal action .
Also :
A source in San Francisco city government who was informed about the raid said the DEA 's action appeared to be prompted by alleged financial improprieties related to the payment of sales taxes .
DEA Special Agent Casey McEnry , spokeswoman for the local office , would not comment on that information .
As the kevlar - vested agents removed the buds from the place , bystanders taunted them with cries of " Who is Eric Holder ?
He 's your boss ! "
Advocates of marijuana decriminalisation and of legal medical marijuana are sceptical .
Marijuana Policy Project California policy director Aaron Smith said in a statement :
It is disturbing that , despite the DEA 's vague claims about violations of state and federal laws , they apparently made no effort to contact the local authorities who monitor and license medical marijuana providers .
For an agency that for eight years said it could n't care less about state law to suddenly justify raids as an effort to uphold state law simply does n't pass the smell test .
Aaron Houston , the group 's director of government relations , said :
Washington , D.C. - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) today urged the United States Sentencing Commission to reject modifications to federal sentencing guidelines that would require extra prison time for people who use technology that hides one 's identity or location .
Under current rules , a criminal defendant can get additional time added to a prison sentence if he used " sophisticated means " to commit the offense .
In its testimony before the commission , EFF will argue that sentencing courts should not assume that using proxies -- technologies that can anonymize users or mask their location -- is a mark of sophistication .
In fact , proxies are widely employed by corporate IT departments and public libraries and , like many computer applications , can be used with little or no knowledge on the part of the user .
" It would be a serious mistake for the United States Sentencing Commission to establish a presumption that using a common technology is worthy of additional punishment , " said Jennifer Granick , EFF Civil Liberties Director .
" Whether or not a convicted person 's use of a proxy is worthy of increased penalties is a case - by - case determination most appropriately made by a court . "
" While proxies may be an advanced technology , using a proxy is often no more difficult than using Microsoft Word , " said Seth Schoen , EFF Staff Technologist .
" Many kinds of people use proxies for all sorts of legitimate purposes , so only a court can reliably assess which uses are truly employed as a ' sophisticated means ' of committing a crime and which are for privacy , free speech or some other innocent purpose . "
Schoen will testify about EFF 's comments at the Sentencing Commission 's public hearing on March 17th in Washington , D.C .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- IBM employees being laid off in North America now have an alternative to joining the growing ranks of the unemployed - work for the company abroad .
Big Blue is offering its outgoing workers in the United States and Canada a chance to take an IBM job in India , Nigeria , Russia or other countries .
Through a program dubbed Project Match , IBM will help interested workers whose jobs are on the chopping block to " identify potential opportunities in growth markets and facilitate consideration by hiring managers in those markets , " according to an internal company document obtained by CNN .
The company also will help with moving costs and provide visa assistance , it says .
Other countries with IBM opportunities include Argentina , Brazil , China , Czech Republic , Hungary , Mexico , Poland , Romania , Slovakia , Slovenia , South Africa , Turkey , and United Arab Emirates , according to the document .
Only " satisfactory performers " who are " willing to work on local terms and conditions " should pursue the jobs , the document says .
IBM would not immediately confirm if it means that the workers would be paid local wages and would be subject to local labor laws .
A spokesman for Alliance@IBM , a workers ' group that is affiliated with the Communications Workers of America but does not have official union status at IBM , slammed the initiative .
" IBM not only is offshoring its work to low - cost countries , now IBM wants employees to offshore themselves , " spokesman Lee Conrad told CNN .
" At a time of rising unemployment IBM should be looking to keep both the work and the workers in the United States . "
The Armonk , N.Y. - based company has confirmed recent layoffs but has not provided any specifics on the number of people affected .
Conrad said IBM ( IBM , Fortune 500 ) has laid off more than 4,000 workers in the United States since the beginning of the year , but called that " a conservative number . "
" This is unacceptable to the Alliance and we are pursuing this by asking our members and all IBM employees to contact their political representatives to demand an accounting and transparency in job cuts and offshoring from IBM , " Conrad said .

The combined efforts of the University of Tokyo with private sector partners and the Information and Robot Technology Research Technology Initiative have moved one - step closer to creating a robot capable of performing fine motor skills , balancing on one foot and lifting .
These skills are required in order for the robot to serve as a housekeeper / caregiver for the disabled and an aging population .
In other developments , Japanese scientists and engineers at Waseda University in Tokyo unveiled their latest humanoid robot named Twenty - One .
This new and improved humanoid robot is equipped with manual dexterity capable of picking up a drinking straw , placing it into a tumbler and handing off the drink to it 's human counter - part .
Twenty - One looks like a robotic version of Steven Spielberg 's kind - eyed character ET .
Japan is truly taking one giant step forward for mankind .
The collaborative efforts of the University of Tokyo , Toyota , Fujitsu , Mitsubishi , Panasonic , Sega and Olympus under the auspices of IRT , ( Robot Technology Research Technology Initiative ) have formed a Home Assistant Robot Project .
The robot is 61 - inches in height by 25.6 - inches wide with a depth of 31.31 - inches .
The new home assistant has not been officially named , but currently goes by the name AR , the initials of " Assistant Robot . "
AR is equipped with a wide - angle stereo camera , a telephoto stereo camera and ultra-sensitive sensors .
AR operates on a two - wheel drive base with balancing wheels .
The battery life is estimated to run 30 - minutes to 1 - hour .
Seeing is believing , but in short AR can sweep the floor , pick up a tray of dirty dishes , move them to the sink , load up the dishwasher , move chairs , put dirty clothes in the washer and more .
In other news , Japan 's Digital Content Expo in late October 2008 allowed robot developers to show off robots performing a range of gymnastic and calisthenic feats including balancing on one foot , playing a game of limbo , moving from floor position to upright and more .

Thankful Rockets rally behind Carl Landry after shooting Rockets '
Landry shot in leg
Assault follows return from team 's New Orleans trip
Recommended Video :
In the aftermath of Carl Landry ’s shooting early Tuesday , his Houston Rockets teammates were frightened and relieved , yet determined not to let the incident dramatically alter their lifestyles .
“ It ’s scary , ” said forward Shane Battier .
“ This is a guy we were joking and riding with on the plane just hours before .
My feeling is thankfulness that he ’s going to be OK .
“ You have to be careful and be aware of your surroundings .
Even then , there ’s no guarantee you ’re safe .
But I ’m not going to lock myself in my house with an arsenal of weapons . ”
Landry , 25 , suffered a gunshot wound to his lower left leg Tuesday morning in a possible drive - by shooting or failed robbery near downtown , police said .
He was released after treatment at Memorial Hermann - Texas Medical Center .
“ I ’m just thankful that he ’s all right , ” said Rockets head coach Rick Adelman .
“ It ’s just a situation that all of us have to be aware of .
It ’s not the same world it was 10 years ago .
You ’re just thankful that it ’s not something more serious . ”
Rockets general manager Daryl Morey called the leg injury a surface wound in Landry ’s left calf and said the player also suffered a dislocated finger on his left hand .
He said Landry is expected to be able to return to practice in one to three weeks .
“ Dr. ( Tom ) Clanton ( the Rockets ’ team physician ) examined him early , ” Morey said .
“ I was in the hospital with Carl . …
Right now , we ’re focused on him and his family and the fact that he ’s OK ; that ’s where our players ’ hearts are as well .
I ca n’t answer any detailed questions because it ’s an ongoing investigation . ”
Landry hit , ran for help

Landry and the rest of the Rockets had just returned from New Orleans after their 95 - 84 victory over the Hornets .
The team ’s charter flight landed at Hobby Airport shortly after midnight , according to a team spokesman .
The incident happened in the 2900 block of Leeland , a short distance southeast of downtown , at about 2:30 a.m. , Houston police said .
According to senior officers D.W. Arnold and R.A. Moreno of the Houston police homicide division , Landry was driving southbound on Leeland with a female passenger when a gray Honda Civic , traveling northbound , swerved into Landry ’s lane and sideswiped his sport utility vehicle .
Landry made a partial U - turn near Palmer Street , and the Honda also turned around and again struck Landry ’s SUV , causing it to hit a wooden utility pole and stop , the officers said .
After Landry got out , two men got out of the Honda , and one of them pulled a pistol from his back pocket and fired twice , police said .
After being hit , Landry ran for help , they said .
The two men ran after Landry for a short distance before giving up and running away , police said .
The woman in Landry ’s SUV was not injured , they said .
Landry described the attackers as Hispanic men in their early - to mid-20s , about 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighing 150 to 160 pounds .
They had short black hair and wore all - black clothing , he said .
Landry was unavailable for comment , but Rockets guard Aaron Brooks spoke to him .
“ I had a little conversation , and he told me some of the stuff that went on , ” Brooks said .
“ He just sounded happy , blessed .
It was a situation that pretty much anybody could have been in .
He ’s just blessed that he ’s alive , and he ’ll be back and he ’ll be Carl again . ”
Police asked that anyone with information about the shooting call the homicide division at 713-308-3974 or Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS .
All callers to Crime Stoppers remain anonymous .

Bernard Madoff 's longtime accountant has been released on $ 2.5 million in bail after being charged with securities fraud .
The allegations against David Friehling expand the case against Madoff as prosecutors target others who may have been involved in his sprawling $ 65 - billion Ponzi scheme .
Friehling was responsible for auditing Madoff 's securities business , but never reported the investment business was a giant fraud , prosecutors said .
He is due back in court on April 17 .
" His job was not merely to rubber stamp statements he did n't verify , " FBI Assistant Director Joseph Demarest said .
" Simply put , Friehling failed to do his job and lied to investors and regulators in saying he did . "
Friehling allegedly failed to verify Madoff 's assets or revenue as well as look into whether Madoff had made purchases as he had claimed .
He was paid about $ 14,000 a month for bogus services between 2004 - 2007 , prosecutors said .
Investigators said the accountant did not have direct knowledge of the scheme , but he deceived investors by falsely certifying that he had audited the financial statements when he had not .
The SEC said the accounting firm made millions of dollars off of Madoff .
" Friehling had a fiduciary responsibility to investors , and a legal obligation to regulators , to report the truth , " Demerest said .
" The charges unsealed today make clear that Friehling did not fulfill those duties .
He did little or no testing , no verification of the ' facts ' he certified . "
Friehling , 49 , surrendered to authorities and faces charges of securities fraud , aiding and abetting investment adviser fraud and four counts of filing false audit reports with the FCC .
The accountant was released after a brief hearing Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan .
He faces up to 105 years in prison if convicted of the charges .
Friehling 's attorney Andrew Lankler declined to comment when reached .
Friehling ran an accounting office in a nondescript suburban building north of New York City , and quickly drew scrutiny after the Madoff scandal broke .
Jerome Horowitz handled Madoff 's books for many years before turning the business over to his son - in - law , Friehling .
Horowitz died of cancer last week at the age of 80 .
A family friend confirmed his death , and investigators mentioned in their criminal complaint that Friehling 's former partner had died .
Investigators interviewed Horowitz before he died , a source close to the investigation said .
Horowitz 's lawyer had previously described him as one of Madoff 's victims and said he was in financial ruin because of the fraud .
Dr. Margaret Gatz , a professor of psychology , gerontology and preventative medicine at the University of Southern California , conducts research on interventions that may reduce the risk of Alzheimer ’s disease .
In a recent study , published in the January 2009 issue of the journal Diabetes , Dr. Gatz and her team tracked rates of dementia and diabetes in Swedish twins and discovered that developing type 2 diabetes before the age of 65 was associated with a 125 percent increased risk of subsequently developing Alzheimer ’s disease .
1 . How did you become interested in the relationship between diabetes and dementia ?
Our research began with the question why some people develop dementia , especially Alzheimer ’s disease , in old age , whereas others do not .
Alzheimer ’s disease is the most common type of dementia , followed by vascular dementia , which is generally caused by the same things that are risk factors for stroke .
Recently , a number of researchers have begun to show that vascular risk factors are important not only for increasing risk of vascular dementia but also for increasing risk of Alzheimer ’s disease .
This observation is particularly interesting because vascular risk factors are potentially modifiable .
In other words , people might be able to reduce their risk of Alzheimer ’s disease by attending to the kinds of health behaviors that reduce vascular risk , such as controlling blood pressure , cholesterol and diabetes .
What led our research group to be interested in diabetes was the search for potential ways to lower risk of Alzheimer ’s disease .
We were fortunate to be able to launch the Study of Dementia in Swedish Twins , building on the Swedish Twin Registry , to identify a population of twins where one or both members of the pair have developed dementia .
Because the participants are twins , they are genetically similar , and that permits us to ask specifically what is different in the lives of those twins when one has dementia and the other does not .
Actress Eva Green once Googled herself - and was horrified to discover an online discussion about her nipples .
The James Bond star was curious to see what was being written about her on the web and tapped her name into the Internet search engine .
The 28 - year - old found a chat room dedicated to her and learned that her breasts were the main topic of conversation - and Green has sworn never to look herself up online again .
She tells Britain 's GQ magazine , " It was when ( 2003 film ) The Dreamers came out and I googled myself .
My ego drove me to it .
It was an insane thing to do .
Then I saw that weird discussion and decided never to do it again .
People can get very mean .
They get angry even if it 's just a dress you wore that they did n't like .
" It 's actually quite masochistic to google yourself because you know that not everyone is going to like you .
Or your nipples . "
There are two bull markets going on right now .
They are in U.S. government looting .
They are Congressional looting and Federal Reserve ( FED ) looting .
They are bull markets for the government , banks , and select beneficiaries .
They are bear markets for the Americans being looted , which is most of us .
These bull markets in looting are at all - time highs .
Never before has the amount of looting reached such astronomical heights , either in absolute terms or relative to other measures like population or product .
The looters are promoting their looting with a stream of false advertising and mis-information .
They are claiming one false rationale after another .
They are making out like their looting is essential to American prosperity and employment .
There is no basis for these claims .
The looting is transferring wealth from those who have created it to those who have not .
It is outright theft by government .
There is absolutely no way that theft through such transfers can ever create prosperity or employment .
Article 17 of the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights states
Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others .
No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property .
The U.S. government and the FED are engaged in massive violations of the right to own property , which entails the right not to be deprived of it arbitrarily .
They are violating our rights to own property by taking that property from us for themselves and others .
They are looting us .
The Congress and the FED are depriving many Americans of their property for the benefit of a select few .
That makes their looting arbitrary .
Their looting is both unjust and unjustifiable .
They are doing this under the U.S. Constitution , but this makes it no less arbitrary .
Populations have been exterminated under constitutions .
Only by stretching the U.S. Constitution beyond all proper grounds have they grasped the power to loot so rapaciously and openly .
The U.S. Constitution says that no person shall
" be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation . "
The government ’s looting of private property , taken for public use , without just compensation is at an all - time high .
The bull market in government looting kicked off in 2007 .
It now amounts to multiple trillions of dollars .
It rises at least to $ 8 trillion .
This includes money already spent and money guaranteed to defunct , ailing , and insolvent institutions .
There is no end in sight .
Both Congress and the FED have promised even more .
This theft is not and will not be evenly spread over all Americans , born and unborn .
But to get some idea of its immensity , there are about 100 million households in the U.S.
A trillion dollars is $ 10,000 per household .
Eight trillion dollars is $ 80,000 per household .
It is $ 26,667 for every man , woman , and child in America .
The looting shows up in the form of debt and debt - like tax obligations that Americans will pay .
The $ 8 trillion bill and rising is addressed to them .
Even before the government engineered this looting , Americans were already deeply in debt .
Non-mortgage debt is about $ 8,460 for every man , woman , and child .
The total of this consumer credit came to $ 2.5 trillion in 2007 .
Mortgage debt came to another $ 14.6 trillion .
See here .
This debt , accumulated over many years by many Americans , added up to $ 17.1 trillion .
The U.S. government , in a little over a year , is looting Americans and adding to their debt by another $ 8 trillion .
The amount of this brazen violation of property rights is astounding .
The minimum value of a human life is often estimated as the present value of the future income of that person .
Juries often award wrongful death damages that average $ 500,000 to $ 800,000 .
At the higher figure , which produces a lower number of equivalent human lives , $ 8 trillion is equivalent to 10 million human lives .
Suppose that the U.S. government exterminated 10 million persons , each worth $ 800,000 .
That amounts to $ 8 trillion .
In my mind , the government looting is equivalent to a massive genocide of 10 million human beings .
These things cannot accurately be measured , I grant .
The additional poverty , misery , travail , lower income , and other consequences that stem from this looting cannot be measured ; and they cannot be accurately compared with the loss of human lives .
I grant that .
Yet human necessity requires us to make an inaccurate comparison in order to grasp , even faintly , the meaning of the looting that is going on .
The latest Geithner plan is not included in the $ 8 trillion total .
That plan is , again , outright looting .
It is a wealth transfer from taxpayers to banks that have made bad loans .
It is just as much theft as the transfer payments from taxpayers to the creditors of the AIG company .
One sure effect of theft is that the victim is made poorer .
He has to work to make up for what he has lost .
He is set back .
It is as if he were a slave who had worked for the thieves .
Looting enslaves .
The American government is enslaving the American people to a massive extent .
It will not matter what the GDP numbers show if a good part of it is work effort devoted to paying debts and taxes .
That is money that otherwise could have gone to meeting the needs and wants of the victims .
The massive victimization of the American people through the looting of the Bush - Obama - Bernanke regimes will be felt as time passes .
The rulers count on spreading out the pain and obscuring its cause .
The cause is an $ 8 trillion rape .
The cause is outright looting .
The cause is outright violation of property rights .
I hope for a bear market in faith and trust in government .

This is the scariest , stealthiest , and most dangerous exploit I 've seen come around since the legendary Blue Pill !
No , I 'm not just trying to sensationalize this or spread fear , uncertainty and doubt .
This is serious and represents a massive new security threat for us all .
Security Researchers Joanna Rutkowska is planning to release a research paper + exploit code for a new SMM ( System Management Mode ) exploit that installs via an Intel® CPU caching vulnerability .
Joanna , of blue pill fame , reported this on her blog
Joanna cleared it up for me that they are not releasing a SMM rootkit but rather a exploit .
It will be up to some other folks to tie this in with a SMM rootkit like this one perhaps .
" Thursday , March 19th , 1600 UTC , we will publish a paper (+ exploits ) on exploiting Intel® CPU cache mechanisms .
The attack allows for privilege escalation from Ring 0 to the SMM on many recent motherboards with Intel CPUs .
Rafal implemented a working exploit with code execution in SMM in a matter of just a few hours . "
The heart - stopping thing about this particular exploit is that it hides itself in the SMM space .
To put that into perspective , SMM is more privileged than a hypervisor is and it's not controllable by any Operating System .
By design , the operating system cannot override or disable System Management Interupt ( SMI ) calls .
In practice , the only way for you to know what is running in SMM space is to physically disassemble the firmware of your computer .
So , given that an SMI takes precedence over any OS call , the OS cannot control or read SMM , and the only way to read SMM is to disassemble the system makes an SMM rootkit incredibly stealthy !
It is very much like the blue pill attack ( the PC is living in the matrix which is under your complete control ) except that SMM attacks are at an even deeper hardware level of abstraction than a hypervisor exploit !
SMM has been around in Intel chips since 386 processors so if you 'd like further education or history lesson here is a good article .
Now remember that what Joanna will be releasing is a brand new , never before disclosed Intel caching hack that allows them to gain access to SMM space and run their new exploit .
If you then use this exploit to run a SMM rootkit that has the ability to call home to its creator to get new code or deposit its findings your really gonna have a powerful hack .
No software you can run on your operating system would be able to detect this type of exploit once you are p0wned .
So why would they release the exploit code to the public you ask .
Are n't security researchers supposed to play by the rules and refrain from disclosure ?
Well here 's the thing , both the CPU caching vulnerabilities and the SMM vulnerabilities already have been reported to intel .
In fact , according to Joanna " the first mention of the possible attack using caching for compromising SMM has been discussed in certain documents authored as early as the end of 2005 (! ) by nobody else than ...
Intel 's own employees . "
Joanna also officially reported this and other related bugs to Intel .
Loic Duflot also did so back in October 2008 .
Bottom line is that Intel has known about this vulnerability and others for years and it can be argued they have n't done due diligence to fix them yet .
When this happens , security researchers have little choice but to release their finding publicly , the assumption being that if they have known about it for years then for sure someone with less than legal intentions is already exploiting it .
Here is how Joanna puts it ,
" If there is a bug somewhere and if it stays unpatched for enough time , it is almost guaranteed that various people will ( re ) discover and exploit it , sooner or later .
So , do n't blame researchers that they find and publish information about bugs — they actually do a favor to our society . "
Is your PC currently p0wned by some hacker ninja using a SMM rootkit ?
How would you tell ?
You can't tell !!!!!
I just hope Intel fixes these vulnerabilities fast .
Keep checking this site on Thursday , the paper and code will be published here .
Good article on previous theoretical SMM exploits can be found here .
The opinions and information presented here are my personal views and not those of my employer .
On his authority as Admiral of the battlestar Galactica , Edward James Olmos addresses a crowd in the United Nations chamber and gets them to condemn the use of the constructed term [ edited ] “ race ” with a shout of “ So say we all ! ”
Apart from the , I believe , indisputable general awesomeness of this moment , I ’m not sure there ’s that much else to say .
The poor UN official who set Olmos off by using the word “ races ” — in quotation marks — was pretty good - humored about it .

W3C has just published the SVG Tiny 1.2 recommendation .
Others are much more experts than me to describe the changes in the core functionality compared to the 1.1 version , so I let them do that .
However , there is an interesting aspect of the new recommendation regarding the Semantic Web , too .
Indeed , SVG Tiny 1.2 has adopted RDFa as one of the means to add metadata to the SVG file itself .
The semantics of the RDFa attributes are the same as for XHTML ; in fact , the SVG document simply refers to the RDFa specification .
Nevertheless , the fact that the host language is SVG does lead to two small differences :
SVG uses xml: base , whereas XHTML1 +RDFa disallows it in favor of the base element SVG inherits from earlier versions the possibility to add RDF / XML directly into the SVG content via the metadata element .
An SVG +RDFa distiller ought to understand this RDF graph and merge it with the graph produced by the regular RDFa processing .
The RDFa distiller has been updated to distill SVG +RDFa files , too .
To account for those two differences a separate ( host=xml ) option has been introduced , although the distiller would work out of the box for most of the SVG cases ( ie , for those that do not make use of those two features ) .

Nicole Colson examines the Obama administration 's recent decisions on civil liberties -- from policies toward detainees in the " war on terror " to the legality of warrantless wiretapping .
DEFENDING GOVERNMENT
eavesdropping without a warrant .
Arguing that prisoners of the U.S. held overseas do n't have the right to challenge their detention in U.S. courts .
Claiming that victims of CIA kidnapping should n't have their cases heard because of " national security " interests .
These were supposed to be relics of the Bush administration and its attacks on basic constitutional and human rights .
Instead , they are among the many troubling actions taken by the new administration of President Barack Obama .
Rather than repudiating Bush 's shredding of the Constitution , the new White House is embracing some of the worst abuses carried out by the Bush administration in the name of national security and the " war on terror . "
As a candidate for president , Obama promised a new direction .
While pledging to maintain national security , Obama said that " we also want to make sure that we 're protecting the Constitution , and that we 're not excessively providing the president with a sort of a ' blank check ' when it comes to dealing with national security , " he told ABC's This Week .
And , in fact , it was refreshing to hear Obama 's new Attorney General Eric Holder declaring bluntly during his confirmation hearings that " waterboarding is torture . "
It was a forceful repudiation of one aspect of the Bush administration , at least -- Vice President Dick Cheney had , after all , openly defended " waterboarding " in October 2006 .
This seemed to confirm the expectations expressed by Obama supporters like George Washington University law professor Jeffrey Rosen , who wrote in a March 2008 op - ed article in the New York Times : " As a former grassroots activist , Mr. Obama understands the need to make the case for civil liberties in the political arena .
At a time when America 's civil - libertarian tradition has been embattled at home and abroad , his candidacy offers a unique opportunity . "
But just two months into his presidency , the " unique opportunity " that Rosen thought Obama represented seems to be evaporating .
The litany of disappointing actions on civil liberties taken by the Obama administration seems to grow longer by the week .
Among other things , since taking office , the Obama administration has : pre-empted a Supreme Court ruling on whether a legal resident on U.S. soil can be imprisoned indefinitely without trial as an " enemy combatant " ; attempted to block a judicial ruling on Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program ; asserted in court that prisoners currently held overseas by U.S. forces in Bagram , Afghanistan , have no constitutional right to challenge their detentions in U.S. courts ; and argued to dismiss cases brought in federal court by alleged victims of CIA kidnappings and torture on the grounds of " national security . "
As ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said after Obama 's Justice Department argued in federal court that a lawsuit filed by five current and former detainees against Jeppesen Dataplan -- a company accused of arranging extraordinary rendition flights for the CIA - - should be dropped :
Eric Holder 's Justice Department stood up in court today and said that it would continue the Bush policy of invoking state secrets to hide the reprehensible history of torture , rendition and the most grievous human rights violations committed by the American government .
This is not change .
This is definitely more of the same .
Candidate Obama ran on a platform that would reform the abuse of state secrets , but President Obama 's Justice Department has disappointingly reneged on that important civil liberties issue .
THE REVERSALS from what Obama promised -- or was expected -- to do on civil liberties questions have shocked many people who looked forward to the end of the Bush regime .
On the question of warrantless wiretapping , for example , the Obama administration 's arguments in one important court case are indistinguishable from its predecessors .
In the case , brought by two American lawyers against the Bush administration , a federal judge ruled in favor of admitting into evidence a classified document showing that the lawyers for a Saudi charity , the Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation , were electronically eavesdropped on without warrants by the Bush administration .
The Obama administration argued in court that national security would be compromised if the lawsuit was allowed to proceed .
As Salon.com 's Glenn Greenwald wrote :
Manifestly , the Obama [ Justice Department ] has one goal and one goal only here : to prevent any judicial ruling as to whether the Bush [ National Security Agency ] warrantless eavesdropping program was illegal .
And they 're engaging in extraordinary efforts to ensure that occurs ...
Everyone knows the Bush administration spied on Americans without warrants and in violation of the law .
Everyone knows that this document reflects that these plaintiffs were among those who were illegally spied on .
Still , there 's the Obama administration -- just like the Bush administration -- claiming that we 'll all be slaughtered if a court rules on whether the president broke the law .
Another disappointment came in early March , when the Justice Department argued in a California federal court to dismiss a case filed against former Bush administration official John Yoo .
Yoo famously drafted much of the so - called " Bybee torture memo " -- a Justice Department document that approved the use of CIA interrogation methods , including rendition , and blessed as legal methods of physical and psychological coercion that inflicted discomfort " equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury , such as organ failure , impairment of bodily function , or even death . "
Last year , lawyers for supposed " dirty bomb " plotter Jose Padilla --a U.S. citizen who spent years in a military brig without being charged , and subject to sensory and sleep deprivation and other harsh interrogation measures -- filed a suit against Yoo .
If heard , it could challenge the government 's policies on the treatment of detainees .
According to one of the lawyers , Jonathan Freiman , the premise of the suit is that " a lawyer who gives the green light to clearly illegal conduct is an accomplice to that conduct . "
But the Obama Justice Department is standing behind Yoo - - on the grounds that " the Department of Justice generally defends employees and former employees in lawsuits that are filed in connection to their official duties , " according to department spokesperson Matthew Miller .
" We 're not saying that we condone torture , " Justice Department lawyer Mary Mason said at the hearing on the suit .
But by arguing that the case against
Yoo should be dismissed , the Obama administration is protecting the very man who crafted the legal reasoning to justify torture as an acceptable part of the U.S. " war on terror . "
How is that not " condoning torture " ?
The Obama administration is n't protecting just Yoo , but other top Bush administration military officials who are the targets of lawsuits brought by prisoners who say they were tortured while being held at Guantánamo Bay .
In another federal court document filed in March , the Justice Department argued that holding military officials liable for their treatment of prisoners could cause them to make future decisions based on fear of litigation rather than appropriate military policy .
" The Obama administration appears to be sticking with Bush administration legal definitions in pending litigation , " reported the Associated Press .
The case , involving four British men who say they were beaten , shackled in " stress positions " and forcibly shaved while they were imprisoned in Guantánamo Bay ( all four have since been released ) named , among others , former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and retired Gen.
Richard Myers , former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
As Eric Lewis , an attorney for the four , put it : " The upshot of the Justice Department 's position is that there is no right of detainees not to be tortured , and that officials who order torture should be protected . "
EVEN WHEN the Obama administration has seemed to take positive steps to turn back some of the Bush administration 's abuses , the full picture is more complicated .
So , for example , civil liberties advocates applauded Obama 's executive orders to close the U.S. prison camp at Guantánamo Bay , affirm detainees ' right to habeas corpus and instruct that prisoners be treated according to the Geneva Conventions when interrogated by U.S. officials .
But it turns out that these orders have wide loopholes .
The order on interrogations , for example , only applies to prisoners " in the custody or under the effective control of an officer , employee or other agent of the United States Government , or detained within a facility owned , operated or controlled by a department or agency of the United States , in any armed conflict . "
That formulation would allow the use of torture by other governments ' security forces operating on orders from the U.S. -- under , for example , the " extraordinary rendition " program used by the Bush administration to evade the law by sub-contracting torture to to U.S. - allied regimes .
In addition , the order demands that the CIA close " as expeditiously as possible " any of its detention centers , but says nothing about whether the FBI , Defense Department or any other U.S. body -- or private contractors such as Blackwater - - may run such facilities .
As Professor James
Hill noted , " This order contains loopholes big enough to drive a FEMA camp train through them . "
Likewise , in February , it seemed like a positive sign when Attorney General Eric Holder announced a review of every court case in which the Bush administration invoked the " state secrets " privilege to have lawsuits thrown out .
But according to the Associated Press , on the same day that Holder announced his review , Douglas Letter , an attorney for the Justice Department 's civil division , cited the same " state secrets privilege in asking a federal appeals court to uphold dismissal of a lawsuit accusing a Boeing Co. subsidiary of illegally helping the CIA fly suspected terrorists to allied foreign nations where they would be tortured .
Three times , Letter assured the judges his position had been approved by Obama administration officials . "
To take another example , earlier this month , the media reported that the Obama administration had dropped the term " enemy combatants " as a justification for detaining terrorism suspects without trial .
But as the New York Times reported , " [ I ] n a much anticipated court filing , the Justice Department argued that the president has the authority to detain terrorism suspects [ at Guantánamo Bay ] without criminal charges , much as the Bush administration had asserted .
It provided a broad definition of those who can be held , which was not significantly different from the one used by the Bush administration .
" The filing signaled that , as long as Guantánamo remains open , the new administration will aggressively defend its ability to hold some detainees there . "
As Glenn Greenwald put it , " [ T ] he Obama administration , when called upon to state their position , makes only the most cosmetic and inconsequential changes -- designed to generate headlines misleadingly depicting a significant reversal ( " Obama drops ' enemy combatant ' label " ) -- while , in fact , retaining the crux of Bush 's extremist detention theory . "
There is no " middle ground " on these questions .
Those who justified , condoned , participated in and ordered the torture of detainees should be held accountable -- starting with George W. Bush .
Citizens should have a right not to be spied on by their government .
Detainees should have rights under international law , including the right to a trial .
But the Obama administration is n't taking anything like a principled stand on these questions .
On the contrary , while it wants to change the popular perception of federal policies on civil liberties , the evidence is mounting that the Obama administration is putting a new face on many of the same abuses we 've been living with for the past eight years .
Do you remember how you first found out about sex ?
Not just how babies are made , but the…ins and outs , so to speak ?
For most of us , our first introduction to sex as more than just a reproductive act probably came from chatter with friends , a copy of Playboy or racy scenes in your aunt ’s secret stash of adult novels .
All of this titillation with no adult guidance whatsoever .
Abstinence - only education does n’t work , and neither does fear - mongering with frightening statistics while kids inevitably experiment in back seats , figuring out the details of sex on their own .
What ’s the alternative ?
How about being real ?
I mean really , really real .
The Unitarian Church of Christ has started a holistic and perhaps controversial sexual education program for middle schoolers called OWL ( Our Whole Lives ) which educates teens , in a safe and adult - guided environment , about the honest realities of this wonderful thing we call sex .
While so many standard sex -ed courses focus on what can go wrong , OWL also educates about what ’s so right about sex – and how to foster physical and emotional health .
OWL presents not fear , but plenty of facts , including images of adults having sex , alternatives to intercourse , emotions involved in sexual activity and plenty of time to speak up and discuss body issues , which are so important to teenagers in the hormonal throes of adolescence .
And of course , they do present statistics and information about potential consequences like unwanted pregnancies and STDs .
This is what I would consider an evolution in education .
OWL is n’t promoting sex but rather presenting information in an honest way , debunking myths , and giving kids a chance to ask the real questions free from fear .

February 25 , 2009 --
The people of the United States ( through their vote for US President Barack Obama and ``change ' ' ) and Iraqi journalist Muntadar al - Zaidi alike may have given George W. Bush ( and all he stood for ) the boot – but India 's Congress Party wants to give Bush the Bharat Ratna ! [ 1 ]
Congress Party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi , addressing the annual general meeting of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry ( FICCI ) , declared , “ Give Bharat Ratna to Bush .
I do n't know what the rules are but I will officially do something . ”
The ruling Congress Party and its United Progressive Alliance ( UPA ) coalition government ’s continued servility to Bush and the disastrous neoliberal economic model is entirely against the people ’s mood – not just in India but even across the world .
It is not just radicals in the world who are recognising this mood – the imperialist establishment is taking note too .
Take the recent warnings issued to the US Senate by the USA ’s new director of national intelligence , Dennis Blair .
In a briefing to the Senate Committee on Intelligence , he declared that the greatest threat to US security and hegemony is not the al Qaeda but the world capitalist crisis and resulting protests .
He pointed out that the " widely held perception that excesses in US financial markets and inadequate regulation were responsible has increased criticism about free - market policies , which may make it difficult to achieve long - time US objectives " .
The collapse of Wall Street , he added , " has increased questioning of US stewardship of the global economy and the international financial structure " .
` New generation of activists '
In France , too , recent intelligence reports talk about a " new generation of activists " coming up in the wake of the global crisis , and possibly a " rebirth of the violent extreme left " .
When even the US Intelligence establishment is recognising the “ increased questioning of US stewardship of the global economy and the international financial structure ” and the “ increased criticism about free - market policies ” across the globe , why is India ’s ruling class stubbornly intent on taking India along the path of disaster ?
All over the world , there is anger at the corporate greed and US imperialism that caused the recession – and at the governments that are making people pay for the crisis with ``austerity measures '’ , job cuts and wage cuts while bailing out the corporates with billions of dollars .
Governments have fallen in Iceland and Latvia , following weeks of militant protests on the streets .
There are powerful ongoing mass protests in Greece , Ireland and Italy , a successful general strike in France , and student occupations of campuses like New York University and several campuses in Britain on the issue of the genocide in Gaza .
Meanwhile , in Bolivia , a referendum moved by President Evo Morales for a new constitution won 60 % of the vote .
The new constitution expands autonomy of Bolivia ’s indigenous majority , strengthens their rights over land , water and natural resources , and introduces some land reforms .
These policies are totally against the grain of the neoliberal policy thrust by the ruling class in countries like India : policies of state - sponsored grab of land and water , if necessary killing indigenous people and agrarian poor people who stand in the way ; privatisation of resources like water ; and reversal of poorly implemented land reforms !
In Venezuela too , a referendum moved by President Hugo Chavez won 55 % of the vote .
The referendum was on a proposal of the Venezuelan National Assembly to allow Venezuelans the right to elect Chavez to a third six - year term after his second term ends in 2012 .
Its victory can be said to be a vote for the vision of socialism espoused by Chavez and his party , the UNited Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) .
The Indian government ’s policy in the wake of the economic crisis has been identical with that of all those governments in the world that are getting the boot from their people – ``austerity ' ' and wage and job cuts for the people , and bailouts for banks and corporations .
India 's finance minister Pranab Mukherjee at the recently held Indian Labour Conference , recommended ``austerity measures '' and wage cuts as an alternative to job cuts .
The Indian government is doing all it can to bring the US - manufactured global crisis to Indian soil .
Forces of struggle against these neoliberal policies in India must do all they can to bring the global wave of resistance to Indian shores .
The spectre of “ rebirth of the left ” and of capitalism ’s severely eroded credibility fuelling struggles for revolutionary change haunts the ruling classes of the US and Europe , and India too .
That spectre reflects a very real fear .
The history that was declared to have ``ended '' nearly two decades ago is coming alive – in the spirit of people all over the world who are not only hitting the streets but also picking up their copies of Marx , Engels and Lenin !

Ten Reasons to use Beer Brewing Software
Many homebrewers are not aware of how brewing software can dramatically improve the quality and consistency of their home brew .
Brewing without doing the math is kind of like shooting darts blindfolded , and software makes the math much easier .
This week , we take a look at some of the ways brewing software can make a difference in beer design and how it can improve your brewing day .
Now as a disclaimer , I obviously am affiliated with BeerSmith brewing software , but even if you do n’t choose our package , I highly recommend you try the various beer brewing software programs available and select the one that suits you best .
Your beer will be better for it .
Design Great Beer in Minutes – Building a recipe with beer software is as simple as picking the ingredients you want from a list .
A typical package has several hundred varieties of hops , grains , yeasts and more that are pre-entered for your use .
Picking from a list of ingredients is much easier than thumbing through a set of reference books .
Brew Consistently Good Beer –
By tracking your ingredients , recipe used , original gravity and taste of your beer you can improve your brewing process and make more consistent , better tasting beer .
You can keep track of old recipes , see how changes affect your color , gravity and bitterness , and design better beers .
Brew the Style you Want – Brewing software lets you select a target beer style and match the color , bitterness and suggest ingredients as you build the recipe .
As you add ingredients , the software estimates each of these and lets you compare the current values to the style you selected .
This will help you come much closer to your target beer style the first time out .
Share Recipes – Brewing software that supports open standards like BeerXML give you access to thousands of recipes online that you can download , import and customize to your taste .
Many of the popular packages have dedicated recipe sites available .
You can also email recipes to your friends , post them on a web site or share them in a variety of formats .
Get Step by Step Instructions – Software like BeerSmith will generate step - by - step instructions customized for your recipe , equipment and methods .
No fuss , no worries .
After you enter your recipe you can get specific brewing instructions generated by the program with a single click .
Stay Organized – Keep all of your brewing records in one place .
Keep a brewing log of your past brewing sessions , schedule your next brew , record new ideas and manipulate recipes from the web .
Refine your favorite recipes to perfect your brewing technique .
Match your Brewing Equipment –
The equipment you use to brew has a huge impact on the taste of your beer .
With brewing software you can set up your equipment settings once and apply that to any recipe to get accurate calculations and estimates .
All Grain Made Easy – Modern equipment and ingredients have made all grain brewing more accessible than ever .
Infusion mashing for all - grain brewing involves a fairly complex set of calculations to determine the amount and temperature of water to be added at each step .
In BeerSmith , you just pick the infusion profile you desire and the software provides detailed instructions that match your equipment and ingredients .
Manage Inventory , Track Prices and go Shopping –
The best brewing software includes tools to manage your inventory of ingredients , determine the cost of each brew and even generate shopping lists for a particular recipe for your next trip to the store .
This makes it much easier to keep track of what you need and avoid those “ extra trips ” .
Software Costs Less than a Batch of Beer – Brewing software is cheap– typically from $ 20 - 25 for the top commercial packages .
One bad tasting batch of beer costs more .
Want to try brewing software yourself ?
Thanks again for joining us on the BeerSmith Home Brewing Blog .

The BBC was in crisis last night as politicians including government ministers , religious leaders and senior members of its own staff condemned the decision not to broadcast a charity appeal to help the stricken people of Gaza rebuild their homes .
The corporation 's director general , Mark Thompson , was left isolated as rival broadcasters ITV and Channel 4 agreed to put out the plea for aid made jointly by 13 British charities .
The BBC has decided the broadcast of the appeal might be seen as evidence of bias on a highly sensitive political issue .
The Archbishop of York , John Sentamu , has accused the broadcaster of " taking sides " .
He said yesterday : " This is not a row about impartiality but rather about humanity .
" This situation is akin to that of British military hospitals who treat prisoners of war as a result of their duty under the Geneva convention .
They do so because they identify need rather than cause .
This is not an appeal by Hamas asking for arms but by the Disasters Emergency Committee asking for relief .
By declining their request , the BBC has already taken sides and forsaken impartiality , " the archbishop added .
Communities secretary Hazel Blears said : " The BBC 's decision should not discourage the public from donating to this important appeal .
I sincerely hope the BBC will urgently review its decision . "
The BBC 's unrepentant stance has stirred up rebellion in the ranks of it own reporters and editors .
One senior BBC news presenter told the Observer : " I 've been talking to colleagues and everyone here is absolutely seething about this .
The notion that the decision to ban the appeal will seem impartial to the public at large is quite absurd .
" Most of us feel that the BBC 's defence of its position is pathetic , and there 's a feeling of real anger - made worse by the fact that contractually we are unable to speak out . "
Jon Snow , the journalist who presents Channel 4 news , said the BBC should have been prepared to accept the judgment of the aid experts of the DEC .
" It is a ludicrous decision .
That is what public service broadcasting is for .
I think it was a decision founded on complete ignorance and I am absolutely amazed they have stuck to it . "
Snow said he suspected a BBC bureaucrat had " panicked " and he called upon Mark Thompson to put the situation right .
Martin Bell , the former BBC foreign correspondent , said the BBC should admit it had made a mistake .
He claimed " a culture of timidity had crept " into the corporation .
" I am completely appalled , " he said .
" It is a grave humanitarian crisis and the people who are suffering are children .
They have been caught out on this question of balance . "
But Greg Dyke , Thompson 's predecessor as director general of the BBC , said the issue put the BBC in a " no win situation " .
He added : " Outside of Iraq , the single biggest issue that caused complaints was the coverage of Israel .
I can understand why the BBC has taken this decision , because on a subject as sensitive as the Middle East it is absolutely essential that the audience cannot see any evidence at all of a bias . "
Douglas Alexander , the international development secretary , who has attacked the BBC 's decision , today welcomed commercial broadcasters ' decision to break ranks and urged the BBC to think again .
" I welcome this decision .
The DEC appeal is crucial to help alleviate the suffering of people injured , displaced and hungry in Gaza . "
The BBC also faces demands for an explanation from within the Commons international development select committee .
Richard Burden , the Labour MP and committee member , said the BBC was out of step with public opinion .
Andrew Mitchell , the shadow international development secretary , who was this weekend making a visit to Gaza , Israel and the West Bank , said it was up to the BBC , but added : " We believe that they should allow the broadcast to proceed so that the British public , who have proved themselves so generous during recent emergencies in the Congo and Burma , can make their own judgment on the validity of the appeal . "
The satellite broadcaster Sky said it was " considering " broadcasting the appeal .
A spokesman for the BBC said : " We do accept that people are strongly guided in their view on this by the humanitarian emergency .
We are highlighting the situation in Gaza in every news bulletin and that is one of the reasons the issue is so high on the agenda . "
Thompson received backing from the BBC Trust 's chairman , Sir Michael Lyons .
He said he was " concerned " about the tone of some politicians ' comments on the issue , which he said came close to " undue interference " in the BBC 's editorial independence .
A group of protesters this morning gathered outside the Central Bank of Iceland in order to block the bank chiefs ’ access to the building as they arrived for work .
Two of the bank ’s three chairmen , David Oddsson and Eirikur Gudnason have refused to yield to the new Prime Minister ’s demand that they resign .
The remaining chairman , Ingimundur Fridriksson , does intend to resign .
At Saturday afternoon ’s protest meeting in front of parliament , the singer / songwriter turned firebrand rabble - rouser Hordur Torfason encouraged attendees to meet again at the Central Bank this morning at 08.00 .
Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir last night expressed her disappointment with David Oddsson for his refusal to resign and for his harshly worded reply to her initial letter .
I ’ve just found this remarkable CT scan in a 1997 article entitled ‘ Trans - orbital penetrating head injury with a door key ’ .
The paper reports that “ A 71 - year - old - female was answering the door when she misjudged the step and fell forward impaling herself on the large key protruding from the lock . ”
She was found with the key still embedded in her head and was transferred to neurosurgery where the key was removed .
Thankfully , the patient recovered with no neurological impairment and only slight difficulties with her vision .

What is a zombie ?
It ’s an obvious and necessary question for any blog that seeks to cover the wide variety of zombie media .
In my research and writing , I ’ve encountered a number of different definitions for what is or is n’t a zombie .
It ’s something that really , really seems to get zombie lovers riled up .
If you want to see an example , check out the discussion page for the Wikipedia list of zombie movies ( it ’s in my blogroll links ) .
It has pages of discussion over 28 Days Later , much of which can only be described as frenzied .
Many people take what I feel is a ridiculously narrow view .
In a list of the best zombie movies of all time I wrote a while back , some of the commenters complained that The Serpent and the Rainbow did n’t belong .
Another commenter said if it was n’t an ambulatory , flesh - eating corpse , it was n’t a zombie ( in other words , it ’s a Romero clone , or it ’s not a zombie ) .
That ’s just ridiculous .
For one thing , it makes the list of zombie movies and media about a ten percent of what it actually is , or should be .
For another , it completely ignores the history and development of the zombie .
Worst , it completely excludes some of the coolest zombies of all time .
Personally , I take an expansive , inclusive position on what is or is n’t a zombie .
I use what I consider a common - sense approach : if it looks like a zombie , acts like a zombie and / or is called a zombie , then it ’s ( probably ) a zombie .
I know that might seem like a circular argument , but we are talking about a largely fictional creature here — a zombie is what the people who make zombie media say it is , and , to a lesser degree , what the people who experience that media think it is .
It ’s not quite that simple ; there are other considerations .
For starters , it ’s definitely worth noting that zombies are , in one incarnation , a real thing .
You ca n’t say that about too many other monsters !
The first zombie stories came from reports of Westerners who visited Haiti and witnessed or heard about the creations of Voudon practitioners .
From there , zombies were incorporated into film and theater , then later books , video games , etc .
On the other hand , things that are clearly and definitively something else , such as vampires , demons or ghosts , are not zombies ( although there are some special cases that might qualify as zombie hybrids ) .
These creatures have their own traditions and tropes associated with them .
Trying to encompass them in the definition of a zombie simply dilutes the definition beyond usefulness .
That ’s the basic premise : if it looks like a zombie , acts like a zombie and / or is called a zombie ( i.e. is based on the reality of the Voudon practice of zombification or any of the fiction inspired by that practice ) and is n’t something else , it ’s a zombie .
I ’m not done with this topic , not by a long shot .
I ’m actually working on a super - scientific method for determining zombieness and I intend to address several specific characteristics of zombiism in later posts , but I think I ’ve poked the fire enough for one day .
February 2009
A lot of cities look at Silicon Valley and ask " How could we make something like that happen here ? "
The organic way to do it is to establish a first - rate university in a place where rich people want to live .
That 's how Silicon Valley happened .
But could you shortcut the process by funding startups ?
Possibly .
Let 's consider what it would take .
The first thing to understand is that encouraging startups is a different problem from encouraging startups in a particular city .
The latter is much more expensive .
People sometimes think they could improve the startup scene in their town by starting something like Y Combinator there , but in fact it will have near zero effect .
I know because Y Combinator itself had near zero effect on Boston when we were based there half the year .
The people we funded came from all over the country ( indeed , the world ) and afterward they went wherever they could get more funding — which generally meant Silicon Valley .
The seed funding business is not a regional business , because at that stage startups are mobile .
They 're just a couple founders with laptops . [ 1 ]
If you want to encourage startups in a particular city , you have to fund startups that wo n't leave .
There are two ways to do that : have rules preventing them from leaving , or fund them at the point in their life when they naturally take root .
The first approach is a mistake , because it becomes a filter for selecting bad startups .
If your terms force startups to do things they do n't want to , only the desperate ones will take your money .
Good startups will move to another city as a condition of funding .
What they wo n't do is agree not to move the next time they need funding .
So the only way to get them to stay is to give them enough that they never need to leave .
___
How much would that take ?
If you want to keep startups from leaving your town , you have to give them enough that they 're not tempted by an offer from Silicon Valley VCs that requires them to move .
A startup would be able to refuse such an offer if they had grown to the point where they were ( a ) rooted in your town and / or ( b ) so successful that VCs would fund them even if they did n't move .
How much would it cost to grow a startup to that point ?
A minimum of several hundred thousand dollars .
Wufoo seem to have rooted themselves in Tampa on $ 118 k , but they 're an extreme case .
On average it would take at least half a million .
So if it seems too good to be true to think you could grow a local silicon valley by giving startups $ 15 - 20 k each like Y Combinator , that 's because it is .
To make them stick around you 'd have to give them at least 20 times that much .
However , even that is an interesting prospect .
Suppose to be on the safe side it would cost a million dollars per startup .
If you could get startups to stick to your town for a million apiece , then for a billion dollars you could bring in a thousand startups .
That probably would n't push you past Silicon Valley itself , but it might get you second place .
For the price of a football stadium , any town that was decent to live in could make itself one of the biggest startup hubs in the world .
What 's more , it would n't take very long .
You could probably do it in five years .
During the term of one mayor .
And it would get easier over time , because the more startups you had in town , the less it would take to get new ones to move there .
By the time you had a thousand startups in town , the VCs would n't be trying so hard to get them to move to Silicon Valley ; instead they 'd be opening local offices .
Then you 'd really be in good shape .
You 'd have started a self - sustaining chain reaction like the one that drives the Valley .
___
But now comes the hard part .
You have to pick the startups .
How do you do that ?
Picking startups is a rare and valuable skill , and the handful of people who have it are not readily hireable .
And this skill is so hard to measure that if a government did try to hire people with it , they 'd almost certainly get the wrong ones .
For example , a city could give money to a VC fund to establish a local branch , and let them make the choices .
But only a bad VC fund would take that deal .
They would n't seem bad to the city officials .
They 'd seem very impressive .
But they'd be bad at picking startups .
That 's the characteristic failure mode of VCs .
All VCs look impressive to limited partners .
The difference between the good ones and the bad ones only becomes visible in the other half of their jobs : choosing and advising startups . [ 2 ]
What you really want is a pool of local angel investors — people investing money they made from their own startups .
But unfortunately you run into a chicken and egg problem here .
If your city is n't already a startup hub , there wo n't be people there who got rich from startups .
And there is no way I can think of that a city could attract angels from outside .
By definition they 're rich .
There 's no incentive that would make them move . [ 3 ]
However , a city could select startups by piggybacking on the expertise of investors who were n't local .
It would be pretty straightforward to make a list of the most eminent Silicon Valley angels and from that to generate a list of all the startups they 'd invested in .
If a city offered these companies a million dollars each to move , a lot of the earlier stage ones would probably take it .
Preposterous as this plan sounds , it 's probably the most efficient way a city could select good startups .
It would hurt the startups somewhat to be separated from their original investors .
On the other hand , the extra million dollars would give them a lot more runway .
___
Would the transplanted startups survive ?
Quite possibly .
The only way to find out would be to try it .
It would be a pretty cheap experiment , as civil expenditures go .
Pick 30 startups that eminent angels have recently invested in , give them each a million dollars if they 'll relocate to your city , and see what happens after a year .
If they seem to be thriving , you can try importing startups on a larger scale .
Do n't be too legalistic about the conditions under which they 're allowed to leave .
Just have a gentlemen 's agreement .
Do n't try to do it on the cheap and pick only 10 for the initial experiment .
If you do this on too small a scale you 'll just guarantee failure .
Startups need to be around other startups .
30 would be enough to feel like a community .
Do n't try to make them all work in some renovated warehouse you 've made into an " incubator . "
Real startups prefer to work in their own spaces .
In fact , do n't impose any restrictions on the startups at all .
Startup founders are mostly hackers , and hackers are much more constrained by gentlemen 's agreements than regulations .
If they shake your hand on a promise , they 'll keep it .
But show them a lock and their first thought is how to pick it .
Interestingly , the 30 - startup experiment could be done by any sufficiently rich private citizen .
And what pressure it would put on the city if it worked . [ 4 ]
___
Should the city take stock in return for the money ?
In principle they 're entitled to , but how would they choose valuations for the startups ?
You could n't just give them all the same valuation : that would be too low for some ( who'd turn you down ) and too high for others ( because it might make their next round a " down round " ) .
And since we 're assuming we 're doing this without being able to pick startups , we also have to assume we can't value them , since that 's practically the same thing .
Another reason not to take stock in the startups is that startups are often involved in disreputable things .
So are established companies , but they do n't get blamed for it .
If someone gets murdered by someone they met on Facebook , the press will treat the story as if it were about Facebook .
If someone gets murdered by someone they met at a supermarket , the press will just treat it as a story about a murder .
So understand that if you invest in startups , they might build things that get used for pornography , or file - sharing , or the expression of unfashionable opinions .
You should probably sponsor this project jointly with your political opponents , so they can't use whatever the startups do as a club to beat you with .
It would be too much of a political liability just to give the startups the money , though .
So the best plan would be to make it convertible debt , but which did n't convert except in a really big round , like $ 20 million .
___
How well this scheme worked would depend on the city .
There are some towns , like Portland , that would be easy to turn into startup hubs , and others , like Detroit , where it would really be an uphill battle .
So be honest with yourself about the sort of town you have before you try this .
It will be easier in proportion to how much your town resembles San Francisco .
Do you have good weather ?
Do people live downtown , or have they abandoned the center for the suburbs ?
Would the city be described as " hip " and " tolerant , " or as reflecting " traditional values ? "
Are there good universities nearby ?
Are there walkable neighborhoods ?
Would nerds feel at home ?
If you answered yes to all these questions , you might be able not only to pull off this scheme , but to do it for less than a million per startup .
I realize the chance of any city having the political will to carry out this plan is microscopically small .
I just wanted to explore what it would take if one did .
How hard would it be to jumpstart a silicon valley ?
It 's fascinating to think this prize might be within the reach of so many cities .
So even though they 'll all still spend the money on the stadium , at least now someone can ask them : why did you choose to do that instead of becoming a serious rival to Silicon Valley ?
Notes
[ 1 ] What people who start these supposedly local seed firms always find is that ( a ) their applicants come from all over , not just the local area , and ( b ) the local startups also apply to the other seed firms .
So what ends up happening is that the applicant pool gets partitioned by quality rather than geography .
[ 2 ] Interestingly , the bad VCs fail by choosing startups run by people like them — people who are good presenters , but have no real substance .
It 's a case of the fake leading the fake .
And since everyone involved is so plausible , the LPs who invest in these funds have no idea what 's happening till they measure their returns .
[ 3 ] Not even being a tax haven , I suspect .
That makes some rich people move , but not the type who would make good angel investors in startups .

“ Everyone is suffering , ” President Obama said in his speech to a joint session of Congress in late February .
He was referring to the global financial and economic crisis , but he did n’t have it exactly right .
There are some people who are doing well : dollar - store owners , bankruptcy lawyers , gun manufacturers ( sales are up ! ) , short - sellers of stock , foreclosure experts , and so on .
But some individuals who are doing well are doing really well .
Here ’s a rundown of 10 of the financial crisis ’ biggest winners :
John Paulson : “ John Paulson Profits in Downturn ” is the headline of a February 2009 article in Portfolio magazine .
It ’s also the understatement of the century .
Paulson is a hedge fund manager who has been ridiculously successful betting against banks and other entities that had exposure to the subprime crisis :
In 2007 , his funds were up $ 15 billion .
In 2008 , he did n’t do as well :
His main fund rose 38 percent in a year when the S&P 500 fell almost 40 percent .
His 2007 earnings were in the neighborhood of $ 3.7 billion .
According to Forbes , while 656 billionaires lost money last year , Paulson was one of the 44 who added to their fortunes .
He jumped to # 76 on the magazine ’s list of the world ’s richest people , approximately doubling his net worth since 2007 .
According to Portfolio , $ 100 invested with Paulson ’s “ Credit Fund 1 ” in 2007 would be worth nearly $ 700 today .
And on Wednesday , Bloomberg News reported that Paulson may have made another $ 428 million since September 2008 by shorting Lloyds Banking Group and HBOS Plc. , two British financial firms .
Andrew Lahde :
In late 2007 , the Financial Times reported that a hedge fund run by Santa Monica - based Lahde Capital was up a stunning 1,000 percent through November 26 of that year .
Andrew Lahde had earned those returns by taking the other side of everyone else ’s stupid bets :
He bet that the subprime loans banks were packaging , securitizing , and otherwise turning from crap to gold were , in fact , still crap .
Like Paulson , Lahde was right about the subprime loans , and that move , according to the Financial Times , “ appears to have become the most profitable single trade of all time . ”
Unlike Paulson , Lahde is no longer working in the financial industry .
Last October , he closed up shop , penning a wide - ranging screed ( PDF ) railing against the hedge fund industry , the American system of government , and ( naturally ) the illegality of growing hemp .
“ I am dropping out , ” he wrote .
“ Please do not expect any type of reply to emails or voicemails within normal time frames or at all . ”
Sir Fred Goodwin : Goodwin , who The Economist called “ a bad banker and a dishonourable man ” last week , was the head of Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) until it had to be bailed out by the British government late last year .
( John Paulson , coincidentally , made $ 420 million in late 2008 and early 2009 betting that RBS was going down . )
So how has Goodwin profited from the crisis ?
Despite his failure , he ’s still likely to receive a pension of nearly $ 1 million a year .
If Britain had n’t saved RBS from going bankrupt , Goodwin ’s pension would be in the neighborhood of $ 39,000 a year , beginning when he turned 65 ( he ’s 50 now ) .
But since his bank was bailed out , he is , as The Economist writes , an “ accidental multimillionaire . ”
James Chanos : Chanos last drew widespread attention when he made millions betting against Enron in the early 2000s .
He later gave testimony walking Congress through the analyses his firm , Kynikos Associates , had performed to determine Enron was drastically overvalued .
Chanos told Reuters in late February that his funds “ had a good year ” in 2008 — not surprising for a man whose fund specializes in betting stocks will go down .
The average hedge fund focusing on that kind of trading had 25 percent returns in 2008 , so a “ good year ” for Chanos was probably a very good year compared to stock indexes , which were down big .
But even winners like Chanos have their problems — despite good returns , skittish investors still withdrew 20 percent of their money from his funds .
Prem Watsa : Watsa , Canada ’s version of Warren Buffett , is known as the “ Sage of Toronto . ”
He believes the world is going through an “ economic Pearl Harbor , ” but if that ’s the case , he ’s on the winning side .
Like others who did well in 2008 , Watsa made a killing betting against financial companies like American International Group ( AIG ) .
In 2008 , his company , Fairfax Financial Holdings , had its best year in its 23 - year history .
Its book value was up 21 percent on the year and its $ 1.1 billion in earnings made Fairfax Canada ’s most profitable corporation .
Shawn Kolahi : Kolahi used to be a mortgage broker , specializing
in “ cash - out ” refinancing .
The company he worked for , Dana Capital ,
tried to convince people with bad credit to take out new loans because
their homes had gone up in value .
According to Salon ‘s Alyssa Katz , who wrote about Kolahi
in early March , “ It ’s largely thanks to cash - out mortgages like Dana’s
that recent homebuyers in California , more than anywhere else in the
country , owe far more in mortgage debt than their homes are actually
worth . ”
Like many others in his line of work , Katz reports , Kolahi is
now in the “ loan modification ” business , heading “ a fire brigade
battling the inferno he helped ignite . ”
But very few loan modifications
actually work , and critics say that trying to get people to keep paying
a mortgage on a house that was insanely overvalued is predatory
lending .
It “ is not only ineffective , it is evil , ” former mortgage
broker Ramsey Su wrote in the Wall Street Journal
in January .
Whether or not that ’s true , it ’s clear that Kolahi and
people like him have figured out a way to profit from both sides of the
bubble — first selling bad mortgages and then trying to “ fix ” them .
Jerry Haworth : Haworth is a relatively small - time hedge fund
manager ( his firm manages in the neighborhood of $ 40 million ) , but his
“ Black Swan Fund ” made big - time profits over the past year , gaining 236 percent .
The fund is named after NYU professor Nassim Nicholas Taleb ’s Black Swan theory ,
which warns of rare , hard - to - predict events that nonetheless have
enormous impacts .
The fund was “ conceived and executed as a disaster
hedge , and clearly last year was full of disasters ” one fund investor
told Bloomberg News .
But Haworth announced in early March that he is
closing down the Black Swan fund , because , he says , “ The market has
gone from underpricing risk to overpricing it . ”
Instead , he ’ll be
starting a fund that bets on increasing worldwide inflation .
Meredith Whitney :
Not many financial analysts saw their reputations enhanced by the economic meltdown , but Whitney , who Fortune called the “ oracle of the bear market , ” is one of them .
In October 2007 , she wrote a highly critical memo attacking the financial stability of Citigroup .
Citi ’s CEO , Chuck Prince , resigned three days later , and Citi has since been the recipient of billions of bailout money .
“ It ’s gotten to the point where Meredith ca n’t opine or write anymore without moving stocks , ” Gus Scacco , an institutional fund manager for AG Asset Management , told Fortune last August .
In February , as another of her predictions ( that Citi would eventually have to dismantle itself ) began to look like it was coming true , Whitney announced that she would be leaving Oppenheimer & Co. to start her own financial advisory firm .
Jamie Dimon :
In today ’s market , you can be a big winner just by not being a big loser .
Dimon ’s JP Morgan has weathered the financial crisis better than perhaps any other big bank .
Dimon , the firm ’s CEO , got JP out of the subprime securitization business earlier than its major competitors .
( He still calls not getting out sooner “ the biggest mistake of my career . ” )
And while JP Morgan has suffered greatly from the downturn , its position relative to its competitors is secure .
On Tuesday , Dimon took center stage again , giving a speech that was credited with helping boost the stock market .
He announced that JP Morgan was “ solidly profitable ” for the first quarter of 2009 .
While the company has taken $ 33.3 billion in losses since the start of the credit crisis , that ’s only a fraction of those experienced by competitors like Citi ( $ 88.3 billion ) and Merrill Lynch ( $ 55.9 billion ) .
Dimon deserves at least some of the credit for minimizing the damage .
John Maynard Keynes :
The great economist may be dead , but the past 20 or so months have been perhaps his finest hours since his theories fell out of favor in the late 1970s .
Paul Krugman , a Nobel Prize winner in economics , calls the current era a “ Keynesian moment . ”
And N. Gregory Mankiw , the chairman of George W. Bush ’s Council of Economic Advisors , wrote late last year that “ if you were going to turn to only one economist to understand the problems facing the economy , there is little doubt that the economist would be John Maynard Keynes . ”
When left - wing Democrat Krugman and right - wing Republican Mankiw agree , you know they ’re probably on to something .
“ The essential framework constructed by Keynes — that recessions are caused by a failure of demand , and that at the very least government should not respond to an economic slowdown by paring back its largesse — is no longer in dispute , ” The New Republic ‘s Jonathan Chait wrote last week .
Indeed , many world governments , including America ’s , are trying to jumpstart demand by increasing government spending — the fiscal stimulus you ’ve heard so much about .
Krugman writes ,
“ In the long run , it turns out , Keynes is anything but dead . ”

We are actively seeking student projects for Summer of Code .
A list of project suggestions is at : http://wiki.xiph.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code_2009
Students should feel free to select one of these , develop a variation , or propose their own ideas !
Some examples : * Develop a conference bridge or reference SIP client for CELT , the new , ultra - low delay audio codec that bridges the gap between Vorbis and Speex for applications where both high quality audio and low delay are desired .
If you enjoy hacking on networks , you 'll have fun with these CELT projects .
* Develop components to support all Ogg codecs for OpenMAX IL , the media plugins used in Maemo , Android and LIMO mobile devices .
This touches on many interesting projects , and is perfect for anyone with an interest in mobile and embedded systems who wants a broad introduction to multimedia codecs .
* Write a JavaScript Library for Subtitles , Captions and other time - aligned text .
The main focus of this project is around enabling video accessibility for Ogg in Firefox .
The project requires a student with experience in JavaScript development , HTML and CSS , but also with some understanding of C for liboggplay and libkate , and of C++ for Firefox .
* Make a Proof of Concept for HTML5 Ogg Video support in the Chromium Browser , using liboggplay ( our Ogg Theora playback library , as used in Mozilla Firefox ) .
Full support for HTML5 < video > is a lot of work , but let 's get the ball rolling with a proof of concept for Theora frame decoding and rendering .
*
Add support for import and export of XSPF playlists to Songbird , the Mozilla - powered open music player .
This project requires good XML foo , the opportunity to work with cross-platform XUL and JavaScript , and perhaps some C++. Submissions
The student application period starts on Monday ( March 23 ) : http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/program/google/gsoc2009/timeline and runs for a little under 2 weeks , until Friday April 3 .
Details of our application process are at : http://wiki.xiph.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code_Applications
Interested students * must * get involved with the project development community , on project mailing lists and IRC , before the application deadline .
When selecting projects , preference will be given to students who have submitted at least one patch to a Xiph.org or Annodex .
net project before the application deadline .
Students will receive a grant from Google for successful work on their GSoC projects .
Hacking on free multimedia projects is fun and can have a big impact .
We need students who love to hack , to help put support for free codecs into more applications , browsers and networks .
When I start a new design project , part of my intake process is requesting that clients complete a project request form , even if we ’ve had phone conversations in advance .
I ’ve found that asking the client to spend some time thinking about the project and writing ( or typing ) down the specifics is a great exercise to flesh out the work , including what they want and do n’t want the site to accomplish .
The information becomes a tool to scope the project and create a project plan .
If the right information is provided , it can save time and resources throughout the entire project .
The challenge is making the form long enough to include all of the questions you want to ask , while avoiding making it so long that it ’s overwhelming .
The method of submission can facilitate this process , too .
I tend to tailor my request format in a way that suits each individual client and their preferences .
Some formats I use include a Microsoft Word form ( e- mailed , faxed or mailed back ) , an online form , copying and pasting the questions into an e-mail , and even verbally running down the list and writing their answers myself on occasion .
Here is some of the information I aim to gather from new clients :
Contact Information
Name
Company name
Mailing address
Phone number
E-mail address
Business Information
Year the business was established
How the business name was chosen
Nature of the business
Target audience
Main competitors
Any existing branding ( logo , colors , fonts )
Website Information
Domain name
Purpose of the site
What information they will provide
Style of design they like best
Desired functionality / special features
Other sites they like and why
Other
Budget
Timeline
Communication preference
Contact person
Additional services they may need
At the time they submit the form , I ask that they send me all of the information they have for the site : content , logo , photos , other graphics , marketing materials , hosting account information .
Usually , I get this information piecemeal , in forwarded e-mails , mailed hard copies , or various attachments , but I file and log everything I receive so it becomes a part of the client ’s files .
What ’s your process for gathering information for a design project and what do you consider the most important information to collect ?

A computer programmer who lost half his finger after his motorbike crashed into a deer has had the finger replaced with a USB drive .
Jerry Jalava , from Finland , says the two - gigabyte prosthetic finger is not permanently attached to his hand , allowing him to leave his finger in the computer slot and " pick it up after I 'm ready " .
The silicon prosthetic looks like a normal finger , but can be peeled back at the tip to reveal the USB drive .
Israel has repeatedly claimed that it had “ no choice ” but to wage war on Gaza on December 27 because Hamas had broken a ceasefire , was firing rockets at Israeli civilians , and had “ tried everything in order to avoid this military operation , ” as Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni put it .
This claim , however , is widely at odds with the fact that Israel ’s military and political leadership took many aggressive steps during the ceasefire that escalated a crisis with Hamas , and possibly even provoked Hamas to create a pretext for the assault .
This was n’t a war of “ no choice , ” but rather a very avoidable war in which Israeli actions played the major role in instigating .
Israel has a long history of deliberately using violence and other provocative measures to trigger reactions in order to create a pretext for military action , and to portray its opponents as the aggressors and Israel as the victim .
According to the respected Israeli military historian Zeev Maoz in his recent book , Defending the Holy Land , Israel most notably used this policy of “ strategic escalation ” in 1955 - 1956 , when it launched deadly raids on Egyptian army positions to provoke Egypt ’s President Nasser into violent reprisals preceding its ill - fated invasion of Egypt ; in 1981 - 1982 , when it launched violent raids on Lebanon in order to provoke Palestinian escalation preceding the Israeli invasion of Lebanon ; and between 2001 - 2004 , when Prime Minister Ariel Sharon repeatedly ordered assassinations of high - level Palestinian militants during declared ceasefires , provoking violent attacks that enabled Israel ’s virtual reoccupation of the West Bank .
Israel ’s current assault on Gaza bears many trademark elements of Israel ’s long history of employing “ strategic escalation ” to manufacture a major crisis , if not a war .
Making War ‘ Inevitable ’
The countdown to a war began , according to a detailed report by Barak Raviv in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz , when Israel ’s Defense Minister Ehud Barak started planning the current attack on Gaza with his chiefs of staff at least six months ago  even as Israel was negotiating the Egyptian brokered ceasefire with Hamas that went into effect on June 19 .
During the subsequent ceasefire , the report contends , the Israeli security establishment carefully gathered intelligence to map out Hamas ’ security infrastructure , engaged in operational deception , and spread disinformation to mislead the public about its intentions .
This revelation does n’t confirm that Israel intended to start a war with Hamas in December , but it does shed some light on why Israel continuously took steps that undermined the terms of the fragile ceasefire with Hamas , even though Hamas respected their side of the agreement .
Indeed , there was a genuine lull in rocket and mortar fire between June 19 and November 4 , due to Hamas compliance and only sporadically violated by a small number of launchings carried out by rival Fatah and Islamic Jihad militants , largely in defiance of Hamas .
According to the conservative Israeli - based Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center ’s analysis of rocket and missile attacks in 2008 , there were only three rockets fired at Israel in July , September , and October combined .
Israeli civilians living near Gaza experienced an almost unprecedented degree of security during this period , with no Israeli casualties .
Yet despite the major lull , Israel continually raided the West Bank , arresting and frequently killing “ wanted ” Palestinians from June to October , which had the inevitable effect of ratcheting up pressure on Hamas to respond .
Moreover , while the central expectation of Hamas going into the ceasefire was that Israel would lift the siege on Gaza , Israel only took the barest steps to ease the siege , which kept the people at a bare survival level .
This policy was a clear affront to Hamas , and had the inescapable effect of undermining both Hamas and popular Palestinian support for the ceasefire .
But Israel ’s most provocative action , acknowledged by many now as the critical turning point that undermined the ceasefire , took place on November 4 , when Israeli forces auspiciously violated the truce by crossing into the Gaza Strip to destroy what the army said was a tunnel dug by Hamas , killing six Hamas militants .
Sara Roy , writing in the London Review of Books , contends this attack was “ no doubt designed finally to undermine the truce between Israel and Hamas established last June . ”
The Israeli breach into Gaza was immediately followed by a further provocation by Israel on November 5 , when the Israeli government hermetically sealed off all ways into and out of Gaza .
As a result , the UN reports that the amount of imports entering Gaza has been “ severely reduced to an average of 16 truckloads per day  down from 123 truckloads per day in October and 475 trucks per day in May 2007  before the Hamas takeover . ”
These limited shipments provide only a fraction of the supplies needed to sustain 1.5 million starving Palestinians .
In response , Hamas predictably claimed that Israel had violated the truce and allowed Islamic Jihad to launch a round of rocket attacks on Israel .
Only after lethal Israeli reprisals killed over 10 Hamas gunmen in the following days did Hamas militants finally respond with volleys of mortars and rockets of their own .
In two short weeks , Israel killed over 15 Palestinian militants , while about 120 rockets and mortars were fired at Israel , and although there were no Israeli casualties the calm had been shattered .
It was at this time that Israeli officials launched what appears to have been a coordinated media blitz to cultivate public reception for an impending conflict , stressing the theme of the “ inevitability ” of a coming war with Hamas in Gaza .
On November 12 , senior IDF officials announced that war with Hamas was likely in the two months after the six - month ceasefire , baldly stating it would occur even if Hamas was n’t interested in confrontation .
A few days later , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert publicly ordered his military commanders to draw up plans for a war in Gaza , which were already well developed at the time .
On November 19 , according to Raviv ’s report in Haaretz , the Gaza war plan was brought before Barak for final approval .
While the rhetoric of an “ inevitable ” war with Hamas may have only been Israeli bluster to compel Hamas into line , its actions on the ground in the critical month leading up to the official expiration of the ceasefire on December 19 only heightened the cycle of violence , leaving a distinct impression Israel had cast the die for war .
Finally , Hamas then walked right into the “ inevitable war ” that Israel had been preparing since the ceasefire had gone into effect in June .
With many Palestinians believing the ceasefire to be meaningless , Hamas announced it would n’t renew the ceasefire after it expired on December 19 .
Hamas then stood back for two days while Islamic Jihad and Al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigades militants fired volleys of mortars and rockets into Israel , in the context of mutually escalating attacks .
Yet even then , with Israeli threats of war mounting , Hamas imposed a 24 - hour ceasefire on all missile attacks on December 21 , announcing it would consider renewing the lapsed truce with Israel in the Gaza Strip if Israel would halt its raids in both Gaza and the West Bank , and keep Gaza border crossings open for supplies of aid and fuel .
Israel immediately rejected its offer .
But when the Israel Defense Forces killed three Hamas militants laying explosives near the security fence between Israel and Gaza on the evening of December 23 , the Hamas military wing lashed out by launching a barrage of over 80 missiles into Israel the following day , claiming it was Israel , and not Hamas , that was responsible for the escalation .
Little did they know that , according to Raviv , Prime Minister Olmert , and Defense Minister Barak had already met on December 18 to approve the impending war plan , but put the mission off waiting for a better pretext .
By launching more than 170 rockets and mortars at Israeli civilians in the days following December 23 , killing one Israeli civilian , Hamas had provided reason enough for Israel to unleash its long - planned attack on Gaza on December 27 .
The Rationale for War
If Israel ’s goal were simply to end rocket attacks on its civilians , it would have solidified and extended the ceasefire , which was working well , until November .
Even after November , it could have addressed Hamas ’ longstanding ceasefire proposals for a complete end to rocket - fire on Israel , in exchange for Israel lifting its crippling 18 - month siege on Gaza .
Instead , the actual targets of its assault on Gaza after December 27 , which included police stations , mosques , universities , and Hamas government institutions , clearly reveal that Israel ’s primary goals go far beyond providing immediate security for its citizens .
Israeli spokespersons repeatedly claim that Israel ’s assault is n’t about seeking to effect regime change with Hamas , but rather about creating a “ new security reality ” in Gaza .
But that “ new reality ” requires Israel to use massive violence to degrade the political and military capacity of Hamas , to a point where it agrees to a ceasefire with conditions more congenial to Israel .
Short of a complete reoccupation of Gaza , no amount of violence will erase Hamas from the scene .
Confirming the steps needed to create the “ new reality , ” the broader reasons why Israel chose a major confrontation with Hamas at this time appear to be the cause of several other factors unrelated to providing immediate security for its citizens .
First , many senior Israeli political and military leaders strongly opposed the June 19 ceasefire with Hamas , and looked for opportunities to reestablish Israel ’s fabled “ deterrent capability ” of instilling fear into its enemies .
These leaders felt Israel ’s deterrent capability was badly damaged as a result of their withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 , and especially after the widely criticized failures in the 2006 Israeli war with Hezbollah .
For this powerful group a ceasefire was at best a tactical pause before the inevitable renewal of conflict , when conditions were more favorable .
Immediately following Israel ’s aerial assault , a New York Times article noted that Israel had been eager “ to remind its foes that it has teeth ” and to erase the ghost of Lebanon that has haunted it over the past two years .
A second factor was pressure surrounding the impending elections set to take place in early February .
The ruling coalition , led by Barak and Livni , have been repeatedly criticized by the Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu , the former prime minister , who is leading in the polls , for not being tough enough on Hamas and rocket - fire from Gaza .
This gave the ruling coalition a strong incentive to demonstrate to the Israeli people their security credentials in order to bolster their chances against the more hawkish Likud .
Third , Hamas repeatedly said it would n’t recognize Mahmud Abbas as president of the Palestinian Authority after his term runs out on January 9 .
The looming political standoff on the Palestinian side threatens to boost Hamas and undermine Abbas , who had underseen closer security coordination with Israel and was congenial to Israeli demands for concessions on future peace proposals .
One possible outcome of this assault is that Abbas will remain in power for a while longer , since Hamas will be unable to mobilize its supporters in order to force him to resign .
And finally , Israel was pressed to take action now due to its sense of the American political timeline .
The Bush administration rarely exerted constraint on Israel and would certainly stand by in its waning days , while Barack Obama would not likely want to begin his presidency with a major confrontation with Israel .
The Washington Post quoted a Bush administration official saying that Israel struck in Gaza “ because they want it to be over before the next administration comes in .
They ca n’t predict how the next administration will handle it .
And this is not the way they want to start with the new administration . ”
An Uncertain Ending
As the conflict rages to an uncertain end , it ’s important to consider Israeli military historian Zeev Maoz ’s contention that Israel ’s history of manufacturing wars through “ strategic escalation ” and using overwhelming force to achieve “ deterrence ” has never been successful .
In fact , it ’s the primary cause of Israel ’s insecurity because it deepens hatred and a desire for revenge rather than fear .
At the same time , there ’s no question Hamas continues to callously sacrifice its fellow Palestinian citizens , as well as Israeli civilians , on the altar of maintaining its pyrrhic resistance credentials and its myopic preoccupation with revenge , and fell into many self - made traps of its own .
There had been growing international pressure on Israel to ease its siege and a major increase in creative and nonviolent strategies drawing attention to the plight of Palestinians such as the arrival of humanitarian relief convoys off of Gaza ’s coast in the past months , but now Gaza lies in ruins .
But as the vastly more powerful actor holding nearly all the cards in this conflict , the war in Gaza was ultimately Israel ’s choice .
And for all this bloodshed and violence , Israel must be held accountable .
With the American political establishment firmly behind Israel ’s attack , and Obama ’s foreign policy team heavily weighted with pro-Israel insiders like Dennis Ross and Hillary Clinton , any efforts to hold Israel accountable in the United States will depend upon American citizens mobilizing a major grassroots effort behind a new foreign policy that will not tolerate any violations of international law , including those by Israel , and will immediately work towards ending Israel ’s siege of Gaza and ending Israel ’s occupation .
Beyond that , the most promising prospect for holding Israel accountable is through the increasing use of universal jurisdiction for prosecuting war crimes , along with the growing transnational movement calling for sanctions on Israel until it ends its violations of international law .
In what would be truly be a new style of foreign policy , a transnational network that focuses on Israeli violations of international law , rather than the state itself , could become a counterweight that forces policymakers in the United States , Europe , and Israel to reconsider their political and moral complicity in the current war , in favor of taking real steps towards peace and security in the region for all peoples .

The following can be attributed to Matt Coles , Director of the ACLU Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Project :
“ It is terrific that the Obama administration is joining the United Nations ’ resolution calling for an end to laws that make physical intimacy between same - sex couples a crime , and we are hopeful the U.S. will commit to taking a leadership role in ending discrimination against gay , lesbian and transgender people around the world .
Many of these laws are no technicality .
They are used to put people in prison and sometimes result in people being executed .
" That the Bush administration refused to endorse the resolution is pretty unbelievable considering the U.S. Supreme Court said it was unconstitutional to criminalize physical intimacy between consenting adults back in 2003 .
" We welcome the decision to join this important declaration , and we urge the United States to match its action on human rights abroad with bold commitment to respect and promote human rights at home .
We can begin putting an end to discrimination against lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people by , as the president has proposed , banning job discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity and by repealing the section of the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) that denies federal protections to those same - sex couples who have legally married . ”

Puzzle Languages
I know I 've covered this before .
I am repeating myself .
But it was woven into various other topics , never stated outright :
Some programming languages , especially among those which have n't gained great popularity , are puzzles .
That 's not to be confused with " programming in general is a puzzle . "
There 's always a certain amount of thought that goes into understanding a problem and deciding upon an approach to solving it .
But if it takes focused thought to phrase that solution into working code , you go down one path then back up , then give up , then try something completely different -- then you 're almost certainly using a puzzle language .
These are puzzle languages :
Haskell Erlang Forth J
And these are not :
Python Ruby Lua C
In Forth , the puzzle is how to simplify a problem so that it can be mapped cleanly to the stack .
In Haskell and Erlang , the puzzle is how to manage with single assignment and without being able to reach up and out of the current environment .
In J the puzzle is how to phrase code so that it operates on large chunks of data at once .
Compare this to , say , Python .
I can usually bang out a solution to just about anything in Python .
I update locals and add globals and modify arrays and get working code .
Then I go back and clean it up and usually end up with something simpler .
In Erlang , as much as I want to deny it , I usually pick a direction , then realize I 'm digging myself into a hole , so I scrap it and start over , and sometimes when I end up with a working solution it feels too fragile , something that would n't survive minor changes in the problem description .
( Clearly this does n't apply to easy algorithms or simple transformations of data . )
A critical element of puzzle languages is providing an escape , a way to admit that the pretty solution is elusive , and it 's time to get working code regardless of aesthetics .
It 's interesting that these escapes tend to have a stigma ; they induce a feeling of doing something wrong ; they 're guaranteed to result in pedantic lecturing if mentioned in a forum .
In Forth , an easy pressure value when the stack gets too busy is to use local variables .
Local variables have been historically deemed unclean by a large segment of the Forth community ( although it 's amazing how easy some Forth problems are if you use locals ) .
There 's a peculiar angst involved in avoiding locals , even if they clearly make code simpler .
Locals aside , there 's always the escape of using some additional global variables instead of stack juggling , which has a similarly bad reputation ( even though everyone still does it ) .
In Erlang , ETS tables and the process dictionary are two obvious escapes .
And as expected , any mention of the process dictionary always includes the standard parental warning about the dangers of playing darts or standing there with the refrigerator door open .
It is handy , as shown by the standard library random number generator ( which stores a three element tuple under the name random_seed ) , and Wings3D ( which uses the process dictionary to keep track of GUI state ) .
A more interesting escape in Erlang is the process .
A process is commonly thought of as a mechanism of concurrency , but that need not be the case .
It 's easy to make an infinite loop by having a tail recursive function .
Parameters in such a loop can be -- if you dig into the implementation a bit -- directly modified , providing a safe and interesting blurring of functional and imperative code .
Imagine taking such a function and spawning it into its own process .
Each process captures a bit of relevant data in a small , endlessly recursive loop .
Imagine dozens or hundreds of these processes , each spinning away , holding onto important state data .
Erlang string theory , if you will .
I would n't want to break a program into hundreds of processes simply to capture state , but usually there are some important bits which are used and updated across a project .
Pulling these out of the purely functional world can be enough of a relief from growing complexity that the rest of the code can remain pure .
But there 's still that stigma of doing something dirty .
Back before the Norton name became associated with anti-virus products , when MS - DOS was ubiquitous , Peter Norton authored the standard book on programming IBM PCs .
In a discussion of the MS - DOS interrupts for displaying characters and moving the cursor , he strongly advised that programmers not access video memory directly , but use the provided services instead .
( The theory being that the MS - DOS interrupts would remain compatible on future hardware . )
Of course almost every application and game would not have been possible had developers taken Peter 's advice to heart .
Learning to write directly to video memory was practically a cottage industry until Windows 95 finally ended the MS - DOS era .
Sometimes advice is too idealistic to follow .

" Most of the Universe is filled with fluids of one kind or another , " says Jerry Gollub , a Professor of Physics at Haverford College with a special interest in fluid dynamics .
" They are important in astrophysics , they are important in engineering , in medicine and health , in chemistry , geophysics , basically in all the sciences .
Fluid motion underlies natural phenomena both large and small , and there are many applications that affect society . "
The Universe is filled with fluids .
People have long been fascinated by fluids .
The ability of water to be so many different things — yielding but strong , embracing but free , serene , chaotic , or even angry — has inspired poets as well as scientists throughout history , and the scientific study of fluids can be traced back to Archimedes , and possibly further .
Today scientists study all kinds of fluids , including gases , grainy fluids , sticky fluids and elastic ones .
Applications range from the use of microfluids in nanotechnology , to understanding the flow of blood , the formation of tears in our eyes , aerodynamics , predicting weather patterns , or understanding the behaviour of gas clouds in outer space .
Questions on the nature of fluid flow abound .
" Fluid dynamics is not dominated by a few special questions in the way that , for example , the physics of elementary particles might be , " says Gollub .
" In fluid dynamics there is tremendous diversity . "
But while much research in fluid dynamics is driven by applications , there are also fundamental questions that need to be answered .
Even the most fundamental question of them all — how to best describe the flow of fluids mathematically — still has n't been answered in full generality .
It 's all very well when a fluid flows smoothly down a channel , but how do you cope with the chaotic or even turbulent flow of , say , a raging mountain stream ?
It is in this area of chaotic flows that Gollub and his collaborator Nicholas Ouellette , now at Yale University , have made an interesting , possibly very significant , discovery , by combining experimental results with sophisticated mathematics .
Traditional approaches
To set the scene , let 's first look at the traditional mathematical approach to fluid flow .
Imagine you have a fluid moving around in a container and you want to describe its motion over a period of time .
The most important descriptor of this motion is the velocity of the fluid at each point in space and at each point in time .
Velocity is a vector ; its direction indicates the direction of the fluid flow and its magnitude the fluid 's speed .
Since space and time are continuous , a full description would entail an infinite number of vectors , one for each location and instant .
A function , which allocates a velocity vector to each point in space and instant in time is called a velocity field .
Figure 1 : A snap - shot of a two - dimensional fluid with some of the velocity vectors shown .
Blue and red indicate clockwise and counter - clockwise rotation .
Fixed magnets and electric currents are used to drive the flow .
In some cases it is possible to derive the velocity field from the Navier - Stokes equations of fluid motion , which were established in the early nineteenth century by the physicists Claude - Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes .
Their equations are based on the laws of conservation of mass and momentum , and relate the changes of velocity at different locations and instants .
Since the equations involve rates of change , they are phrased in terms of derivatives , and are therefore known as partial differential equations .
The solutions of this set of equations for given conditions , if you are able to find them , are precisely the possible functions .
This is the theory , but in practice things are n't that simple .
Partial differential equations have a habit of being hard to solve , especially if they are nonlinear , and the Navier - Stokes equations are no exception .
In some simple situations it is possible to obtain analytical solutions — solutions that can be written down explicitly — but in many physically interesting situations , for example in turbulent flows , analytical solutions are beyond reach .
What 's more , no - one knows if physically meaningful solutions even exist for the general case of a three - dimensional incompressible fluid .
In fact , proving the existence or non-existence of general solutions to the Navier - Stokes equations is one of the most important open problems in mathematics ; whoever solves it is set to win $ 1 m from the Clay Mathematics Institute .
New ideas
This might seem worrying seeing that so many products of modern engineering , including aeroplanes , are based on fluid dynamics .
However , for practical purposes , scientists and engineers use theoretical methods , computer simulations or experimental data to approximate the velocity field at a large number of individual points in time and space .
The numerical method works well , but requires an immense amount of computing power .
" Suppose you wanted to describe the motion of fluid in a box that 's 10 cm across in each direction , " says Gollub .
" Maybe you 'd like to know the velocity at spacings of 1 mm .
So on each axis you have to give 100 numbers .
You have three axes , so altogether you have to specify 1 million numbers at each instant in time .
You might be able to do this , but then what do you do with all that data ?
You 'd really have great difficulty to test theoretical ideas , it 's just too much information . "
The large number of variables can become difficult even for fast computers to deal with , and what 's more , the brute - force numerical approach is n't exactly elegant .
Surely there must be better ways of describing fluid flows ?
Gollub believes in the power of experiment to reveal hidden patterns , and it was through experiment that he and Ouellette came up with their new discovery .
Describing turbulence is something of a holy grail in fluid dynamics , and as a sort of precursor to turbulence , Ouellette and Gollub have addressed the problem of spatiotemporal chaos .
Flows that exhibit spatiotemporal chaos are disorderly in space and also unpredictable in time , so that knowledge of the present state of the fluid will not make the next instant predictable .
Instead , our ability to predict the future becomes progressively inaccurate as time passes .
In fact , the uncertainty increases exponentially with time .
This behaviour is complex , but not quite as wild as " strong turbulence " , where motion on many scales ( vortices of all sizes ) occurs simultaneously .
" We have been interested in studying flows that consist of a collection of vortices , or circulating areas , " says Gollub .
Such flows can exhibit spatiotemporal chaos .
" How do you describe such a flow ?
Do you really need to use the full velocity field , as has been traditional , or can you get by with something simpler ? "
Figure 2 : In this image , obtained experimentally by Ouellette and Gollub , the vortices form a regular array and do not fluctuate .
In their experiment Ouellette and Gollub considered a thin layer of a conducting fluid , where most of the fluid activity would occur in a horizontal plane .
To track the flow , they released thousands of fluorescent polystyrene tracer particles into the fluid .
They then set the fluid in motion using magnets and electric currents , which created a pattern of vortices .
By changing the electric currents , they were able to control the complexity of the flow : for a small driving current , the vortices stay in fixed locations ( see figure 2 ) , while for a larger current , they break free and move around unpredictably .
This latter scenario is a chaotic state .
" Over time , the vortices arrange and rearrange themselves in an irregular way .
The pattern looks different in ten seconds from what it looks like now , and it never seems to repeat itself . "

Figure 3 : Here the vortices have broken free from the regular lattice of driving forces , and evolve unpredictably in the state of spatiotemporal chaos .
Rather than describing this complex motion by measuring the velocity at a great number of points over time , Ouellette and Gollub decided to look for geometric features that characterise the whole flow .
They were interested in two sets of special points : those that lie at the centre of vortices , known as elliptic points , and those towards which the flow converges along one direction , but from which it diverges along another direction .
These are known as hyperbolic points , or saddle points ( see figure 4 ) .
Elliptic points have the flow whirling around them , while hyperbolic points arise , for example , at a point where four vortices meet , with each neighbouring pair of vortices turning in different directions .
These types of points tell you , at a given point in time , where vortices are centred , and where the domain of one vortex ends and another starts — very important information in a flow that is dominated by vortices .
Could this information be enough to characterise the whole flow ?
Figure 4 : The flow of the fluid close to elliptic and hyperbolic points .
The idea was a good one , but there was a problem : how do you locate the special points ?
One possibility is to look for points of zero velocity , but this is hard to do accurately .
But Ouellette had an ingenious idea .
He noted that near elliptic points , tracer particles circulate in very small circles , and near hyperbolic points , they turn sharp corners .
In both cases , the trajectories of particles exhibit very high curvature .
Using ideas from differential geometry , Ouellette came up with a reliable way of locating the special points by measuring the curvature of the tracer particles ' trajectories .
Creation and destruction
Figure 5 : The fluid flow with the special points marked by circles ( elliptic points ) and crosses ( hyperbolic points ) .
Once they had located the special points , Ouellette and Gollub tracked their behaviour over time , and found some amazing patterns .
" The most interesting phenomenon is that the special points can be born , or die , always in pairs containing one of each type " Gollub explains .
" You can have a hyperbolic and an elliptic point that annihilate each other , leaving no special feature in that region .
You can also have the opposite , where a hyperbolic and an elliptic point are born together .
It 's very striking . "
( Click on figure 5 to see a movie of this behaviour . )
Striking it may be , but does it tell us anything useful about the system ?
Ouellette and Gollub forced the system using varying driving currents and measured the frequency of births and deaths for each forcing strength .
They found an interesting correlation : " The rate at which births and deaths occur turns out to be an excellent measure of the strength of the chaos in the flow , " says Gollub .
The typical speed of a flow can be measured by a quantity called the Reynolds number ( see Plus article The Buzz of the bumblebees for more information ) , and Ouellette and Gollub found that the rate of births and deaths rate grows linearly with the Reynolds number once a critical value is passed .
" Furthermore , the rate correlates well with other measures of the strength of spatiotemporal chaos . "
In other words , the birth or death rate is a characteristic feature of the state of spatiotemporal chaos .
The elliptic and hyperbolic points also seem to shed light on another important question concerning fluid flow : whether chaos sets in suddenly , or develops gradually .
Ouellette and Gollub were able to pinpoint the critical Reynolds number at which births and deaths , and therefore spatiotemporal chaos , start to occur .
" At slightly lower Reynolds numbers the fluid may be weakly time - dependent , and weakly unpredictable , but the patterns vary only slightly from the regular checker board , " says Gollub .
" Since the onset of spatiotemporal chaos is basically the onset of strong unpredictability , it is an important point in any effort to understand the distinction between different states of a fluid . "
Figure 6 : The paths traced out by elliptic and hyperbolic points in a chaotic flow .
Can their trajectories be described mathematically ?
Gollub and Ouellette 's results are an interesting marriage of experiment and sophisticated mathematical ideas , and they are a promising first step in a very interesting direction : describing a vastly complex physical scenario by a comparatively small number of geometric features .
But there 's much to do yet : " We have n't been able yet to express our results in a simple mathematical way .
For example , over time our special points are wandering around in space making a complicated tangle of paths [ see figure 6 ] .
We would like to be able to express the dynamics of the fluids in terms of equations that describe these trajectories , at least statistically .
This is a goal we have not achieved yet , and we do n't even know if it 's possible to do this . "
The prospect of being able to replace the classical Navier - Stokes equations of fluid motion by a set of simpler equations describing the behaviour of geometric features will excite many fluid dynamicists .
So is Ouellette and Gollub 's discovery something of a revolution ?
Gollub restricts himself to calling it a " worthwhile path for future study .
We usually are very poor at predicting the significance of scientific or mathematical advances .
I have no idea whether our work will prove to be important .
And that 's not a motivation for doing this kind of work .
We do it because it is interesting and there is something of physical beauty in the shapes and forms we are studying and in the connection between physical phenomena and mathematics .
Whether it turns out to be useful is something we can hope for , but not expect . "

ZURICH / GENEVA ( Reuters ) - Shares in UBS hit record lows on Friday as Swiss bank stocks reeled on concern a widening U.S. tax probe will weaken strict privacy rules that underpin Switzerland ’s wealth management industry .
UBS , the world ’s biggest banker to the rich , led the fall in Swiss bank shares .
It was down 12.5 percent at 10:14 a.m. EDT after hitting a fresh all - time low at 10.54 Swiss francs .
Shares in rivals Credit Suisse and Julius Baer , both large players in the private banking industry which has thrived thanks to Swiss bank privacy laws , were down 9 and 10 percent respectively .
Swiss banks were underperforming a fall in the DJ Stoxx index of European banks , which was down 5.4 percent .
Bank worries also hit the Swiss franc , down almost 1 percent against the dollar and 0.6 percent against the euro .
Crisis - hit UBS late on Wednesday settled U.S. criminal charges that it had helped rich Americans to dodge taxes .
But U.S. tax authorities said on Thursday they were still pursuing a civil lawsuit seeking to access details of 52,000 UBS clients .
“ It is very unfair to see that the whole profession has been dragged through the mud , ” Ivan Pictet , senior managing partner and scion of one of Switzerland ’s largest private banks , said in an interview with the Geneva daily Le Temps .
“ The reputation of the whole ( Swiss ) financial center has been tarnished by the fault of a single banking institution , ” he said .
“ It is a very annoying precedent for Switzerland . ”
Despite tough Swiss laws protecting bank clients , the government said on Thursday it had no choice but to let UBS hand over data to avoid U.S. criminal charges which could have threatened the bank ’s existence and hurt the Swiss economy , heavily dependent on the banking industry .
“ The Swiss made a mistake , they believed that in caving in ... that things would come to an end , ” Douglas Hornung , a Geneva lawyer who represents American clients of UBS who are under U.S. investigation , told Reuters .
“ They have now discovered with shock that it continues and the whole Swiss financial center is in danger . ”
UBS agreed on Wednesday to pay a fine of $ 780 million and to disclose about 250 names of U.S. clients it said had committed tax fraud .
But U.S. tax authorities now want thousands more names of its citizens it says are hiding about $ 14.8 billion in assets in secret Swiss bank accounts .
PRESSURE MOUNTS
Nearly a third of the wealth that is stashed in tax havens around the world is in Swiss banks -- an estimated $ 2.2 trillion -- making the Alpine state the world ’s biggest offshore center .
Other havens include Liechtenstein , Bermuda and Singapore .

Tax - dodging schemes are increasingly under attack by governments scrambling to find revenue needed to finance the soaring costs of government stimulus programs .
John Christensen , director of the Tax Justice Network which campaigns against bank secrecy , said he also saw a dramatic shift in public opinion against tax havens .
“ It is clear to many that the game is over , the game pretending this is a minor issue , ” he said .
“ Wealth management has become an euphemism for tax evasion . ”
The issue will be on the agenda at a meeting of European leaders in Berlin at the weekend to prepare for the April G20 summit on reforming global financial rules .
The German government said on Friday it had taken note of the UBS settlement and said it will continue to push for the implementation of international standards on tax evasion .
Germany , which paid an informant last year to obtain names of German clients hiding funds in LGT bank of Liechtenstein , is now investigating Prince Max of Liechtenstein for possible tax evasion , the Financial Times Deutschland reported on Friday .
LGT said in a statement that Prince Max , the bank ’s CEO who lives in Munich and is the second son of current ruler Hans Adam II , had complied with Germany tax rules and was cooperating with authorities in the investigation .
Switzerland ’s European Union neighbors are also watching the development of the UBS case and are hoping that cooperation with the U.S. authorities will set a precedent .
“ I would expect that similar requests from EU member states would by no means be treated differently , ” said a spokeswoman for EU Tax Commissioner Laszlo Kovacs .
Kenneth Farrugia , General Manager of Valetta Fund Services in Malta which caters for onshore and offshore clients , said the U.S. investigation had ramifications far beyond UBS .
“ UBS is not reliant on investors from the U.S. , or even on private banking .
The stability of UBS is not in question , ” he said .
“ The question is how will this affect U.S. customers of other Swiss banks ? ”
UBS shares had rallied on Thursday on hopes the settlement would end uncertainties hanging over the company , which has written down more toxic assets than any other European bank during the credit crisis , prompting clients to loose confidence and withdraw billions of dollars .
Every website owner who depends on an income from their site relies on internet traffic .
I have n’t met one who was convinced they could make sales without someone dropping by to buy something .
That includes whether they were attracted or sent .
Pull or Push marketing in academia .
I ’ve set out a few tips for you to research so you can improve your traffic .
I could give you a pitch and use words like incredible , fantastic , massive but I ’m hoping you ’re above that .
One more thing – it ’s important to research these things so you end up knowing how they work .
That , believe it not puts you in a position to improve on the original formula or knowledge so that it becomes even more effective .
Ponder on that last sentence and maybe even read it again .
It has enough gravity to make the difference of surviving online or being successful .
It ’s what you put in .
Here we go .
1 . Work out whether you want to pay for your traffic ( ie. adwords … ) or attract traffic via SEO and similar means .
I for one do n’t have any problem with either .
My preference is to use SEO techniques because I despise having to monitor and adjust my bidding on adwords every time there ’s some kind of adjustment or amendment to search engine policy .
Set price advertising on high traffic sites is often a better way to go .
There are textlink sites and there are straight up affiliate program sites .
I ’ve mentioned these because you know how much you ’re up for at the outset .
You ’re not left juggling your ads because the bidding war has started again and your budget and strategy have just been blown away with fixed price advertising .
There are some rules to follow if you want to use adwords effectively and there are some people who show signs of near brilliance when it comes to adwords techniques .
However , even they admit to frustration when Google or another engine alters it ’s acceptance policies or bidding skyrockets for adwords or a similar advertising venue .
So in essence , think about the adwords ball and chain phenomena , fixed rate advertising and PULL marketing .
2 . Let ’s discuss SEO as an alternative .
This is generally a lot longer and harder to accomplish .
Many would argue this but if they thought about the time and persistence it took to get the knowledge they now use , they would inevitably agree that SEO is longer and harder .
There are rules here too .
a) Make sure the sites or pages you are about to work on are worthwhile .
Not many do this .
In fact , if you think on it , you may have rushed in once or twice .
You ’ll be understandibly upset if you go to great lengths to promote something using SEO only to find the affiliate product / service is poor in quality or your own product is faulty or similar .
b ) This means ;
– making sure there is a reasonably good market
– check the product for quality if it ’s an affiliate
– how long will it last ?
No point doing SEO on an item with a short life span
– check the competitive landscape ( ie. weight loss , insurance etc. are tough )
3 . Despite the whiners , there IS such a thing as ‘ set it and forget it ’ at least for lengthy periods at any rate .
The fundamental secret for success with this strategy is to do everything correctly the first time .
It DOES take longer ( days not years ) .
However , you get better results from the search engines .
Complaints are kept to a minimum .
You can act quickly when you are organised and everything is where it should be and … you make more sales with less refunds .
Does n’t that sound like something more satisfying than ‘ putting out fires ’ all the time and wondering whether your site will still be in the same SERPs this time tomorrow ?
If it took three days or even a week to do everything right instead of 4 hours with lot ’s of errors and bans and angry customers reporting you to the powers that be …would n’t that be a business to be proud of and keep you in the lifestyle you ’re no doubt seeking ?
It makes sense does n’t it ?!
To do this you ’ll need a plan and some guidance .
There ’s one guy who pulls this stuff off all the time and he does it well .
I ’ve included a review of him and some history so you can see just what he ’s capable of and this way , you can do the same .
You have probably already heard of him .
His name is John Reese and he is responsible for immense levels of traffic to many sites ( someone who ’s done it ) using a combination of the above to achieve HIGH levels of website traffic .
The opposite of hard raving .
Often practised after long nights raving or by those abstaining from pro-raving , involves a degree of hypothetical theorizing and continual self questioning ( " what " is a common chill - raver salutation ) .
Chill raves are non venue specific and occur in numerous locations including private houses , outdoors , fruit markets and often illegal laundrettes .
Music is another feature of the culture ranging from chill to rave , without ever really raving , but always chill raving .

This is a new generation of youth : a generation that grew up witnessing gross violations of US civil liberties , under the shadow of the Patriot Act .
They grew up watching Iraq and Afghanistan being destroyed by US military weapons ; they saw citizens of countries of their ancestors tortured and humiliated .
They have not forgotten Israel ’s unjustified attack on Lebanon only two years ago .
Many youth have profound attachments to the lands that their parents or great - grandparents came from , and where many still have family .
“ We were very young when [ the 11 September 2001 attacks ] happened .
We grew up under Bush ’s presidency and witnessed our community being marginalized .
We were often questioned about our religion and culture .
This brought many of us closer and we started organizing awareness events on campus , ” said Billal Asghar , a senior global studies and health science major at San Jose State University .
The Arab and Muslim communities were largely quiet the first few years after the 11 September 2001 attacks .
Some stayed away from political activism and limited their social activities to the mosque .
A conscious decision was made to focus on Islam and Muslim issues within the US and stay away from speaking up against the atrocities being committed in countries where their family roots are .
Today Arab and Muslim youth in the US are increasingly visible as they stand up against injustice .
A 22 - year - old University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) student , Yasmine Alkhatib ’s family migrated from Iraq when she was five .
She organized Palestinian events to mark the 60th anniversary of the Nakba , the dispossession of the Palestinian homeland in 1947 - 48 , last year .
“ Growing up in America , which preaches virtue and justice , I always felt that I could express my views and opinions about the way the world works , ” she said .
“ When we see war crimes being committed by Israel on women and children or our rights being vandalized in the United States , we feel incensed and consider it our duty to fight against it , ” she continued .
Karimah Al - Helew , a student leader at San Jose State University and one of the organizers of the protests in San Jose , has traveled to the West Bank four times .
“ I know what it means to live under an illegal occupation .
I can see that my tax dollars are going to support the poverty that has suffocated my family there , ” she said .
Her father , who passed away a year ago , is Palestinian .
Her mother is from Cuba .
Speaking in Spanish at an immigrant rights rally in San Jose last month she said , “ I am not speaking as a Palestinian or Cuban or American , I am speaking as a human being ; you only have to be human to understand what is just . ”
Raunaq Khodaai , who was born in India and is a mathematics major at Mission College Santa Clara said that a class on Modern History of Europe a year ago motivated her to become politically active .
“ As I started reading more I felt that the Palestinians have been suffering for the longest time post - World War II , ” she said .
The unbalanced reporting by the mainstream media on the Iraq war and Israel - Palestine has lead to new , innovative ways of information gathering for the youth .
Their sources of information are alternative media like Democracy Now ! , YouTube or blogs , as well as social networking applications like instant messaging and Facebook .
“ We are web savvy and like to search for other perspectives online , ” said Khodaai .
At a time when Israel banned the media from entering Gaza , these channels of communication were used effectively to broadcast the personal horror stories and images coming out of Gaza .
“ Facebook became a news stand when the war broke out .
The quickest way to get the word out for a rally would be to simply change your [ Facebook ] status , ” said Al - Helew .
In California ’s Bay Area , some of these students joined hands with African Americans to protest against the shooting of Oscar Grant , an unarmed black youth , by a police officer in Oakland .
“ The struggle for justice and equal rights in occupied Palestine is no different from what the African Americans struggled for in this country , ” said Laila Khatib , a 2008 San Francisco State University graduate .
“ Racism witnessed against Arabs throughout the recent election campaign is still fresh in my mind , ” she added .
Arab and Muslim youth have become more and more organized during the past couple of years .
They realize that to become part of the “ American story ” it is important to participate in the local community and be involved in the political process .
Their struggles for civil liberties and justice are their “ American story . ”
Their participation in electing the first African American president of the US has given them new hope .
Arab and Muslim student groups mobilized youth to register and vote .
“ After seeing the election results of 2004 , we wanted to make sure Republicans do not win this time , ” said Asghar .
“ There is new excitement about bringing change bottom - up .
The wars in Iraq , Afghanistan and Palestine have invoked a lot of passion and energy as well as dismay at US foreign policy .
People are tired of these wars and can see what they have done to our economy , ” added Asghar .
Yasmin Qureshi is a Bay Area , California activist involved in South Asian and Palestinian issues .
She is a member of The Free Gaza Movement , South Bay Mobilization and Friends of South Asia .
She was one of the organizers of the Mumbai peace vigil in San Francisco and worked closely with youth to organize protests in San Jose against the Gaza attacks .

“ The primary near - term security concern of the United States is the global economic crisis and its geopolitical implications , ” Blair told the Senate .
“ The crisis has been ongoing for over a year , and economists are divided over whether and when we could hit bottom .
Some even fear that the recession could further deepen and reach the level of the Great Depression .
Of course , all of us recall the dramatic political consequences wrought by the economic turmoil of the 1920s and 1930s in Europe , the instability , and high levels of violent extremism . ”
The specter of social unrest was raised at the U.S. Army War College in November in a monograph [ click on Policypointers ’ pdf link to see the report ] titled “ Known Unknowns : Unconventional ‘ Strategic Shocks ’ in Defense Strategy Development . ”
The military must be prepared , the document warned , for a “ violent , strategic dislocation inside the United States , ” which could be provoked by “ unforeseen economic collapse , ” “ purposeful domestic resistance , ” “ pervasive public health emergencies ” or “ loss of functioning political and legal order . ”
The “ widespread civil violence , ” the document said , “ would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis to defend basic domestic order and human security . ”
“ An American government and defense establishment lulled into complacency by a long - secure domestic order would be forced to rapidly divest some or most external security commitments in order to address rapidly expanding human insecurity at home , ” it went on .
“ Under the most extreme circumstances , this might include use of military force against hostile groups inside the United States .
Further , DoD [ the Department of Defense ] would be , by necessity , an essential enabling hub for the continuity of political authority in a multi-state or nationwide civil conflict or disturbance , ” the document read .
In plain English , something bureaucrats and the military seem incapable of employing , this translates into the imposition of martial law and a de facto government being run out of the Department of Defense .
They are considering it .
So should you .

Blair warned the Senate that “ roughly a quarter of the countries in the world have already experienced low - level instability such as government changes because of the current slowdown . ”
He noted that the “ bulk of anti-state demonstrations ” internationally have been seen in Europe and the former Soviet Union , but this did not mean they could not spread to the United States .
He told the senators that the collapse of the global financial system is “ likely to produce a wave of economic crises in emerging market nations over the next year . ”
He added that “ much of Latin America , former Soviet Union states and sub-Saharan Africa lack sufficient cash reserves , access to international aid or credit , or other coping mechanism . ”
“ When those growth rates go down , my gut tells me that there are going to be problems coming out of that , and we ’re looking for that , ” he said .
He referred to “ statistical modeling ” showing that “ economic crises increase the risk of regime - threatening instability if they persist over a one to two year period . ”
Blair articulated the newest narrative of fear .
As the economic unraveling accelerates we will be told it is not the bearded Islamic extremists , although those in power will drag them out of the Halloween closet when they need to give us an exotic shock , but instead the domestic riffraff , environmentalists , anarchists , unions and enraged members of our dispossessed working class who threaten us .
Crime , as it always does in times of turmoil , will grow .
Those who oppose the iron fist of the state security apparatus will be lumped together in slick , corporate news reports with the growing criminal underclass .
The committee ’s Republican vice chairman , Sen. Christopher Bond of Missouri , not quite knowing what to make of Blair ’s testimony , said he was concerned that Blair was making the “ conditions in the country ” and the global economic crisis “ the primary focus of the intelligence community . ”
The economic collapse has exposed the stupidity of our collective faith in a free market and the absurdity of an economy based on the goals of endless growth , consumption , borrowing and expansion .
The ideology of unlimited growth failed to take into account the massive depletion of the world ’s resources , from fossil fuels to clean water to fish stocks to erosion , as well as overpopulation , global warming and climate change .
The huge international flows of unregulated capital have wrecked the global financial system .
An overvalued dollar ( which will soon deflate ) , wild tech , stock and housing financial bubbles , unchecked greed , the decimation of our manufacturing sector , the empowerment of an oligarchic class , the corruption of our political elite , the impoverishment of workers , a bloated military and defense budget and unrestrained credit binges have conspired to bring us down .
The financial crisis will soon become a currency crisis .
This second shock will threaten our financial viability .
We let the market rule .
Now we are paying for it .
The corporate thieves , those who insisted they be paid tens of millions of dollars because they were the best and the brightest , have been exposed as con artists .
Our elected officials , along with the press , have been exposed as corrupt and spineless corporate lackeys .
Our business schools and intellectual elite have been exposed as frauds .
The age of the West has ended .
Look to China .
Laissez - faire capitalism has destroyed itself .

Face it :
When it comes to food , meat 's the treat to eat that can't be beat .
Show me someone who does n't eat meat and I 'll show you me eating that person 's pork chop .
And please , spare me your vegetarian moralisms -- if we were n't meant to eat animals , how come they 're all made out of meat ?
Ah , but which meat is the best meat of all ?
With so many meats to choose from , it can be hard to single out the champion meat , the cr�me de la meat , the meat de la meat .
Fortunately for you , I 'm here to sort the whole thing out for you .
So loosen your belt and let 's get started ( winning teams shown in bold ) :
Beef Region
First Round
(1) Porterhouse steak vs. ( 16 ) Steak - umms
Steak - umms are the foundation of a good Philly cheesesteak .
That 's nothing to scoff at , but it can't compare to a well - marbled porterhouse .
(8) Smoked brisket vs. ( 9 ) BBQ beef ribs
Two classic
Texas barbecue meatstuffs in a fight to the finish !
Purists will opt for the brisket , but meat is always better if you can pick it up with your hands and eat it off the bone .
(5) Rib eye steak vs. ( 12 ) London broil
If they tell you that you can eat only one more steak before you die , a bone - in rib eye is the one you want .
It 's also the one you want if you 're going to eat steak every single day for the rest of your very long life .
Trust me .
AP Photo / Larry Crowe Sorry fancy pants , but the filet is like the Knicks -- mushy and expensive .
(4) Filet mignon vs. I hate to break this to you , but filet mignon is for chumps .
Flavorless and mushy ( not tender -- there 's a difference ) , it 's meat for people who do n't really like meat , sort of like vodka is booze for people who do n't really like booze .
A hanger steak , meanwhile , is 10 ounces of beefy bliss .
This is like a scrappy mid-major beating up on a lazy , overconfident conference champ .
(6) New York strip steak vs. ( 11 ) Short ribs
Wanna mark yourself as a food rube ?
Try saying " New York strip " in New York .
Nobody here uses that term ( we say " shell steak " ) , except maybe at the local Ruth 's Chris outlet , which is only for tourists and losers .
But I digress .
The real story is that short ribs are the bomb .
(3) T - bone steak vs. ( 14 ) Ground chuck
A T - bone is just a junior version of a porterhouse , and no self - respecting meat should ever be a junior anything .
Ground chuck , on the other hand , is the basis of a great burger .
(7) Pastrami vs. ( 10 ) Corned beef
A world - class deli meat matchup !
Corned beef is swell , but you can't beat a pastrami on rye with brown mustard .
Wait , make it half a sandwich and a cup of soup , because man cannot live on meat alone ( but do n't tell anyone I said that ) .
(2) Standing rib roast vs. ( 15 ) Pot roast
Who does n't love a good pot roast ?
Mom , if you 're reading this ( unlikely , since you do n't know how to use a computer ) , I love your pot roast .
But c'mon , not even the best pot roast can offer more than token resistance against a rib roast .
Second Round
(1) Porterhouse steak vs. ( 9 ) BBQ beef ribs
Remember how Fred Flintstone ordered those giant ribs that were so heavy that they tipped over his car ?
I 'll take my beef ribs just a smidge bigger than that , please .
Vote : Best of the meats Hungry ?
Good , now go show your loyalty to your meat of choice .

Click here to vote for your favorite meat
vs. ( 13 ) Hanger steakSorry , scrappy mid-major -- this conference champ is ready for you .
( 11 ) Short ribs vs. ( 14 ) Ground chuck
The only problem with braised short ribs is that they 're perfect for fall and winter but do n't really work in the warm - weather months .
A good burger , however , is good anytime .
(2) Standing rib roast vs. ( 7 ) Pastrami
There 's something so primal about a massive rib roast .
Pastrami , as wonderful as it is , ca n't compare .
Round of 16
(5) Rib eye steak vs. ( 9 ) BBQ beef ribs
The sad truth :
This one went into so many overtimes that I fell asleep on the couch .
But when I woke up , there was a nicely marbled rib eye waiting for me .
(2) Standing rib roast vs. ( 14 ) Ground chuck
One of the many , many great things about a rib roast is that you can use the rendered fat to make Yorkshire pudding .
Another is that you get to say " rendered fat . "

If someone says " ' I 'm serving rib roast , " they 're basically saying , " I love you . "
Regional Final
vs. ( 5 ) Rib eye steak
The bad news about a standing rib roast is that it 's only suitable for holidays .
The good news is that serving a standing rib roast basically makesday a holiday .
Even the grandest steak on the planet can't overcome that .
Pork Region
First Round
(1) Bacon vs. ( 16 ) Hog jowl
Hog jowl is very trendy right now in certain foodie circles .
Bacon , meanwhile , has been trendy forever among everyone .
Next !
(8) Pork chops vs. ( 9 ) Deli ham
Want to make a really good pork chop ?
No , I mean a really good pork chop ?
Start with an inch - thick chop and season it with salt and pepper .
Sear it in a super - hot skillet for two minutes on one side and one minute on the other side .
Then reduce the heat to low , cover the skillet , and cook for four more minutes per side .
You can thank me later .
(5) Glazed ham vs. ( 12 ) Pulled pork
Glazed ham is soooooo overrated .
Why put all that sugary coating on a nice piece of meat ?
Especially when you could have a good pulled pork sandwich instead ?
(4) Roast suckling pig vs. ( 13 ) Boston butt
The funny thing about Boston butt is that it 's not from the back end of the pig .
It 's the butt ( i.e. , short end ) of the shoulder , which is at the front of the pig .
And it 's very good -- but it ai n't no suckling pig .
(6) Pork tenderloin vs. ( 11 ) Scrapple
As Robbie Fulks sings in " The Scrapple Song , " " Any old piece of the hog will do / The neck or the nipples or the toenails too . "
To my knowledge , no songs have ever been written about pork tenderloin .
(3) Crown roast of pork vs. ( 14 ) Canadian bacon
Did you know that 83 percent of the Canadian bacon consumed in this country is served on Egg McMuffins ?
Probably not , because I just made that up , but it sounds plausible , right ?
Anyway , slice me another chop off that crown roast , would you please ?
(7) Prosciutto vs. ( 10 ) Cracklins
Good cracklins -- cooked pork skin , hot from the oven , a little salty and a little garlicky -- are one of life 's most sublime pleasures .
Good prosciutto is just good prosciutto .
(2) Spare ribs vs. ( 15 ) Baby back ribs
Quick quiz :
Does the term " baby back ribs " refer to the ribs being ( a ) from a baby pig , or ( b ) small ribs ?
Answer :
It does n't matter , because baby back ribs suck .
If you want a real rib experience , get a full slab of spare ribs and prepare for some serious bliss .
( The real answer , by the way , is ( b ) . )
AP Photo / Larry Crowe From burgers to breakfast , bacon is the Michael Jordan of meat :
It makes everything around it better .
Second Round
vs. ( 8 ) Pork chopsDo n't be embarrassed , pork chops -- there 's no shame in losing to one of nature 's most perfect foods .
(4) Roast suckling pig vs. ( 12 ) Pulled pork
This little piggy when straight to my plate .
And if you play your cards right , maybe I 'll leave a few scraps for you .
(3) Crown roast of pork vs. ( 11 ) Scrapple
If you really want to live high on the hog , use scrapple as the stuffing in the center of the crown roast -- the best of both worlds !
But until that happens , the roast wins this showdown .
(2) Spare ribs vs. ( 10 ) Cracklins
Cracklins are a great snack , but spare ribs are a great reason to wake up in the morning .
Cue Homer Simpson : Mmmmm , rrriiiibbbs .
Round of 16
(1) Bacon vs. ( 4 ) Roast suckling pig
Have you heard about the bacon explosion yet ?
Mildly intriguing , I suppose , but it seems like gilding the lily .
Why turn bacon into such a production when it 's already ideal on its own ?
(2) Spare ribs vs. ( 3 ) Crown roast of pork
Little - known fact : Every Chinese restaurant in America is required by law to serve Chinese spare ribs with an exterior hue of Pantone 188 .
The ribs are also required by law to be the best thing on the entire menu .
Interestingly enough , compliance is 100 percent .
Regional Final
(1) Bacon vs. ( 2 ) Spare ribs
Ask vegetarians what they miss most , and what tempts them to fall off the wagon , and most will tell you , " Bacon . "
There 's a reason for that .
Sausage Region
First Round
(1) Bratwurst vs. ( 16 ) Bologna
Yeah , I like that Oscar Mayer song too , but let 's be honest : Bologna is like boredom on a stick , only without the stick , and its primacy in our lunch pantheon is a sad commentary on life 's very worth .
A grilled brat , on the other hand , is what life is all about .
AP Photo / Srdjan Ilic
If you do n't like sausage then you probably do n't like America or freedom either .
(8) Breakfast links vs. Tricky choice here , especially since one 's preference on a given morning can depend on so many variables ( how much sleep you got , how hung over you might be , whether your favorite team just announced that it 's going to be wearing history 's most embarrassing sleeve patch for the entire 2009 season , etc. ) .
On this particular morning , however , I say patties are sounding a bit more appealing .
(5) Italian sausage vs. ( 12 ) Merguez
I 'm fond of merguez , an underrated lamb sausage that shows up in a lot of Moroccan cooking .
But merguez is way too skinny to serve on a hero roll , which means it loses this matchup on that basis alone .
(4) Pepperoni vs. ( 13 ) Bangers
Bangers and mash is a quaint British dish eaten by quaint British people who would n't know a pepperoni pizza if it walked up to them on the Fourth of July and yelled , " In your face , Redcoats ! "
Not even a fair fight .
(6) Kielbasa vs. ( 11 ) Boudin Bracket - buster alert !
Unless you live down in southern Louisiana , you probably do n't know about boudin , which is a shame , because those Cajuns know what they 're doing when it comes to food .
Take some pork scraps , some rice , some lard , maybe some crawfish , stuff it all in some sausage casings , and then give me a call when you wake up from your boudin - induced stupor .
That 's right , buddy , it 's that good .
(3) Hot dogs vs. ( 14 ) Blood sausage
Yo , if I want a blood transfusion , I 'll get in a car accident or something .
Until that happens , keep that blood to yourself .
(7) Chorizo vs. ( 10 ) Andouille
We 've got a multi-culti sausage grudge match here , with the Spanish chorizo barely eking out a victory over the French andouille .
[+]
Enlarge AP Photo / Hermann J. Knippertz ... and on the eighth day , God created salami .
vs. ( 15 ) Slim JimYou realize there 's almost no actual meat in a Slim Jim , right ?
Second Round
(1) Bratwurst vs. ( 9 ) Breakfast patties
When are they gonna get around to putting a bratwurst illustration on the Wisconsin state flag ?
(4) Pepperoni vs. ( 5 ) Italian sausage
Turns out Randall Simon is n't the only one who can beat up an Italian sausage .
(3) Hot dogs vs. ( 11 ) Boudin
Best hot dog of my life : a Kosher dog at the " O " in Pittsburgh in 1998 .
Love their fries , too .
Only thing I can't figure out is why they bother to have salads on the menu ( see the orange panel at lower left ) , since everyone knows salads cause cancer and hot dogs are good for you .
(2) Salami vs. ( 7 ) Chorizo
Until someone comes up with a chorizo version of this sign , salami's gonna win this matchup every time .
Round of 16
(1) Bratwurst vs. ( 4 ) Pepperoni
You know , the bratwurst song is even better than the bologna song .
(3) Hot dogs vs. Salami
Look , can you eat a salami at the ballpark ?
I rest my case .
Regional Final
(1) Bratwurst vs. ( 3 ) Hot dogs
OK , so I 'm sort of oversimplifying here , but in many respects a brat is like a bigger , thicker , spicier better hot dog .
Brats even take similar condiments .
So why would you go with the smaller , blander version when you could have the bigger , tastier version ?
Two brats , please , with onions and mustard .
Wait , make it three .
And put another one on the grill , just in case .
Meatscellaneous Region
First Round
(1) Veal chops vs. ( 16 ) Deli turkey
Here 's a good measure of how stupid we are as a nation :
Our annual per capita veal consumption has been stuck at about 0.6 of a pound since the early 1990s .
That translates to about one veal chop per person per year .
Look , I eat about that much veal every week , and I 'm sick of picking up the slack for all the rest of you !
(8) Chicken vs. ( 9 ) Osso bucco
I love me some good roast chicken .
But I love osso bucco ( braised veal shanks , an Italian classic ) even more , in part because I can suck the marrow out of the bone in one big slurp .
If that grosses you out , well , you probably stopped reading this bracket a long time ago anyway .
(5) Duck vs. ( 12 ) Cornish hen
I 've never understood the complaint that duck has " too much fat " -- as if such a thing were even possible !
AP Photo / Larry Crowe
The only bad thing about lamb chops is when they 're gone .
vs. ( 13 ) VenisonI 've tried really hard to like venison .
The only thing I have to try hard to do with lamb chops is to keep from saying , " You gonna finish that ? " to everyone else at the table .
(6) Lamb shanks vs. ( 11 ) Rabbit
When people say a particular food " tastes like chicken , " it usually means they 're too lazy to come up with a real description .
But guess what : Rabbit really does taste like chicken .
Braised lamb shanks , however , taste like heaven and a half .
(3) Chicken wings vs. ( 14 ) Turducken
I 'm gonna let you in on a little secret : Turducken is n't very good .
It 's just a freak show masquerading as a meal .
Chicken wings , on the other hand , are what made Buffalo famous , yee - haw !
(7) Turkey vs. ( 10 ) Veal cutlet
Y'know , there 's a reason most people make turkey only on Thanksgiving .
It 's bland , it 's a pain to carve , it 's hard to cook it without either drying out the white meat or undercooking the dark meat , and the mere sight of it makes you instinctively think of the Detroit Lions losing yet another boring , lopsided game .
Gimme a veal parm hero any day of the week .
(2) Leg of lamb vs. ( 15 ) Chicken tails
Here 's another secret :
The best part of the chicken is the tail .
Equal parts crunchy , chewy and gooey , it 's like a piece of candy , except it 's savory instead of sweet .
It 's the chicken 's secret weapon , and it 's right up there with any other meat in this entire tournament .
Second Round
(1) Veal chops vs. ( 9 ) Osso Bucco
One of those hard - fought contests where it's a shame anyone has to lose .
The favorite holds on to win , just barely .
(4) Lamb chops vs. ( 5 ) Duck
Why are lamb chops so often described as " fist - thick " ?
I do n't know why , but it 's an appealing comparison .
And as much as I love duck , it has never inspired a cool metaphor like that .
AP Photo / Larry Crowe A good chicken wing can even cushion the blow of your busted bracket .
vs. ( 6 ) Lamb shanksConventional wisdom holds that there are two parts of a chicken wing : the drumette and the flat .
But there 's a third , overlooked part : the wing tip , located at the end of the wing .
Most Buffalo wing recipes inexplicably call for removing the tip , butCrunchy and chewy , it 's a serious treat .
Not quite as good as a chicken tail , but close .
( 10 ) Veal cutlet vs. ( 15 ) Chicken tails
How good are chicken tails ?
So good that I plan to open a chicken tail restaurant one day .
It will have an open kitchen , so customers can watch the staff chopping off the tails from the chickens and contemptuously discarding the rest of the bird in the trash .
The menu will consist of two items : an appetizer - sized skewer of chicken tails ( $ 27.95 ) and an entr�e - sized skewer of chicken tails ( $ 49.95 ) .
The only problem is that I have n't figured out how to incorporate chicken tails into a dessert .
Yet .
Round of 16
(4) Lamb chops vs. ( 5 ) Veal chops
Easter is fast approaching , which means a lot of people will be eating lamb for the first and only time of the year .
A pity , really , because lamb is delicious anytime .
Then again , veal is delicious too .
But all other things being equal , the redder meat always wins .
(3) Chicken wings vs. ( 15 ) Chicken tails
My chicken tail restaurant , incidentally , will be called The Pope 's Nose , which is slang for chicken tail .
And I will give a free dinner to any card - carrying pope !
Which means the pope is gonna be racking up some serious frequent flier miles commuting from Rome to Brooklyn , because there 's no way he 'll be able to resist the lure of a free chicken tail dinner .
Regional Final
(4) Lamb chops vs. ( 15 ) Chicken tails
I know what you are thinking .
You are thinking , " He 's not really gonna take this chicken tail obsession all the way to the Final Four , is he ? "
Darn right I am , because chicken tails are this tournament 's Cinderella story .
They 've languished in obscurity for too long , and this is their moment , baby !
Final Four
Semifinals
Standing rib roast vs. Bratwurst
There 's something appealing about a brat 's workaday , lunch - pail character , especially when compared with the upper - class aura of a fancy - schmancy rib roast .
So brats make for a sexy underdog here .
And like a lot of sexy underdogs , they get slaughtered once the game actually starts .
Bacon vs. Chicken tails
You know , most Cinderella stories do n't have happy endings .
Championship Game
Bacon vs. Standing rib roast
In your heart of hearts , you knew it would come down to the king of beef against the king of pork .
Let 's try this the rock - scissors - paper way : Bacon covers rib roast ( mmmm , bacon - wrapped rib roast ! ) , but rib roast squashes bacon .
Or to look at it another way , bacon is a perfect food but a rib roast is a perfect meal .
Paul Lukas has written almost as much about meat as he has about sports uniforms .
His collection of vintage recipe booklets with the word " meat " in the title has been exhibited at the City Reliquary in Brooklyn , and his grilled chicken smells so good that it once convinced a friend to break her 12 - year run of vegetarianism ( prompting the friend 's husband to say , " I think you just saved our marriage " ) .
He does n't really think salad causes cancer , but he has his suspicions about tofu .

A new manufacturing method for lithium - ion batteries could lead to smaller , lighter batteries that can be charged in just seconds .
Batteries that discharge just as quickly would be useful for electric and hybrid cars , where a quick jolt of charge is needed for acceleration .
The approach only requires simple changes to the production process of a well - known material .
The new research is reported in the scientific journal Nature .
Because of the electronic punch that they pack , gram for gram , lithium - ion batteries are the most common rechargeable batteries found in consumer electronics , such as laptops .
However , they take a long time to charge ; researchers have assumed until now that there was a speed limit on the lithium ions and electrons that pass through the batteries to form an electrochemical circuit .
Tiny holes Gerbrand Ceder , at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , US , and his colleagues used a computer simulation to model the movements of ions and electrons in a variant of the standard lithium material known as lithium iron phosphate .
The simulation indicated that ions were moving at great speed .
FROM THE BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC World Service " If transport of the lithium ions was so fast , something else had to be the problem , " Professor Ceder said .
That problem turned out to be the way ions passed through the material .
They pass through minuscule tunnels , whose entrances are present at the surface of the material .
However , the team discovered that to get into these channels , the ions had to be positioned directly in front of the tunnel entrances - if they were not , they could not get through .
The solution , Ceder discovered , was to engineer the material such that it has a so - called " beltway " that guides the ions towards the tunnel entrances .
Traffic management A prototype battery made using the new technique could be charged in less than 20 seconds - in comparison to six minutes with an untreated sample of the material .
Most commercial batteries use a material made up of lithium and cobalt , but lithium iron phosphate does not suffer from overheating - something that has affected laptop and mp3 player batteries in a number of incidents .
Hybrid cars could benefit from a quick discharge as much as a quick charge Even though it is cheap , lithium iron phosphate has until now received little attention because lithium cobalt batteries can store slightly more charge for a given weight .
However , the researchers found that their new material does not lose its capacity to charge over time in the way that standard lithium ion batteries do .
That means that the excess material put into standard batteries to compensate for this loss over time is not necessary , leading to smaller , lighter batteries with phenomenal charging rates .
What is more , because there are relatively few changes to the standard manufacturing process , Professor Ceder believes the new battery material could make it to market within two to three years .

MUSIC NEWS - Last month their manager , Steve Dagger , tipped the press , and this week , the British band Spandau Ballet made it official - they announced that they are reuniting .
The group responsible for the hit ballad " True " ( and others ) revealed this week that they would warm up the guitars , keyboards and drum kits to launch a comeback .
Band members , Tony Hadley , Gary Kemp , Martin Kemp , Steve Norman and John Keeble are putting past differences aside .
And , the band said they have n't ruled out the possibility of recording new music .
Spandau Ballet broke up in 1989 , later fought over royalties in a 1999 court battle .
Singer Tony
Hadley noted at the press conference that " time is the great healer .... "
" As you can see , we 're back together again and we 're very happy boys , " lead singer Hadley told the press .
" We 're embarking on a British tour in October and then on to the rest of the world and we 're all very excited .
We 've had a rehearsal which sounded a million dollars . "
The band , which has sold 25 million records , made the announcement on board the HMS Belfast , a British naval ship now a museum on the River Thames in London .
The Belfast was were the band held a gig back in 1980 , when hundreds of fans tried to climb aboard .
Hadley said the eight - date tour would kick off in Dublin on October 13 and end in Manchester on October 28 .
Expect more dates to be announced !
Credit card defaults are soaring .
In response , lenders are hiking rates and slashing credit lines .
Meanwhile Obama wants to throw money at the problem by increasing small business loans .
Let 's take a look at how the above facts interrelate starting with U.S. credit card defaults rise to 20 year - high .
U.S. credit card defaults rose in February to their highest level in at least 20 years , with losses particularly severe at American Express Co( AXP ) and Citigroup ( C ) amid a deepening recession .
AmEx , the largest U.S. charge card operator by sales volume , said its net charge - off rate -- debts companies believe they will never be able to collect -- rose to 8.70 percent in February from 8.30 percent in January .
In addition , Citigroup -- one of the largest issuers of MasterCard cards -- disappointed analysts as its default rate soared to 9.33 percent in February , from 6.95 percent a month earlier , according to a report based on trusts representing a portion of securitized credit card debt .
Analysts estimate credit card chargeoffs could climb to between 9 and 10 percent this year from 6 to 7 percent at the end of 2008 .
In that scenario , such losses could total $ 70 billion to $ 75 billion in 2009 .
" People underestimated the severity of the downturn we are experiencing and I would n't be surprised to see them north of 10 percent , " said Todd , who added American Express was most exposed to higher credit card losses , given its sole reliance on the industry .
Credit card lenders are trying to protect themselves by tightening credit limits , rising standards , and closing accounts .
They have also been slashing rewards , raising interest rates and increasing fees to cushion further losses .
Meredith Whitney , one of Wall Street 's best known and most bearish bank analysts , estimates that Americans ' credit card lines will be cut by $ 2.7 trillion , or 50 percent , by the end of 2010 -- and fewer Americans will be offered new cards .
Business Owners Tear Up Cards
Susan Woodward is n’t renewing the lease on her music boutique and internet cafe in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , after nine years .
The reason : doubling interest rates on her credit cards .
Woodward , 41 , said three other stores along the main square in Jackson Hole are already empty , an unprecedented sight in her more than 20 years living there .
“ My business is seasonal , so we count on credit to stock the store at the end of the slow season and prepare for the busy season , ” said Woodward , who canceled her Citibank and Capital One credit cards in February after learning that rates would climb to 19 percent from 10 percent .
She said she always made timely payments and kept low balances .
Almost three - quarters of U.S. companies with fewer than 500 employees are experiencing a deterioration in credit or credit - card terms at a time when half of them depend on credit cards as a primary source of financing , according to a December survey by the National Small Business Association , a trade group with more than 150,000 members .
Charge - offs , which are loans the banks do n’t expect to be repaid , were 7.1 percent on average in January compared with 4.6 percent a year earlier , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
Consumers are falling behind on credit - card payments as U.S. unemployment reached 8.1 percent in February , the highest level in more than a quarter century .
Obama Pushes Small Business Loans
President Barack Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the U.S. will free up credit for small businesses by raising loan guarantees and spending $ 15 billion to bolster the secondary market .
To help entrepreneurs and business owners , the administration announced the Small Business Administration will step up lending guarantees .
The SBA currently guarantees payment on 85 percent of a loan up to $ 150,000 and as much as 75 percent on loans of more than $ 150,000 .
The administration is raising the guarantee to 90 percent , reducing lender risk as an incentive to make loans .
Fees Waived
In addition , fees of as much as 3.75 percent of the loan ’s face value are being waived effective today , and people who obtained loans and paid fees since Feb. 17 qualify for a refund of those fees .
Canceling fees will lower the cost of money , administration officials said in a conference call with reporters .
Obama ordered the Treasury Department , effective March 31 , to begin using as much as $ 15 billion from the $ 700 billion bank rescue fund to purchase SBA loans on the secondary market , freeing up bank liquidity to make more loans .
The administration also announced new reporting requirements on lending .
The 21 largest banks getting government bailout money must provide monthly reports on how much they are lending to small businesses , and all other banks must make quarterly reports on such lending , under the plan .
Punished For Prudence
Joseph A. Petrucelli is one of the most cautious bankers in America .
In fact , Petrucelli is so cautious that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. recently criticized his bank for not lending enough .
The FDIC ’s negative review of East Bridgewater Savings Bank ’s loan volume is an anomaly in today ’s current banking scene as lenders reel from their role in offering too many cruddy mortgage products to borrowers with weak credit .
Bad or delinquent loans ?
Zero .
Foreclosures ?
None .
Money set aside in 2008 for anticipated loan losses ?
Nothing .
“ We ’re paranoid about credit quality , ” Petrucelli said .
The 62 - year - old chief executive has run the bank since 1992 .
Still , the FDIC slapped East Bridgewater Savings with a rare “ needs to improve ” rating after evaluating the bank under the Community Reinvestment Act.
FDIC examiners also faulted East Bridgewater for not advertising and marketing its loan products enough .

( CNN ) -- Osama bin Laden 's release of an audio message denouncing Israel 's military offensive in Gaza signals the al Qaeda leader 's priorities , CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen says .
Peter Bergen says Osama bin Laden releases few messages because they open him up to detection .
On the tape , which became public Wednesday , bin Laden calls for jihad , or holy war , against Israel in response to its military campaign aimed at stopping Hamas rocket attacks .
It 's unknown when the tape was made because the time lag between recording a bin Laden message and releasing it is usually about two weeks , said Bergen , a fellow at the New America Foundation in Washington and author of " The Osama bin Laden I Know : An Oral History of al Qaeda 's Leader . "
Bergen answered questions about the latest message from bin Laden .
Q : When was the last time we heard from bin Laden ?
Peter Bergen :
We have n't heard from him in nine months .
We were expecting to hear from him during the run-up to the presidential election , as we had four years ago in the previous presidential election , and heard nothing .
Watch why Bergen thinks bin Laden remains relevant »
This is a long period for him not to have said anything , and one potential reason is that by our bureau in Pakistan 's count , there have been 30 Hellfire missile strikes into the tribal zones in Pakistan in the last year , whereas in 2007 there were only four .
Those Hellfire missile strikes put pressure on al Qaeda and killed a number of key leaders in the last several months .
In fact , President Bush referenced those strikes in an interview [ Tuesday ] night with Larry King -- two al Qaeda leaders killed January 1 .
The missile strikes have gone up exponentially in the last year , and clearly that 's going to put a crimp on al Qaeda 's activities .
He 's survived , but these airstrikes have clearly been highly interruptive .
Q : Why are we hearing this time from bin Laden and not his lieutenant , Ayman al - Zawahiri , who speaks out much more frequently ?
Bergen : [ Al - Zawahiri ] has been releasing more videotapes , and there 's been an occasion when [ al - Zawahiri's ] released two tapes in one week .
Hearing from [ al - Zawahiri ] is no longer a newsworthy event .
Bin Laden has been a lot more careful .
The obvious reason for this is that with the release of a videotape or audiotape , you 're opening yourself up to detection .
Somebody 's got to tape the thing , and somebody 's got to take it to either the Al - Jazeera bureau or , more generally , a jihadi Web site .
There 's a chain of custody , and every time you do this you open yourself to exposure .
So I think they 've just made the calculation that Ayman al - Zawahiri 's going to be more talkative and that bin Laden is more important , and he's not going to say much unless it 's sort of a big deal .
And the Israeli attacks on Gaza would certainly be a big deal for bin Laden .
If we had n't heard from him at all in all of this , I think it would have been very puzzling .
Q : Does the timing of the message seem to be affected by the impending inauguration of Barack Obama as president ?
Bergen : I think it 's affected by the Gaza issue .
The Israeli -Palestinian issue is something bin Laden has been pretty vocal about for more than a decade .
It 's nothing specifically to do with the inauguration .
I 'm pretty sure he does n't care whether it 's President Obama or President Bush .
In the early '90s , they were using a picture of President Clinton for target practice .
There 's going to be no substantially different Obama administration policy on most of the issues bin Laden cares about .
I mean , he wants the destruction of the state of Israel .
Obviously the Obama administration is not going to advocate that .
Q : Is bin Laden still relevant ?
Do people still listen and respond to him ?
Bergen : I think if he were irrelevant , we would n't be doing the coverage .
He 's less relevant than he might have been a few years ago because a lot of Muslims have turned against al Qaeda because of its tactics and suicide operations .
But there are clearly people who still think he 's important .
He can put out general messages , you know , inciting people to violence , and this is the way it happens .
So he puts out the strategic guidance to al Qaeda , through the jihadi network , through the audio and videotapes .
Sometimes he makes specific calls for attacks on particular places .
For instance , he called for attacks on Spain , and there were attacks in Madrid in 2004 .
He called for a response to the Danish cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed , and there was an attack by al Qaeda on the Danish Embassy in Pakistan last year .
And I can give you several other examples .
That 's the way he maintains operational control .

Say what you will about them , but the Mormons have their ant - gay talking points down in California and Illinois and Maine .
I got this email from an AMERICAblog reader who was visited by Mormon missionaries recently .
Seems like all the Mormons have been schooled on how to respond to Prop 8 questions — and laying blame on the Catholics is part of the Mormon spin :
Last week , two young women knocked on my door to talk with me about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints .
Mind you , I live on the Portland peninsula in one of the most liberal neighborhoods , probably , in the country .
I think our precinct voted close to 95 % for Obama .
So , it ’s interesting to me that these two women were even venturing into this area .
They started out with their typical rhetoric asking about my beliefs .
I told them I was Catholic .
In the past , that ’s been enough to get them to move on .
But , not this time .
When they finally paused from their script , it was my turn .
I told them that , while I respect their right to their beliefs , I would never support the Mormon Church because of its stand on gay rights and its actions in California .
The younger woman immediately responded “ the Catholics supported that , too . ”
I told them I disagreed vehemently with the Catholic Church as well and explained that this issue is critically important and deeply personal so there was no way I would ever support their church .
They persisted , telling me that , like most religions , I do n’t have to agree with the Mormon Church on all issues .
They said that a lot of people supported the repeal of Prop 8 , including the Catholic Church .
Clearly , they ’re ready to respond to concerns about the Mormons ’ support of Prop 8 and are n’t backing down when the issue is raised .
After all that , they still left a card in case I want to get more information on their church .
They ’re persistent .
Back in 2005 , when I worked on the campaign to prevent the repeal of adding sexual orientation and gender identity to Maine ’s Human Rights law , we could n’t even send volunteers to knock doors in this same very liberal neighbhorhood , unless the household had already been identified as supporters .
Yet , the Mormons send people into that same neighborhood who are unabashed about the anti-gay views of their church .
That ’s chutzpah .
But , it shows how determined and aggressive the Mormons are .
Bashing gays and blaming Catholics .
That ’s quite a combo .
And , what a coincidence : The Maine Legislature is considering a marriage equality bill .
So , are those Mormons really in Maine to do missionary work or are they there to do political work ?
Someone needs to find out if the church is undertaking political activity in Maine and possibly violating its tax - exempt status .
Do n’t forget , the leaders of the Mormon Church lied repeatedly about all of their activity in California .
That church needs to be monitored vigilantly because they do n’t miss a chance to gay bash .

get real .
i freely > acknowledge that i am a bit extreme on drinking and driving but i also > have experienced the results of drinking and driving up close and > personal .
As you know by now , I 've been directly affected 3 times by drunk drivers and my ideas of punishment are pretty radical .
As someone who 's been heavily involved in the politics of traffic policy for years , it has become a necessity to actually know what I 'm talking about instead of firing off emotional opinions as fact .
here are some things you really ought to know so you wo n't make a fool of yourself advocating a BAC of 0.0 : * There is a certain amount of alcohol in many people 's blood all the time , the byproduct of some varieties of intestinal flora .
Usually below 0.01 BAC but not always , particularly in diabetics .
* it is relatively rare that someone who is drunk will show a BAC anywhere near 0.1 .
A person who has a glass of wine , a single beer or a mixed drink with dinner is not in any way impaired but will show a BAC of around 0.01 - 02 .
The drunks almost always show 0.17 and upward .
Drunks do n't get just a little drunk and then go out and kill someone .
They get sloshed .
I 've done many a ride - along with DUI squads so that I could gain a first hand knowledge of how it is out there on the street vs the lies that crazies like MADD promote .
*
There is a large body of scientific data showing that most people are not in any significant way impaired at a BAC below 0.1 .
One of the more significant tests was sponsored by Car & Driver magazine where the commissioned a test to determine the effects of alcohol and pot on a wide variety of drivers , ranging from ordinary drivers to race car drivers .
That study pissed off a lot of people because it demonstrated that pot has zero effect on motor skills but the data and the science are unassailable .
It was funny to see that one of the race car drivers actually lapped faster on pot than he did sober .
* the BAC is a poor indicator of impairment , particularly when the impairment is from non-alcohol causes such as drugs or lack of sleep .
There are impairment testers available that directly measure the subjects impairment - what we 're really interested in for public safety - and are portable .
The problem is the prohibitionists and religious nuts are more interested in punishing " sin " ( that being the drinking of alcohol rather than being impaired ) than they are getting drunks off the street .
There is further opposition from a segment of the politicians ( the Kennedy faction ) who do n't want an accurate impairment measurement because they know they 'd get caught eventually .
A skilled lawyer can usually challenge the BAC procedure enough to get the politicians off if the case does n't make the paper .
Well enough .
I 'm probably wasting my breath on a zealot .

These things are already on the market and are used somewhat widely in industry to test for worker impairment , usually after an accident .
They lack the " presumed accurate and admissible " legal status that Breathalyzers have and so are not used for law enforcement .

I have n't learned the specifics on this instance but in the case of the drunk who hit me and the one who killed my other friend , both were chronic drunks with long strings of DUIs ( and the slaps on the wrists that follow ) and both were far over the legal limit .
There is no need to go after the guy with 0.05 on his breath at an unconstitutional DUI checkpoint .
Just execute those who chronically blow 0.3 or more .

Visitors to the Alhambra fortress - palace in Granada have for centuries fallen into a reverie before its intricately carved medieval walls , wondering at the meaning of the Arabic inscriptions that adorn them from floor to ceiling .
The script that winds round the filigree arches and pillared courtyards is so stylised that it 's often difficult to disentangle words from images , and few can decipher the classical Arabic in which they are written .
Now , the carvings have been logged and translated , finally answering the question that has perplexed generations of visitors to Europe 's jewel of Muslim architecture : " What are these walls telling me ? "
Researchers have produced an interactive DVD that decodes , dates and identifies 3,116 of some 10,000 inscriptions carved on the building that symbolises centuries of Muslim rule in Spain and is today the country 's top tourist landmark .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" There 's perhaps nowhere else in the world where gazing upon walls , columns and fountains is an exercise so similar to turning the pages of a book of poems , " says Juan Castilla , from the School of Arabic Studies at Spain 's Higher Scientific Research Council , whose team produced this still - incomplete guide .
Arabic artisans , supervised by poets employed in the 14th - century court of King Yusuf I , drew up the decorative plans and planned the spaces where verses – original , or copied – were to be engraved .
So , what do these words say ?
" There are n't as many as we thought , " Dr Castilla confessed .
Inscriptions of poetry and verses from the Koran that have inspired generations represent only a minimum percentage of the texts that adorn the Alhambra 's walls , despite the mistaken belief that they are smothered in writings of this kind , he said , presenting his study in Madrid .
Instead the motto of the Nazrid dynasty – " There is no victor but Allah " – is repeated hundreds of times on walls , arches and columns .
Isolated words like " happiness " or " blessing " recur , seen as divine expressions protecting the monarch or governor honoured in each palace or courtyard .
Aphorisms abound : " Rejoice in good fortune , because Allah helps you , " and " Be sparse in words and you will go in peace . "
Researchers built upon studies begun 500 years ago by the conquerors of the Nazrid dynasty , who ruled the kingdom of Al Andalus and created this fabulous pile .
The Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella ruthlessly purged Muslims from Spain after 1492 , but they were sufficiently curious about their vanquished enemy 's heritage , or impressed by the Alhambra 's unique beauty , to order specialist translators to study the inscriptions that cover every nook and cranny .
For centuries scholars spent half their life , and ruined their eyesight , scrutinising the messages embedded in the geometric tiles or finely carved in the stonework .
Among them are verses by the acclaimed Islamic poets Ibn al - Khatib and Ibn Zamrak , some of which describe the place where they appear , such as the Hall of the Two Sisters , which represents a garden : " Moreover we do not know of any other garden / more pleasant in its freshness , more fragrant in its surroundings , / or sweeter in the gathering of its fruits ... " wrote Ibn Zamrak .
The ceiling represented heaven : " The hands of the Pleiades will spend the night invoking / God 's protection in their favour and they will awaken to / the gentle blowing of the breeze ./
In here is a cupola which by its height becomes lost from / sight ... " the poet wrote .
Until now , however , efforts to transcribe such verses have revealed only a fraction of the material .
With modern technology , including a 3D laser scanner , " we have achieved not so much a discovery as an exhaustive labour that seeks to register all the inscriptions , " said Dr Castilla .
At the touch of a mouse , everyone from the specialist to the idly curious can now learn the meaning of the ancient words , see exactly where they are located , and how often they are repeated on the walls .
The form of script is also described : angular kufic , whose uprights sprout into decorative foliage , or intertwine ; curlicue cursive ; or a mixture of forms .
In a culture that banned human images , the form as well as the content of the calligraphy was designed to exalt temporal and heavenly rulers .
Kufic is used for quotations from the Koran , which tend to be high up on the walls , while the poetry is nearer the ground – further from heaven , scholars say – in elaborately cursive script .
The DVD takes you on a virtual tour of all the writings , with details ( in Spanish only , so far ) of when and how each was created .
This first volume covers the citadel - palace of Comares .
The Palace of Lions , with its renowned courtyard and fountain , follows later this year .
The guide is due to be completed , and reissued in one compilation DVD by 2010 .
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - Some 200 secular , religious and media groups from around the world on Wednesday urged the United Nations Human Rights Council to reject a call from Islamic countries for a global fight against “ defamation of religion . ”

The groups , including some Muslim bodies , issued their appeal in a statement on the eve of a vote in the Council in Geneva on a resolution proposed by the 56 - nation Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) .
Such a resolution , the statement said , “ may be used in certain countries to silence and intimidate human rights activists , religious dissenters and other independent voices , ” and to restrict freedom of religion and of speech .
The resolution , its critics say , would also restrict free speech and even academic study in open societies in the West and elsewhere .
Islamic countries argue that criticizing or lampooning religions is a violation of the rights of believers and leads to discrimination and violence against them .
Cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad , first published in a Danish newspaper , sparked riots in the Muslim world in 2006 .
The OIC resolution says “ Islam is frequently and wrongly associated with human rights violations and terrorism ” and calls on U.N. member states “ to combat defamation of religions and incitement to religious hatred in general .... “
BUILT -IN MAJORITY
Similar unbinding resolutions have been passed since 1999 in the U.N. General Assembly and by the 47 - nation Human Rights Council , where Islamic countries and others who support them on the issue have a built - in majority .
But activist groups say the latest one -- tabled by Pakistan on behalf of the OIC -- is part of a growing offensive by the Islamic countries to impose their concepts of rights and religion on the rest of the world .
They argue that the concept of “ defamation of religions ” is so vague that it can be used against any challenge to a religious tenet and bolster laws against blasphemy in authoritarian regimes where one religion holds sway .
Condemnation of “ defamation ” was originally included in a draft of a declaration to be issued by a U.N. anti-racism conference , dubbed Durban II , in Geneva next month , but was withdrawn after Western countries said it was unacceptable .
However , critics say they fear OIC states and their allies are working to insert it in an existing U.N. convention against racial discrimination .
They say “ defamation of religion ” has no validity in international law because only individuals , and not concepts or beliefs , can be defamed .
Among the groups signing Wednesday ’s statement were the International Humanist and Ethical Union , the Geneva - based U.N. Watch , the Muslim Council of Canada , the American Islamic Congress , the World Jewish Congress , the U.S. Freedom House , and the Paris - based International Press Institute .
It was also backed by organizations representing believers , agnostics and atheists in India , Australia , Europe , Africa and Latin America .
Joe the Plumber Wants to Make Love to Washington
The Republican 's Working Man hero
Joe the Plumber could barely contain himself last night before a crowd of adoring , media - bashing conservatives .
" God , all this love and everything in the room - I 'm horny , " declared Joe , whose real name is Samuel Wurzelbacher .
The particular state of his libido was way too much information , certainly for the Sleuth .
But she was n't the only slack - jawed person in the room .
It seemed that all of those who were gathered in the ballroom of Washington 's Grand Hyatt hotel for the Media Research Center 's annual " DisHonors Awards " ceremony designed to bash the dreaded liberal elite media were stunned .
Buzz immediately commenced .
" Did Joe the Plumber really just say he 's horny ? "
" Did you hear Joe say ' horny ' ? "
" Why is he horny and why is he telling us ? "
And those were only the comments overheard at the Sleuth 's table .
Joe was all hot and bothered over the standing ovation he received as he walked on stage to accept accolades from the top liberal media watchdog .
Lee Greenwood 's GOP country classic " God Bless the USA " boomed overhead as Joe , wearing blue jeans , a black t- shirt and a flannel shirt unbuttoned to his navel , strolled on stage .
After declaring he was horny , Joe mumbled a few other things about being the " token redneck " and the media loving him , and then sat back down in a sea of conservative luminaries that included G. Gordon Liddy , former Attorney General Ed Meese , radio talk show host Mark Levin , Fox News ' Brit Hume and former House speaker ( for half a minute ) Bob Livingston .
The Media Research Center 's DisHonors Awards ceremony was an evening of roasting the " most outrageously biased liberal reporting of the year . "
And it was also an evening of lampooning the mainstream media 's treatment of President Obama , who the gala 's hosts sarcastically referred to as " the Messiah . "
Several members of the " lame - stream media , " as Monica Crowley referred to them ( er , us ) , won awards .
MSNBC's Chris Matthews won the " Media Messiah Award " for his famous Potomac Primary day comment that " I felt this thrill going up my leg . "
ABC 's Bill Weir won the " Obamagasm Award " and HBO " Real Time " host Bill Maher won the " Half - Baked Alaska Award for Pummeling Palin " for questioning whether Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , or her daughter Bristol , was the true biological mother of baby Trig .
Deploying Sinatra with Vlad
So you 've just written a nice new Sinatra application , and you want to get it running on your web server .
How hard can it be ?
Well with Vlad the Deployer , it 's actually rather easy .
Creating a sample application
Let 's start by making ourselves a test app :
$ mkdir hello $ cd hello $ touch app.rb
Open app.rb in your editor and put this code in it :
require " rubygems " require " sinatra " get " / " do " Hello ! "
end
We can check that the app works locally by running it ...
$ ruby app.rb
... and then opening http://localhost:4567 in a web browser .
We need to create a public directory too , as Vlad assumes that we have a public directory for our static assets .
I 'm also going to make an empty CSS file so that the directory does n't get ignored by Git :
$ mkdir public $ touch public / master.css
We 'll deploy our application from version control .
I 'm using Git , but you can use any system that Vlad supports ; just check your files into a repository that will be accessible from your web server .
Configuring Vlad
Okay , we 're ready for Vlad .
It 's a Ruby gem , so it 's very easy to install :
$ sudo gem install vlad Successfully installed vlad - 1.2.0 1 gem installed Installing ri documentation for vlad - 1.2.0 ...
Installing RDoc documentation for vlad - 1.2.0 ...
There 's no need to install Vlad on your server , just your workstation .
You access Vlad 's functionality through Rake tasks .
This means that we need a Rakefile which loads the Vlad code .
Create Rakefile in the same directory as app.rb , then add the following code to it :
begin require " vlad " Vlad.load ( : app => nil , :scm => " git " , : web => nil ) rescue LoadError # do nothing end
Note that we 've told Vlad that we intend to use Git ( subversion is the default ) .
These instructions were tested using Vlad 1.2.0 .
They still work if you 're using Vlad 2.x , but be aware that support for git was moved into a separate gem in Vlad 2.x , so you 'll also want to run gem install vlad - git .
If you do n't , vlad will later complain with " Please specify the server domain via the : domain variable " .
We 've set : app to nil as Vlad assumes that we 'll run our application with Mongrel .
I 'm not going to use Mongrel here , so we do n't want Vlad to load its Mongrel recipes .
If you run rake - T now you should see a bunch of vlad tasks that are available to you .
You can't run them yet ; you need to configure Vlad with a config / deploy.rb file :
$ mkdir config $ touch config/ deploy.rb
Open deploy.rb in your editor and set the following variables :
set :application , " hello " set : repository , " ssh://your.git.server/path/to/project/hello.git " set :domain , " your.web.server " set : deploy_to , " /var/apps/#{application} "
Make sure that : repository correctly references your source control system , and that : domain is set to the hostname of your server .
I wo n't be able to create any directories under the / var / apps directory ( I 'm going to run vlad using my own username in this example ) , so I need to login to my server and make sure that I can create files in the hello directory :
$ ssh your .
web.server $ sudo mkdir - p / var / apps / hello $ sudo chown yourusername / var / apps / hello
Now you can try running Vlad , to create all the directories necessary to serve your project .
Back on your workstation , type :
$ rake vlad : setup
You should find that some directories have been created within / var / apps / hello on your server .
Let 's trying deploying some code :
$ rake vlad: update ( in / Users / graham/data/effectif/projects/hello ) Initialized empty Git repository in /var / apps / hello/scm / repo/.git /
Switched to a new branch " deployed - HEAD "
You should now find that if you ssh into your server that you can run the application :
$ ssh your.web.server $ cd /var / apps/hello/current $ ruby app.rb
Try making a change to your source , committing it to your repository , then run vlad : update again .
Your code will be updated .
If you restart Sinatra in the new directory you 'll see your changes in the browser .
If you 're following along with these commands , be careful that you 're running app.rb in the freshly deployed directory .
current is a symlink to a specific release directory , so you 'll need to leave the directory and return to it to see the new source code ( i.e. symlinks do n't get updated under your shell 's feet ) .
This should do it :
$ cd ~ && cd - $ ruby app.rb
You may now be wondering how to get Thin running automatically , and how to re-start it when you run vlad : update .
That should be the subject of my next blog post ( you can subscribe if you need it ) .
Deploying from a Git branch
If you want to deploy from a specific Git branch ( master is the default ) you can set the : revision variable in deploy.rb :
set :revision , " origin/mybranch "
Deploying as a different user
It 's not a great idea to deploy and run applications as your own login name ( it 's better practice to run web applications as users that do n't have many privileges ) .
I 've not really addressed users in this article in order to focus on the basics of Vlad , but if you 're interested you can deploy as a different user with these settings in deploy.rb :
set :user , " deploy " set : domain , " #{user}@domain.com "
I love feedback and questions — please get in touch on Twitter or leave a comment .
Like dynasties rising and falling , videogame systems enjoy periods of ascendancy and popular support , only to be thrust aside by a new and conquering power .
First came Magnavox Odyssey ( in the 1970s ) , then Atari consoles , then Nintendo , which dominated the market for the better part of the 1980s .
In the early 1990s , Nintendo's Super NES and Sega Genesis battled each other for supremacy .

Automatically apply patches from Django ’s ( or any ) Trac¶
Lately I ’ve been delving into Django development a bit more , and applying people ’s patches has been a bit of a hassle .
You know you want to apply someones patch , but there are about five steps in between you and applying their patch to your source tree .
So I ’d like to present trac_patch.py , which allows you to apply a patch from Django ’s trac automatically .
It is posted on github , so I encourage everyone to fork it and modify it to fit your own workflow .
This was done in about 2 hours , so it ’s still pretty rough .
Also note , that this should work with a small modification on just about any trac install out there .
I threw a few features in that were useful for my development workflow .
You can easily create a new git branch automatically with the name of the patch that you ’re applying .
You can apply and revert a patch .
It also has a mode where you can confirm the ticket you ’re looking at , and choose which of the patches on the ticket you wish to apply to your code .
You can use it by default if you ’re in your current top - level django directory ( or where ever you want the patches applied ) .
However , there is a django_src variable in the code that you can set and then it will work from anywhere .
I ’ll paste in the modules docstring below , so you see some examples of it in action .
At the behest of a sponsor , Michael Phelps has recorded a video apology to the people of China , expressing his remorse over the recently published photograph showing him using a marijuana pipe .
He thanked them for their support and forgiveness .
The 52 - second video has been posted on several Web sites in China , and one major Chinese newspaper said the video had been sent directly from the Japanese auto company Mazda , which last month signed Phelps to an endorsement deal believed to be worth more than $ 1 million .
Phelps was signed to promote Mazda cars in China after his record - breaking eight - gold - medal performance at the Beijing Olympics last summer .
In the video , Phelps begins by saying , “ To my Chinese friends , ” and goes on to apologize for behavior that was “ regrettable and not what people have come to expect from me . ”
Phelps ’s words are subtitled in Mandarin .
Phelps , 23 , never specifically addresses what the picture captured : he was at a house party in South Carolina , appearing to inhale from a marijuana pipe .
After the photo was published in a British tabloid , the fallout included a three - month suspension by USA Swimming .
Another of Phelps ’s sponsors , Kellogg , said that it would not renew his contract .

Financial and commodities - related stocks led the market to a fourth straight loss on Monday as investors placed last - minute bets ahead of fourth - quarter earnings season .
Wall Street expects a dismal batch of profit reports , and the pecking order of winning and losing sectors on Monday closely mirrored the distribution of pain that analysts expect to see in various sectors .
The ...
CHINA'S growth will slow to 6.5 per cent , the World Bank has forecast in its latest quarterly report , 0.2 per cent lower than the January International Monetary Fund forecasts and well below the 8 per cent that Beijing officials say they need to ensure social stability .
Yet despite China being hit hard , the World Bank says the country is holding up better than most other economies because of the huge fiscal stimulus injected early by the Government , a strong banking sector and some growth in domestic demand .
The regular assessment of the Chinese economy finds that its banks have been largely unscathed by the international financial turmoil and that the economy still has plenty of space to implement forceful stimulus measures .
However , as the global crisis has intensified , China 's exports have been hit badly , affecting market - based investment and sentiment , notably in the manufacturing sector .
It is this that has prompted the World Bank to adjust its projection for China 's GDP growth downward .
It follows the bank 's recent downgrading of projections for global GDP growth .
There is , however , some good news for Australia in the report .
The World Bank says China 's imports - mainly raw materials which Australia and others supply - were down in February , but not nearly as sharply as they were in January , when there was a precipitous decline .

The world 's two major nuclear weapons states are preparing to stage a public spectacle not seen since the peak of the cold war : full scale negotiations for a new deal to slash their still - bloated arsenals of offensive strategic arms .
President Barack Obama 's administration has set Moscow 's security community abuzz by signaling Washington 's willingness to work up a replacement for the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty , or START , which would otherwise expire at the end of this year .
Mr. Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev are expected to set the ball rolling when they meet on the sidelines of April 's G - 20 meeting in London .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will also meet Friday in Geneva with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov .
Secretary Clinton offered a preview of the meeting during a gathering of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels .
Regarding Russia , " It 's time for a fresh start , " Clinton said .
The high - level meetings ahead between the US and Russia are likely to be followed by intense activity as the two sides strive to map out a fresh accord by the Dec. 5 deadline .
Often described as the most effective arms control accord in history , START led to the removal of more than two - thirds of all strategic weapons and limited each side to the then - radical ceiling of 6,000 warheads deployed on no more than 1,600 delivery systems .
Moscow welcomes Obama 's goal
But experts warn that the global security environment has shifted dangerously in two decades , and the old bipolar superpower standoff has been deeply complicated by the emergence of new nuclear wild cards , such as India , Pakistan , and North Korea .
They also worry that the old arms control framework may have been fatally damaged by the Bush administration 's unilateral withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty , which banned defensive strategic weapons , followed by a decision to station anti-missile interceptors in Poland .
Despite such concerns , official Moscow appears enthusiastic .
" Nuclear arms control is the one , single area where Russians feel like complete equals when they face their American counterparts across a table , " says Fyodor Lukyanov , editor of Russia in Global Affairs , a leading foreign policy journal .
" When we start serious talks [ on START ] , it will say to us that Russia is finally back as a serious player . "
Russian experts say they are excited by the signs coming out of Washington .
According to a statement published on the White House website , Mr. Obama wants to move toward " a world without nuclear weapons " and is ready to partner with Moscow to seek " dramatic reductions in US and Russian stockpiles , " of nuclear arms .
A recent story in The Times of London quoted a White House official saying the US might seek to slash strategic arsenals down to 1,000 weapons on each side – an 80 percent reduction .
" We have heard these declarations from Obama , " says Andrei Klimov , deputy chair of the Russian State Duma 's international affairs committee .
" This is very welcome .
We are in favor of deep strategic cuts , but there is a complex knot of problems to be resolved .
The balance needs to be maintained . "
The Russians complain that Washington lost interest in serious arms control with Moscow after the USSR collapsed .
But Russia and the US , between them , hold about 93 percent of the world 's remaining 25,000 nuclear weapons , according to the Washington - based Center for Defense Information ( CDI ) , and little has changed in the equation since the cold war 's end .
Experts say that any serious attempt to engage other up - and - coming nuclear powers in arms control – much less convince countries like Iran and North Korea to dismantle their atomic programs – will require decisive moves toward disarmament by the big powers .
Currently , according to CDI , China has about 410 warheads , France 384 , Israel and Britain around 200 each , India about 60 , and Pakistan 25 .
" If Russia and the US are interested in keeping the nuclear non-proliferation regime alive , they must do their best to get a new framework for arms control going , " says Anton Khlopkov , executive director of the PIR Center , an independent Moscow - based security think tank .
" Otherwise , many other countries will see it as more hypocrisy from the big powers who , just as in the past , call on others to disarm but do not keep their own pledges . "
Tight deadline approaches
The Bush administration responded to Russian pleas by signing the Strategic Offensive Reduction Treaty ( SORT ) with then - Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2002 , which called for both sides to slash their arsenals to a maximum of 2,200 weapons on each side by 2012 .
But it 's a deal the Russians say they 'd prefer to forget , because it contained no provisions for verifying compliance and seemed , to them , a way for Mr. Bush to avoid discussing arms control with Moscow .
" This so - called SORT was a page - and - a - half long , and was basically a statement of intention with no follow up mechanisms at all , " says Mr. Khlopkov .
" Russia was , and is , interested in old - fashioned arms control talks with a full framework of mutual obligations . "
The Russians claim that the Bush administration 's opposition to structured negotiations led it to ignore all opportunities for prolonging START , thus leaving Obama with a very tight deadline to find a replacement for the accord .
As soon as they start discussing fresh cuts in offensive strategic weapons , experts say , the US and Russia will run up against another Bush legacy : the lack of controls on antimissile systems .
" Back in the 1970s , the American approach was that development of defensive weapons must be blocked first of all , and that led to the ABM Treaty , " says Yevgeny Bazhanov , vice rector of the official Diplomatic Academy in Moscow , which trains Russian diplomats .
But the US broke out of the ABM Treaty in 2001 , and began developing a global antimissile shield that includes plans to station interceptors in Poland , right near Russia 's borders .
" I do n't see how we can discuss strategic arms control in isolation from this larger context ; the missile defense issue will have to be addressed as well , " says Mr. Bazhanov .
" But Russia is ready , and the signals all say Obama is ready too .
It 's a historic moment . "
Holly Madison , former playboy playmate and ex-girlfriend of Playboy Magazine tycoon Hugh Hefner , has wasted no time finding love .
According to sources Holly has fallen head over “ Hollyheels ” in love with illusionist Criss Angel who is known for his amazing ability to walk on water .
But is he as enthusiastic about walking the path of Holy Matrimony ?
Could his resistance to wear the paper made engagement ring his playboy honey designed and create for his is any indication ?
Angel has told his new found love that he will marry her .
Madison has even gone as far of vowing to propose if her agrees to wear the ring however for fear of perhaps “ paper cuts , ” the ring has yet to be worn or could it be that he is still legally married ?
IDK !
In a recent interview with US Magazine the 41 year old illusionist said : ” I will propose . ” however , just being together is enough for him !
Yikes Holly !
Sounds like this might take a little “ magic . ”

Tesla's Roadster Is
Sex on Wheels
We 've been writing about the Tesla Roadster for more than a year , and Tesla Motors finally gave us the chance to drive one .
For two hours .
Around town .
With a PR flack riding shotgun .
Despite the short leash , we pushed the electric sports car hard enough to know it 's quick , nimble and fun — but not as exciting as we'd hoped .
Do n't get us wrong :
The Roadster is n't just an excellent EV , it 's an excellent car .
The power is impressive , the fit and finish are top - notch , we love the instant power , and that candy - colored carbon shell is sexy as hell .
Most impressive , it 's a true sports car that just about anyone can hop into and drive fast .
And that 's exactly the problem .
The Roadster is so easy to drive it 's almost , well , boring .
Still , you can't help but grin when you 're behind the car 's tiny Momo steering wheel .
Aside from drawing more looks than a chrome Lamborghini ( though that 's probably a San Francisco thing ) , the Roadster 's acceleration is addicting .
It is n't the horsepower that 's so impressive — though 248 horsepower in a 2,700 - pound car is nothing to sneeze at — it 's the torque .
Stomp on the skinny aluminum accelerator and all 276 foot - pounds of it is right there , instantly .
That 's why we love electric motors , and it's the reason the Roadster does zero to 60 in a Porsche - worthy 3.9 seconds .
The power is linear , coming on evenly and strongly , and we imagine it does so all the way to the car 's claimed top speed of 125 mph .
We did n't push it that high with the publicist in the passenger seat , so we 'll have to take Tesla 's word for it .
Handling is neutral with a slight tendency toward understeer , which is odd given 65 percent of the car 's weight is over the back wheels .
Try as we might , we could n't get the back end to break loose or oversteer noticeably around corners — but , as we said , we had a babysitter within freakout range , so we were n't driving the way we might if , say , you were next to us .
The Roadster 's ride is firm but not stiff , even over pockmarked city streets , and the Yokohama Advan tires are stickier than a movie - theater floor .
The manual steering makes tooling around a parking lot quite a chore , but the wheel lightens up at speed .
All in all , the Roadster handles a lot like the kartish Lotus Elise it is ( loosely ) based on , and the guys at Top Gear found it can match the pace of the mighty Porsche 911 GT3 around their test track .
However , the driving dynamics are unlike those of a conventional sports car .
In a normal sports car , you can slip around a turn faster by lifting off the throttle .
This sudden drop in power transfers weight to the front tires , taking traction away away from the rear end .
Oversteer , as it's called , is a good thing if you do n't panic ; you can essentially make the vehicle pivot around the front tires , allowing you to corner faster and tighter .
We could n't do this in the Tesla .
The torquey electric motor , which does such a nice job of saving your brakes by generating electricity as you let off the go- pedal , does n't cut the power from the rear wheels quickly enough .
Granted , you probably should n't be inducing oversteer on public roads , and there is n't yet an electric - car racing league in which to flog a Roadster .
But Tesla owners with aspirations of tearing up the twisties will have to readjust more than just their refueling habits :
They 're going to have to learn to drive differently .
And the rest of us are n't far behind .
The inexorable wave of electric cars that 's set to drench the world 's roads and garages and tracks will require a new performance - driving paradigm .
Instructors at Skip Barber will have to modify their spiels ; racers will have to retrain their neural pathways .
Though we did n't have the chance to really figure the car out , we got the best results by tapping the brakes at a turn 's apex .
It 's a little hamfisted and jerky , but we just were n't going fast enough to try to break the rear end 's death - grip on the pavement with throttle .
And , like we said , there was that flack to worry about .
The Brembo brakes were up to the task , but we were n't thrilled with their initial bite .
It is n't a big issue in day - to - day driving because the re-gen system is so generous with the engine braking , but we wonder what it will mean under hard driving .
Back off on the throttle , and the 185 kilowatt motor becomes a dynamo , generating energy instead of using it , and returning it to the 992 - pound , 53 - kilowatt - hour lithium - ion battery pack located right behind the seats .
It takes a little getting used to keep from nauseating your passenger in traffic .
The fit and finish are as impressive as the technology underpinning the car .
The carbon fiber is gorgeous , the paint shimmers , the panel gaps are even and everything works exactly as it should .
The heated leather seats are firm and supportive , but getting into them requires the flexibility of a gymnast , because the door sills are as wide as the car is low .
( It is , however , a lot easier than getting in the Roadster 's British cousin , the Elise . )
Once you 're buckled up , the car is comfortable , though the footwells are about the size of a shoebox .
The interior is a bit Spartan , and the creature comforts seem like afterthoughts .
Our Tesla rep countered these observations by repeating " It 's a sports car " so many times we thought she might have a nervous tick .
Yeah , well , Ferraris are sports cars too , but every modern model has power mirrors — something the Roadster inexcusably lacks .
The carbon - fiber center console is a beautiful piece of automotive sculpture , but it felt flimsy .
The climate control knobs were awkward , and the JVC navi screen was so small it 's sure to cause accidents when lost eco-motorists lean in close to scrutinize the Liliputian map to find nearby charging stations .
And the computer that lets you switch performance levels and access the system diagnostics is located exactly where the coin tray should go .
If we owned a Roadster , it'd be about a week before we jammed a quarter through the tiny LCD screen by mistake .
But we could live with all that .
What really bugged us about the Roadster is its silence .
Except for a little tire noise , you do n't hear anything but the faint whir of the motor .
Tesla spokeswoman Rachel Konrad hailed it as a selling point , but the roar of a high - performance engine and the sound of the exhaust is as much a part of the sports car experience as acceleration and handling .
We 'd probably get over that eventually , but the silence also makes the Roadster easy to overlook in traffic , as the woman yakking on her cellphone while making an illegal left turn discovered when she almost plowed into us .
It does n't help that the Roadster is just 44.35 inches tall .
Small and silent is n't the best combination for urban traffic .
Perhaps Brabus was on to something when it developed that " space sound generator " that mimics the sound of a V - 8 engine .

Ms Waghmare has been promised police protection
The sole known surviving suspect from last November 's attacks in Mumbai ( Bombay ) may once again be without proper legal representation .
A lawyer who was appointed for Ajmal Amir Qasab has said she is resigning from the case , after a crowd of protesters gathered outside her home .
Lawyer Anjali Waghmare was then promised police protection and is due to give a final decision on Wednesday .
Qasab has been charged with murder and " waging war " against India .
He has told the court he was from Pakistan 's Punjab province and asked for a lawyer .
After the attacks , Indian lawyers had refused to represent Qasab .
Intimidation Anjali Waghmare , the wife of a city police officer , was appointed by a judge only on Monday morning .
She said she would withdraw on the evening of the same day .
A crowd of people - many of them from the Hindu nationalist party Shiv Sena - had surrounded her house in Mumbai chanting slogans .
Stones were thrown and nine arrests are reported to have been made .
Protesters said anyone who represented Qasab would be considered unpatriotic .
Ms Waghmare would be the second lawyer to withdraw from the case after intimidation .
The special public prosecutor involved in the Qasab trial has strongly condemned those involved in this latest protest .
He said it would send the wrong signal to the world about whether Qasab could get a fair trial in India .
More than 170 people were killed in the Mumbai attacks , and feelings are still running high , says the BBC's Chris Morris in Delhi .
The charge sheet relating to November 's attacks runs to more than 11,000 pages .
Qasab has been charged under various acts , including murder , attempted murder and damaging public property .
OTHER MAIN QASAB CHARGES
Firing at CST train station Firing inside and outside Cama Hospital Hijacking of Skoda vehicle Murder of MV Kuber boatman Firing at Girgaum Chowpatty beach
His trial , which is due to begin in April , is to be held in Mumbai 's maximum - security Arthur Road jail .
He could face the death penalty if found guilty .
Officials say the charge sheet against Qasab and other accused contains details of evidence pertaining to how the alleged conspiracy was hatched , how the gunmen entered Mumbai and the training in Pakistan .
Mumbai police say they are confident of their case because of the weight of evidence .
Relations between India and Pakistan have worsened considerably since the November attacks .
As well as accusing Lashkar - e - Taiba of being behind the attacks , India suggested that " state actors " in Pakistan were also involved .
Delhi has submitted a list of suspects to Pakistan and demanded they be handed over .
Both Pakistan and Lashkar have denied involvement .
However , Pakistan 's investigation last month found that at least nine suspected attackers had sailed from Karachi to Mumbai in three boats in November .
Pakistan says it has indicted eight people , six of whom have already been arrested , and that any trials will take place on its soil .

The new president ’s budget represents the climate of change Obama has brought to Washington , DC .
From reducing the deficit by 1/3 to allocating $ 634 billion for health care reform over the next decade , “ President Obama ’s new budget represents a huge break , not just with the policies of the past eight years , but with policy trends over the past 30 years , ” according to Paul Krugman of the New York Times .
In addition , Obama ’s budget promises to address climate change .
Obama ’s budget projects revenue from cap - and - trade sales will result in $ 150 billion over 10 years ( starting in 2012 ) that will be used to fund renewable energy projects .
The sale of emission permits will also create $ 65 billion a year to pay for middle - class tax credits .
Any additional revenue would be returned to families , communities and businesses to offset higher energy prices .
Again , this program reflects a departure from the previous administration in addressing climate change .
Krugman describes , “ After years of denial and delay by its predecessor , the Obama administration is signaling that it ’s ready to take on climate change , ” however , James Hansen has warned cap - and - trade is not the solution .
All pollution permits will be auctioned off under Obama ’s plan with the budget projecting emissions reductions targets of 14 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 .
Obama ’s budget also includes an increase of 34 percent in spending for the Environmental Protection Agency for clean water projects , regulations , research and enforcement .
For once , the presidents ’ budget blueprint does not ignore the environment , even if it relies heavily on cap - and - trade .
With just hours to go before the widespread Conficker worm is expected to activate , researchers say they 're relying on new efforts to help mitigate the risk and detect the worm itself .
And not a moment too soon .
The worm , which is also known as Downadup , Kido , Confick and the April Fool 's Day worm , is creating a vast botnet with an as - yet - unknown purpose .
One of the few facts researchers know about the worm is that it 's designed to begin seeking out new orders from its creators on April 1 .
Technology vendors are actively doing what they can to ensure that the worm is detected and blocked -- a massive undertaking that 's yielded some staggering statistics as the industry locks down botnet - controlled domains and hunts infected PCs .
" We have blocked over 300,000 names so far in the domains that we support , " Heather Read , senior director for communications at top - level domain ( TLD ) operator Afilias , told InternetNews.com .
" We expect that , over the course of the year , this number will be significantly more , likely in excess of one million names . "
Afilias is a member of the Conficker Working Group , which brings together TLD ( top level domain ) operators , industry leaders like Microsoft and ICANN , and security researchers .
Involving members of the domain community like Afilias , which currently supports 15 TLDs including.org , could be critical to helping stop the spread of Conficker .
The latest variants of the worm use randomly registered domains as part of its command - and - control network .
" The belief is that if we prevent the registration of these domains , we will deprive Conficker 's creators with Internet resources that they could potentially use to control and update the botnet , " Read said .
How many infections ?
Aside from its domain - based command - and - control network , Conficker at its most basic level is a Windows PC - based worm that affects consumer desktops .
And given the massive rate of Conficker - controlled domains , it 's no surprise that plenty of systems have been hijacked .
According to Jeffrey Shipley , manager of intelligence collection and analysis at Cisco Security Research and Operations , Conficker 's infection rates are relatively low in the U.S. , while higher in other areas .
Shipley told InternetNews.com that the Conficker .
C worm has infected about 10 million Windows - based computers in 150 countries , with China 's level of infection estimated at 3 million , Brazil at 1 million and Russia at 800,000 .
In the United States , researchers suspect about 200,000 computers have been infected .
As a middle - class white chick , I was n’t aware of my stereotypability until recently , when an older co-worker carelessly threw out the M - word .
Curious about the term , I googled “ Millenials ” and embarked upon a two - hour journey of self - exploration .
The verdict ?
Being a millennial is sweet .
For some reason , it turns out those of us born between ‘ 81 and ‘ 93 have a free pass to act like an asshole on the job .
Bad work ethic ?
Whoops – I ’m a millennial .
Showed up late every day this month ?
Millennial , again .
So what if you found me printing out the nudie fliers for my best friend ’s band ’s show on the company printers ?
I am a millennial , yo .
Calm the eff down .
According to Google , I ’m switching jobs in a few months .
Also according to Google : you ’re happy to deal with it .
All of it .
The discourse surrounding our generation is fantastic .
Everything pretty much says that the world and the workplace need to adapt to suit our unique needs .
From what I can gather , millennials need to sleep in late , wear casual clothing , and listen to iPods on the job .
We want to be buddy - buddy with our bosses and , not only do we need their constant approval , we need a raise ( or at least a gold star . )
Who needs hyper - involved parachute parents when you have national news media outlets like these :
“ The key to your organization 's future success is understanding how the Millennials view the world and using that knowledge to motivate them in a way that works .
Here 's a hint : meet them where they are and they will achieve your underlying goals ; try to force them to fit your definitions and they will run for the door every time . ”
No , that ’s not some crazy kid ’s craaaaazy blog .
That ’s printing - press - sanctioned , business - magazine truth .
For some reason , “ adults ” have decided that “ millennials ” are a different breed of human beings , who need to be treated with a very particular style of care .
I ’m guessing that they do this because , deep down , they know that somehow they irreversibly fucked us up .
But , just as I fully took advantage of the no-curfew rule that came along with my parents ’ divorce , I ’ll be sure to milk this one as well .
Israel 's military last night admitted that one of its tanks killed three girls at their home in Gaza during last month 's war in a case that shocked the Israeli public , but said the shelling was " reasonable . "
The Israeli military said two shells had hit the house of a Palestinian doctor , Izz el - Deen Abu el - Eish , on 16 January , killing his daughters .
Moments after their death the Hebrew - speaking gynaecologist was interviewed by mobile phone live on an Israeli television channel , screaming with grief in an extraordinary scene .
For most Israelis it was the first time they had seen such a striking case of civilian deaths in the war , even though hundreds of the 1,300 Palestinian dead were believed to be civilians .
The Channel 10 television correspondent who interviewed el - Eish arranged for the military to rush other injured members of the family to hospital in Israel for treatment , where they remain today .
The Israel Defence Force said soldiers from its Golani infantry brigade were under sniper and mortar fire in the area near the man 's house in Shujaiya , east of Gaza City .
It said soldiers identified " suspicious figures " in the house who they thought were " spotters " for Hamas fighters and opened fire , killing the girls .
" The IDF is saddened by the harm caused to the Abu el - Eish family , but at the same time states that considering the constraints of the battle scene , the amount of threats that endangered the force , and the intensity of fighting in the area , the forces ' action and the decision to fire towards the building were reasonable , " the military said .
Last night , el - Eish , who was still in hospital in Israel with his surviving relatives , said he was grateful his account of the incident had been recognised .
" Thank God the truth has been revealed , " he said .
" I was always sure that my case was just . "
The bird on Twitter 's home page , familiar to millions , is small , cute and fun , and implies communication and anticipation .
One might say it 's the perfect graphic for Twitter .
Yet the company paid its designer at most $ 6 , without attribution .
Some designers claim crowdsourcing is evil because it devalues their work by driving down prices , allowing amateurs into the game and forcing people to work " on spec , " meaning that they do n't get paid unless their design is chosen .
Others see it as a natural evolution driven by supply , demand and technology .

I absolutely loved the scenes in the Matrix where Neo dodges bullets .
Last week IBM was issued a patent that in theory would give us mortals that ability .
The patent proposes a system where an external device monitors the area for incoming projectiles .
If it detects a projectile headed near a person hooked into the system it can either shock their muscles in order to move their body a particular way to dodge the bullet , Neo style , or it could simply make the intended target collapse .
Figure from the patent .
From the patent :
The present invention relates generally to the protection of an individual against a projectile propelled from a firearm .
More particularly , the present invention relates to a body armor system and its method of use that is capable of detecting a projectile propelled from a firearm , computing the trajectory of the projectile , and moving the individual out of the path of the projectile to avoid being hit .
Historically , certain individuals have been exposed to the threat of assassination because of their status in society .
Examples of these individuals include , but are not limited to , high ranking politicians , clerics , successful industrial entrepreneurs , and military personnel .
These individuals tend to be most vulnerable during those times when they are publicly addressing large crowds , making them easy targets for snipers .
In the past , the only effective protection against “ sniper fire ” has been to wear bullet proof body armor… .
Furthermore using armor- piercing ammunition renders body - armors even less effective and desirable .
Obama surrounded by ballistic glass at the Inauguration .
At an event the size and important as a presidential Inauguration where the high ranking target can be protected this system is not really useful , but I can see how it could in situations where this kind of protection is just not possible .
Read the full patent here .
UPDATE : IBM withdrew the patent .
You can read a copy I made of it here .

A man arrested for his close links to Osama Bin Laden has asked to be allowed back into jail after his Wii was confiscated .
Mohamed Zeki Mahjoub , who is of Egyptian descent , was arrested in 2000 by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service under a ' security certificate ' after fears were raised concerning his links with militant organizations in the Middle East and Africa , as well as his role as a deputy general manager of a farm owned by Osama Bin laden .
Canadian authorities were unable to deport him , due to the risk of him being tortured by other governments , and so instead detained him in an Ottawa prison dubbed ' Guantanamo North ' for over six years .
A judge ordered him released in 2007 and he was subsequently granted bail under strict house arrest conditions .
After 18 months of almost constant surveillance , Mr. Mahjoub has asked to be returned to prison .
Why ?
Well , in part , because Canadian authorities have confiscated his family 's Wii .
As part of his bail conditions , Mr Mahjoub are prohibited from making any use of the internet , meaing that the Wii , which has a built - in web browser , had to go .
Mr Mahjoub cites this , and the other conditions of his house arrest , as having a detrimental effect on his family , and so asked to be returned to prison .
This request was denied , ironically because he had never been charged with any crime .
In an interview last year , Mr Mahjoub 's wife had this to say about the house arrest : " He 's feeling his children are getting punished , ( and he said ) ' they are not putting me only in jail , they are putting all of you in jail . "

President Obama ’s plan to stimulate the economy was “ massive , ” “ giant , ” “ enormous . ”
So the American people were told , especially by TV news , during the run-up to the stimulus vote .
Watching the news , you might have thought that the only question was whether the plan was too big , too ambitious .
Yet many economists , myself included , actually argued that the plan was too small and too cautious .
The latest data confirm those worries  and suggest that the Obama administration ’s economic policies are already falling behind the curve .
To see how bad the numbers are , consider this :
The administration ’s budget proposals , released less than two weeks ago , assumed an average unemployment rate of 8.1 percent for the whole of this year .
In reality , unemployment hit that level in February  and it ’s rising fast .
Employment has already fallen more in this recession than in the 1981 - 82 slump , considered the worst since the Great Depression .
As a result , Mr. Obama ’s promise that his plan will create or save 3.5 million jobs by the end of 2010 looks underwhelming , to say the least .
It ’s a credible promise  his economists used solidly mainstream estimates of the impacts of tax and spending policies .
But 3.5 million jobs almost two years from now is n’t enough in the face of an economy that has already lost 4.4 million jobs , and is losing 600,000 more each month .
Today 's announcement by the Federal Reserve that it intends to pour another $ 1.15 trillion into the economy in the form of $ 300 billion in FOMC treasury purchases and $ 850 billion in mortgage - related debt drove the precious metals markets crazy this afternoon , as they experienced tremendous volitility and heavy volume after the announcement .
Beyond that , the announcement really had very little effect .
The New York Stock Exchange experienced a mild rally , but not much else .
The lack of significant reaction from most of the markets shows just how quickly we 've become accustomed to throwing around the word “ trillions ” in news articles over the past year .
News articles on the subject of the latest deluge of cash sometimes bordered on the absurd .
The Wall Street Journal quoted financial house UBS as commenting , “ The U.S. is not explicitly targeting the money supply , like the Bank of England decided to do .
It is an important distinction which we think should fail to hurt the dollar on a sustained basis . ”
Not targeting the money supply explictly ?
What would be explicit enough … turning on printing presses to print the actual cash itself ?
At some point , one has to ask … when does all this money turn into inflation ?
History tells us it can take 1 - 5 years for price inflation to follow monetary inflation , and it usually only shows up in certain segments of the economy .
So , we can expect that this latest round will show up sometime between 2010 and 2014 .
Unfortunately , it will be hard to distinguish it from the other trillions added to the economy during the past nine months or so .
It 's becoming clear that more money has been pumped into the economy than has actually been lost in the form of defaulted mortgages … so far .
The Fed 's willingness to throw huge sums of money around has shown remarkably little “ positive ” impact on the economy .
This suggests to me that the ability of the Fed to “ stimulate ” the economy has definitely been overplayed .
The markets simply are n't responding the way they previously had to much smaller stimulations over the past 10 - 15 years .
I think this suggests that the debt - based nature of fiat money is finally starting to show its bloat .
Many people do n't realize that fiat money is debt - based , that every new dollar created is distributed by creating a debt , usually on behalf of the U.S. government .
Typically , the Fed “ stimulates ” the economy by creating more of it , while shunning anything that even hints at reducing money supply as much as possible , because such reductions tend to be recessionary .
The mortgage crisis has led to significant deflationary pressures , which of course are what are driving the emotions of the markets and the business community as a whole these days .
Yet , the overall effect of all the Fed 's most vigorous stimulation has n't even gotten the economy to get up off the couch and slouch into the kitchen for some junk food .
Bloat indeed !
What is forgotten by most , however , is that all this stimulation , no matter how inept it is proving to be so far , ultimately leads to greater debt .
Today , the national debt is more than $ 11 trillion .
That 's the same as 11 million times another million ….11 million millions .
It 's a number so horribly large that the human mind literally can't conceive of it in terms of real things .
Even the numerical representation is mind - bogglingly long …
$ 11,000,000,000,000 .
The only thing we know for sure about it is that it's a debt that we can reasonably believe will never be paid off .
That 's actually a depressing thought , because the only way in a fiat money supply to grow the economy is to inflate it further , thereby creating even more debt .
We are now long past the point of no return .
Even more importantly , UBS ( and many other people apparently ) are forgetting or else in denial that all that money inventually does lead to inflation , quite possibly hyperinflation at the rate they 're going .
The endgame approaches .
A week - long international conference ended Sunday in Istanbul with a statement that recognizes access to safe drinking water as a " basic human need , " but not a " human right , " as some delegates had proposed .
The statement , coinciding with the United Nations ' World Water Day , was issued at the end of a three - day ministerial meeting at the 5th annual World Water Forum in the Turkish city .
" We acknowledge the discussions with the UN system regarding human rights and access to safe drinking water and sanitation .
We recognize that access to safe drinking water and sanitation is a basic human need , " the statement said .
Dissenting countries challenge declaration
The lack of binding protocols at the forum , held every three years to safeguard the world 's freshwater supplies , prompted about 20 dissenting member countries to issue their own declaration , defining safe drinking water as a human right .
Countries that tried to beef up the wording of the official statement were blocked by Brazil , Egypt and the United States , Agence France Presse reported .
The Istanbul Ministerial Statement was adopted by ministers and heads of delegations from more than 150 countries .
They agreed to better manage water resources , strive to prevent pollution of surface and groundwater and improve water - related monitoring systems .
The event was sponsored by the World Water Council , a group made up of water specialists and international organizations .
More than a billion people lack access to clean water , and 2.5 billion are without water for sanitation , the UN estimates .
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicts that by 2030 , nearly half of the world 's population will be living in areas with freshwater shortages .
The OECD says most of the people affected will live in China and South Asia .
Canadian funding announced for water monitoring
On Saturday , Canada 's Environment Minister Jim Prentice announced the federal government could contribute $ 2.5 million over five years to the UN Environmental Program 's Global Environmental Monitoring System ( GEMS ) , in addition to the basic operating funding it already receives .
GEMS is a Canada - led United Nations water monitoring program that had been floating in cash - strapped limbo for the past three years .
The program used to receive a similar sized budget under the Liberals , but the Conservatives did not renew the full amount of funding when they came to power in 2006 , spurring criticism from inside GEMS and from environmental advocates .
The system is based in Burlington , Ont. , and tracks temperatures , metal content and other trends in inland water quality from 2,700 monitoring stations around the world .
Several UN agencies rely on the information , and the program offers training and advice for developing countries on how to set up water sampling programs .

South Korea military intelligence caught spying on citizens
February 2 , 2009 by intelNews
By IAN ALLEN | intelNews.org |
Since last December , a residential building scheduled for redevelopment in the Yongsan district of South Korean capital Seoul had been the site of a mass occupation campaign .
Dozens of protesters , all building residents , were refusing to leave unless they were offered improved compensation and relocation packages .
On January 20 , however , Seoul ’s riot police and SWAT units stormed the building using tear gas and water cannons .
During the operation , parts of the building were engulfed in a huge blaze , which caused the deaths of five protestors and one police officer , and injured 23 people , one of whom is reportedly in a coma .
On the evening of Saturday , January 31 , protestors who had gathered in and around Seoul ’s Myeongdong Cathedral for a candlelight memorial service for the victims of the fire spotted a group of plainclothes military intelligence officers with South Korea ’s Capital Defense Command ( CDC ) clandestinely observing the vigil .
The six - member group appeared to be directed by a number of commanding officers who were also in the proximity of the vigil , though detached from the crowd .
Organizers of the vigil isolated the six intelligence officers and proceeded to search them , but discovered no surveillance equipment .
Witnesses said , however , that one of the intelligence officers appeared to be reporting on the movements of vigil participants on his cell phone .
Questioned as to the reasons for their presence at the vigil , the officers responded that they were there “ to check if any soldiers were participating in the protest ” .
In a subsequent statement , the South Korean Army said the soldiers were “ engaged in preventative activities [ to ensure ] that servicemen out [ for ] the weekend did not get involved in the protest crowds ” .
The vigil was attended by approximately 10,000 people .
ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( Reuters ) - Twenty years ago , when crude oil was gushing out of the wrecked Exxon Valdez supertanker and Prince William Sound was being blackened by what would become the nation ’s worst tanker spill , oil giant Exxon Corp was vilified in Alaska .
On his hands and knees , a member of the cealn up crew scrubs the oil soaked rocks on Naked Island in the Prince William Sound , April 2 , 1989 after the worst oil spill in U.S. history , cased by the Exxon tanker Valdez .
REUTERES / Mike Blake
Bumper stickers said the corporation ’s name was the “ sign of the double - cross . ”
A sarcastic T - shirt took jabs at the company ’s perceived arrogance , proclaiming : “ Exxon : We Do n’t Care .
We Do n’t Have to Care . ”
Today , Exxon Mobil Corp , as the company is now known , is expanding in Alaska and officials are striking a conciliatory tone about the tanker disaster that has defined the company in Alaska and much of the world .
“ The event around Valdez , you ca n’t overstate how tragic it was and how it was such a low point for the company in our 125 - year history , ” said company spokesman Alan Jeffers .
“ We understand the feelings of the people of Alaska about the spill itself and the continuing impact that it had and recognize how difficult it was . ”
As economic malaise forces other oil companies to cut back , delay projects and lay off employees , Exxon has embarked on this season ’s biggest new project in Alaska ’s petroleum - rich North Slope region -- a 50 - mile ( 80 - kilometre ) ice road , and a two - well drilling program at the long - dormant Point Thomson field .
The company has put over 250 employees and contract workers on duty at Point Thomson , despite a legal dispute in which the state is trying to revoke leases for nonperformance .
Exxon has tripled its Anchorage office space , said Craig Haymes , the company ’s Alaska production manager .
It is actively examining options for a massive natural gas pipeline , he said .
And it has boosted its community contributions .
This year , Exxon became one of the four prime sponsors of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race , ponying up $ 1.25 million over five years .
This is all part of a move into a higher - profile role as an oil - field operator rather than a mere investor in the North Slope ’s Prudhoe Bay and other properties operated by other oil companies such as BP Plc or ConocoPhillips , according to Exxon officials .
“ We ’ve been in Alaska for 50 years .
We ’ll be here for another 50 years , ” Haymes said .
DAMAGE REMAINS
But with still - pungent oil lingering on some beaches , Prince William Sound herring stocks nearly wiped out by an epidemic that fishermen believe was triggered by the spill , various animal populations depleted and residents exhausted by long years of still - unresolved litigation , many Alaskans are still bitter .
A June 25 U.S. Supreme Court decision , which shrank a punitive award that had originally been $ 5 billion to a mere $ 507.5 million , was devastating to fishermen , Alaska Natives and other spill litigants .
Meanwhile , Exxon is prospering , with more than $ 30 billion in cash on its balance sheet .
“ Exxon is very , very healthy , unlike Prince William Sound , ” said state Senator Hollis French , an Anchorage Democrat .
“ I think Alaskans for several generations will have a bad taste in their mouths from that incident . ”
Some political experts say lingering anger at Exxon has been reflected in state policy .
A year ago , Governor Sarah Palin suggested Exxon was unwanted as a partner in a long - desired but as - yet - unbuilt North Slope natural gas pipeline .
“ The sentiment shared by a lot of Alaskans is , you know , Exxon , do n’t let the door hit you in the stern on your way out if you choose not to participate in progressing development of Alaska ’s resources , ” Palin said at a news conference a year ago .
Alaska ’s Natural Resources Commissioner Tom Irwin , who has been in the forefront of the battle to revoke Point Thomson leases so that they can be sold to other companies , once issued a statement saying he “ did not trust ” Exxon to follow through with its promises .
Still , French said , if Exxon is trying to improve its operations and make more contributions to Alaska ’s economy and nonprofit organizations , the move should be welcomed .
“ They should n’t be punished or excoriated for that , ” he said .

6 Richie Rich feat .
Tupac - " Niggas Done Changed "
Let 's just get it out of the way : Nobody knows who the hell Richie Rich is .
According to the lyrics of this song , he 's got a hand full of game .
For all we know , that is still true .
Maybe even a sack full of game by now .
We do n't care .
The real star of this tune , featured on the Seasoned Veteran album , is Tupac Shakur .
His verse on " Niggas Done Changed " is the stuff that conspiracy theories are made of .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
This probably is n't the right one .
Unfortunate Lyrics :
" I been shot and murdered , can tell you how it happened word for word ,
But best believe niggas gon ' get what they deserve . "
What Happened Next :
Pac was shot and murdered , just like he said .
The shooting happened on the strip in Vegas after a Mike Tyson fight .
Obviously , at a time like that not many people were around , so nobody saw the shooter and the case remains unsolved .
Unsolved for most people anyway .
Some others are convinced they know exactly what happened .
Tupac faked his own death !
The logic went as follows : Since Italian philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli advocated faking one 's own death , and Tupac used Makaveli as a stage name , then he must still be alive .
That 's shaky reasoning , even before you take into account that the real Machiavelli did n't actually say much of anything about faking your own death .

If he was dead , could he do this ?
But when " Niggas Done Changed " was released less than two months following Tupac 's death , the " Pac 's Still Alive " movement was off and running , and it has n't let up since .
Group psychology experts contacted by Cracked attribute the movement 's seeming refusal to die ( sorry ) to the fact that Tupac Shakur has released at least seventy - three studio albums since his death and also to the fact that he 's totally alive , y'all .
The Canadian immigration minister Jason Kenney gazetted in the Sun yesterday morning that I was to be excluded from his country because of my views on Afghanistan .
That 's the way the rightwing , last - ditch dead - enders of Bushism in Ottawa conduct their business .
Kenney is quite a card .
A quick trawl establishes he 's a gay - baiter , gung - ho armchair warrior , with an odd habit of exceeding his immigration brief .
Three years ago he attacked the pro-western Lebanese prime minister , Fuad Siniora , for being ungrateful to Canada for its support of Israeli bombardment of his country .
Most curiously of all , in 2006 he addressed a rally of the so - called People 's Mujahideen of Iran , a Waco - style cult , banned in the European Union as a terrorist organisation .
On one level being banned by such a man is like being told to sit up straight by the hunchback of Notre Dame or being lectured on due diligence by Conrad Black .
On another , for a Scotsman to be excluded from Canada is like being turned away from the family home .
But what are my views on Afghanistan which the Canadian government does not want its people to hear ?
I 've never been to Afghanistan , nor have I ever met a Taliban , but my first impression into the parliamentary vellum on the subject was more than two decades ago .
At the time the fathers of the Taliban were " freedom fighters " , paraded at US Republican and British Tory conferences .
Who knows , maybe even the Canadian right extolled these god-fearing opponents of communism .
I did not , however .
On the eve of their storming of Kabul I told Margaret Thatcher that she " had opened the gates to the barbarians " and that " a long , dark night would now descend upon the people of Afghanistan " .
With the same conviction , I say to the Canadian and other Nato governments today that your policy is equally a profound mistake .
From time to time and with increased regularity it is a crime .
Like the bombardment of wedding parties and even funerals or the presiding over a record opium crop , which under our noses finds its way coursing through the veins of young people from Nova Scotia to Newcastle upon Tyne .
But it is worse than a crime , as Tallyrand said , it 's a blunder .
The Afghans have never succumbed to foreign occupation , heaven knows the British empire tried , tried and failed again .
Not even Alexander the Great succeeded , and whoever else he is , minister Kenney is no Alexander the Great .
Young Canadian soldiers are dying in significant numbers on Afghanistan 's plains .
Their families are entitled to know how many of us believe this adventure to be similarly doomed and that genuine support for troops - British , Canadian and other - means bringing them home and changing course .
To ban a five - times elected British MP from addressing public events or keeping appointments with television and radio programmes is a serious matter .
Kenney 's " spokesman " told the Sun , " Galloway 's not coming in ... end of story . "
Alas for him , it 's not .
Canada remains a free country governed by law and my friends are even now seeking a judicial review .
And there are other ways I can address those Canadians who wish to hear me .
More than half a century ago Paul Robeson , one of the greatest men who ever lived , was forbidden to enter Canada not by Ottawa but by Washington , which had taken away his passport .
But he was still able to transfix a vast crowd of Vancouver 's mill hands and miners with a 17 - minute telephone concert , culminating in a rendition of the Ballad of Joe Hill .
Technology has moved on since then .
And so from coast to coast , minister Kenney notwithstanding , I will be heard - one way or another .

The GUI released by HP for its Mini Mi netbook has been winning accolades for its high design standards .
The interface offers pleasing shiny black eye candy that some sites are comparing to Apple design .
The GUI provides an integrated starting point for many day - to - day tasks .
You can search the web , visit your favorite bookmarks , and navigate through your applications ( sorted by categories like Media , Work , and Play ) , all in a friendly task - oriented GUI .
DownloadSquad writes that HP MediaStyle application looks a lot like Apple 's FrontRow .
Admittedly , this comparison to Apple design is not universally accepted .
For my tastes , the HP fonts are too thin , the icons too small , the layout less than optimal .
Leaving criticisms aside , it cannot be denied the HP GUI offers a professionally put together presentation .
You can decide for yourself whether that presentation stands apart from other Linux distros .
Over at the Ubuntu forums , users are installing the HP Mobile Experience Interface on various Ubuntu distributions .
Since the full software restore package would not run on the hardware for most people , the challenge has been to extract just the critical GUI elements that people need .
The theme in question is called " glassy - bleu " , and to date has been installed onto many Ubuntu versions and any number of hardware platforms .
Forum posters reported success on the EEE PC , Nokia 770 , and even a Macbook Air under VMware .
A couple of posters named wildcard and rafaelcapanema have isolated a base set of .deb files .
Compiled for " all " platforms , these files work on 386 and 64 - bit distros .
They have posted instructions on how to install these .
Forum participants are reporting many successes on various platforms using these files .
If you 're a Ubuntu user and are considering giving the theme a spin , make sure to check out the entire thread .
Installation and use are not as clear - cut as you might hope and there is a real risk involved , particularly for users who are not experienced with these kinds of mods .
You may have to do a little clean - up work on Open Office and a few other packages .
But as one poster writes , " I love this new look ! " and you may too .
A voice analysis system is heralded as the answer to millions lost through fraud - yet two academics claim it is about as valid as astrology
It may seem contrary - even churlish - to doubt a technology claimed to have prevented millions of pounds of fraudulent insurance and benefit claims around the world .
Yet that 's what Francisco Lacerda , a professor of linguistics at Stockholm University , and Anders Eriksson , professor of phonetics at Gothenburg University , have done in a scientific paper .
They say the system , used to try to detect people lying in phone calls made to 25 UK councils and a number of car insurers , is no more reliable than flipping a coin - and that millions of pounds have been spent on a technology that has not been validated scientifically , and for which the claims about its function are " at the astrology end of the validity spectrum " .
The claims publicly made for the voice risk analysis ( VRA ) software being used by trained operators at some local councils since May 2007 sound impressive .

The Department for Work and Pensions has already spent £ 1.5 m installing 150 " seats " of the software - plus training from its UK reseller , Amersham - based DigiLog , for each group - in councils , as part of two sets of pilot tests of the VRA system .
Insurance claim
Highway Insurance , which has used DigiLog 's product since 2002 , claimed in 2007 that the system has " successfully prevented more than £ 11 m in potentially fraudulent motor insurance claims " because " Highway has screened nearly 19,000 motor claims cases since 2002 , with more than 15 % repudiated or withdrawn . "
That suggests the system works .
But perhaps the wording is important : it says they were potentially , not demonstrably , fraudulent .
Scientists say telling people they are being monitored by a " lie detector " ( real or not ) makes them more likely to be truthful .
The example cited in Lacerda and Eriksson 's paper is of prison inmates interviewed about their drug use , and then tested by urinalysis and hair samples - an objective method .
With " lie detection " , only 14 % lied ; without it , 40 % did .
The software is from Nemesysco , an Israeli company , which licenses DigiLog to sell it in the UK .
Sales to the government are handled jointly by DigiLog ( which does the staff training ) and Capita .
Nemesysco claims it applies " layered voice analysis " ( LVA ) : " LVA uses a patented technology to detect ' brain activity traces ' using the voice as a medium .
By utilising a wide - range spectrum analysis to detect minute involuntary changes in the speech waveform itself , LVA can detect anomalies in brain activity and classify them in terms of stress , excitement , deception and varying emotional states " .
In the UK , the system is known as VRA .
Callers to Harrow council to make a housing benefit claim are warned their call may be subjected to voice analysis .
The DigiLog software monitors the line that operator is on : if it reckons patterns in the voice indicate some form of stress , the operator hears a beep .
Thus alerted , the operator is trained to begin asking questions that may uncover the truth .
Harrow visits anyone who chooses not to take part in a VRA call ; it says there has been only one complaint since its introduction , " indicating that customers do not feel intimidated by the process " .
It claims the technology has saved it about £ 110,000 in benefits payments , helped identify 126 incorrectly awarded single - person council tax discounts - worth £ 40,000 - and prompted reviews of 304 claims .
Of these , 47 were no longer valid , saving another £ 70,000 .
Birmingham city council is equivocal : no prosecutions have followed VRA 's use - and in some cases , the benefits paid have even been raised .
Yet nobody testing the system seems to have tried generating the beep in the operator 's ear by the electronic equivalent of a coin flip .
Measuring the difference in effectiveness between random beeps and the proper system ( without telling the operator ) would be a scientific " blind " test : that could show whether the system is worth its cost or whether it was just the more assertive questions , allied to the " lie detector " warning , that made the difference .
In the absence of such scientific investigation , the next best step is to analyse the software .
In a paper titled " Charlatanry in forensic speech science : a problem to be taken seriously " , published in the International Journal of Speech , Language and the Law , Eriksson and Lacerda analysed the code in the 2003 patent for Nemesysco 's software .
They say it comprises about 500 lines in Microsoft 's simple Visual Basic programming language .
That code carries out the signal analysis , they say , and then offers the multiple levels of " certainty " to operators trying to decide whether someone is being truthful .
Call their bluff
" At best , this thing is giving you an indication of how [ voice ] pitch is changing , " Lacerda told the Guardian .
" But there 's so much contamination by other [ noise ] factors that it's a rather crude measure . "
In the paper - which has been withdrawn from the website of its publisher , Equinox Publishing , after complaints from Nemesysco 's founder that it contains personal attacks - the scientists say the scientific provability of the Nemesysco code is akin to astrology .
The deterrent effect " is no proof of validity , just a demonstration that it is possible to take advantage of a bluff " .
That chimes with one specialist , who spoke on condition of remaining anonymous .
" Nobody seems to have done any sensible research into this , " he says .
" [ The clients have ] all talked to salesmen rather than scientists .
Study after study shows low validity , and chance level for reliability .
But people wo n't listen .
They do n't try them in controlled trials ; they make a public announcement they 're using it , then feel happy they 've got a 30 % fall in claims .
It 's called the ' bogus pipeline effect ' .
People are frightened [ of the threat ] . "
Stress at work
But Lior Koskas , the business development manager of DigiLog , says the VRA system cannot be separated from its user , because the system only picks up stress .
He does not claim it spots " lies " on its own .
" Only when the technology and an operator trained by us spots it , then can we say there 's a risk someone is lying . "
Has there been a scientific " blind test " of the system ?
" No , " Koskas says , " you ca n't say you 're using something if you are n't . "
He adds that the technology " has n't been scientifically validated " , but he rejects Lacerda and Eriksson 's criticisms .
" With any technology you will have opinions , " he says .
" But how many of these scientists have tested it properly ?
They talk about the technology in isolation , as though you do n't need anything from the operator except turning it on or off .
But the majority of the training course is about linguistic training analysis , learning to listen .
Anybody using this [ technology ] in the UK does n't use it in isolation . "
What would Lacerda advise the government and companies considering spending money on the system to do ?
" Spend it on educating the people who are going to interview people , because that would be much more valid and ethically sensible . "
Yossi Pinkas , Nemesysco's vice - president of sales and marketing , insists the system " ca n't be tested in a lab environment , because you 're testing emotion " .
To him , Lacerda and Eriksson 's analysis is flawed because " there 's no scientific field of ' voice analysis ' , only voice recognition " .
Thousands of children on feeding programmes face starvation , patients awaiting surgery have been left in doctorless wards and 90,000 refugees are now defenceless against a deadly meningitis outbreak in a single camp in Darfur , say international aid workers expelled from Sudan .
" A lot of lives will be lost , " said Dr Philip Ejikon , from the Dutch division of Medécins Sans Frontières , in Nairobi yesterday .
MSF
Holland 's operations which had been providing basic medical care to as many as 450,000 Darfuris have been dismantled .
The expulsions were a retaliation for the international warrant charging President Omar al - Bashir with war crimes in Darfur , where a rebel war is raging .
" They targeted large organisations which did large food operations , medical programmes , water and sanitation , " said MSF Holland 's general director Hans van de Weerd .
He said his organisation alone was feeding 2,000 young children and had delivered 50,000 babies in the past year .

Chris Dodd Admits He Wrote the Amendment That Allowed AIG to Hand Out Bonuses
Yesterday I wrote a post about how Chris Dodd inserted an amendment into the stimulus bill that permitted AIG to pay out the bonuses to its executives .
Since the news broke about the Dodd amendment Chris Dodd has been denying that he wrote any such amendment .
He has been trying to distance himself from this controversy .
But Chris Dodd has now admitted that he did insert the amendment into the stimulus bill that gave AIG permission to pay its executives $ 165 million in bonuses .
We wrote the language in the bill , the deal with bonuses , golden parachutes , excessive executive compensation that was adopted unanimously by the United States Senate in the stimulus bill , ” Dodd told CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer this afternoon .
It should come as no surprise that Dodd wrote these protections into the stimulus bill for AIG after it was learned that AIG donated over $ 100,000 to the Dodd campaign .
This man has been exposed , he is the man responsible for the $ 165 million in bonuses that has become the hottest topic on capital hill .
While all of these self - righteous politicians grill the executives at AIG and condemn them they let people like Chris Dodd off the hook .
There would have been no bonuses without Chris Dodd , maybe they should put Chris Dodd on the stand .
How would you like to see the following exchange :
Frank :
Did you write the amendment ?
Dodd : you want answers ?
Frank : I want the truth !
Dodd : you ca n’t handle the truth !
Frank : did you write the amendment ?
Dodd : you ’re goddamn right I did !
- Walt Whitman ( “ Democratic Vista , ” 1871 ) .
" The United States will never be Europe .
It was born as a commercial republic .
It ’s addicted to the pace of commercial enterprise .
After periodic pauses , the country inevitably returns to its elemental nature .
The U.S. is in one of those pauses today .
It has been odd , over the past six months , not to have the gospel of success as part of the normal background music of life .
You go about your day , taking in the news and the new movies , books and songs , and only gradually do you become aware that there is an absence .
There are no aspirational stories of rags - to - riches success floating around .
There are no new how - to - get - rich enthusiasms .
There are few magazine covers breathlessly telling readers that some new possibility — biotechnology , nanotechnology — is about to change everything .
That part of American culture that stokes ambition and encourages risk has gone silent .
We are now in an astonishingly noncommercial moment .
Risk is out of favor .
The financial world is abashed .
Enterprise is suspended .
The public culture is dominated by one downbeat story after another as members of the educated class explore and enjoy the humiliation of the capitalist vulgarians .
Washington is temporarily at the center of the nation ’s economic gravity and a noncommercial administration holds sway .
This is an administration that has many lawyers and academics but almost no businesspeople in it , let alone self - made entrepreneurs .
The president speaks passionately about education and health care reform , but he is strangely aloof from the banking crisis and displays no passion when speaking about commercial drive and success .
But if there is one thing we can be sure of , this pause will not last .
The cultural DNA of the past 400 years will not be erased .
The pendulum will swing hard .
The gospel of success will recapture the imagination .
Walt Whitman got America right in his essay , “ Democratic Vistas . ”
He acknowledged the vulgarity of the American success drive .
He toted up its moral failings .
But in the end , he accepted his country ’s “ extreme business energy , ” its “ almost maniacal appetite for wealth . ”
He knew that the country ’s dreams were all built upon that energy and drive , and eventually the spirit of commercial optimism would always prevail . ”

This is Part 3 in a series on Passive Solar Design by Will Stewart , a Systems Engineer in the energy industry and longtime reader of theoildrum.com .
As a new administration considers how best to make future infrastructure investments , it seems like some of the lowest hanging fruit is better utilization of the daily solar flux , not only directly with photovoltaic and hot water , but also in building construction and placement .
I encourage our readers to further their understanding of passive solar concepts by reading / bookmarking this series .
Passive Solar Design Overview : Part 3 – Thermal Storage Mass
In Part 1 of this series , we looked at the three main architectural styles of passive solar design ( Direct Gain , Indirect Gain , and Isolated Gain ) , as well as the first of the five design aspects , Aperture .
In Part 2 , we covered heat transfer , building heat gain and loss , and Absorbers .
This article will present an over of the next design aspect , Thermal Mass , which is one of the main factors in avoiding passive solar overheating in the daytime and excessive cooling at night .
Mornings are typically the coldest times for some passive solar homes , and this article aims to provide help to those who want to design their next home or renovate their existing one to provide moderation in heating , cooling , or both .
If the sun shone steadily upon our home or office 24 hours per day , we could simply size the equatorial - facing windows to collect just the right amount of sun for winter heating and be done .
However , as the effective sunlight available in winter can be short - lived , in order to keep a reasonably stable temperature before the sun comes back up again , the passive building design must account for storage of warm thermal energy in the form of mass storage .
The location , materials , shape , and size are the important aspects of mass storage ( though shape is an advanced topic beyond the scope of this overview , as are detailed calculations of heat re-release via radiation and convection ) .
Thermal storage techniques can vary widely between regions that tend to be closer to the tropics vs. regions that are closer to the poles .
It should be pointed out that virtually all buildings have incidental mass storage in the form of furniture , wallboard , wood or masonry flooring , and so forth .
This is usually not anywhere near the amount of storage needed , though with a superinsulation design approach it can supply an appreciable amount .
As noted in Part 1 , passive solar techniques can be combined with active solar techniques ; for example , a thermal mass floor heated directly by the sun could also be integrated ( during the design / construction phase ) with a radiant floor system heated on cloudy days by stored hot water from an active solar heating system .
Figure 7 - Indirect solar gain
Figure 8 - Isolated Gain
Interior wall mass storage : Interior walls , whether warmed directly by the sun part of the time or indirectly from reflections Standing walls : Similar to trombe walls , but are shorter and non-bearing , some providing a view out of the windows and easier access to insulating shades .
External wall mass storage :
Thick external masonry or log walls with little to no insulation that moderate swings in outside temperature in warmer climates where the average daily temperature is close to ( or in ) the ' comfort zone ' ( i.e. , Southern California , Mediterranean , etc ) .
Solar insolation on these external walls is also a factor , indeed a special case .
Please note : in cool and cold climates , any thermal mass outside of the wall 's insulation layer has little to no thermal storage effect in winter .
Roof pond mass storage : A pond on the roof with thermal ' visibility ' into the house , warmed during the day , covered with insulation at night [ 5 ]
Earth mass storage : Partially ( or fully ) undeground house that uses the earth as thermal mass store .
Annualized Geo Storage :
An extension of simple earth mass storage ( see figure 13 ) .
Hot air is collected year around and thermosiphoned down through a thermal mass wall in the winter ( or via fan - driven bypass in the summer , making it active ) and through the earth beneath a building [ 6 ] .
To review the 3 main styles of passive solar design , there is ( sunlight enters through windows into the living space ) , , and There are also variants to these styles , with six examples below ( many other variants exist ) ;
Beside structural and aesthetic considerations , the main thermal mass properties we are interested in are ;
specific heat ( c ) : the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a unit weight of material one degree .
For example , it take 1 BTU to raise 1 pound of water 1 degree F .
( ) : the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a unit weight of material one degree .
For example , it take 1 BTU to raise 1 pound of water 1 degree F. density ( ρ ) : the mass per unit volume for a material .
For example , water weighs 8.33 pounds per gallon ( lb/ gal ) or 1 kg / litre .
( ) : the mass per unit volume for a material .
For example , water weighs 8.33 pounds per gallon ( lb/ gal ) or 1 kg / litre .
thermal conductivity ( k ) : the rate at which heat travels through a material .
For example , for each degree F difference between one side of a 1 foot concrete wall and another , heat travels through every square foot of that wall at 0.833 BTUs per hour ( see value in Table 2 ) .
( ) : the rate at which heat travels through a material .
For example , for each degree F difference between one side of a 1 foot concrete wall and another , heat travels through every square foot of that wall at 0.833 BTUs per hour ( see value in Table 2 ) .
thermal resistivity ( r ) : the inverse of the conductivity .
( ) : the inverse of the conductivity .
heat capacity ( β ) : specific heat times density ( cρ ) , which determines how much heat energy a material can hold
Because we are EROEI - aware here at TOD , we also want to know how much energy was involved in the production and handling of the materials , called embodied energy .
The values shown are approximates , as material hauling energy varies widely .
Note that some of these values are often listed in other units ( e.g. , conductivity as BTU ·in / hr F ft2 ) and careful attention must be paid to calculating units correctly ( such as inches , feet , meters , cm , temperature scales , etc ) .

Any convection of the fluid within the storage media increases the rate of heat transfer
The embodied energy of Green Brick is only 168 BTUs / lb , due to use of recycled materials ( at factory shipping dock ) .
The embodied energy of " Green Concrete " ( slag concrete ) is 50 % lower ( at factory shipping dock ) .
The R - Value and U - Value of a material can be calculated from the their resistivity and conductivity :
R - Value = rd , and
U - Value = k/d
same units
where : d = thickness ( in theas in density and area )
Example : The R - Value of a 4 " typical cellulose batt is ;
R-Value = 37 x 4/12 = 12.3
Note that the overall R-value of the non-window portion of a wall includes not only the insulation , but the framing ( studs ) as well .
Framing can create a less resistive path for heat loss ( or gain ) ; this effect is referred to as thermal bridging .
This reference derives realistic R - values for various wall types .
Up to this point , we have been looking at materials that stored sensible heat , that is , heat one can sense when raising the temperature of a substance by some number of degrees .
But when materials change phase from solid to liquid , or liquid to gas ( excluding triple point ) , a large amount of energy is expended just to realize the phase change ; this is called latent heat of fusion ( or melting ) .
For example , remember that it takes 1 BTU to raise 1 lb of water 1 degree F. However , it takes 144 BTUs to melt 1 lb of ice at 32 F to water at 32 F .
There are commercially available phase change materials ( PCM ) that change from solid to liquid in the temperature ranges that are suitable for building applications .
Due to the tremendously larger amount of BTUs that can be ' stored ' via phase change , significant size reductions can be possible , though most such phase change materials have less latent heat capacity than water .
The materials can be contained in tanks , embedded into other sensible thermal mass in a hybrid fashion , or incorporated into building materials , such as PCM impregnated wall board [ 7 ] [ 8 ] and even insulation .
The use of such building materials can greatly reduce ( or eliminate completely ) the need for other thermal mass storage .
Once we know the heat capacity and conductivity of a material , the size of the thermal mass is the remaining factor that determines the number of hours or days the thermal mass continues to moderate the building temperature , whether providing warmth or coolth .
At this point , the general readership may prefer to examine rules of thumb that some designers in the industry have followed , such as these from the Arizona Solar Center ;
* masonry and concrete floors , walls and ceilings to be used for heat storage should be a minimum of 4 inches thick .
* sunlight should be distributed over as much of the storage mass surface as possible by using translucent glazing .
* a number of small windows to admit sunlight in patches gives better control re : overheating .
* use light colored surfaces ( non-thermal mass storage walls , ceilings , floors ) to reflect sunlight to thermal storage mass elements .
* thermal storage mass elements ( floors , walls , ceilings ) should b dark in color .
* masonry floors used for thermal mass should not be covered with wall - to - wall carpeting .
* the most favorable storage occurs when each square foot of sunlight is spread ( diffused ) over a nine square foot area of storage surface .
* the most efficient way to increase heat storage capacity is to increase the storage surface area and the distribution of sunlight rather than the thickness of the storage mass , because masonry absorbs heat slowly , and intense sunlight on a small area will have a negative affect by increasing room temperature while not significantly increasing the rate heat is absorbed by the storage mass , while a system using dispersed , less intense radiation across a larger surface of thermal mass storage will moderate room temperature fluctuations and store most heat at the same time .
and these rules of thumb from GreenBuilder.com ;
* A heat load analysis of the house should be conducted .
* Do not exceed 6 inches of thickness in thermal mass materials .
* For every square foot of south glass , use 150 pounds of masonry or 4 gallons of water for thermal mass .
* Fill the cavities of any concrete block used as thermal storage with concrete .
* Use thermal mass at less thickness throughout the living space rather than a concentrated area of thicker mass .
* The surface area of mass exposed to direct sunlight should be 9 times the area of the glazing .
* Sun tempering is the use of direct gain without added thermal mass .
For most homes , multiply the house square footage by 0.08 to determine the amount of south facing glass for sun tempering .
TTC A = R os + Q A R

While the rules of thumb above may be helpful , most designers and architects are driven to achieve a more exacting level of performance of the buildings they are designing .
For those who prefer to delve a little further into the engineering side , the next important concept to understand is the , or the thermal inertia of the building taking into considertion the building 's insulating properties .
The greater the TTC , the lower the temperature swing , and the greater the time lag it takes to reach the maximum and minimum temperatures ( see figure 14 ) .
The following sets of formulas might appear dizzying to some ; fortunately , there are software applications available that calculate all of this for us by simply entering the specifics of the building materials and dimensions , so do n't be put off by the math .
For each exterior surface in the building , we can perform a simple estimation of the TTC per unit area ( more detail can be added if desired [ 9 ] [ 10 ] ) ; [ 11 ] where : = c*d*ρd = thickness ( in the same units as in density and area ) R = d/k= resistance of outside still air film ( neglible in a breeze or with superinsulation ) For a composite surface of multiple layers , starting from the outside layer as " 1 " ;
TTC A =Q A1 ( R os + 0.5R 1 ) +Q A2 ( R os + R 1 + 0.5R 2 ) + Q A3 ( R os + R 1 + R 2 +0.5R 3 ) ... [ 13 ]
See an example of multi-layer TTC calculations that show how having thermal mass on the inside of insulation gives a much higher TTC than having thermal mass on the outside of insulation [ 12 ] .
For those considering renovating a building with exterior masonry walls , this is an extremely important factor in determining your design approach .
To determine the TTC of a surface area ;
TTC s = A s * TTC s [ 14 ]
where :
A s = area of surface
Forexternal surfaces in the building ;
TTC ext. surfaces = Σ TTC s /A total [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
To take into account any other interior thermal mass ( e.g. , partition walls , standing water walls , insulated masonry slab , etc ) , we can approximate the overall effective thermal mass ;
TTC total = TTC ext. surfaces + Σ M i β i /k i d i &rho i
where : M = mass of individual interior objects
The TTC can sometimes be empirically determined in a real world setting for existing buildings by starting off with a known interior temperature , then observing the temperature change over a number of hours ( with a different outside temperature ) .
Outside temperatures do n't always stay the same , so more advanced calculations may be needed .
TTC = t/( 1-[( T t - T start ) / ΔT ] )
t
[ 15 ] where : t = time in hours= ending interior temperatureΔT = difference between inside and outside temperatures
The diurnal heat constant ( DHC ) is very similar , though even more importantly tells us the building ’s capacity to absorb solar energy coming into the interior of the space and release the heat to the interior for a given period P .
DHC surface = F 1 s
1
[ 12 ] where : ( checkmark is symbol for square root in simple html ) = √ ( cosh 2 x - cos 2 x ) ( cosh 2 x + cos 2x ) x = d√πρc / Pks = √ Pkρc /2πP = period ( 24 hours )
The overall DHC of a building is the summation the DHC values of each surface in contact with the interior air ;
DHC total = Σ DHC surface A surface [ 12 ]
ΔT ( swing ) = 0.61Q gain / DHC total
gain
Now we have come full circle since determining the daily heat gain at the beginning of Part 2 , and can calculate the total variation in indoor temperature ; [ 12 ] where : ΔT ( swing ) = the difference between the minimum and maximum interior temperatures .= the daily building energy gain calculated above .
We can iterate to find the size of the mass we need to stay within the desired maximum temperature swing .
To design for a number of cloudy days , change the value of P ( for example , to have sufficient thermal mass for 3 heavily cloudy days , P = 3 ) .
Spreadsheets make this much easier to " what if " .
As we 've seen above , the ordering of the insulation and mass layers greatly effects the temperature swing and time lag of the interior temperature .
The TTC value is most important when considering heat loss / gain across wall / window surfaces with little to no solar gain and without summer night time " flushing " of cooler air through the house .
Use of solar gain or summer night cool air flushing shifts our focus to the DHC value .
Different approaches can be evaluated by the placement of insulation and thermal mass [ 12 ] ;
High insulation , low thermal mass : Results in a low TTC and low DHC , so while the heat loss across highly insulated surfaces is low , there is still higher levels of heat loss through windows .
The internal temperature is subject higher daily swings without thermal mass and such a building is a poor candidate for passive solar heating or cooling .
: Results in a low TTC and low DHC , so while the heat loss across highly insulated surfaces is low , there is still higher levels of heat loss through windows .
The internal temperature is subject higher daily swings without thermal mass and such a building is a poor candidate for passive solar heating or cooling .
External insulation , internal thermal mass :
A high TTC and high DHC , providing a moderation of the indoor temperature during the winter and summer from winter solar gain and summer night time flushing .
: A high TTC and high DHC , providing a moderation of the indoor temperature during the winter and summer from winter solar gain and summer night time flushing .
Internal insulation , external thermal mass :
A low TTC and low DHC , providing very little temperature moderation .
The internal temperature is subject higher daily swings and such a building is a poor candidate for passive solar heating or cooling .
: A low TTC and low DHC , providing very little temperature moderation .
The internal temperature is subject higher daily swings and such a building is a poor candidate for passive solar heating or cooling .
Internal and external insulation , encased thermal mass : Common with insulating concrete forms ( ICF ) , provides a medium - high TTC , but a low DHC , so while it is somewhat effective for moderating temperatures generally , this approach does not store heat from passive solar insolation , nor does it cool off on summer nights with cool air flushing .
We have touched on many of the basic points concerning Thermal Mass , though there are still more details to cover to finalize a complete passive solar design in these areas .
The good news is ; design tools are available to automate the selection and calculation of formulas , as we will see in later articles .
Continuing the series , Part 4 will complete the rest of the design aspects ( Distribution and Controls ) , followed by several other articles in the series devoted to renovation , design tools , green building standards , case studies , and more .

Stop Spiritual Witchcraft , Demons , And Controlling Powers
The spiritual warfare attacks against you are often referred to as witchcraft attacks .
Witchcraft attacks have nothing to do with Wicca , New Age mysticism , or the religion of witchcraft .
Witchcraft in this context is the spiritual force that Christians feel when under demonic attack .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney on Sunday defended the Bush administration 's economic record , the invasion of Iraq and the treatment of suspected terrorists , warning that reversing its anti-terrorism policies endangers Americans .
" We 've accomplished nearly everything we set out to do , " ex-Vice President Dick Cheney says Sunday about Iraq .
In a wide - ranging interview with CNN's " State of the Union , " Cheney said the harsh interrogations of suspects and the use of warrantless electronic surveillance were " absolutely essential " to get information to prevent more attacks like the 2001 suicide hijackings that targeted New York and Washington .
" President Obama campaigned against it all across the country , and now he is making some choices that , in my mind , will , in fact , raise the risk to the American people of another attack , " he said .
Critics said the Bush administration 's " alternative " interrogation techniques amounted to the torture of prisoners in American custody , while the administration 's warrantless surveillance program violated federal laws enacted after the Watergate scandal .
Since taking office in January , Obama has announced plans to close the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , to halt the military trials of suspected terrorists there , and to make CIA officers follow the Army field manual 's rules on interrogations .
Cheney said the administration appears to be returning to the pre-2001 model of treating terrorism as a law enforcement issue , rather than a military problem .
" When you go back to the law enforcement mode , which I sense is what they 're doing , closing Guantanamo and so forth ... they are very much giving up that center of attention and focus that 's required , that concept of military threat that is essential if you 're going to successfully defend the nation against further attacks , " he said .
' State of the Union ' John King 's interview with Dick Cheney will be re-broadcast .
Sunday , 8 p.m. ET see full schedule »
But Rep. Joe Sestak , D - Pennsylvania , said the Bush administration 's policies undercut " what is actually the source of America 's greatness -- our principles . "
" How can we say that keeping a man in a black hole forever -- perpetually in a black hole -- and saying , ' Let 's torture when we decide to , ' is what America stands for ? " asked Sestak , a former admiral who led the Navy 's anti-terrorism efforts .
The Bush administration took office at the end of an economic boom and left in the middle of a deep recession , with a budget surplus in 2001 becoming a $ 1 trillion - plus deficit by 2009 .
But Cheney said he and Bush had to spend money to deal with the September 11 , 2001 attacks , the resulting war in Afghanistan , the disaster of 2005 's Hurricane Katrina , and the costly and unpopular war in Iraq , now nearly six years old .
" All of these things required us to spend money that we had not originally planned to spend , or were n't originally part of the budget , " Cheney said .
" Stuff happens .
And the administration has to be able to respond to that , and we did . "
Obama has begun to wind down the war in Iraq , which has cost more than 4,200 American lives and nearly $ 700 billion in direct costs .
But Cheney said the United States has " accomplished nearly everything we set out to do " in Iraq , including establishing a democratic government in the Middle East .
Cheney was one of the administration 's leading advocates of the 2003 invasion of Iraq , pressing the Bush administration 's argument that Iraq was concealing weapons of mass destruction and could provide those weapons to terrorists .
None of those weapons were found after the invasion , but Cheney said , " We 've eliminated that possibility . "
In 2005 , Cheney said the raging insurgency against U.S. troops was in its " last throes . "
Nearly two years later , a commitment of more than 30,000 additional American troops and a widespread effort to pay former insurgents to turn against Islamic militants helped quell the worst of the violence .
" I do n't hear much talk about that , but the fact is , the violence level is down 90 percent , " Cheney said .
" The number of casualties [ among ] Iraqis and Americans is significantly diminished .
There 's been elections , a constitution .
They 're about to have another presidential election here in the near future .
We have succeeded in creating in the heart of the Middle East a democratically governed Iraq , and that is a big deal , and it is , in fact , what we set out to do . "
But Sestak said the administration was too slow to react to the problems it faced in Iraq and let the conflict overshadow the " whole fabric " of U.S. national security .
" The cost of this war is something that I strongly believe has far , far hurt us , " he said .
" We 're going to recover , because we 're Americans .
But Iraq was just one piece of our security , and this administration failed to realize that . "
Though considered one of the administration 's most influential figures , Cheney said President Bush rebuffed his advice on at least two issues .
Watch Cheney tout Bush administration »
He said Bush left former Cheney aide Lewis " Scooter " Libby " sort of hanging in the wind " by refusing to issue Libby a pardon before leaving office .
Libby was convicted of perjury , obstruction of justice , and lying to federal agents investigating the leak of a former CIA officer 's identity .
" I believe firmly that Scooter was unjustly accused and prosecuted and deserved a pardon , and the president disagreed with that , " Cheney said .
He would disclose no details of his efforts to lobby the president on Libby 's behalf , saying they would be " best left to history . "
And Cheney said he argued against the administration 's policy on North Korea , which tested a nuclear weapon in 2006 .
The Bush administration reached a still - incomplete disarmament deal with the isolated Stalinist state in 2007 and removed it from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism as part of the deal .
" I had my say , " Cheney told CNN .
" I got my chance to voice my views and my objections .
I did n't think the North Koreans were going to keep their end of the bargain in terms of what they agreed to , and they did n't . "
The Obama administration has nominated Christopher Hill , the State Department official who was the top U.S. negotiator with North Korea , to be the U.S. ambassador to Iraq .
Cheney said Hill lacks the Middle East experience that his predecessors have , and " I did not support the work that Chris Hill did with respect to North Korea . "
" I think it 's a choice that I would n't have made , " he said .

Facebook said Tuesday that CFO Gideon
Yu is leaving the company .
Yu had been at Facebook since 2007 , where he helped it raise more than $ 500 million , including $ 240 million from Microsoft ( NSDQ : MSFT ) .
But the company is looking for more funding as it grapples with rising costs .
Just last week , Business
Week reported that the company was seeking another $ 100 million to help it fund the lease of new servers needed to support its growing membership .
The social networking site did not immediately provide a reason for his departure , although it said it was looking for a new CFO with public - company experience , which suggests an IPO may be in the offing sooner rather than later .
“ Gideon has played an important role in helping us achieve our financial success , building a strong finance team and establishing the core financial operations of our company .
We are grateful to Gideon for his contributions to Facebook and what we are trying to accomplish , ” said Facebook spokeswoman Brandee Barker in an e-mail .
In its announcement , Facebook emphasized that its finances were solid , stating that “ despite the poor economic climate , we are pleased that our financial performance is strong and we are well positioned for the next stage of our growth . ”
The company also provided financial figures to some media outlets .
A spokesman told The NYT that the company expected to increase revenue by 70 percent this year and that it would be cash - flow positive by 2010 .
What ’s next for Yu ?
Unclear , but Yu is an investor in several startups , including anti-piracy firm Vobile and photo ad network Pixazza , which last week announced it had raised $ 5.75 million from several investors , including Google .
DENVER --
Every raincloud that passes over her eastern Colorado ranch tempts state Rep. Marsha Looper to break the law .
A long , hard drought has settled across the land , and on those rare occasions when the sky opens , Ms. Looper longs to set out some rain barrels to collect the bounty for future use .
She 'd like to use the rain to grow hothouse tomatoes .
But she refrains .
" I do n't want to get thrown in jail , " she explains .
It is , in fact , illegal in Colorado to collect rainwater .
State law is vague about the penalties , except to say that violators can be taken to court and ordered to pay damages .
The state lacks the resources for vigorous enforcement and fines are extremely rare , officials say .
Still , the law is the law -- and so Ms. Looper has set out to change it .
This might just be her year .
Colorado , like most Western states , lives by a rigid and byzantine knot of water laws .
Vast quantities of river water are made available , free of charge , to a variety of public and private interests , including oil companies , ski resorts , fire districts and breweries .
The international food conglomerate Nestlé has applied for a permit to draw water from a Colorado aquifer and sell it in plastic bottles under its Arrowhead brand .
The database migration of the old data set has just finished .
Welcome to the brand new freshmeat .net .
We still have a few open loops to close , but we wanted to bring the site back up first .
Read on for a few brief comments on the current site status .
First of all , we ’re not done yet .
What you ’re looking at right now is a 90 % import of the old site , with most of the data being present and available to you .
We did our best to map the former trove categorization into a meaningful set of tags for each project and release .
I am confident that this will not have worked in every case .
But I am just as confident that with every submission we process in the new system we will nudge the metadata of the entries and I also trust you as project maintainers to make sure your project ’s record here on freshmeat .
net is shaping up nicely .
What ’s missing right now is the statistics component .
Yes , we had statistics per project reaching back 60 days , but that just is n’t enough anymore .
We also need to refine our metrics for measuring popularity and vitality .
All of this will be tackled in the next few days , since implementing this solely on the drawing board without the interaction of the real site is rarely a good idea .
Also coming in the next few days is the revamped API to interface with both project data and user data ( including your subscriptions and filters ) .
With the site itself out of the door now we can focus on polishing that component up for release .
In case you ’re wondering , the first newsletter originating from the new system will be sent out on Monday .
As noted in our little placeholder page during the migration , status updates regarding further code pushes will be sent to our Twitter account with more detailed articles coming as time and features permit .
We fully expect to spend a couple of days ironing out the kinks that have not surfaced during the beta test and without the full set of data .
Please bear with us and use our help system should you be in need of assistance .
Please remember that we opened the new site for beta testing at the beginning of February and reminded you about it in five articles detailing what we were doing and why .
Try to limit your comments to things you could n’t have told us over the last six weeks .
Sorry for keeping this note a little brief .
The past weeks were exhausting .
Here ’s a really pragmatic use of graph theory .
This is a better method of matching compatible kidney donors and recipients than the current inefficient method of arranging transplants .
Here ’s the problem .
There are 70,000 people on a waitlist for a kidney .
Family members may offer to donate kidneys but they are incompatable .
Nor do they offer to randomly donate kidneys to absolute strangers .
Could they arrange swaps ?
For instance , what if a different family was in a similar situation .
Someone is willing to donate but they are incompatable .
But they are compatible with the other family .
So they arrange to swap kidneys .
This grows more complicated when you have to arrange intricate swaps between six or seven families to get the compatibility right .
It would save many lives but no one even tries to do it .
( US Naval Academy mathematician Sommer ) Gentry expects that if there were a national registry in place for kidney matching , and if it used her team ’s method , then each month , about half the pairs in the registry would find a compatible match .
Each year , 1,000 – 2,000 patients would get kidneys who currently would not .
By contrast , as of 2005 , only 51 patients had ever received kidneys through a swap in which two incompatible pairs exchange donors to create compatible pairs .
Gentry calculates that developing a national registry could save $ 750 million per year , because dialysis , the only alternative to transplantation , is very expensive .
Here ’s an example of how it works .
Draw a ring of circles .
Each of these circles are different colors – red , blue , yellow , green .
The way it is set up now , the circles ( nodes ) are only connected to the circle next to it .
This means that the travel distance ( jumping from linked node to another ) is very long .
The graph method would find a way to connect them .
Draw lines through the center of your graph – just a couple – to link two nodes together on opposite ends .
This reduces the distance to travel to any other node in the graph .
Currently , the red circles need red organs and blue circles need blue organs but there is little linkage in the graph .
If a red circle gets the blue organ today , it has to discard it because it is useless .
He cannot communicate with blue nodes and share it in a “ marketplace ” in the center .
With this system , connections can be identifies and made .
If a red node gets a blue organ , a blue node gets a green organ , and a green node gets a red organ , instead of disposing the unusable organs , they can organize a complicated organ swap .
Behold , Charts !

An anonymous official quoted in Politico ’s story on the House GOP budget plans said , “ We need to hold something up and say , ‘ Here are our charts .
Here are our graphs .
It ’s real . ”
Here ’s one of the charts ( after the jump ) :
Indeed , this chart exists .
There are a few of these charts but only three graphs in the plan , all of them CBO estimates about Democratic budget proposals — none of them scoring Republican proposals , which is what a lot of us expected today .

Whatever the truth is about where this economy is heading , one thing is clear : employers are taking every opportunity to slash employment and , if they are unionized , to hammer unions for pay cuts , even when there is no justification for these actions .
Take Safeway Inc. , a large national supermarket chain .
The company , which had $ 44 billion in sales in 2007 , and which , based upon third quarter figures for 2008 was well on the way to show record sales for 2008 , appears to be using the economic downturn as a justification for laying off employees and making remaining employees work harder .
I can only give anecdotal information on this , but the Genuardi ’s Family Market store ( a Safeway subsidiary ) where I live , in Upper Dublin , PA , an upper middle - class suburb north of Philadelphia , according to its employees , has been laying off cashiers , and slashing its night work force — the people who restock the shelves and unload the delivery trucks when the store is closed .
The management is doing this not because sales have slumped .
They have n’t .
People may not be buying new cars , but they are still buying food , and in fact , if they are cutting back on eating out , as restaurant chains are reporting , they are probably actually buying more groceries , not less .
Management is making these cuts simply because they can get away with it .
The layoffs , in the face of continued heavy business , means that cashiers are working harder .
It means that the night staff , cut by half , is working twice as hard .
But with jobs getting scarce , what is their option ?
If they do n’t like the speed - up , where are they going to go in the current environment ?
Meanwhile , if service gets worse , customers will accept the decline because they ’ll blame it on the economy , not noticing that there is really no justification for employee cutbacks at the supermarket .
Temple University , which is a major public higher education institution in Philadelphia , is reportedly telling all departments to make substantial cuts in their budgets .
This will inevitably lead to layoffs of faculty and support staff critical to the education mission .
And yet , what is the justification for such draconian measures ?
The governor initially announced plans to cut the state 's contribution to the university ’s annual budget for next year by a few million dollars , but the new Economic Recovery
Act stimulus package includes huge grants to the states , including Pennsylvania , more than compensating for those cuts .
Furthermore , state - funded universities across the country , including Temple , are reporting increased applications and enrollments , as students whose parents cannot afford to send them to private colleges , send them instead to public institutions , and as workers who lose their jobs decide that the economic downturn is a good time to go to college and get an education .
That means more tuition revenues coming in .
Moreover , student aid , including Pell Grants for lower - income students , have been substantially increased in the stimulus package , meaning more money for public colleges .
Money might be marginally tighter at places like Temple ( while , as with most public institutions , the university ’s endowment is not a significant contributor to the operating budget , small as it is it is certainly significantly reduced because of the market collapse ) , but it ’s certainly not down by enough to put universities in crisis .
It may not even be down at all .
It might be understandable that state and local governments would be considering layoffs , or reduced pay and hours for public employees , given the slump in tax revenues from property taxes , sales taxes and income taxes .
It is certainly necessary for the auto industry , which has seen sales plummet , to lay off workers .
Luxury stores like Circuit City are going bust .
But not all employers are hurting alike .
Health care industries are still booming .
Public colleges are doing fine .
Supermarkets are doing well .
Energy companies are okay .
Criticism of the nationwide wave of layoffs by companies and employers that really do n’t need to beggar their workers or push them out onto the street came from an unusual quarter recently , when Steve Korman , chief executive of a privately held Philadelphia - area company called Korman Communities , blasted corporate executives for laying off workers when they do n’t really need to .
Korman had gotten upset when he saw Pfizer Inc. ’s CEO Jeff Kinder say , on a television business program , that he planned to lay off 8000 workers in anticipation of a merger with Wyeth , another drug company .
The layoffs were not being made because Pfizer was losing money or in trouble financially , but rather to improve profits .
Korman , who owns stock in Pfizer , got angry and spent $ 16,000 to run ads in the Philadelphia Inquirer and the New York Times , saying :
" I have listened to the executives of many companies say that they are eliminating thousands of jobs to ' improve the bottom line , ' I own stock in many of these companies and would prefer that the company make a smaller profit and [ that ] the stock fall , in the short term , rather than affect the lives of our neighbors and their families as jobs are lost .
" Please join me in reminding all CEOs that we are not just dealing with numbers and profit , but with real people and real families who need to keep their jobs . "
Korman sent individual letters saying much the same thing to 16 companies in which he is an investor , including Federal Express , Google , Cisco Systems , Caterpillar , General Electric , ExxonMobil , Kraft , Nokia , Intel , Johnson &Johnson , Apple , EMC , Chevron , DuPont , Coca - Cola , Oracle and Dow .
If this phenomenon is bad enough that it has upset a prominent capitalist like Korman , it is clearly a major problem .
The irony is that as all these companies slash their workforces , and force remaining workers to work harder , and as public institutions like Temple University and other colleges cut their faculties and increase class sizes for remaining teaching staff , they are undermining any stimulus that taxpayers are subsidizing in the massive stimulus bill , and thus making the recession worse , not to mention wasting the huge deficit - spending measure itself .
Nobody would argue with a company ’s laying off of workers when sales collapse and there is no money coming in , but in many cases this is not what has been happening .
One reason there is a tidal wave of layoffs even at viable businesses and institutions across the country is simply the lack of or weakness of labor unions .
With workers at most employers unorganized ( unions represent only some 8 percent of private employees ) , it is easy for managers to engender an attitude of fear and passivity among employees , which makes it easier to pick them off , and to make those on the job work ever harder .
Furthermore , without labor contracts , there is little workers can do to resist speedups that can seriously threaten their health , safety and well - being .
Only a new militancy and sense of solidarity among American workers , and a revitalization of the nearly moribund labor movement , can rescue this situation , which will only get worse as the economy continues to sink .
Demand that Congress pass , and President Obama sign , the Employee Free Choice Act , which would restore some fairness in the contest between management and labor by allowing workers to establish unions in their place or work by simply obtaining signed cards from a majority of the employees , instead of having to go through a Labor Relations Board - run election , which can be delayed by management for years , giving companies time to fire and scare off union backers and activists .

At least 21 people have died and hundreds more are missing after two boats heading for Italy sank off Libya in separate incidents .
The victims are thought to be illegal migrants looking for a new life in Europe , Libyan officials said last night .
The bodies were found after a boat containing 253 people went down , while at least 23 people were rescued by Libyan coastguards when a packed second boat sank .
Another 342 people said to be on board are still missing .
Two other boats have been spotted drifting off the coast of the north African state in recent days .
The dead and missing are thought to be African migrants heading for Europe illegally .
One official told Reuters news agency : " We have information that two more boats were drifting off Libya 's coast but we do not know the exact conditions and the number of migrants on board . "
Another official said : " The boat incidents took place in the past two days and rescue and search operations are continuing . "
But sources also said it was not clear whether all the boats had sailed from Libya .
The country has become a popular jumping - off point for the dangerous journey .
It signed a new accord with Italy in February in an effort to stem the flow of migration .
There has been a 50 % increase in the number of migrants reaching Italy 's southern coast after dangerous crossings from northern Africa , according to UN figures .
Laura Boldrini , a UNHCR spokeswoman in Italy , said recently that these had become " increasingly frequent .
Migrants were also being consigned by traffickers to " ever more unseaworthy vessels " .
Google 's Python engineers have launched a new project called Unladen Swallow , which aims to bring a major performance boost to the Python programming language by making runtime speed five times faster .
The project is being implemented as a branch of the conventional CPython runtime and will be fully source - compatible with regular Python applications and native extensions .
This will make it possible to eventually merge the improvements into Python trunk .
The goal of the Unladen Swallow project is to use LLVM , the Low Level Virtual Machine compiler infrastructure , to build a just - in - time ( JIT ) compilation engine that can replace Python 's own specialized virtual machine .
This approach offers a number of significant advantages .
As the developers describe in the project plan , the project will make it possible to transition Python to a register - based virtual machine and will pave the way for future optimizations .
Adopting LLVM could also potentially open the door for more seamlessly integrating other languages with Python code , because the underlying LLVM intermediate representation is largely language - neutral .
The Unladen Swallow project also encompasses several other initiatives to improve other characteristics of the runtime and take advantage of modern hardware .
Parallelization and higher utilization of multicore processors is one area where the developers are placing strong focus .
They are considering the possibility of implementing a concurrent garbage collector , for example .
They are very serious about fixing multithreading in Python and hope to slay the Global Interpreter Lock , a mechanism that provides thread safety but imposes limitations on the kind of scalability improvements that applications can get from concurrency .
Although the project is at a very early stage of development , an experimental prototype is already available .
The source code can be downloaded from the project 's version control system at the Google Code site .
The current implementation is said to already provide a performance increase in some specific testing scenarios , but it 's still only a flesh wound compared to the improvements that are coming .
For their second milestone , which is scheduled for the second quarter of 2009 , they hope to replace the Python virtual machine with a functionally - equivalent LLVM - based implementation .
The Unladen Swallow developers hope that the project will eventually make it possible to use Python instead of C for a wider range of performance - sensitive tasks .
They are building it on top of Python 2.6 ( 2.x is not dead yet ) because it will allow many existing projects to adopt it and will also provide a clean glide path to Python 3 .
Python is gaining some traction in enterprise environments and it's used extensively by Google within the company 's own infrastructure and its hosted App Engine system .
Google 's investment in improving Python performance will make the language even more compelling for rapid web application development .

Friday Q&A 2009 - 03 - 20 : Objective - C Messaging
Welcome back to another Friday Q&A .
This week I 'd like to take Joshua Pennington 's idea and elaborate on a particular facet last week 's topic of the Objective - C runtime , namely messaging .
How does messaging work , and what exactly does it do ?
Read on !
Definitions
Before we get started on the mechanisms , we need to define our terms .
A lot of people are kind of unclear on exactly what a " method " is versus a " message " , for example , but this is critically important for understanding how the messaging system works at the low level .
Method : an actual piece of code associated with a class , and which is given a particular name .
Example : - ( int ) meaning { return 42 ; }
an actual piece of code associated with a class , and which is given a particular name .
Example : Message : a name and a set of parameters sent to an object .
Example : sending " meaning " and no parameters to object 0x12345678 .
a name and a set of parameters sent to an object .
Example : sending " meaning " and no parameters to object .
Selector : a particular way of representing the name of a message or method , represented as the type SEL .
Selectors are essentially just opaque strings that are managed so that simple pointer equality can be used to compare them , to allow for extra speed .
( The implementation may be different , but that 's essentially how they look on the outside . )
Example : @selector ( meaning ) .
a particular way of representing the name of a message or method , represented as the type .
Selectors are essentially just opaque strings that are managed so that simple pointer equality can be used to compare them , to allow for extra speed .
( The implementation may be different , but that 's essentially how they look on the outside . )
Example : .
Message send : the process of taking a message and finding and executing the appropriate method .
Methods
The next thing that we need to discuss is what exactly a method is at the machine level .
From the definition , it 's a piece of code given a name and associated with a particular class , but what does it actually end up creating in your application binary ?
Methods end up being generated as straight C functions , with a couple of extra parameters .
You probably know that self is passed as an implicit parameter , which ends up being an explicit parameter .
The lesser - known implicit parameter _cmd ( which holds the selector of the message being sent ) is a second such implicit parameter .
Writing a method like this :
- ( int ) foo :( NSString * ) str { ...
int SomeClass_method_foo_ ( SomeClass * self , SEL _cmd , NSString * str ) { ...
Gets translated to a function like this :
( The name mangling is just illustrative , and the gcc does n't actually generate a linker - visible symbol for methods at all . )
What , then , happens when we write some code like this ?
int result = [ obj foo : @ " hello " ] ;
int result = ( ( int ( * ) ( id , SEL , NSString * ) ) objc_msgSend ) ( obj , @selector ( foo :) , @ " hello " ) ;
The compiler ends up generating code that does the equivalent of this : I 'm sorry , did you run off screaming there ?
I 'll just wait a moment to give everybody some time to come to their senses and return ....
What that ridiculous piece of code after the equals sign does is take the objc_msgSend function , defined as part of the Objective - C runtime , and cast it to a different type .
Specifically , it casts it from a function that returns id and takes id , SEL , and variable arguments after that to a function that matches the prototype of the method being invoked .
To put it another way , the compiler generates code that calls objc_msgSend but with parameter and return value conventions matched to the method in question .
Those readers who are really awake and did n't have their wits scared out of them have now noticed that the compiler needs to know the method 's prototype even though all it has to work with is the message being sent .
How does the compiler deal with this discrepancy ?
Quite simply , it cheats .
It makes a guess at the method prototype based on the methods it can see from the declarations that it has parsed so far .
If it can't find one , or there 's a mismatch between the declarations it sees and the method that will actually be executed at runtime , Bad Things Happen .
This is why Objective - C deals so poorly with multiple methods which have the same name but different argument / return types .
Messaging
A message send in code turns into a call to objc_msgSend , so what does that do ?
The high - level answer should be fairly apparent .
Since that 's the only function call present , it must look up the appropriate method implementation and then call it .
Calling is easy : it just needs to jump to the appropriate address .
But how does it look it up ?
The Objective - C header runtime.h includes this as part of the ( now opaque , legacy ) objc_class structure members :
struct objc_method_list ** methodLists OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE
;
struct objc_method_list { struct objc_method_list * obsolete OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE
; int method_count OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE
; #ifdef __LP64__ int space OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE
; #endif /* variable length structure */ struct objc_method method_list [ 1 ] OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE ; } OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE ;
objc_method
struct objc_method { SEL method_name OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE
; char * method_types OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE
; IMP method_imp OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE
; } OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE ;
That struct is in turn defined :
Which is just declaring a variable - length struct holdingstructs .
That one is in turn defined as :
So even though we 're not supposed to touch these structs ( do n't worry , all the functionality for manipulating them is provided through functions in elsewhere in the header ) , we can still see what the runtime considers a method to be .
It 's a name ( in the form of a selector ) , a string containing argument / return types ( look up the @encode directive for more information about this one ) , and an IMP , which is just a function pointer :
typedef id ( * IMP ) ( id , SEL , ... ) ;
objc_msgSend

Now we know enough to see how this stuff works .
Allhas to do is look up the class of the object you give it ( available by just dereferencing it and obtaining themember that all objects contain ) , get the class 's method list , and search through the method list until a method with the right selector is found .
If nothing is there , search the superclass 's list , and so on up the hierarchy .
Once the right method is found , jump to the IMP of method in question .
One more detail needs to be considered here .
The above procedure would work but it would be extremely slow .
objc_msgSend only takes about a dozen CPU cycles to execute on the x86 architecture , which makes it clear that it's not going through this lengthy procedure every single time you call it .
The clue to this is another objc_class member :
struct objc_cache * cache OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE
;
struct objc_cache { unsigned int mask /* total = mask + 1 */ OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE
; unsigned int occupied OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE ; Method buckets [ 1 ] OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE ; }
Method
objc_msgSend
And that 's defined farther down :
This defines a hash table that storesstructs , using the selector as the key .
The wayworks is by first hashing the selector and looking it up in the class 's method cache .
If it 's found , which it nearly always will be , it can jump straight to the method implementation with no further fuss .
Only if it 's not found does it have to do the more laborious lookup , at the end of which it inserts an entry into the cache so that future lookups can be fast .
( There is actually one more detail beyond this which ends up being extremely important : what happens when no method can be found for a given selector .
But that one is so important that it deserves its own post , so look for it next week . )
Conclusion
That wraps up this week 's edition .
Come back next week for more .

Diego Stocco is a composer , sound designer , composer for video games , and all - round creative guy .
Not only are his compositions very interesting to listen to , but he ’s got a knack for making his music out of the least likely of sources .
Diego was born in Italy and discovered music at the age of 6 when his parents , hoping to calm him down , gave him his first electronic keyboard .
My own parents actually bought me a Korg Poly - 800 synthesizer to calm me down too .
The soothing sounds of analogue synthesis !
In 2001 Diego started to produce for Spectrasonics and is one of the principal sound designers for a few really cool virtual instruments – Atmosphere , Omnisphere and Stylus RMX .
His latest track is made from SAND .
Yes , sand – the kind you find at the beach .
I had some sandbags in the backyard that I used in November during a rainy day .
I was moving them to a different spot when I heard the noise of the sand .
I thought that maybe I could try a new sound design technique so I bought some piezo film transducers and started to experiment with them .
The entire track is created only out of tuned sand tones .
No additional sounds , instruments or wave forms were used .
The grooves are played entirely live and without the use of sequencers , using various techniques , including taping two piezo films to his fingers .
This is the McIntyre Acoustic Feather contact microphone .
It ’s designed to be used with a mandolin , but Diego thought it would make a great sand pickup :
At the beach , setting up the portable recorder .
Diego was listening to the track playing from an iPod , and played the sand in sync with the music :
Taping the DT Series Piezo Film to his fingers .
These are mainly designed for industrial applications , but he decided to use them to turn his hands into percussive instruments .
Watch for more on Diego ’s inventive music in upcoming stories .
Maybe it ’s Jimmy Fallon 's integration of it into his new TV show , Shaq ’s use of it to interact in real - life with fans , or blog ’s ability to write about it non-stop , but one way or another , Twitter ’s growth just continues to explode .
The latest numbers from Nielsen Online indicate that Twitter grew 1,382 % year - over - year in February , registering a total of just more than 7 million unique visitors in the US for the month .
Not only is that huge growth in one year , but in one month as well , as in January , Twitter.com clocked in with 4.5 million unique visitors in the US , meaning the service grew by more than 50 percent month - over - month .
Elsewhere in the social networking space , Facebook continued to widen its lead on MySpace , with a total of 65.7 million unique visitors versus 54.1 million for its increasingly distant competitor .
Meanwhile , the recently re-launched Bebo , which now plays in the social networking aggregation game , is showing some promise , growing 40 percent from last year to register a total of nearly 3.2 million US visitors in February .
The competition that most are now focused on , however , is that between Facebook and Twitter .
While Facebook remains several orders of magnitude bigger , its recent move to a real - time homepage and its overhaul of Facebook Pages is seen by many as a move to thwart Twitter ’s continued growth .
It will be a few months until this shows up in the numbers and gives us some sort of indication as to whether or not that strategy is working , but for now , both networking sites are enjoying tremendous growth .
The full report is embedded below :

Data released by Government agency Directgov 's Innovation blog has lead to the creation of a map of all the reported accidents involving bicycles in the UK for the years 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 .
If you have Google Earth installed on your machine you can download the KML files of the data and check out the blackspots in your area .
The police define an accident as follows :
Accident : Involves personal injury occurring on the public highway ( including footways ) in which at least one road vehicle or a vehicle in collision with a pedestrian is involved and which becomes known to the police within 30 days of its occurrence .
The vehicle need not be moving , and accidents involving stationary vehicles and pedestrians or users are included .
One accident may give rise to several casualties .
“ Damage - only ” accidents are not included .
When the police record an accident they also record its grid reference data which can then be turned into latitude and longitude readings which can be plotted accurately on a map .
Possibly the most immediately useful aspect of data when applied to a map is that it enables easy identification of accident blackspots – there may well be plenty of anecdotal evidence that they exist but a map gives clear at - a - glance evidence to members of the public .
For instance one commenter at the timesonline lab blog notes that most of the eight incidents in Richmond park over the period mapped were by the main gate .
Ideally traffic engineers should also be able to quickly identify the types of location where accidents are more likely to occur : certain sorts of junction or street layout , or furniture lead to more accidents and require remedial action .
They probably have the raw stats in some form already .
Not surprisingly most of the incidents mapped occur in large cities and highly populated areas - there are none on the Isle of Skye for instance .
And while an average of 16,000 incidents a year is too high it needs also to be viewed in the context of the vast numbers of people now riding bikes .
A map of accidents involving motor vehicles would be massively more crowded - indeed the size of that particular data set may well be one of the factors in Directgov releasing the cycling data instead .
To put these figures in a more general context , The Department for Transport 's Road Casualties Great Britain 2007 : Annual Report is an interesting read .
If the 16,000 cycling accidents per year average mentioned above is compared to the total number of casualties of all severities on Britain 's roads in 2007 , cycling - related accidents make up roughly 6.5 per cent of the 247,780 total .
Looking at the stats by mode of transport it is clear that way ahead in the fatality stakes , and perhaps prompting the current series of adverts warning drivers to look out for them , are motorcyclists , followed , but not closely , by cyclists .
Figures for 2006 show that motorcylists had 190 fatalities ( per 100 million passenger journeys ) compared to 12 cyclists , 3.7 pedestrians and 3.3 fatalities of those travelling by car .
For even more detailed stats , have a look at the Department of Transport 's factsheet on pedal cyclist casualties in road accidents : 2007

( CNN ) -- Donna Zovko will have to wait to travel to Falluja to see where her son died in one of the Iraq war 's most infamous attacks .
Clockwise from upper left : Wesley Batalona , Mike Teague , Scott Helvenston , Jerry Zovko
" My dream was to go for the fifth anniversary , and that did n't come true , " Zovko said this week while visiting friends in Boston , Massachusetts .
" It 's not that I 'm afraid for me .
But people with me on the trip would be in more danger . "
Tuesday marks five years since her son Jerry Zovko and three other civilian employees of the Blackwater private security firm were ambushed in Falluja on March 31 , 2004 .
Gunmen attacked vehicles holding Zovko , Mike Teague , Wesley Batalona and Scott Helvenston and set the vehicles on fire .
Shocking images beamed around the world showed Iraqis celebrating in front of charred bodies strung up on a bridge over the Euphrates River .
The remains were dragged through the streets .
Donna Zovko honors her son »
" I did n't realize until way after the incident that he had been decapitated , " said Helvenston 's mother , Katy Helvenston - Wettengel , from her Florida home .
" They cut his heart out .
How can anybody be that hateful ? "
To identify his body , she said , investigators had to gather DNA samples from her son's children .
A half - decade after the notorious attack , memories of the gruesome images have faded somewhat from the public eye , as the United States plans to reduce troop numbers in Iraq and a wrongful death suit brought by the four families heads to court - ordered arbitration .
The families accuse Blackwater of failing to prepare the men for their mission that day .
A 2007 House oversight committee report concluded that Blackwater " ignored multiple warnings about the dangers " and failed to supply armored vehicles , machine guns , sufficient intelligence or even a map .
Blackwater responded by saying the experienced military veterans on the team " had all of the resources they needed " and were victims of a " well - planned ambush . "
In the days after the attack , Blackwater was largely silent beyond a statement that said , " We grieve today for the loss of our colleagues and we pray for their families . "
But the families said they ran into a stone wall trying to get details of what happened in Falluja .
" For the next three months , they never returned my calls , " Helvenston 's mother said .
" Our families were destroyed .
We will never be the same . "
For Zovko , the suit is not about money or punishment .
" I want to hear the truth , " she said .
" I want to know what my Jerry was doing before the mission .
Why they did n't they have the maps ?
I want to know who he spoke to last . "
What makes this anniversary different from past years , she said , was an encounter this month in Boston with an Iraqi who claimed that he was at the scene of the attack shortly after the massacre .
He offered Zovko new alleged details of the attack , which she says brought her comfort .
The Iraqi man , whom she would n't identify , told her that the attackers did not appear to be targeting the motorcade containing her son and his three comrades .
" We used to think maybe the attack was done on purpose , " she said .
The news made her feel like " I was lifted into the air , " she said .
" For me , it was good .
I miss my Jerry more today than yesterday . "
The gruesome attack put the little - known North Carolina - based security company into the American lexicon and on the world stage .
It also changed the course of the war .
The House report called it a " turning point in public opinion about the war , " which led to the first major U.S. offensive in Falluja .
The fighting lasted three weeks , killing 36 U.S. service members , about 200 insurgents and an estimated 600 Iraqi civilians , according to the report .
In the ensuing years , Blackwater and other private security firms in Iraq received hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. government contracts .
Tactics used by the private security firms sometimes created ill will among Iraqis and Blackwater in particular was criticized , even by some in the U.S. military , for its allegedly reckless use of deadly force .
Erik Prince , Blackwater 's founder and former CEO , dismissed such allegations as " baseless " after his company was criticized by the Iraqi government for an incident in which its guards killed 17 Iraqi civilians and wounded others while protecting a U.S. State Department convoy in Baghdad on September 16 , 2007 .
" To the extent there was the loss of innocent life , let me be clear that I consider that tragic , " Prince said , adding that the Blackwater team " acted appropriately while operating in a very complex war zone " that day .
Five ex-Blackwater security guards pleaded not guilty in January to charges of voluntary manslaughter stemming from their involvement in the shootings .
A sixth pleaded guilty to voluntary and attempted manslaughter .
That same month , the Iraqi government refused to grant the firm an operating license , and the U.S. State Department announced that it will not renew its contract .
In the two months since the exit of the Bush administration , Prince has stepped down as CEO and brought in a new leadership team .
The company has changed its name to Xe , but Prince is still chairman .
" I think Blackwater 's been punished enough , " Zovko said , " but they will be punished more .
It 's time our government makes some rules and regulations about what civilian contractors can do in their wars . "
This week ,
Xe released a brief statement to CNN about the Falluja killings , saying the " sacrifices of these brave men have not been forgotten .
On the five - year anniversary of their death , the company continues to mourn their loss .
Our thoughts remain with their families and loved ones . "
Prince 's promise
Both mothers seem to be making a conscious effort to control their anger five years on .
" I refuse to hate , but if I were gonna hate anybody , it would be Blackwater and Erik Prince , " Helvenston - Wettengel said .
" I want Blackwater exposed for who they are , and I want them out of business . "
Zovko said she relies on her Catholic faith to control her anger .
In 2007 , Prince told CNN he would be willing to meet with Zovko , but 16 months later , no such meeting has taken place .
" He has n't honored his promise , but I believe he will , " Zovko said .
" Sometimes I think he does n't have a heart , but he really does . "
Zovko said she wants to ask Prince , " Where are my Jerry 's three suitcases with personal things that I have never received ? "
Also , she said Prince promised to invite Zovko to Blackwater 's headquarters in North Carolina to see memorial stones and trees that were planted honoring the victims .
" That has n't happened , " Zovko said .
Helvenston - Wettengel also said she 'd like to meet with Prince .
" I 'd like to look him in the eye , yeah .
I 'd say , ' How can you live with yourself ? ' "
CNN sought a response from Prince about his promised meeting with Zovko .
Company spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said Prince had tried to meet with Zovko in early 2008 but was unable to " due to scheduling conflicts . "
Both mothers ' sons went to Iraq after careers in the U.S. military .
Jerry Zovko , a former Army Ranger , had gone as a security contractor to train Iraqi soldiers .
When that contract ended in late 2003 , he signed on with a different company , Blackwater , according to his mother .
For Scott Helvenston , Iraq was just the final chapter of a colorful career for the former Navy SEAL , a life that included a job as a stuntman and consultant for Hollywood films .
On the set of 1997's " G.I. Jane , " shot in Jacksonville , Florida , Helvenston put Demi Moore through a rigorous training program , his mother said , even managing to grab a small role as an extra .
A divorced father of two , Helvenston told his mother he would return from Iraq in two months , she said .
" He was going to go over there and make a bunch of money and come back and give it to his ex-wife , " she said .
Zovko and Helvenston - Wettengel have become close friends in the years since the tragedy , but on this anniversary , the two mothers will not be together to share their support and grief with each other .
" Traveling is getting to be troublesome for us both , " said Zovko , who plans to remain near her home in Bratenahl , Ohio , to attend morning and evening masses at Cleveland 's St. Paul Croatian Church .
Helvenston - Wettengel also said she plans to attend church Tuesday in her hometown of Leesburg , Florida .
Legal setbacks
As for the families ' wrongful death lawsuit against Blackwater , a federal judge in 2007 ordered that the case be taken out of the courts to be decided by a three - member arbitration panel .
Senior U.S. District Judge James
Fox sent the case to arbitration based on Blackwater 's argument that the four victims had signed an agreement not to sue the company .
A hearing is set for June 23 .
In court , Blackwater had argued that it was immune to such a lawsuit because , as an extension of the military , it can not be held responsible for deaths in a war zone .
At this point , Zovko said , both sides are losers .
" I lost my son , and Blackwater lost the dignity of the company they thought they were . "
Helvenston said she wants the whole thing to just end , but events keep dragging it out .
" They wo n't let me let it go . "

Judge says its okay for Navy to spray recruits with banned chemical John Byrne
Published : Monday March 16 , 2009
Print This Email This The Navy can spray recruits in the eyes with pepper spray , even though it has been linked to death and is banned during warfare by international law , a federal judge ruled Friday .
The decision , revealed by the blog of Legal Times , is in response to a case brought by naval officers , who argued that the practice of " subjecting trainees to a direct shot of pepper spray was dangerous and deprived them of their constitutional rights to due process and equal protection .
They said the Navy could rely on less intense training methods , such as smearing a small amount of the spray on the skin beneath the eyes , or forcing trainees to walk through a room that had previously been sprayed . "
But Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said he was n't in a position to overrule the Navy 's decision to continue the practice .
 The use of direct - impact [ pepper ] spray indisputably risks injury , but the agency decided that this risk was offset by the benefits of training ,  Leon wrote .
 Plaintiffs allegation that the action was clearly not the product of reasoned thought ,  is little more than a legal conclusion and provides insufficient support for its claim that the agency decision was arbitrary and capricious . 
Pepper spray is made from oleoresin capsicum , an oily extract of pepper plants .
According to the American Civil Liberties Union , there have been 27 deaths among people sprayed in California alone since 1993 , although the deaths were not directly linked to the chemical .
In particular , it can be fatal for individuals with asthma .
Pepper spray is banned for use in war by Article I.5 of the Chemical Weapons Convention .
The " spray may contain water , alcohols , or organic solvents as liquid carriers ; and nitrogen , carbon dioxide , or halogenated hydrocarbons ( such as Freon , tetrachloroethylene , and methylene chloride ) as propellants to discharge the canister contents , " the North Carolina Medical journal wrote in a study .
" Inhalation of high doses of some of these chemicals can produce adverse cardiac , respiratory , and neurologic effects , including arrhythmias and sudden death . "
According to Legal Times , the judge threw out the navy officers ' constitutional arguments as well , saying the practice of using pepper spray did n't " shock the conscience ,  even though it 's banned for use in warfare by the chemical weapons convention .

Austin Powers director Jay Roach ’s new comedy , Dinner for Schmucks is finally getting under way after last year ’s lengthy custody dispute over it between Paramount and DreamWorks .
According to Variety , Paramount and Spyglass Entertainment will produce the film , a remake of the 1998 French film , Le Diner de cons .
The film will star Steve Carell and Paul Rudd , who previously worked together on Anchorman : The Legend of Ron Burgundy and The 40 - Year - Old Virgin .
Originally set to star in the film was Borat himself , Sascha Baron Cohen , but he dropped out of the project some time last year .
This will be Roach ’s first theatrical film since his 2004 sequel , Meet the Fockers .
He made a film last year for HBO about the 2000 Florida recount , aptly titled Recount .
I ’m looking forward to this one .
Roach has proven himself a pretty strong comedic director ( even if Fockers and the final Austin Powers film were pretty lackluster ) and right here he ’s working with a relly great cast .
Should n’t be too bad .
Maybe Those Under Indictment for Espionage Should n’t Talk About Other People ’s Commitments to Israel

Steve Rosen , who ’s trying to derail Ambassador Chas Freeman ’s chairmanship of the National Intelligence Council , says this about M.J. Rosenberg from the Israel Policy Forum , who ’s defended Freeman :
He urges the Obama administration to “ ignore Freeman ’s rightwing critics .
They are the same people who will oppose your efforts to secure Israeli- Palestinian peace . ”
He says that the “ only interest ” of Jeff Goldberg of the Atlantic in opposing the Freeman nomination , although he is like Rosenberg a fierce AIPAC critic , is “ defending the occupation and opposing the peace process . ”
He depicts me as motivated by being a spy for Israel .
Is IPF so eager to see pressure on Israel that they will throw in their lot with a Chas Freeman and attack anyone who opposes him ?
Senior officials of IPF reportedly are supporting both the substance and tone of Rosenberg ’s attacks on Freeman critics , and do not see them as intemperate .
This reads like Rosen reached out to IPF “ senior officials ” to whine about Rosenberg and they told him they did n’t care about what he had to say .
I wonder why that is ?
Maybe the Israel Policy Forum ’s “ senior officials ” do n’t particularly want to see people under indictment for spying for Israel acting like the arbiters of what a healthy U.S. - Israel relationship should look like .
I know , I know , this meshuggeneh world !
Children were left close to tears after they won an inter-school athletics competition - but were booed by unsporting parents .
Youngsters from Thomas A Becket Middle School in Worthing were heckled by grown men and women because they scooped the top prize for the 20th year running .
One mother and her young daughter told The Argus how the atmosphere soured when the winners of the five - school contest were announced on Monday .
Speaking anonymously the mother described how a bit of sporting fun “ turned adults into children ” .
She said : " It was close to the end and everyone thought West Park School had won and we had come second .
" Parents were trying to add up points in their heads and it worked out that West Park would win by around four points .
" But when judges announced the results Thomas A Becket had won and suddenly parents from other schools started booing - it was horrible .
" The children looked visibly upset and shocked and were asking what they 'd done wrong . ”
She added : " The parents were saying there must have been a mistake adding up or someone was cheating but I do n't think anyone was cheating – there would be no reason to .
" I think it sets a really bad example for children if they see adults behave like that – it's just really unpleasant .
" I 'm sure they 're tired of Thomas Becket winning it year after year but that 's not the way to go about it . "
The competition takes place every year at Worthing Leisure Centre and has been on the local calendar for more than two decades .
Five schools take part in the indoor games which include relay races , sprints and high jump .
Thomas A Becket school in Glebeside Avenue , Worthing , has won the competition for the past 20 years despite only being 24 - years - old .
The young girl from Thomas A Becket , who did not want to be named , said : " I was upset .
They announced our name as the winners and then there was just a boo .
" We were upset even though we were supposed to be feeling happy .
" My friends and I were all talking about it and we could n't understand why that would happen . "
Thomas A Becket is known for its sporting achievement and the school gained the ' Activemark Gold Award for excellence in sports .
Louise Slaughter , a Democratic congresswoman from upstate New York , said : “ I know of women victims , women in the military , who said to me that the first response they would get if they tried to report a rape was , ‘ Oh , you do n’t want to ruin that young man ’s career , do you ? ’ ”
Ms. Slaughter has been trying for many years to get the military to really crack down on these crimes .
“ Very , very few cases result in court - martials , ” she said , “ and there are not that many that are even adjudicated . ”
The Department of Defense has taken a peculiarly optimistic view of the increase in the number of reported sexual attacks .
The most recent data is contained in the annual report that the department is required to submit to Congress .
The report says that “ the overall increase in reports of sexual assault in the military is encouraging , ” and goes on to explain :
“ It should be noted that increased reports of sexual assault do not reflect a rise in annual incidents of sexual assault .
Sexual assault is one of the most under - reported crimes in the United States .
Estimates suggest that only a small percentage of sexual assaults are ever reported to the police .
The department suspects that the same is true for military society as well .
An increase in the number of reported cases means that the department is capturing a greater proportion of the cases occurring each year . ”
How ’s that for viewing hideous statistics through rose - colored glasses ?
If the number of reported cases of rape goes sky - high over the next fiscal year , that will mean that the military is doing an even better job !
The military is one of the most highly controlled environments imaginable .
When there are rules that the Pentagon absolutely wants followed , they are rigidly enforced by the chain of command .
Violations are not tolerated .
The military could bring about a radical reduction in the number of rapes and other forms of sexual assault if it wanted to , and it could radically improve the overall treatment of women in the armed forces .
There is no real desire in the military to modify this aspect of its culture .
It is an ultra-macho environment in which the overwhelming tendency has been to see all women  civilian and military , young and old , American and foreign  solely as sexual objects .
Real change , drastic change , will have to be imposed from outside the military .
It will not come from within .
Been eyeballing that old aquarium in the garage ( the fish long since gone ) for your next extreme system mod and cooling solution ?
Probably not , but Puget Systems now offers kits for those of you that are interested and brave enough to venture into submerged cooling mods .
Custom PC maker , Puget Systems , has announced the availability of their DIY ‘ Aquarium PC ’ .
Puget claims that they have been running their own system for over a year with no ill effects on the hardware submerged within .
Some people may cringe at the thought , but mineral oil is completely non conductive of electricity – meaning you could drop anything electronic into it and it will continue to run just fine .
Standard liquid cooling systems have nothing on this baby .
Since the entire motherboard and everything attached to it gets entirely submerged into mineral oil .
With the aid of a pump and external radiator , everything in the aquarium gets it share of ‘ liquid cooling ’ .
As depicted in the images , you can see that the power supply is even inside the tank .
A cooler is installed on the CPU – but really all it is there for is to move the mineral oil across the fins as though it were air .
Now it does n’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that standard fans can move air a lot easier than liquid – since liquid is heavier and denser than air , you may want to ensure that the fan on your cooler and in your PSU will stand up to the increased stress of moving liquid .
All current fan manufactures of course do not have a ‘ liquid ’ rating on their fans , so this would be entirely a trial by fire situation .
Puget was unavailable at this time for comment regarding this issue .
Image 1 of 2 Image 2 of 2
We can also see , according to the images anyway , that the hard drives are not contained within the tank itself – this would be for obvious reasons , anything gets inside your drive and its pretty much toast since what goes on inside them happens at a severely high degree of accuracy – something you do not want to mess with .
This leaves you with eSATA for your storage option .
You could however submerge solid state drives into mineral oil without issue .
Keep that in mind .
Your CDs and DVDs will not be going for a swim either .
Puget would also like to caution potential buyers that submerging your hardware into any liquid will obviously void your warranty – could you imagine returning a oil - logged video card to EVGA ?
Yeah , not going to happen .
Puget also mentions that mineral oil is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to clean from your hardware – making your hardware dunking madness a one way ticket .
Do n’t put it in there if you do n’t plan on leaving it in there .
The system can be purchased in two separate pieces , the Aquarium Module , and the Cooling Module .
Puget ’s site claims the cooling module is only needed for ‘ high - end ’ systems – this would imply that lower - end hardware would not require the massive radiator module .
Since nobody buying this would be planning on dunking 8500GTs , it ’s a good assumption that you will need the cooling module as well .
The Aquarium Module costs US $ 312.50 and the Cooling Module US$ 375.00 .

While our leaders in the Federal and State Governments are talking about trying to create jobs with another massive stimulus package ( read BAILOUT ) , they have refused to LOAN my company the money to rebuild my company 's family riverside resort , which was destroyed by a flood in March 2008 , because I also own a Strip Club .
Yes , I can easily pay the loan back , that is not the issue nor reason for denial .
Yes , it is a FAMILY resort .
It has Camping , canoes , fishing , paintball , cafe etc etc .
Yes , I do have flood insurance .
However , this was a record flood that wiped out much more than we were covered .
Yes , I would rebuild a family resort .
Yes , this is a LOAN , not a bailout .
We would be required to pay the loan back , with interest
Yes , this would create JOBS !
From construction , to producing the materials needed to construct , to the actual staff who would be working when it was open .
How 's that for a stimulus ?
The Government , however , says that they cannot loan me money because my companies create too much of a percentage of my revenue through my club .
When I asked for the EXACT percentage needed to disqualify me , they refused to answer .
When asked to define exactly what part of my business or sales met their definition of a “ sexually prurient business ” they refused to define it .
Here is a copy of the regulation SBA reg 123.201
The problem with this law is that it is too ambiguous .
It does not define the “ de minimus ” amount nor does it define exactly what is of a “ sexually prurient nature ”
Luckily , there are dozen of States which do define it in their regulations .
Acts of a “ sexually prurient nature ” are OBSCENITY !
In fact , obscenity or obscene displays are illegal in my state , Missouri .
Read this for the legal description of Obscenity .
# 12 a-c
We do not fall under this description .
If we did , we would all be in prison .
The failure / refusal of the SBA to define which materials that we sell or perform are of a “ sexually prurient nature ” or “ obscene ” shows that they themselves know that their actions are unjustified .
The same can be said of their “ de minimus revenue ” clause for which they refuse to give an exact figure .
We have exhausted our appeals with the SBA and are now moving on towards Federal Court .
Lucky for us , the law is on our side and we will most likely prevail .
It just seems insane that we can't borrow money to help the economy because we have a Gentlemen 's Club when the Feds are GIVING Billions ( if not Trillions ) to the people who stole it from us in the first place .
I hope that some “ real ” journalists would like to talk to me about this issue .

An intense , six - month campaign of Predator strikes in Pakistan has taken such a toll on Al Qaeda that militants have begun turning violently on one another out of confusion and distrust , U.S. intelligence and counter - terrorism officials say .
The pace of the Predator attacks has accelerated dramatically since August , when the Bush administration made a previously undisclosed decision to abandon the practice of obtaining permission from the Pakistani government before launching missiles from the unmanned aircraft .
Since Aug. 31 , the CIA has carried out at least 38 Predator strikes in northwest Pakistan , compared with 10 reported attacks in 2006 and 2007 combined , in what has become the CIA ’s most expansive targeted killing program since the Vietnam War .
Because of its success , the Obama administration is set to continue the accelerated campaign despite civilian casualties that have fueled anti-U.S. sentiment and prompted protests from the Pakistani government .

“ This last year has been a very hard year for them , ” a senior U.S. counter - terrorism official said of Al Qaeda militants , whose operations he tracks in northwest Pakistan .
“ They ’re losing a bunch of their better leaders .
But more importantly , at this point they ’re wondering who ’s next . ”
U.S. intelligence officials said they see clear signs that the Predator strikes are sowing distrust within Al Qaeda .
“ They have started hunting down people who they think are responsible ” for security breaches , the senior U.S. counter - terrorism official said , discussing intelligence assessments on condition of anonymity .
“ People are showing up dead or disappearing . ”
The counter - terrorism official and others , who also spoke anonymously , said the U.S. assessments were based in part on reports from the region provided by the Pakistani intelligence service .
The stepped - up Predator campaign has killed at least nine senior Al Qaeda leaders and dozens of lower - ranking operatives , in what U.S. officials described as the most serious disruption of the terrorist network since 2001 .

Among those killed since August are Rashid Rauf , the suspected mastermind of an alleged 2006 transatlantic airliner plot ; Abu Khabab Masri , who was described as the leader of Al Qaeda ’s chemical and biological weapons efforts ; Khalid Habib , an operations chief allegedly involved in plots against the West ; and Usama al - Kini , who allegedly helped orchestrate the September bombing of the Marriott Hotel in the capital , Islamabad .
Al Qaeda ’s founders remain elusive .
U.S. spy agencies have not had reliable intelligence on the location of Osama bin Laden since he slipped across the Pakistan border seven years ago , officials said .
His deputy , Ayman Zawahiri , remains at large after escaping a missile strike in 2006 .
But the Predator campaign has depleted the organization ’s operational tier .
Many of the dead are longtime loyalists who had worked alongside Bin Laden and were part of the network ’s hasty migration into Pakistan in 2001 after U.S. - led forces invaded neighboring Afghanistan .
They are being replaced by less experienced recruits who have had little , if any , history with Bin Laden and Zawahiri .
The offensive has been aided by technological advances and an expansion of the CIA ’s Predator fleet .
The drones take off and land at military airstrips in Pakistan , but are operated by CIA pilots in the United States .
Some of the pilots -- who also pull the triggers on missiles -- are contractors hired by the agency , former officials said .

Predators were originally designed as video surveillance aircraft that could hover over a target from high altitudes .
But new models are outfitted with additional intelligence gear that has enabled the CIA to confirm the identities of targets even when they are inside buildings and ca n’t be seen through the Predator ’s lens .
The agency is also working more closely with U.S. special operations teams and military intelligence aircraft that hug the Pakistan border , collecting pictures and intercepting radio or cellphone signals .
Even so , officials said that the surge in strikes has less to do with expanded capabilities than with the decision to skip Pakistani approval .
“ We had the data all along , ” said a former CIA official who oversaw Predator operations in Pakistan .
“ Finally we took off the gloves . ”
The Bush administration ’s decision to expand the Predator program was driven by growing alarm over Al Qaeda ’s resurgence in Pakistan ’s tribal belt .

A 2006 peace agreement between Islamabad and border tribes had allowed the network to shore up its finances , resume training operatives and reestablish connections with satellite groups .
The Bush administration had been constrained by its close ties with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf , who argued against aggressive U.S. action .
But by last summer , after a series of disrupted terrorist plots in Europe had been traced to Pakistan , there were calls for a new approach .
“ At a certain point there was common recognition of the untenable nature of what was happening in the FATA , ” said a former senior U.S. counter - terrorism official , referring to Pakistan ’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas where Al Qaeda is based .
The breaking point came when Musharraf was forced to resign mid-August , officials said .
Within days , President Bush had approved the new rules : Rather than requiring Pakistan ’s permission to order a Predator strike , the agency was allowed to shoot first .

The effect was immediate .
There were two Predator strikes on Aug. 31 , and three more by the end of the week .
CIA officials had suspected that their targets were being tipped by Pakistani intelligence to pending U.S. strikes ; bypassing the government ended that concern .
It also eliminated delays .
Former CIA officials said getting permission from Pakistani authorities could take a day or more , sometimes causing the agency to lose track of the target .
The missed opportunities were costly because it often took months to assemble the intelligence necessary for a strike .
In 2006 , for example , the CIA got word from Pakistani intelligence that Habib was staying at a compound in Miram Shah .
A CIA officer involved said he spent weeks at a Pakistani military outpost near the compound , monitoring images from a Predator on a flat - screen device .
Advertisement
“ We had a Predator up there for hours at a stretch , just watching , watching , ” the official said .
The agency studied the layout of the compound , trying to determine who slept where , and scanning the surrounding roads for the arrival of Habib ’s truck .
“ They took a shot at the compound a week after I left , ” the official said .
“ We got some bodyguards , but he was not there . ”
It took more than two years for the agency to catch up to Habib again .
He was killed in a Predator strike in South Waziristan in October .
Pakistan has repeatedly criticized the Predator campaign ; the attacks are reported to have caused dozens of civilian casualties .
“ Drone attacks are counterproductive , ” said Nadeem Kiani , press attache at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington .
Rather than firing missiles , Kiani said , the United States should provide intelligence to Pakistan “ and we will take immediate action . ”
U.S. officials say that despite such complaints , the Pakistani government ’s opposition has been muted because the CIA has expanded its targeting to include militant groups that threaten the government in Islamabad .

The success of the Predator campaign has prompted some counter - terrorism officials to speak of a post - Al Qaeda era in which its regional affiliates -- in North Africa and elsewhere -- are all that remain after the center collapses .
“ You can imagine a horizon in which Al Qaeda proper no longer exists , ” said Juan Zarate , former counter - terrorism advisor to Bush .
“ If you were to continue on this pace , and get No. 1 and No. 2 , Al Qaeda is dead .
You ca n’t resuscitate that organization as we know it without its senior leadership . ”
How to achieve that without undermining the government in Pakistan is a key issue the Obama administration faces as it searches for a new strategy in the region .
In a tour of the region , CIA Director Leon E. Panetta arrived in Islamabad Saturday for talks with Pakistani intelligence officials .
“ There ’s a risk of driving [ Al Qaeda and its allies ] farther and farther into Pakistan , into cities , ” said Daniel Byman , a former CIA analyst and terrorism expert at Georgetown University .
“ There ’s a danger of weakening the government we want to bolster .
It ’s already to some degree a house of cards . ”

In fact , the stepped - up strikes have coincided with a deterioration in security in Pakistan .
Over the last six months , Taliban elements tied to Al Qaeda have carried out increasingly bold attacks , including in Islamabad , and a recent truce between the government and militants in the Swat Valley was seen by some observers as a capitulation to Islamic hard - liners .
But proponents of the strikes argue that the opportunity to cripple Al Qaeda , perhaps permanently , outweighs concerns over the strains being placed on Pakistan .
“ Is this really helping when you have radical militants controlling more territory than ever before ? ” Zarate said .
“ That is a good question , but that is a different question from whether this is effective against Al Qaeda . ”
So far , that appears to be the prevailing view within the Obama administration .
A strike in Pakistan ’s North - West Frontier Province last Sunday was the second in four days , and the ninth this year .

Panetta , asked about the Predator attacks in a meeting with reporters last month , refused to discuss the program directly , but said , “ Nothing has changed our efforts to go after terrorists , and nothing will change those efforts . ”

The truth is out there , but not as far away as you might think
Three aid workers from Médecins sans Frontières Belgium are being held hostage after being kidnapped in Darfur , a spokeswoman said today .
Five staff were seized in Serif Umra , in the Sudanese province of North Darfur , but two – both Sudanese – were later released , MSF said .
A Canadian nurse , an Italian doctor and a French project co-ordinator are still being held .
" We have no information about the missing workers ' whereabouts or the motives for the abduction , " an MSF spokesperson said in Nairobi .
The agency said later that it would withdraw all medical teams from projects in Darfur and would leave only an " essential skeleton team " , who would try to secure the freedom of the staff being held hostage .
" MSF is extremely worried both for our abducted colleagues and for the populations that MSF teams had been providing medical aid to , " the agency said in a statement .
The staff were seized at about 8 pm GMT yesterday , Ahmed Salah , a spokesman for the United Nations African Mission in Darfur ( Unamid ) , said .
The immediate relatives of those still held hostage have been informed .
" Our thoughts are with the colleagues and families of those abducted , " the MSF spokeswoman said .
" MSF is deeply concerned about their safety and is doing everything it can to determine their whereabouts and ensure their safe and swift return . "
While both pro-and - anti government militias in Darfur often hijack aid vehicles and have previously kidnapped humanitarian workers , the timing will raise questions of possible state involvement .
The abductions came exactly a week after the international criminal court ( ICC ) issued an arrest warrant for Sudan 's president , Omar el Bashir , for alleged war crimes in Darfur .
In response , the government expelled 13 international aid agencies and three local organisations , having warned some of them a few days before that it could not guarantee their security .
Workers from the Dutch section of MSF were expelled from Darfur by the Sudanese government .
MSF
France also had its licence revoked .
MSF expressed outrage at the decision , which it said would leave more than 200,000 patients without essential medical care .
The UN estimates the expelled organisations , which also include Care , Oxfam and Save the Children , carried out about half of all the relief work in Darfur , where 4.7 million receive aid .
It has warned of a possible humanitarian crisis if the government does not immediately reverse its decision .
But Sudan , which accuses the aid agencies of spying for the ICC , has dismissed the fears , suggesting that non-Western humanitarian organisations could fill the gap .
" We have received many applications from Arab and Asian countries .
They want to go to Darfur , " said Ahmad Harun , Sudanese State Minister for Humanitarian Affairs , who is also sought by the ICC , on 51 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
Most of the expelled agencies have withdrawn their international staff from Sudan , following threats and harassment .
Last week , government officials interrogated dozens of foreign aid workers after examining seized computer records .
The government has also frozen the agencies ' bank accounts , and confiscated all assets , from mobile phones to 4x4 vehicles .
One aid agency , which asked not to be named , said though it was officially still appealing the expulsion order it was resigned to quitting Sudan .

It 's now official : Windows Vista , Microsoft 's over - hyped , underachieving operating system took top honors , winning the first - ever Fiasco Award announced in Barcelona , Spain .
The Fiasco Awards consists of a group of people linked to the Information and Communication Technologies ( ICT ) sector , which wants to reward the best non-successful projects in the area .
( Source : itwire.com )
Out of 6,043 votes , 5,222 were garnered by Windows Vista , beating out other contenders including Google 's Lively virtual world , the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) computer , and many others .

In 2005 , Microsoft announced Windows Vista .
In January 2007 , after a mega public relations blitz , it hit the market .
The need for many customers to upgrade their PCs was made less clear upon Window Vista 's release .
Compatibility Problems And Difficult Navigation
The Fiasco Awards web site notes that Windows Vista was a ) complicated to navigate and b ) had significant compatibility problems .
Collectively , this led many people to stick with Windows XP .
Furthermore , many PC makers recommended that consumers avoid Vista altogether because it was such a failure .
( Source : fiascoawards.com )
According to the awards organizers , Microsoft 's recent introduction of Windows 7 , Vista 's successor , indicates that even Microsoft was disappointed with Windows Vista .
The lesson , according to the Fiasco Award web site , is that more testing should be done to check reliability and performance before rolling out major product - marketing campaigns .
Promoting Critical Spirit And a Positive Attitude Towards Failure
The purpose of the Fiasco awards is to " promote critical spirit and a positive attitude towards failure , which is a necessary stage in the road to success , " say the awards organizers .

AT THE end of February , the orchards of California 's Central Valley are dusted with pink and white blossom , as millions of almond trees make their annual bid for reproduction .
The delicate flowers attract pollinators , mostly honeybees , to visit and collect nectar and pollen .
By offering fly - through hospitality , the trees win the prize of a brush with a pollen - covered bee and the chance of cross-pollination with another tree .
In recent years , however , there has been alarm over possible shortages of honeybees and scary stories of beekeepers finding that 30 - 50 % of their charges have vanished over the winter .
It is called colony collapse disorder ( CCD ) , and its cause remains a mystery .
Add to this worries about long - term falls in the populations of other pollinators , such as butterflies and bats , and the result is a growing impression of a threat to nature 's ability to supply enough nectar - loving animals to service mankind 's crops .
This year , however , the story has developed a twist .
In California the shortage of bees has been replaced by a glut .
Bee good to me
The annual orgy of sexual reproduction in the Californian almond orchards owes little to the unintended bounty of nature .
Francis Ratnieks , a professor of apiculture at Sussex University who has worked on the state 's almond farms , says the crop is so large and intensively grown these days that it has greatly surpassed the region 's inherent ability to supply pollinators .
Decades ago , when there were fewer almonds , farmers could rely on pollination just from the beekeepers who live in the Central Valley .
Now , they have to import migrant apian labour .
Scientific AG , a firm based in Bakersfield , California , helps broker pollination deals between local almond growers and apiarists from across America .
Joe Traynor , the pollination broker who founded Scientific AG , says that in the 1960s there were 100,000 acres ( 40,000 hectares ) of groves .
Today it is 700,000 acres and the industry claims it supplies 80 % of the world 's almonds .
In order to meet this pollination demand , more than a third of America 's beehives must be moved to California for the season .
Such changes to the industry have been reflected in the prices for bee hives .
In 1995 growers could rent a hive for $ 35 .
Today , says Mr Traynor , a strong colony would cost $ 150 - 200 .
It is hard to pin down what has been causing honeybees to vanish .
“ People want it to be genetically modified crops , pollution , mobile - phone masts and pesticides , ” says Dr Ratnieks , and it is “ almost certainly none of those ” .
But he adds that such large losses to a population are not unusual in epidemics .
One explanation offered by both Dr Ratnieks and Mr Traynor is of a once - rare disease , possibly caused by the Israeli acute paralysis virus ( IAPV ) , sweeping through colonies that have already been weakened by parasites such as Nosema ceranae , a parasitic fungus from Asia .
Some have suggested that N. ceranae alone might be sufficient to cause CCD , as the fungus is believed to have been widespread since 2006 , when CCD first became a problem .
There is also Varroa , a parasitic mite , which has been another problem in bees for some time , and which might also transmit the IAPV .
But there is almost certainly a further factor causing stress on the bees — a poor diet .
Bee-conomics
It is increasingly being recognised that managed bees need food supplements .
In some places , a decline in the area of pasture land on which they can forage , the loss of weedy borders and the growth of crop monocultures mean it is hard for bees to find a wide enough range of pollen sources to obtain all their essential amino acids .
In extreme cases they may not even find enough basic protein .
Writing in Bee Culture this February , Mr Traynor observes that places where crops with low - protein pollens , such as blueberries and sunflowers , are grown are also places where CCD has appeared .
The suggestion is that poor nutrition has weakened the bees ' immune systems , making them more vulnerable to viruses and other parasites .
Feeding bees supplements , rather than relying on their ability to forage in the wild , costs time and money .
Many beekeepers therefore try to avoid it .
Anecdote suggests , however , that those who do fork out find their colonies are far more resistant to CCD .
This year 's Californian bee glut , then , has been caused by a mixture of rising supply meeting falling demand .
The price of almonds dropped by 30 % between August and December last year , as people had less money in their pockets .
That has caused growers to cut costs , and therefore hire fewer hives .
There is also a drought in the region , and many farmers are unlikely to receive enough water to go ahead with the harvest .
Meanwhile , the recent high prices for pollination contracts made it look worthwhile fattening bees up with supplements over the winter .
That may help explain why there have been fewer colony collapses .
The rise and fall of the managed honeybee , then , owes as much to the economics of supply and demand as it does to the forces of nature .
And if the nutrition and disease theory is correct , next year 's lower contract prices may see beekeepers cutting back on supplemental feeding , and a resurgence of CCD .
Bee off with you !
Despite the importance of the honeybee , none of this is evidence of a wide - scale pollination crisis or a threat that is specific to pollinators .
No one has shown that colonies of wild bees are collapsing any more frequently than they used to .
And while it is true that many species of butterflies , moths , birds , bats and other pollinators are in retreat , their problems are far more likely to mirror broader declines in biodiversity that are the result of well - known phenomena such as habitat loss and the intensification of agriculture .
Troubling though this loss of diversity is , it does not necessarily translate into a decline in the amount of pollination going on .
Jaboury Ghazoul of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich , writing in Trends in Ecology and Evolution in 2005 , points out that the decline of bumblebees in Europe that has been observed recently mostly affects rare and specialised species — an altogether different problem .
Though the idea that there is a broader and costly pollination crisis under way is entrenched ( the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation is spending $ 28 m on a report investigating it ) , the true picture is cloudier .
In 2006 America 's National Academy of Sciences released a report on the status of pollinators in North America that concluded “ for most North American pollinator species , long - term population data are lacking and knowledge of their basic ecology is incomplete . ”
Simply put , nobody knows .
As for the managed bees of America , Dr Ratnieks says that “ the imminent death of the honeybee has been reported so many times , but it has not happened and is not likely to do so ” .
Exit polls : Economy voters ' No. 1 concern RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday November 4 , 2008

The economy is the top concern of more than six in 10 voters , and a majority would like to see the government do more to solve the nation 's problems , according to Election Day exit polls .
Networks began reporting the poll results just after 5 p.m. Tuesday .
They found that 62 percent of voters say the economy is their top concern , compared to 10 percent who said Iraq , 9 percent who said terrorism and 9 percent who said healthcare .
According to the polls , which are conducted by major networks and the Associated Press , 51 percent of voters want a more active government while 43 percent say the government is doing too much .
Two - thirds of voters are worried about affording healthcare , while 32 percent are not concerned .
The poll also found 68 percent of voters favor expanding offshore drilling for oil and natural gas .
Just 6 percent of voters gave the economy high marks , while 93 percent offered a negative economic rating .
Four - fifths of voters worried that the economic downturn would hurt their families finances .
On taxes , 70 percent believe they will pay higher taxes if Barack Obama wins the presidency , and 61 percent predict higher taxes under McCain .
Half said taxes would increase regardless of who 's elected .
Obama has said he wants to only raise taxes on the top 5 percent of earners , while McCain has promised not to raise income taxes on anyone .
The polls also found Obama had contacted more voters that McCain ; 27 percent of voters said they were contacted by the Obama campaign , compared to 19 percent by McCain .
DEVELOPING ...
Before its portfolio of bad loans helped trigger the current housing crisis , mortgage giant Freddie Mac was the focus of a major accounting scandal that led to a management shake - up , huge fines and scalding condemnation of passive directors by a top federal regulator .
One of those allegedly asleep - at - the - switch board members was Chicago 's Rahm Emanuel — now chief of staff to President Barack Obama — who made at least $ 320,000 for a 14 - month stint at Freddie Mac that required little effort .
As gatekeeper to Obama , Emanuel now plays a critical role in addressing the nation 's mortgage woes and fulfilling the administration 's pledge to impose responsibility on the financial world .
Emanuel 's Freddie Mac involvement has been a prominent point on his political résumé , and his healthy payday from the firm has been no secret either .
What is less known , however , is how little he apparently did for his money and how he benefited from the kind of cozy ties between Washington and Wall Street that have fueled the nation 's current economic mess .
Though just 49 , Emanuel is a veteran Democratic strategist and fundraiser who served three terms in the U.S. House after helping elect Mayor Richard Daley and former President Bill Clinton .
The Freddie Mac money was a small piece of the $ 16 million he made in a three - year interlude as an investment banker a decade ago .
In business as in politics , Emanuel has cultivated an aggressive , take - charge reputation that made him rich and propelled his rise to the front of the national stage .
But buried deep in corporate and government documents on the Freddie Mac scandal is a little - known and very different story involving Emanuel .
He was named to the Freddie Mac board in February 2000 by Clinton , whom Emanuel had served as White House political director and vocal defender during the Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky scandals .
The board met no more than six times a year .
Unlike most fellow directors , Emanuel was not assigned to any of the board 's working committees , according to company proxy statements .
Immediately upon joining the board , Emanuel and other new directors qualified for $ 380,000 in stock and options plus a $ 20,000 annual fee , records indicate .
On Emanuel 's watch , the board was told by executives of a plan to use accounting tricks to mislead shareholders about outsize profits the government - chartered firm was then reaping from risky investments .
The goal was to push earnings onto the books in future years , ensuring that Freddie Mac would appear profitable on paper for years to come and helping maximize annual bonuses for company brass .
The accounting scandal was n't the only one that brewed during Emanuel 's tenure .
During his brief time on the board , the company hatched a plan to enhance its political muscle .
That scheme , also reviewed by the board , led to a record $ 3.8 million fine from the Federal Election Commission for illegally using corporate resources to host fundraisers for politicians .
Emanuel was the beneficiary of one of those parties after he left the board and ran in 2002 for a seat in Congress from the North Side of Chicago .
The board was throttled for its acquiescence to the accounting manipulation in a 2003 report by Armando Falcon Jr. , head of a federal oversight agency for Freddie Mac .
The scandal forced Freddie Mac to restate $ 5 billion in earnings and pay $ 585 million in fines and legal settlements .
It also foreshadowed even harder times at the firm .
Many of those same risky investment practices tied to the accounting scandal eventually brought the firm to the brink of insolvency and led to its seizure last year by the Bush administration , which pledged to inject up to $ 100 billion in new capital to keep the firm afloat .
The Obama administration has doubled that commitment .
Freddie Mac reported recently that it lost $ 50 billion in 2008 .
It so far has tapped $ 14 billion of the government 's guarantee and said it soon will need an additional $ 30 billion to keep operating .
Like its larger government - chartered cousin Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac was created by Congress to promote home ownership , though both are private corporations with shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange .
The two firms hold stakes in half the nation 's residential mortgages .
Because of Freddie Mac 's federal charter , the board in Emanuel 's day was a hybrid of directors elected by shareholders and those appointed by the president .
In his final year in office , Clinton tapped three close pals : Emanuel , Washington lobbyist and golfing partner James Free , and Harold Ickes , a former White House aide instrumental in securing the election of Hillary Clinton to the U.S. Senate .
Free 's appointment was good for four months , and Ickes ' only three months .
Falcon , director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight , found that presidential appointees played no " meaningful role " in overseeing the company and recommended that their positions be eliminated .
John Coffee , a law professor and expert on corporate governance at Columbia University , said the financial crisis at Freddie Mac was years in the making and fueled by chronically weak oversight by the firm 's directors .
The presence of presidential appointees on the board did n't help , he added .
" You know there was a patronage system and these people were only going to serve a short time , " Coffee said .
" That 's why [ they ] get the stock upfront . "
Financial disclosure statements that are required of U.S. House members show Emanuel made at least $ 320,000 from his time at Freddie Mac .
Two years after leaving the firm , Emanuel reported an additional sale of Freddie Mac stock worth between $ 100,001 and $ 250,000 .
The document did not detail whether he profited from the sale .
Sarah Feinberg , a spokeswoman for Emanuel , said there was no conflict between his stint at Freddie Mac and Obama 's vow to restore confidence in financial institutions and the executives who run them .
At the same time , Feinberg said Emanuel now agrees that presidential appointees to the Freddie Mac board " are unnecessary and do n't have long enough terms to make a difference . "
Former President George W. Bush voluntarily stopped making such appointments following Falcon 's assessment of their uselessness .
In an interview , Falcon said the Freddie Mac board did most of its work in committees .
Yet proxy statements that detailed committee assignments showed none for Emanuel , Free or Ickes during the time they served in 2000 or 2001 .
Most other directors carried two committee assignments each .
Contrary to the proxy statements , Feinberg said she believed that Emanuel served on board committees that oversaw Freddie Mac 's investment strategies and mortgage purchase activities .
But Feinberg acknowledged she had no official documents to back up that assertion .
The Obama administration rejected a Tribune request under the Freedom of Information Act to review Freddie Mac board minutes and correspondence during Emanuel 's time as a director .
The documents , obtained by Falcon for his investigation , were " commercial information " exempt from disclosure , according to a lawyer for the Federal Housing Finance Agency .
Emanuel 's board term expired in May 2001 , and soon after he launched his Democratic congressional bid .
One of Emanuel 's fellow directors at Freddie Mac was Neil Hartigan , the former Illinois attorney general .
Hartigan said Emanuel 's primary contribution was explaining to others on the board how to play the levers of power .
He was respected on the board for his understanding of " the dynamics of the legislative process and the executive branch at senior levels , " Hartigan recalled .
" I would n't say he was outspoken .
What he was , was solid . "
By the time Emanuel joined Freddie Mac , the company had begun to loosen lending standards and buy riskier sub - prime loans .
It was a practice that later blew up and contributed to the current foreclosure crisis .
In his investigation , Falcon concluded that the board of directors on which Emanuel sat was so pliant that Freddie Mac 's managers easily were able to massage company ledgers .
They manipulated bookkeeping to smooth out volatility , perpetuating Freddie Mac 's industry reputation as " Steady Freddie , " a reliable producer of earnings growth .
Wall Street liked what it saw , Freddie Mac 's stock value soared and top executives collected their bonuses .
Another focus of Freddie during Emanuel 's day — and one that played to his skill set — was a stepped - up effort to combat congressional demands for more regulation .
During a September 2000 board meeting — midway through Emanuel 's 14 - month term — Freddie Mac lobbyist R. Mitchell Delk laid out a strategy titled " Political Risk Management " aimed at influencing lawmakers and blunting pressure in Congress for more regulation .
Through Delk 's initiative , Freddie Mac sponsored more than 80 fundraisers that raised at least $ 1.7 million for congressional candidates despite a federal law that bans corporations from direct political activity .
Emanuel spokeswoman Sarah Feinberg said Emanuel " ca n't remember the meeting or topic " but might have been in attendance when Delk outlined his plans .
Feinberg downplayed the significance of the fundraiser thrown for Emanuel , which brought in $ 7,000 , stressing that it was but one of many hosted by Delk .
The event stood out in at least one respect , however .
The Freddie Mac - linked events were mostly for Republicans , and only a handful benefited Democrats like Emanuel .
" Rahm was a good friend of mine .
He was on Freddie Mac 's board .
He was very much supportive of housing , " said Delk , who resigned under pressure in 2004 .
Then - Freddie Mac CEO
Leland Brendsel also hosted a fundraising lunch for Emanuel 's 2002 campaign that netted $ 9,500 from top company executives .
Brendsel was later ousted in the accounting scandal .
Federal campaign records show that Emanuel received $ 25,000 from donors with ties to Freddie Mac in the 2002 campaign cycle , more than twice the amount collected that election by any other candidate for the U.S. House or Senate .
Emanuel joined the House in January 2003 and was named to the Financial Services Committee , where he also sat on the subcommittee that directly oversaw Freddie Mac .
A few months later , Freddie Mac Chief Executive Officer Leland Brendsel was forced out , and the committee and subcommittee launched hearings to sort out the mess , spanning more than a year .
Emanuel skipped every hearing , congressional records indicate .
Feinberg said Emanuel recused himself " from deliberations related to Freddie Mac to avoid even the appearance of favoritism , impropriety or a conflict of interest . "

The Devil ’s Dictionary
By Ambrose Bierce
Presented by
Auth o rama
Public Domain Books
Author ’s Preface
The Devil ’s Dictionary was begun in a weekly paper in 1881 , and was continued in a desultory way at long intervals until 1906 .
In that year a large part of it was published in covers with the title The Cynic ’s Word Book , a name which the author had not the power to reject or happiness to approve .
To quote the publishers of the present work :
“ This more reverent title had previously been forced upon him by the religious scruples of the last newspaper in which a part of the work had appeared , with the natural consequence that when it came out in covers the country already had been flooded by its imitators with a score of ’ cynic ’ books 
The Cynic ’s This , The Cynic ’s That , and The Cynic ’s t’Other .
Most of these books were merely stupid , though some of them added the distinction of silliness .
Among them , they brought the word ’ cynic ’ into disfavor so deep that any book bearing it was discredited in advance of publication . ”
Meantime , too , some of the enterprising humorists of the country had helped themselves to such parts of the work as served their needs , and many of its definitions , anecdotes , phrases and so forth , had become more or less current in popular speech .
This explanation is made , not with any pride of priority in trifles , but in simple denial of possible charges of plagiarism , which is no trifle .
In merely resuming his own the author hopes to be held guiltless by those to whom the work is addressed  enlightened souls who prefer dry wines to sweet , sense to sentiment , wit to humor and clean English to slang .
A conspicuous , and it is hope not unpleasant , feature of the book is its abundant illustrative quotations from eminent poets , chief of whom is that learned and ingenius cleric , Father Gassalasca Jape , S.J. , whose lines bear his initials .
To Father Jape ’s kindly encouragement and assistance the author of the prose text is greatly indebted .

The Boss Says No : Bruce Springsteen Already Campaigning Against Ticketmaster - Live Nation Deal
Struggling Ticketmaster , which holds a near - monopoly on concert ticket sales , wants to merge with struggling Live Nation ( LYV ) , which is the biggest concert promoter in the world .
Will antitrust regulators let this one fly ?
We ’ll find out once the reported deal becomes official , which could happen as early as Friday .
In the meantime , you can consider the varied opinions of antitrust attorneys and experts quoted in The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times .
Or you can just ask the Boss , who gives the deal an unqualified thumbs down .
The story : Bruce Springsteen happens to be embarking on yet another megatour ( perhaps you caught him on TV the other day ) .
Said tour , which is using Ticketmaster ( TKTM ) to sell tickets ( again , like just about everyone else in the concert business ) has already run into a snafu involving TicketsNow , the “ secondary marketplace ” ( i.e. , legal aftermarket / scalping ) company Ticketmaster bought last year .
If you want the details , you can consult Springsteen ’s Web site , where the musician and manager Jon Landau have posted a long apology .
Or you can cut to the chase :
The one thing that would make the current ticket situation even worse for the fan than it is now would be Ticketmaster and Live Nation coming up with a single system , thereby returning us to a near monopoly situation in music ticketing .
Several newspapers are reporting on this story right now .
If you , like us , oppose that idea , you should make it known to your representatives .
The abuse of our fans and our trust by Ticketmaster has made us as furious as it has made many of you .
We will continue to do our utmost now and in the future to make sure that these practices are permanently curtailed on our tours . ”
And that ’s the thing :
There are plenty of companies Americans enjoy disliking , but most of them have some kind of lobby and political clout to help shrug off that animus .
But just about anyone who ’s bought a concert ticket has at some point cursed Ticketmaster for some kind of perceived slight or insult .
And unlike banks , oil , health care or any of our favorite bugaboos , it ’s hard to argue that ticket brokers perform some crucial function in our economy , so we have to put up with it .
Ticketmaster CEO Irving Azoff is one shrewd dude .
But he ’s going to have to be awfully persuasive to find people in Washington willing to back this one when it gets to Washington .
Reports across the pond claim that Amazon.com has stopped selling the game Rapelay , a Japanese video game that involves the player stalking victims and then raping them .

The rape simulation game involves players chasing a mother on the subway and violently raping her , and then tracking down and raping her two daughters described as virgin schoolgirls .
The game includes even more horrific details according to online game reviews , such as the option get other men to join in the attacks , having to force the women to get abortions if they get pregnant , and what a review ( NSFW ) from Something Awful says are " tears that glisten and move in the little girl 's eyes . "
Following a report from the Belfast Telegraph that Amazon was selling the English version of the game , the company has removed it from the site .
Amazon has not commented on the item or said why it was being sold through their website .
The screen shot below from Google 's cache shows the Amazon page for the game before it was taken down .

The game is produced by the Japanese company Illusion , which makes other 3D adult video games .
According to the Illusion Wikipedia page , company policy says that , " games are not intended to be sold or used outside of Japan , and official support is only given in Japanese and for use in Japan . "
As if somehow the game being sold only in Japan makes it any less disgusting .
British MP Keith Vaz says he is planning to raise the issue in Parliament .
" It is intolerable that anyone would purchase a game that simulates the criminal offence of rape , " said Vaz .
" To know that this widely available through a major online retailer is utterly shocking , I do not see how this can be allowed . "
Last year , when Vaz brought up rape simulation video games during a discussion on a bill about film ratings , he was criticized by other MPs who said such games did n't exist and gamers who commented online that he did n't know what he was talking about .
Though the game is no longer available on Amazon , the English version of the game is still being sold on here on eBay , here on Overstock.com , and on many other websites .

Amazon Drops Rape Simulation Game [ The Belfast Telegraph ]
Rapelay Review [ Something Awful ] ( NSFW )
You have probably heard of green buildings , green cars and , perhaps , even green phones .
But were you aware that green beer is flowing from the taps of some U.S. breweries , and not the kind for St. Patrick 's Day tomorrow ?
Among the leaders of the movement is Lucky Labrador Brewing Company in Portland , Ore. , which for the past year has been saving big bucks by using solar energy to heat water used in the brewing process .
Lucky Labrador 's first green beer , " Solar Flare Ale , " was an instant sensation when it was introduced in February 2008 , according to brewery co-owner Gary Geist .
Sales spiked in the month following the beer 's debut , Geist says .
But , he notes that going solar is more about long - term benefits than about temporary sales spurts .
He says the entire system , which includes 16 solar panels on the brewery roof , cost about $ 70,000 up front but that it ended up costing only about $ 6,000 , thanks to a $ 21,000 ( 30 percent ) federal tax credit , a $ 35,000 ( 50 percent ) state tax credit , and an $ 8,000 incentive from the Energy Trust of Oregon ( a nonprofit that assists businesses taking steps to reduce their gas and electrical energy consumption ) .
It was quite the investment , he says , given that it saves the company about $ 3,000 annually in gas bills , which means it will have paid for itself by this time next year .
To understand how the sun powers Lucky Lab 's beer - making operation , you must first understand how the beer is brewed .
There are three stages to brewing , and two of them require very hot water , Geist explains .
The first is to mix barley with water that 's about 160 degrees Fahrenheit ( 71 degrees Celsius ) in a nine - foot - ( 2.7 - meter - ) tall steel tank called the " mash tun " ( the traditional term for barrel ) .
When combined with hot water , the enzymes in the barley convert its starch into sugars .
Using a large fiberglass paddle , a brewer stirs the mixture , which Geist says looks like " cereal in water . "
After about an hour and a half , the sugary liquid , now called " wort , " is separated from the barley with a sieve and transferred into a kettle , where it is boiled , along with hops — plants containing oils that give beer its bitter aroma and flavor .
Finally , the wort is removed from the kettle , cooled , and then poured into a closed tank called a fermenter where it is combined with yeast , microbes that convert the sugars to alcohol and carbon dioxide .
The solar power drives the first step of the brewing process when the barley is mixed with hot water , says Bruce McLeod , lead installer for Ra Energy , the company that provided Lucky Lab with its system .
Water entering the mash tun gets its heat from 16 four - by - 10 - foot ( 1.2 - by - 3 - meter ) " solar thermal collectors , " thick panels atop the brewery 's roof .
As the panels absorb heat from the sun , a liquid made of propylene glycol and water that resists freezing during Oregon 's cold winters within them becomes scorching hot ( up to 230 degrees F , or 110 degrees C ) , McLeod explains .
This broiling liquid passes through pipes into a heat exchanger , which transfers the heat energy to water stored in a massive 1,500 - gallon ( 5,680 - liter ) tank in the brewery .
This storage tank supplies hot water not only for the brewing process but for the kitchen and bathroom sinks , too , according to Geist .
He notes that the system works like a hybrid car , meaning it gets its energy to heat water from two sources : solar energy , used in the mash tun phase , and natural gas , which is necessary for the kettle phase .
The reason the sun cannot drive the whole process , he says , is because the solar system cannot heat water beyond 180 degrees F ( 82 degrees C ) , which is shy of the 212 degrees F ( 100 degrees C ) needed to make it boil .
For this reason , Lucky Labrador cannot go 100 percent green — though it gets kudos from enviros for reducing its natural gas consumption by about 25 percent in the past year .
Does the beer taste any different ?
Not a bit , Geist says , noting he has no regrets about his decision to brew green .
" We discovered that going solar was not only good for sustainability , " he says , " but a good business decision with a great investment return . "
North Korean guards have detained one or more American journalists near the country 's border with China , South Korean media have reported .
The news comes amid increasing strains on the peninsula .
Pyongyang is angry at Seoul and Washington 's annual joint military drill , while the latter fear the North is planning to launch a ballistic missile next month .
South Korean television channel YTV said guards from the North crossed the border into Chinese territory to arrest two US journalists , quoting an official in Seoul .
It said the two women , described as Korean - American employees of a California - based online news company , had ignored warnings to stop filming across the Tumen river .
The Munhwa Ilbo evening newspaper said guards had detained one US journalist near the Yalu river , along the western part of the border between the two countries , which runs into the Tumen river on the east side .
" It 's difficult to comment on this matter because it involves a US citizen , but our government is aware that a US journalist is in detention in the North , " a senior government official told the paper .
Another diplomatic source said the US state department would be dealing with the case soon .
The foreign ministry in Seoul could not immediately confirm the report .
Pyongyang appeared to regard the arrival of the Obama administration as a prospect for improving relations between the two countries .
But its announcement that it will launch a satellite between 4 April and 8 April has increased regional strains .
Seoul , Washington and Tokyo say they believe it will in fact test a long - range ballistic missile in violation of a United Nations security council resolution .
Japan 's defence minister , Yasukazu Hamada , said today that Tokyo may mobilise a missile shield , moving PAC - 3 missiles near the capital further north to protect against fragments that might fall into Japanese territory if the launch fails .
The Chinese premier , Wen Jiabao , yesterday urged the North to co-operate with efforts to revive the deadlocked international talks on nuclear disarmament , another of the stumbling blocks in improving relations .
The official People 's Daily newspaper said Wen told his counterpart , Kim Yong - il – no relation of the country 's leader Kim Jong - il – that China wants to " actively push forward " the six - party negotiations .
Kim will today meet China 's president , Hu Jintao , for talks which may include discussion about a possible summit with Kim Jong - il , the South Korean news agency Yonhap said Thursday , citing unnamed sources in Beijing .
It said that Chinese leaders had invited Kim to visit , possibly in early April .
Beijing is North Korea 's biggest benefactor .

An armed gang has ransacked the oldest Jewish synagogue in the Venezuelan capital Caracas after occupying the building for several hours .
About 15 unidentified men broke into the building before daubing graffiti on the walls and desecrating scriptures .
They also called for Jewish people to be expelled from the country .
Jewish leaders say tensions have risen since Venezuela broke diplomatic relations with Israel this month over its recent military offensive in Gaza .
Elias Farache , president of Venezuela 's Jewish Association , said the gang had tied and gagged security guards before destroying offices and the place where holy books were kept .
Anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli slogans were painted on the walls .
" Never in the history of Venezuela 's Jewish community have we been the target of such an aggression , " said Mr Farache .
" The climate is very tense .
We feel threatened , intimidated , attacked . "
' Moral force '
Venezuela and Israel have had strained relations for some time , and Caracas has been fiercely critical of Israel 's military operations in Gaza , which started in late December .
The Venezuelan ambassador and his staff were ordered to leave the country on 6 January , and President Hugo Chavez has urged Israelis to stand up against their government .
Israel responded by ordering Venezuelan diplomats to leave , declaring them " persona non grata in Israel " earlier this week .
But Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro condemned the " criminal act of vandalism " at the synagogue .
" We call all the Venezuelan people , the entire Venezuelan community , to reject these actions , with the same moral force with which we reject the crimes committed against the Palestinian people , " he said .
Venezuelan Information Minister Jesse Chacon also condemned the attack and denied it had any connection with the government .
He said the government 's " excellent relationship " with Venezuela 's Jewish community was in no way affected by Israel 's actions .
THE country has fallen on hard times , but those of us who love cities know we have been living in the dark ages for a while now .
We know that turning things around will take more than just pouring money into shovel - ready projects , regardless of how they might boost the economy .
Windmills wo n’t do it either .
We long for a bold urban vision .
With their crowded neighborhoods and web of public services , cities are not only invaluable cultural incubators ; they are also vastly more efficient than suburbs .
But for years they have been neglected , and in many cases forcibly harmed , by policies that favored sprawl over density and conformity over difference .
Such policies have caused many of our urban centers to devolve into generic theme parks and others , like Detroit , to decay into ghost towns .
They have also sparked the rise of ecologically unsustainable gated communities and reinforced economic disparities by building walls between racial , ethnic and class groups .
Correcting this imbalance will require a radical adjustment in how we think of cities and government ’s role in them .
At times it will mean destruction rather than repair .
And it demands listening to people who have spent the last decade imagining and in many cases planning for more sustainable , livable and socially just cities .
Investors have grown numb to a stock market that knows no direction but down .
Tuesday was another discouraging day as the market was unable to muster a bounce following Monday 's drop to a new 12 - year low .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average failed to hold onto a midafternoon rally and ended the session down 37.27 points at 6726.02 , its fifth day of declines .
The Dow has dropped 11 out of the past 13 trading days , and over that period has fallen 15.3 % .
Investors like Linda Pace have stopped watching .
Ms. Pace says she has n't looked at her investment portfolio since September , when markets began their rapid descent .
" I 'm afraid I 'll just burst into tears , " says Ms. Pace , a 55 - year - old in Pine Mountain , Ga. , who had invested some of her savings and an inheritance from her mother .
" I used to pay more attention to it but I 'm so horrified by what 's going on .
I have n't got a clue what I 've got right now . "
Gina Balcom , a once - avid follower of financial markets , also is n't hearing any of it .
The 34 - year - old resident of Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , says she has stopped watching financial news on television and has n't looked at her 401 ( k ) statements except to prepare her tax filing .

BUDAPEST ( Reuters ) -
The world faces a final opportunity to agree an adequate global response to climate change at a U.N. - led meeting in Copenhagen in December , the European Union ’s environment chief said on Friday .

World leaders from about 190 countries meet in Copenhagen in December to try to agree a global framework to replace the Kyoto Protocol on fighting global warming , which expires in 2012 .
“ It is now 12 years since Kyoto was created .
This makes Copenhagen the world ’s last chance to stop climate change before it passes the point of no return , ” European Union Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas told a climate conference in Budapest on Friday .
“ Having an agreement in Copenhagen is not only possible , it is imperative and we are going to have it , ” Dimas said .
With greenhouse gas emissions rising faster than projected , Dimas said it was essential that big polluters such as the United States and emerging economies in the Far East and South America also sign up for an agreement .
“ President Obama ’s commitment to re-engage the United States fully in combating climate change is an enormously encouraging sign that progress is possible .
So are positive initiatives coming from China , India , Brazil and other emerging economies . ”
Dimas said an agreement in Copenhagen should aim to limit global warming below the critical 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial times , or less than 1.2 degrees above the current level , by at least halving global emissions by 2050 from 1990 levels .
“ Developed countries will have to go further , with cuts of 80 - 95 percent in order to ( enable ) developing countries to lift themselves out of poverty , ” he said .
Dimas said rich nations had a moral obligation to lead the war against global warming and the EU was ready to commit to deeper emissions cuts , provided that developed countries match those cuts with similar reductions .
“ The European Union is committed to increasing its reductions targets from 20 percent to 30 percent ( by 2020 ) on two conditions , ” Dimas said .
“ Firstly that our partners in the industrialized world commit to comparable cuts , secondly , that developing countries agree to take action in line with their capabilities . ”
However , he said richer countries should provide financial incentives for emerging economies to facilitate a deal .
“ The Copenhagen agreement will have to involve a major scaling up of financial aid to help developing countries to both mitigate emissions and adapt to climate change , ” Dimas said .
“ If there is no money on the table there will be no deal . ”
Otto Baxter tried dating girls with Down 's syndrome Otto Baxter is 21 and has Down 's syndrome .
His mother Lucy thinks he should have all the experiences that other young men of his age have - including sex .
Otto and Lucy spoke to BBC Radio 5 Live 's Victoria Derbyshire show .
Lucy Baxter says she has only ever wanted her son to lead an " ordinary " life .
" I wanted him to do exactly the same as everybody else so I was very keen he went to a mainstream school , " she said .
" I had a job keeping him there because the authorities wanted him in a special school .
" But I believe that he has every right to have the same opportunities as everybody else . "
To that end , Otto had friends without disabilites , went to youth clubs and parties .

" I can't see that one can be a rounded individual in our society if you do n't participate in everything that we participate in , " she said .
Otto has plenty of female friends but as he got older it became harder for him to take the steps his male friends took for granted .
" You do n't go to secondary school without being very well aware of sex , " Lucy told Victoria Derbyshire .
" The trouble is , when he goes out on the town to nightclubs and pubs these days his friends get lucky .
Otto manages to get off with somebody , a snog or two , but then they do n't want any more than that .
" And that 's where it 's very difficult for him . "
Sometimes he comes down in the morning and is sad - he just wants a girlfriend
Lucy Baxter
Otto decided he would like one friend , Hannah , to be his girlfriend , so he wrote down all the things he would like to do with her .
He said he wrote : " Things I 'd like to do with Hannah is have a shower together , wash her back and have a lazy day in bed together .
Also go to the cinema and things like that . "
But Hannah wanted to stay just friends .
Otto tried dating agencies , including a " special " one in a bid to meet girls who also had Down's .
But Lucy said the girls
Otto met there had been " fairly institutionalised " and he " did n't have anything in common " with them .
When he went on a date with one girl , her carers prevented them from moving the relationship past friendship .
Ideal girl " What 21 - year - old would put up with that ? " said Lucy .
" Unfortunately Otto is caught between two different worlds , two different cultures .
" One is a very disabled culture where everything is special and you 're treated like a child and the girls there very often have been treated like kids .
" This is dying out now and I think a lot of young parents of people with Down 's syndrome want different things for their children .
They want equality . "
Lucy said it is not just about getting her son sex .
" Sometimes he comes down in the morning and is sad .
He just wants a girlfriend . "
Otto concurs .
" I really do , " he said .
And his ideal girl ?

Manitoba 's justice minister says it 's only a matter of time before children who are artificially conceived after the death of a parent get the same inheritance rights as their siblings .
Dave Chomiak says the current law does n't recognize the growing use of artificial conception and reproductive technology .
Right now , children born anywhere in Canada using frozen sperm or other reproductive technology do n't have any clear legal claim to a biological parent 's estate if there is no will .
Manitoba 's law commission says that discriminates against children who do n't have any control over how they were conceived .
The commission says Manitoba should be the first in Canada to extend inheritance rights to posthumously conceived children .
Chomiak says the law will be changed but he would like to see what other provinces do first .

Asking an Indian whether he believes in God seems to be an unnecessary question considering the deep rooted religious and spiritual outlook that the society here is accustomed to .
And you could be pardoned to dismiss Atheism in India as “ Im the smartass ” conversations among a few disillusioned youth outside the intimidating presence of hundreds of temples , churches and mosques .
Though its acceptance is debatable , of the several thousand ideologies that evolved in the Indian society , Atheism should be the most unlikely that you would figure to be 1800 years old
It was in the year 600 BC ( or 600 BCE to be politically correct ) that the first atheist school of thought , Lokyāta ( or Carvaka ) came into existence .
Brihaspati , an ancient philosopher founded and preached the Lokayata thought and is considered the father of Atheist movement in India .
His views were anything but conservative even in the current context .
“ As long as you live , live happily , take a loan and drink ghee .
After a body is reduced to ashes where will it come back from ? ”
It spoke of a self - centred hedonistic approach to Atheism which never quelled the element of fear , the foundation of religion as per philosopher and mathematician , Bertrand Russell .
Very little is documented about Lokyāta and its demise in 1400 AD though it does n’t come as a surprise considering the fate of several scientists and thinkers in the West who faced torture and persecution from religious bodies like the Catholic Church because of their refusal to acknowledge the existence of God .
Hinduism ’s tryst with Atheism is rather intriguing when you take into account ‘ Nastika ’ , a school of thought that advocated the rejection of belief in the Vedas ( Astika ) but later came to be associated with atheism itself .
Though several schools of thought like the Nyay Sutras , Samkhya and Vaisheshika evolved with varying degrees of dependence on logical , scientific and sometimes spiritual methodologies , almost all of them failed to acknowledge the importance of social contribution and address the real world problems in the Indian society .
Goparaju Ramachandra Rao ( aka Gora ) vowed to change that when he started the Atheist Centre in 1940 and established a headquarters in Vijayawada on the eve of India ’s independence in 1947 .
Combining humanism and his passion for enabling social change , Gora along with his wife worked tirelessly towards uplifting the poor and the lower caste .
His atheism was positive , not an instrument of exhibiting intellectual superiority over conservationists in cocktail parties .
He did share a good rapport with Mahatma Gandhi though when he was conferred with the G D Birla International Award for Humanism , The Hindu called him ‘ a Gandhian and freedom fighter ’ while his association with atheism was more or less ignored .
Maybe an atheist contributing to the society in India is still unthinkable .
Meanwhile , Gora ’s Atheist Centre silently continues to promote of atheism , humanism and social change .

First amendment speech and press rights may also be subordinated to the overriding need to wage war successfully .

Remember learning about the Constitution and the basic principles of American democracy in grade school ?
Well , imagine throwing all of that into a wastebasket .
That 's what the Bush Administration did in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
According to an October 23 , 2001 memo from the Department of Justice 's Office of Legal Counsel , freedom of speech is merely a guideline , a concept that can be suspended at the will of the President .
Not being patriotic enough by giving your full - throated support to the President 's glorious imperialist aims ?
Then kiss your right to speak in opposition of his policies goodbye .
Fail to report the latest Presidential talking points as anything other than the gospel truth ?
Congratulations , your newspaper or media outlet has just had its credentials revoked and is no longer allowed to publish .
Post facts on your blog that contradict the falsehoods and rhetorical illusions created by the Administration , and you might just find yourself in prison being held incommunicado as an enemy combatant .
And as we 've seen over the past several years , especially with the " Mission Accomplished " fiasco , the term " waging war successfully " can be defined any way those in power see fit .
This is n't Stalin 's Soviet Union , Tiananmen Square in 1989 , the military junta of Burma , the Third Reich , or Mussolini 's Italy .
This is n't George Orwell 's 1984 .
This is the United States of America .
But you would n't know it by the creative liberties taken with our laws and the principles of democracy by the Bush Administration .
And it 's memos like this that remind us why a thorough investigation of possible abuses of power and broken laws by the Bush Adminstration must be undertaken .
Otherwise , if we turn a blind eye to flagrant disregard for the rule of law , what good is the law ?
VANCOUVER - Robert Dziekanski was lying dead on the floor of Vancouver 's airport , his entire face blue , 90 seconds after RCMP officers who shocked him with a Taser say he was alive and breathing , a paramedic told a public inquiry Thursday .
Allan Maciak and his partner arrived more than 10 minutes after four RCMP officers confronted Dziekanski in the early morning of Oct. 14 , 2007 , and stunned him multiple times with a Taser .
" What was your impression about his state of being ? " asked Art Vertlieb , a lawyer for the inquiry .
" Mr. Dziekanski was dead , " replied Maciak .
Maciak and his partner , with the help of firefighters and two additional paramedics who arrived later , performed CPR on Dziekanski for nearly half an hour before officially declaring him dead .
Maciak 's testimony raised more questions about how the officers cared for Dziekanski after he fell to the ground and lost consciousness .
Four Mounties confronted Dziekanski in the airport 's international arrivals area , where an agitated Dziekanski had been throwing furniture .
They stunned him multiple times after he picked up a stapler .
The supervising RCMP officer , Cpl. Benjamin Monty Robinson , has insisted he monitored Dziekanski's condition after he was shocked and handcuffed .
Robinson told the inquiry that when he turned Dziekanski over to firefighters , about a minute and a half before paramedics arrived , he was breathing and had a pulse .
But firefighters earlier told the inquiry Dziekanski was n't breathing and they could detect no heartbeat when they reached the scene before the paramedics .
Maciak said when he arrived to take over from firefighters , Dziekanski had a condition known as cyanosis , a serious circulation problem that turns the skin blue and progresses from the extremities into the face and body .
" His lips were blue , his tongue was at the front of his mouth , it was blue , incontinent with urine , unresponsive , " said Maciak .
Maciak and other paramedics told the inquiry it would be difficult to tell how long it would take for cyanosis to set in or for a patient to go into cardiac arrest , with estimates ranging between two and 10 minutes .
Robinson testified earlier this week he noticed Dziekanski's ear was blue and assumed it was bruising from his fall to the floor .
Maciak acknowledged bruising could cause discolouration , but he said it is often the first sign of cyanosis .
He would n't speculate about how long Dziekanski had been dead but later suggested to police that he must have had cyanosis for a length of time .
" As soon as you rolled him over you could tell , it was pretty obvious he was lifeless , " Maciak said in a statement in January 2008 .
" He had been down for a little while , and this is n't something that just happened . "
Robinson also told the inquiry Dziekanski was snoring , which Maciak said could have been a sign of airway problems .
The corporal testified that after noticing the snoring , he moved Dziekanski onto his side .
However , firefighters and Maciak have said Dziekanski was lying flat on his stomach when they arrived .
The paramedics were critical of what firefighters were doing when they arrived .
Maciak 's partner , Mike Egli , said when he arrived , the firefighters did n't appear to be doing anything to help Dziekanski aside from checking his pulse .
He said the firefighters should have noticed the cyanosis and started giving oxygen immediately .
" I yelled at the fireman to , ' Get the damn oxygen on him now , " ' said Egli .
Egli said he complained to his supervisors the next day about the firefighters ' conduct .
" I was mad , I was very upset , " he said .
" There was no life - saving interventions that were being done at the time . "
The paramedics had asked twice for Dziekanski's handcuffs to be removed , and the firefighters said they asked once , as well .
One of the officers reluctantly complied , but only after warning that the man could become violent if he regained consciousness .
Meanwhile , Maciak said he was given incorrect information about how many times Dziekanski was stunned with the Taser .
The Taser 's internal computer indicates it was deployed five times , but Maciak said he was told by the officer who fired the Taser it was only cycled three times .
That officer , Const .
Kwesi Millington , has testified that he could n't remember giving any information to paramedics .
Syria 's President Bashar al - Assad is being actively courted by the new US administration , the EU as well as fellow Arab leaders making ­Damascus the Middle Eastern ­city to visit .
In a rare and ­exclusive ­interview he talks to the ­Guardian 's Middle East editor , Ian Black , in the Syrian capital
Bashar al - Assad , the ­Syrian president , sits back on a smart leather sofa in his honey - coloured hilltop palace , and gestures expansively - his fists visibly unclenched - as he explains his country 's indispensable role in the Middle East in the hopeful era of Barack Obama .
Assad is a busy man .
Hours before the Guardian called , he had seen a senior EU commissioner and the secretary general of the Arab League .
Later this week his visitors will be Senator John Kerry , the chairman of the Senate foreign ­relations committee and Howard Berman , a senior Congressman – reflecting the intensifying relationship between old adversaries who seem anxious to make a fresh start .
In recent months Damascus has become the Middle Eastern capital to visit : Nicolas Sarkozy , with ­characteristic panache , blazed the way for France and Europe ; David Miliband and other EU foreign ministers followed .
Turkey is also playing a key role .
As the world waits for the Obama administration 's first practical steps , expectations of change are high , though tempered by the Gaza war and the result of the Israeli general election , likely to result in a rightwing government under the Likud 's Binyamin Netanyahu .
Assad volunteers he never had high hopes of change in Israel – and certainly not of Netanyahu , who has pledged never to return the Golan Heights to Syria - but puts his faith in a new ­American role .
" We have the impression that this administration will be different , " he says " and we have seen the signals .
But we have to wait for the reality and the results . "
He hopes " in principle " to meet Obama , " but it depends on what we discuss .
I will be very happy to ­discuss peace . "
He worries though , about the impact of " other lobbies and other players " .
Relaxed and thoughtful in a dark ­business suit , Assad seems keen to send out positive messages and to underline his view , inherited from his father Hafez , that Syria is indispensable .
" If you want comprehensive peace in the Middle East you can't achieve it without Syria , " he says .
" We are a player in the region .
If you want to talk about peace you cannot advance without us . "
Assad 's relief that the Bush era is over is palpable .
Though never part of the former US president 's " axis of evil " , Syria has been out in the cold since 2003 : its opposition to the war in Iraq , accusations that it let foreign fighters cross its border , its presence in Lebanon and support for groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas made it the bad boy of the region as far as Washington and its allies were concerned .
American ­sanctions under the Syria accountability act remain in force .
" Bush failed in everything , " says the president .
" They [ the Bush administ­ration ] worked hard to achieve regime change .
But it did n't work .
It did n't work because I am not an American puppet and have good relations with my people . "
But Assad sees America 's role as ­crucial if progress is to be made in the quest for peace in the region .
­Washington must be the " main arbiter " , he says , but the time has come for an approach based on the principle of land for peace , enunciated in UN resolutions dating back decades and embodied in the 1991 Madrid peace conference , the only forum at which Israel faced all its Arab enemies .
" Madrid is still viable , " suggests Assad .
" It is a good model . "
The Arab Peace Initiative , first unveiled in 2002 and re-endorsed in 2007 , is not quite dead – as he ­pronounced dramatically at the height of the Gaza bloodshed last month , but rather " in a coma " .
Whatever the ­precise medical analogy , he agrees with a smile , it was Israel that rejected this ­unprecedented collective Arab offer of peace in return for a withdrawal to the 1967 borders .
Signs are that after the disarray of the Gaza crisis , with the western - backed Arab camp of Egypt and Saudi Arabia confronting Syria , Qatar and non-Arab Iran – there is a fresh urgency to inter-Arab coordination and reconciliation .
Apart from the Arab League 's Amr Musa , another important visitor to Damascus this week was Prince Muqrin , the Saudi intelligence chief – a move seen as the harbinger of a real thaw between Damascus and Riyadh .
Next month 's Arab summit in the Qatar 's capital Doha could be the ­opportunity for a collective Arab response to recent events : a key issue , says Assad , is to restore Palestinian unity after the debilitating split between the PLO in the West Bank and the Islamists of Hamas in the Gaza Strip .
Hamas is a sensitive issue in Syria .
Its exiled leader , Khaled Meshal - once the target of a Mossad hit team - is based in Damascus and enjoys the protection of the authorities .
But Assad is quick to defend its right of resistance to Israel – widely supported by ordinary citizens - and to minimise his own influence over the Palestinian movement .
Intriguingly , he says , in one of ­several thoughtful asides : " You can't only deal with good people .
If they can spoil things or put obstacles in your way you have to deal with them .
And I do n't mean Syria and Iran .
This is a principle .
It applies anywhere in the world .
Forget about labels and rhetoric . "
In the light of comments such as these , suggestions he may downgrade his relationship with Hamas or Hezbollah seem wide of the mark .
But western diplomats say if Assad wants to see real change with the US he will face pressure not to allow Hezbollah to be supplied , via Syria , with longer - range rockets or anti-aircraft weapons that could change the strategic equation in Lebanon .
Overall , his view is that violence is a symptom , not the cause of the Middle East 's problems .
Nor is Syria 's strategic relationship with Iran , its ally since the 1979 ­revolution , up for grabs .
Dialogue with Tehran should begin at once , he says , and westerners should not " waste their time " on imagining that June 's ­presidential election will change ­anything fundamental .
Assad is blunt in rejecting criticism of Syria 's domestic freedom and of the imprisonment of dissidents such as Michel Kilo and Riyad Seif .
" Our laws are tough and strict and whether they are right or wrong that is an issue for Syria , " he says .
" We do n't allow anyone to make or internal issues a matter for relations .
Europeans and Americans supported the occupation of Iraq .
Talking about values has no credibility any more .
And after what happened in Gaza they have no right ( to criticize us ) at all . "

A shooting rampage that began in a high school in southwestern Germany on Wednesday has left the teenage gunman and at least 15 others dead , authorities said .
Police said a 17 - year - old former student dressed in black entered Albertville technical high school in Winnenden , northeast of Stuttgart , and began shooting at random , killing nine students and three teachers .
After fleeing the school , the gunman ran into the downtown area where he shot two pedestrians , killing one and wounding the other .
He then hijacked a car and forced the driver to take him to Wendlingen , about 40 kilometres away , where the driver swerved off the road and escaped .
The teenager , with police in pursuit , ran in to an automobile dealership , where he shot and killed a salesman and a customer .
He then emerged from the building and opened fire on police .
Officers returned fire and the teen fell to the ground wounded , but he then got back up , reloaded his weapon and ran down a dead - end street .
Police said they found him there dead from an apparently self - inflicted gunshot wound to the head .
Two police officers suffered serious injuries described as not life - threatening .
8 girls , 1 boy killed
Albertville technical high school has about 1,000 students .
The gunman graduated last year , officials said .
Frank Nipkau , editor in chief of local newspaper Winnender Zeitung , told CBC News that the gunman reportedly opened fire in two classrooms .
Students were jumping from windows and running from the school while the gunman was firing , witnesses said .
" I heard two shots and then screaming , " said a 15 - year - old student who gave her name only as Betty .
" At first I thought it was a joke , but then someone called ' run , run ! ' and I saw students jumping out of the windows and took off running . "
The students killed in the attack — eight girls and one boy — are believed to have been in Grades 9 and 10 .
" He went into the school with a weapon and carried out a bloodbath , " regional police Chief Erwin Hetger said .
" I 've never seen anything like this in my life . "
Police identified the weapon used in the shootings as a Beretta 9 mm pistol .
Large parts of the town were sealed off as police conducted a search for the gunman , who was initially believed to have run toward the centre of the community of 28,000 , witnesses said .
All schools and daycares in the region were put under lockdown during the manhunt .
Police , rescue workers and firefighters remained at Albertville high school .
Community devastated
Local freelance reporter Simon Young told CBC News that a chaotic scene emerged outside the school as relatives of staff and students arrived looking for their family members .
The school was eventually evacuated , police said .
Police searched the suspect 's parents ' home Wednesday .
They said his father , who belongs to a local gun club , had 15 legally owned firearms that were generally locked up .
However , a pistol that he kept in the bedroom was missing .
The small industrial community has been devastated by the killings , Nipkau said .
" Everyone is desperate about this incident and at this point there is no hint why this has happened , " he said .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the shooting " a horrific crime . "
" It is hard to put into words what happened today , but our sadness and sympathy goes out to the victims ' families , " Merkel said .
The European Parliament , meeting in Strasbourg , France , stood in silence for a minute to honour the victims .
Previous school shootings in Germany include :

Une compilation des meilleurs scènes de No au cinéma .
cinema compilation cri film movie no non scene
A very old tree frog image - it 's still linked from various places so I keep it alive - my work has changed a bit since then .
I read all my email and try , within the limits imposed by work , other consults , and family , to respond to the many good questions sent my way .
The most common question sent to me this week has been about possible canonical responses to Notre Dame 's unbelievable honoring of a major pro-abortion politician , namely , President Obama .
This matter is not simple and my analysis of it would not lend itself to blog - style discussion anyway .
But , for the benefit of readers who have asked , I can at least take two options off the table .
Briefly :
1 . The local bishop cannot put Notre Dame under a local interdict , even for a brief period , if for no other reason ( and there would be other reasons ) than that local interdict is not a penal option under the 1983 Code .
While local interdict ( and community interdict , its cousin ) were possible under the Pio-Benedictine Code ( see 1917 CIC 2268 -2277 ) , today , interdict is a purely personal penalty , meaning that only specific individuals , convicted of a canonical crime , can be interdicted (
1983 CIC 1332
) .
2 . The local bishop cannot forbid the celebration of Mass in campus oratories and chapels by a precept under
1983 CIC 1225
.
While the argument here rests more on scholarly opinion than does that above , I think the weight of that opinion would not support a bishop 's using a precept to forbid Mass on campus during graduation weekend .
Mind , nothing in Bp. D'Arcy 's statement today suggested that he was considering either option , but my advice to folks who have been considering suggesting them would be to save your time : neither action would be supportable under 1983 Code .

Your guide to forest bathing
The practice of forest bathing has been proven to be good for your mind , body and soul – but what is it exactly , and how do you do it ?
In the early hours of a July day in 1918 , one of history 's most infamous murders was perpetrated on parents , their five children and their loyal servants in a cellar in the city of Yekaterinburg , central Russia .
The gunshot - and - bayonet murder of the Romanovs – the family of the last Tsar and Tsarina of Russia – spawned countless conspiracy theories , including the belief that at least one child had survived to escape abroad .
Since that fatal dawn , about 200 people have claimed to descend from one or other of the Romanovs who had somehow survived the slaughter in the basement of Ipatiev House .
But now a scientific study based on meticulous DNA evidence has finally provided irrefutable evidence to show that all five children had indeed perished with their parents at the hands of nervous Bolsheviks of the Ural Soviet , worried about a possible rescue bid by nearby White Russian troops .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Scientists have pieced together DNA evidence from two graves near Yekaterinburg and have conclusively shown that Tsar Nicholas II and his wife , the Tsarina Alexandra , died with all five of their children , Olga , Tatiana , Maria , Anastasia and their haemophiliac son , the crown prince , Alexei .
The only remaining mystery is whether the girl buried alongside Alexei in a separate grave from the rest of the family was Maria or Anastasia , says a study printed in the online journal Public Library of Science .
The story should have come to a close soon after a mass grave near Yekaterinburg ( formerly Sverdlovsk ) was revealed in 1991 by a local geologist , Alexander Avdonin , who had kept the discovery secret for more than a decade , until the fall of the Soviet Union .
Scientists , including Peter Gill from Britain's Forensic Science Service and the Russian geneticist Pavel Ivanov , managed to extract enough DNA from the bone fragments of nine skeletons to show that they included a family of two parents and three daughters .
A comparison with the DNA of living Romanov relatives , including Prince Philip , proved that the family was that of the last Tsar and Tsarina , with the four remaining skeletons belonging to the family doctor and three servants .
But the two missing children only generated further conspiracy theories , according to a report on the study written by an international team of scientists , led by Michael Coble of the US Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory in Rockville , Maryland .
" Rather than bring closure to the mystery of the fate of the Romanovs , identification of only five of the seven family members continued to fuel speculation that somehow two miraculously escaped the bullets of the executioners and made their way out of Russia , " Dr Coble said .
But then , in 2007 , amateur archaeologists found a second grave just 70 metres away , containing dozens of charred human bone fragments that someone had tried to cremate .
" Of the 44 bone fragments and teeth present , it was possible to determine that at least two individuals were present , one female and one putative male , " the report added .
The mystery is solved .
DNA : The detective in the grave
The Romanov study used three different ways of analysing DNA to determine family relationships within the graves – and the relationship , if any , to living relatives of the Russian royal family .
Mitochondrial DNA , inherited only down the maternal line , was used to assess the relationship of Prince Philip , who is related to the Tsarina through his mother , with bone fragments found in the grave .
This helped to determine that the Tsarina and her four daughters were indeed buried in the two graves .
DNA known to be inherited only from fathers by sons on the male Y chromosome was used to determine the relationship between the crown prince , Alexei , and his father , Tsar Nicholas II .
And finally , DNA from the rest of the chromosomes was used to find out who was who in the mass graves – separating family members from three servants and a doctor .
Ah I see it all began with prayer being taken out of schools , that horror of horrors .
Considering your supposedly free country was founded by deists ( not Christians ) who specifically wrote the constitution to guarantee that government should be totally separate from religion it seems detestable that there ever WAS prayer in schools .
Public schools are run largely by and financed fully by the state , hence having prayer in schools is unconstitutional .
The founding fathers of the United States wrote as they did to provide people not only with freedom of religion but freedom FROM religion , so forcing it upon children is hardly coherent with their views .
Claiming , as I 'm sure you do , that America is a built on Christianity is laughable .
Prayer in schools is an illegal affront on freedom from religion and should be lampooned by all rational Americans ( and non-Americans for that matter ) .
It represents indoctrination of children by showing them , in an environment they are forced to be part of , " Christianity is the truth . "
By all means let parents indoctrinate their children at home and in church , we have no moral pedastel to stand on and say what people should and should n't teach their children ; however there is no way that prayer in schools is compatible with modern morality or the United States constitution .
" I do not find in orthodox Christianity one redeeming feature . "
I doubt you 'll recognize this quote , but you should recognize the author .
His name is Thomas Jefferson .
You know , wrote the Declaration of Independence and was the 3rd president .
I further note that the socialist countries of Europe , particularly the Nordics , have higher life expectancies , higher quality of life indices and a great deal more wage equality than the pure capitalist US .
Maybe a healthy dose of socialism is exactly what you need .
I applaud your attempt to wake the sheeple from their stupor ; however your justifications are flawed .
11:48 AM
A question about the approval process , Phil is handling .
" 96 % are approved , but there are things we have to watch out for .
There have been issues , issues about content that 's available to children for instance .
But at the end of the day , we have a great solution that 's working , and we 're constantly making it better .
We 're tracking these numbers , and speaking with developers , and we are constantly doing that . "
" I want to thank you all for joining us today . "
11:45 AM Q : Could you serve audio files over Bluetooth , could you move them onto a device ?
This question essentially has stumped the crew .
They do n't know how to answer !
Scott : " I think probably not -- you could n't move the file . "
A bit of a confusing one .

11:20 AM
You can scroll to the Spotlight homescreen .
It lives in your pages of apps as its own page .
It works as you 'd expect , a keyboard is present and allows you pop up anything you 're looking for in a list below a search box .
11:19 AM Demo time !
11:18 AM " But we did n't stop there .
We thought , would n't it be nice if there was a single location you go to search all of these .
That 's what we did .
We created a new home screen to do this .
We call it Spotlight . "
11:18 AM " Search in Calendar : you can search for appointments .
Also , search in iPod , song name , album , artist ... and , search in Notes , by the title or body . "

Applause .
Applause for a feature that every other device in the world has .
Odd .
11:09 AM " But this works for 3rd party apps as well .
Here 's wikimobile . "
We 're going to go ahead and say that copy / paste probably works the same here .
Yes -- it does .
11:08 AM Just loaded up SMS -- took ages to load .
Same process as Safari to grab SMS text .
11:08 AM
It also copies HTML .
Shake to undo .
Clever .
11:07 AM Long press to select blocks of text in Safari .
Using the same engine that zooms in on blocks of text to intelligently know what to select .
11:07 AM
Now he 's showing off copy / paste across apps -- same selection bubble and process in Notes .
He jumped into mail and pasted .
So ... just exactly like copy and paste on everything .
Zany .
11:06 AM
To select a whole block , you double tap , slide with your finger or thumb ( you get a new magnifying glass ) , and pull across what you want to grab .
11:05 AM Double tap on text , and it automatically selects it -- then puts grab points at the end of the selection , with a cut / copy / paste bubble above it .
11:05 AM Ha , an email with flight info for Oceanic 815 .
11:04 AM " We 've been working really hard to design an easy to use interface for this on our touchscreen display .
Let me demo it for you right now . "
11:04 AM " Now as I said before , 3.0 brings a lot of new features for devs , but for customers as well ... starting ... with cut , copy , and paste . "
Big cheers .
11:03 AM Scott : " How can I go on after that .
Wow .
That duet was played using our new API .
You know , when we created the SDK , it was to make devs really successful .
That 's why we work our asses off every day . "
11:02 AM Huge applause for that !
Huge !
11:02 AM Dr. Wang and assistant are about to perform " a little ditty " for us .
" This is Phantom of the Opera on Leaf Trombone . "
It is .
It is !
Everyone is giggling .
This is pretty amazing , just because it 's so intensely bizarre .
11:01 AM " We 're excited about the new iPhone SDK . "
He 's showing off an app called Leaf Trombone World Stage .
Seriously .
It 's a multiplayer music app .
10:59 AM Dr. Wang is intense .
10:58 AM Scott : " Next , is Smule .
The creators of Ocarina .
Here 's Dr. Ge Wang . "

Pretty sweet .
The crowd here seemed to like it .
Good thing they landed a frag at the end there .
10:57AM
This is pretty impressive , a fairly smooth FPS with in game chat .
Graphics are n't too shabby , if a bit basic .
The controls do n't look super easy ...
10:56 AM " Okay , now let me show off something completely different .
LiveFire .
I 'm going to launch into a global game server . "
Wow , this looks pretty sweet .
10:55 AM
He just showed off in - game purchases .
Very similar to The Sims .
10:54 AM " I just received a push notification to a Touch Pet dogs playdate . "
This is cute .
Virtual dogs are running around onscreen .
A few people are cracking up in here .
10:53 AM " We 're going to show you two games today we 're working on .
The first is Touch Pets , and our multiplayer first person shooter , LiveFire . "
10:52 AM Neil Young ... not THE Neil Young .
" Hello .
The iPhone is a wonderful device .
It 's always on , always with you , and always connected to a network .
It can enable new types of social play and new gaming experiences . "
10:51 AM Scot : " So imagine the possibilities .
We think this is profound .
Next , ngmoco -- a startup that develops games exclusively for the iPod touch and iPhone .
Here 's a sneak peak of some new games they 're working on . "
10:50 AM
They 're really showing off a lot of detail on this app .
It 's fairly in - depth , and seems to pull in a handful of the new APIs .
Still , not what most people came here for today .
10:48 AM
This is interesting .
The app works out dieting and keeps track of glucose levels .
We could definitely see this coming in handy for those with diabetes .
10:47 AM
A cool idea , but we'd like to see just a small dock connector that functions as the finger pricking device .
Are we asking too much ?
10:46 AM
They 're showing off glucose testing ( finger pricking ) .
" Given the new SDK , the meter can transmit that data over Bluetooth or the dock connector . "
10:45 AM
Now they 've brought up Anita Mathew from Lifescan ( a Johnson and Johnson company ) .
Please show the iPhone heart surgery app / hardware combo .
No ... just diabetes testing .
This could be cool .
10:44 AM Scott : " We had to spend the last six months retooling our push notification for companies just like ESPN . "
Big laughs .
10:44 AM Oke Okaro is off ... the ESPN app looks pretty slick .
10:42 AM
Ooh , they 're showing off streaming video right now .
Looks pretty damn nice .
" We 're using the new media player that automatically adjusts quality for the bandwidth you have . "
10:41 AM ESPN just made a sports joke we did n't get .
We hope we do n't get kicked out of our fantasy football league .
10:40 AM Scott : " JD Power ranked the iPhone number one for business users .
Next up , ESPN . "
10:39 AM
And there goes Oracle .
10:38 AM
So let 's just take stock of the rumors right now .
No backgrounding , no multitasking , no unobtrusive notifications .
No copy and paste ( yet ) , no MMS , no video .
Really pretty minor stuff thus far .
10:37 AM " Next up , Oracle . "
Next up , we take a nap .
10:36 AM " Thanks . "
Applause , and Scott is back .
Man they 're moving a real speedy pace .
So far , nothing really surprising at all .
10:36 AM
They 're showing off a character buying some things in - game .
Now they 're showing media access .
They 're playing music off of the device in the game .
Kind of cool .
10:34AM
This looks pretty good .
EA has been hard at work !
10:34 AM Travis Boatman from EA .
" Hey everybody .
We announced Spore a year ago at the original SDK launch .
The game we 're showing off today is The Sims . "
10:33 AM Scott 's back : " As you can see , that 's a perfect candidate for iPhone OS 3.0 . "
" Next , EA . "
10:31AM
We have a sneaking suspicion we 're going to see some serious demo'ing of the push notification service .
They 're jumping into a chat .
Ha !
Totally making typing mistakes .
Classic iPhone errors .
Sire instead of sure .
The crowd chuckled .
10:30 AM " For the first time , Meebo will have a native iPhone app .
Our goal is to let user 's communicate with friends regardless of what network they 're on . "
10:30 AM " Let 's start with Meebo . "
We 're going to see a demo of the OS 3.0 native version of the app .
Seth Sternberg , Meebo CEO is up .
10:29 AM " This is a big update for the iPhone SDK .
Now , a couple of weeks ago , we called a few devs to see what they could do in two weeks ... "
Ah , this old gag !
Should be interesting .
10:28 AM " We 're introducing a new API for streaming video and audio .
And we 're adding an API for in - game voice . "
10:28 AM " So , push .
Preserves battery life , maintains performance , optimized for mobile networks . "
Well , there goes background apps .
So much for those predictions , but not surprising at all .
Apple was n't about to upend their whole architecture .
10:27 AM
Wait , we 've seen this graphic before !
He 's running through the basic push architecture .
Very similar to what we 've seen .
Let 's hope it actually happens now .
10:26 AM " Here 's how it works .
Let 's say you have an IM app .
While it 's running it 's connected to your server .
But , when you quit the app , you no longer have this connection open .
That 's where our push service comes into play . "
Yeah ... this sounds so familiar .
10:25 AM " We took a 3rd party Push notification system -- battery life only dropped 20 % in the background . "
10:25 AM " We were asked , why do n't you do background processing ?
It 's bad for the customer .
It drains battery .
We 've been testing this , and running some background processes on some phones .
We took a popular AIM client , and we just let go in the background -- then we measured the standby time .
And it dropped by 80 % or more . "
10:24 AM " We expected to have this last year , and we did n't .
There 's a few reasons for this .
Within months of launching the App Store , we had 1000 's of apps .
And lots of devs came to us and talked about using Push in ways that we had n't even considered .
So we had to re-architect the server structure . "
" Now , we 're good to good . "
10:23 AM " Next , Push .
You know , we 're late on this one . "
Wow .
10:23 AM " Now there is one catch -- bring your own maps .
Due to licensing , we can't use those tiles in maps . "
So turn by turn is coming .
10:22 AM " Now there is one more thing we 're doing with maps .
We 're enabling developers to use core location for turn by turn directions . "
Again , finally !
10:21 AM " So , Google Maps can be embedded directly into your application . "
10:21 AM Finally !
10:21 AM " Next ... maps .
We 've worked with Google to build an incredible app for the iPhone .
But devs have said they 'd like to use Maps in their apps .
They keep asking us to build something natural , that can wrap our maps into their applications .
We 're making the heart of the Maps application an API which devs can embed into their applications . "
10:19 AM " They talk over the dock , and wirelessly over Bluetooth .
Things like playing and pausing music , getting artwork -- or you can build your own custom protocols . "
10:19 AM " Now here 's a class that we think will be really interesting -- medical devices . "
Scott 's showing off a blood pressure reader that interfaces with the iPhone -- wild .
10:18 AM " Here 's an example -- an FM transmitter .
With 3.0 , the dev can build a custom app that pairs up with it , and automatically finds the right station and tunes it in . "
10:18 AM " With 3.0 , we 're going to enable accessory developers to build custom apps that talk directly to that hardware . "
10:17 AM " Next : accessories .
There are thousands of accessories that work great with iPods and iPhones .
Here 's a popular one , a speaker . "
10:17AM
He 's describing a scenario where you can share a contact in this manner .
10:16 AM " We use Bonjour as the tech , and this is n't just for games .
We think it 's great for games , but this works for any peer to peer app . "
10:16 AM " With the new APIs , you can bring up a standard system panel which finds other touches or iPhones which are in the same app .
You form an IP connection , and you can game together .
This will automatically discover running apps , wirelessly over Blutetooth . "
10:15 AM " Next , support for peer to peer connectivity .
This is great for games . "
10:15 AM " Free apps remain free -- you wo n't be asked to buy something in that app . "
10:14 AM " This is for paid apps only . "
10:14 AM " The model for in - app sales is the same as the rest of the App Store , 70 % goes to developers . "
10:13 AM " This whole thing is tied directly into the iTunes store .
When you tap buy , it brings up a standard iTunes authentication panel . "
10:13 AM " City Guide , you can sell the app , then sell new cities from within the application . "
10:13 AM Showing off a dialog -- a prompt to purchase an update to mag from within an app .
Now a game .
" You can purchase a game with 10 levels , then you can tap to update with another 10 levels within the game . "
Yes , with a nice , intrusive pop up !
10:12 AM " But some devs have come to us and talked about other models they 'd like to use .
Like subscriptions .
A place where you could renew that sub in the app .
Some game devs have wanted to be able to sell new levels from within an app .
There are many examples of that , like e-books .
Like a bookstore built into an app .
We supporting these new models in what we call In - App Purchase . "
10:11 AM " Starting with enhancements to the App Store .
As you heard , over 800 m downloads .
It 's the best way ever for devs to get their software out .
It 's also a great business deal .
They can give apps away , or they can sell them .
70 % of that revenue goes to the devs .
And we cover all the fees , and devs are paid monthly . "
10:10 AM 1000 new APIs .
10:09 AM " Let me tell you what we 're doing for developers .
Our goal was to make devs successful , we gave them the best tools ever .
It blew us away what they did .
We 've spent the last year working hard to make the SDK even better . "
10:08 AM " I 'm here to tell you about iPhone OS 3.0 .
This is a major update to the OS .
It comes with incredible features for devs and customers . "
10:08 AM " This is something we have n't seen before , and this is just the beginning .
We 're only 8 months into this .
I 'd like to bring up Scott Forstall for a preview of OS 3.0 "
10:07 AM
That 's a high percentage , but you have to wonder ( and we know some ) what they 've passed on .
Plenty of good stuff .
10:07 AM Applause for the video .
" So clearly the App Store appeals to big and small devs .
We 've had an explosion of apps .
Over 25,000 . "
" We 've had a lot of curiosity over the submission process ... 96 % of apps that have been submitted were approved . "
10:05 AM Apple is trying to show off how easy it is to get into app development on the platform .
And ... well , it is .
10:05 AM Steve Demeter , creator of Trism .
A little video on him .
10:04AM
He 's propping Gameloft right now -- they love the App Store .
Go figure !
" They 've had over 2 m paid downloads for Gameloft . "
10:04 AM " This has been great for devs .
In one year 's time we 've had over 800,000 downloads of the free SDK .
We 've had over 50,000 companies and individuals join our dev program .
And most of them , over 60 % , have never developed for any Apple platform before . "
10:03 AM " We 've sold 17 m altogether , you can see how people have accepted the 3G .
But the touch also runs the same OS , and if you look at the time period , we 've sold over 30 m units of iPhones and iPod touch . "
10:02 AM " Before we shipped our first phone , we set an aggressive goal -- we said we 'd sell 10 million phones .
And we sold 13.7 m .
We blew it away . "
10:02 AM " We 're gonna show you some of future plans .
Before that , let me remind you of where we 're at with the iPhone .
We 're now in over 80 countries . "
Applause .
10:01 AM " Good morning everyone , welcome to the campus . "
Greg Joswiak !
10:00 AM
And the lights are dimming ...
9:59 AM
They started playing the " every day you wake up " ad song ... but then quickly killed it in favor of Dave Matthews .
Odd .
Very odd .
9:55 AM " Our presentation will begin shortly , please silence cellphones and pagers . "
Pagers !?
Pagers !?
9:54 AM
There 's definitely a feeling that this event is much quieter , more subdued .
Everyone seems to be expecting the same thing -- and that 's not surprising .
9:52 AM Sweet -- Radiohead. 15 step !
Things are getting herky jerky in here !
9:44 AM
Okay folks -- we 're in our seats at long , long , long last .
There 's a little Coldplay playing in the background ( of course ) , and everyone else is just getting settled .
Expect some excitement in a matter of moments .
9:30 AM
We 're currently at the doors , and we probably do n't have to tell you that people are champing at the bit to get inside .
We 'll be knocking down old ladies and tripping unsuspecting humans soon enough , so stay tuned !
9:15 AM
We 're on the ground in Cupertino , waiting outside for the big show to start .
Hang tight , we 'll be heading to our seats momentarily !
Stewart to Cheney : Drink a cup of ' Shut the f**k up ' David Edwards and Rachel Oswald
Published : Thursday March 19 , 2009
Print This Email This Still overcome with incredulity over former Vice President Dick Cheneys interview on Sunday with CNN , The Daily Shows Jon Stewart couldnt resist Tuesday night taking a couple of shots at some of the eye - brow raising statements made .
In his interview with CNNs John King , Cheney said of President Obamas national security policies ,  Hes making some choices that in my mind , will in fact , raise the risk to the American people of another attack . 
Noting that Cheney no longer can truly know what he is talking about as he no longer receives daily intelligence briefings , Stewart indignantly said ,  Maybe I could interest you in a hot cup of shut the f**k up . 
 The guys vice president for eight years , you barely see a whiff of him .
He lives in some subterranean lair , literally has his house removed from Google Earth ,  Stewart said .
 Then when hes no longer accountable to the American people hes popping up everywhere .
I cant get him off my TV .
Hes like the Mario Lopez of doom now . 
Stewart also objected to Cheneys attempts in the interview to cast aside criticism of the enormous deficits the Bush administration left after coming into office eight years earlier with a comfortable surplus .
 I dont think you can blame the Bush administration for the creation of those [ poor economic ] circumstances ,  Cheney said , later adding  Eight months after we arrived , we had 9/11
We ended up with two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq things like Katrina , all of these things required us to spend money that we had not originally planned to spend or werent originally part of the budget .
Stuff happens . 
To which an outraged Stewart returned with  Stuff happens !
No , no , I left a Chapstick in my pants and it went through the wash .
That s stuff happens
Two wars , a mismanaged economy and a botched national disaster rescue effort .
Can a brother get a my bad .
Stewart is not alone in reacting with derision to the Cheney interview .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs on Monday said ,  I think not taking economic advice from Dick Cheney would be maybe the best possible outcome of yesterdays interview . 

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
If you have a stash of pistachios in your house , pistachio ice cream in your freezer or trail mix in your backpack , do n't eat any of it .
The FDA says it and the California Department of Public Health are taking " a proactive approach . "
Wait until an inquiry into possible salmonella contamination is further along , advises FDA Associate Commissioner David Acheson .
Kraft Foods Inc. notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last Tuesday that it found salmonella in roasted pistachios during routine testing .
The nuts were traced to Setton Farms in Terra Bella , California , about 75 miles south of Fresno .
Setton announced a recall , Kraft removed its Back To Nature Trail Mix from store shelves , and Kroger -- a grocery chain with stores in 31 states -- recalled Private Selection shelled pistachios from its retail stores .
See the FDA 's complete recall list
" Ultimately , the question is what should consumers do , and our advice to consumers is that they avoid eating pistachio products and keep checking the FDA Web site for the latest information , " Acheson said .
Watch why it 's important not to eat the nuts »
An investigation is under way into how the pistachios came to carry the bacteria .
Salmonella can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children , frail or elderly people , and others with weakened immune systems .
Acheson stressed at a news conference Monday that the potential problems with pistachios were unrelated to this year 's recall of peanut products , including peanut butter .
The pistachio investigation also involves the California Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , Georgia .
Setton Farms told the FDA that it anticipates recalling about 1 million pounds of products nationally in the next few days , which covers its crop output last year .
Several people have told the FDA that they suffered gastrointestinal illnesses after eating pistachios , and the CDC was doing a genetic analysis , looking for any link between the people and salmonella strains , Acheson said .
He said there could be some results by the end of the week .
He said the FDA is " ahead of the curve " in the current investigation .
" I want to emphasize that this recall was not triggered because of an outbreak , in contrast to some of the previous situations , for example , like the peanuts where people were getting sick and it was determined that peanuts , peanut butter was the likely cause , " Acheson said .
" This is a situation that the recall is being triggered because of ... action taken on the part of the food industry , " he added .
" What we 're doing here is getting out ahead of the curve .
It 's a proactive approach by the FDA and the California Department of Health . "
Jeff Cronin , spokesman for the advocacy organization Center for Science in the Public Interest , had a mixed reaction to Acheson 's comments .
" I think it 's partly the case , " Cronin said .
" It 's good that the FDA is proactively issuing advice to consumers . "
But " this still begets the question of ' how did this contamination happen in the first place ? '
Is this an isolated problem , or are we going to be hearing the same kind of horror stories that we heard about ... the company that produced the peanuts ? "
He said he wondered when was the last time the FDA visited Setton Farms and whether it had known of problems there .
In February , the Texas Department of State Health Services ordered the recall of all products shipped from the Peanut Corporation of America 's plant in Plainview , Texas , after discovering dead rodents , rodent excrement and bird feathers in the plant .
The company 's peanut butter and peanut paste products produced at its plant in Blakely , Georgia , were linked to a nationwide outbreak of salmonella poisoning that affected 600 people , nine of whom died .
According to state health officials and many experts , the deadly outbreak of salmonella was fueled by poor oversight by food safety regulators and a slow response by federal agencies .
The first problem is that almost nothing can stop companies from shipping contaminated food , William Hubbard , a former FDA associate commissioner , told a U.S. Senate committee in February .
He also said there are not enough federal inspections .
Other critics said the FDA stepped in too late in the peanut case to prevent a bigger problem .
Food safety experts say the underlying cause of the problem is that the century - old system of regulation is broken .
In the peanut case , the experts say , the federal government failed to oversee the safety of products coming out of the Blakely plant and was slow to identify it as the source of the salmonella .

Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairwoman Sheila
Bair said the fund it uses to protect customer deposits at U.S. banks could dry up amid a surge in bank failures , as she responded to an industry outcry against new fees approved by the agency .
“ Without these assessments , the deposit insurance fund could become insolvent this year , ” Bair wrote in a March 2 letter to the industry .
U.S. community banks plan to flood the FDIC with about 5,000 letters in protest of the fees , according to a trade group .
“ A large number ” of bank failures may occur through 2010 because of “ rapidly deteriorating economic conditions , ” Bair said in the letter .
“ Without substantial amounts of additional assessment revenue in the near future , current projections indicate that the fund balance will approach zero or even become negative . ”
The FDIC last week approved a one - time “ emergency ” fee and other assessment increases on the industry to rebuild a fund to repay customers for deposits of as much as $ 250,000 when a bank fails .
The fees , opposed by the industry , may generate $ 27 billion this year after the fund fell to $ 18.9 billion in the fourth quarter from $ 34.6 billion in the previous period , the FDIC said .
The fund , which lost $ 33.5 billion in 2008 , was drained by 25 bank failures last year .
Sixteen banks have failed so far this year , further straining the fund .
Smaller banks are outraged over the one - time fee , which could wipe out 50 percent to 100 percent of a bank ’s 2009 earnings , Camden Fine , president of the Independent Community Bankers of America , said Tuesday in a telephone interview .
No one could have anticipated that the Republican Twitter revolution would go so horribly awry :
Witness New York Republican Jim Tedisco ’s attempt to incorporate the Age of Twitter onto his website .
Tedisco , running for the vacant old seat of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand in New York ’s 20th District against Democrat Scott Murphy , has a nifty little feature on his website which incorporates all # NY20 messages from Twitter .
Seems that this includes all messages from , say , his opponent ’s campaign , or the DCCC , as well .
In this case , Jimmy T. highlighted a DCCC story on his website which references Tedisco ’s having burned $ 21,000 of taxpayer money on gas expenses in just seven short years … despite living 20 minutes from the state capital .

And this :
Peter Hoekstra of Michigan , the top- ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee , told reporters about the trip days before the group departed and then posted updates on the delegation ’s approximate location every few hours using the Twitter social networking service . […..]
A former Armed Services aide who is a Republican and a military veteran was more blunt .
“ By relaying that information and telegraphing what they were doing , he probably placed people in harm ’s way , ” said the aide , who requested anonymity because his company deals with Hoekstra ’s office .
“ It ’s just common sense . ”
And this :
Apparently Senator Ralph Northam had agreed with Minority Leader Tommy Norment to vote to give Republicans power sharing in the Virginia Senate today .
Before it was announced on the floor and finalized , RPV Chairman Jeff Frederick tweeted about it .
Majority Leader Dick Saslaw adjourned before it could happen .
The Democrats got into a room and pounded into Northam what would happen if he did this .
Northam backed down .
Here 's a crystal - clear video showing what happens when an airplane engine fan blade gets loose when you fire a chicken at 250 knots into a turbojet using a chicken gun .
Result : ( Contained ) Boom .
Update : Corrected .

Update : Sacha , a reader expert in the matter , has wrote to me saying this is not a simulation of a bird striking into a turbo fan , but a simulation of a blade coming loose , which may happen as a result of fatigue or a crack .
... is not a bird test , it 's what 's called a " blade out " test .
Explosive charges are placed on a blade to simulate a blade coming loose — this could happen as a result of fatigue , an unchecked , unseen crack in an engine blade .
What you 're seeing is essentially " diamond cutting diamond " — and that 's why they do the test .
Turbo fan blades are extremely strong , and at that speed , they 'll chain reaction and destroy each other .
You can't really prevent that .
But what we do n't want is a flying fan blade to hit the fuselage , enter the wing ( where fuel is kept ) , or otherwise leave the engine cowling in any way .
That 's what this test is for — you want to contain the explosion .
I can hear your confusion : " B - b - b - but , the engine did n't blow up ! " — that 's because it 's not supposed to .
We do testing for bird strikes , the engines are built to handle it .
They 're even designed to continue running , up until a certain size and number of bird ingestions , and beyond that , shut down safely .
But they 're * never * , ever fragile or brittle enough to be seriously damaged by a hollow - boned soft - bodied bird .

Probably what happened in the US Airways Airbus ' engines before its Hudsonlanding .
Actually , here a bird hits the engine in slow motion :
Allegedly , a lot of birds is what caused the US Airways flight to waterland on the Hudson .
Well yesterday was a rainy boring day , stuck in the house .
But I made the best out of it .
The second the rain let up , I went outside and took pictures of the ocean and rocks with the dark creepy sky in the background .
They turned out pretty cool .
Although I got freaked out at times .
Like when I was standing on the rocks and a huge wave comes crashing in .
The waves were really big , the tide was really high , the winds were strong and unforgiving , and the sky was black as night .
It was quite scary being out there all alone .

This article is from the March / April 2009 issue of Dollars & Sense .
The United States is in the midst of a national foreclosure crisis that threatens to wreak havoc not just on homeowners , but also tenants , urban neighborhoods , and entire cities .
Community organizers and legal activists are working hard to stop it .
Over 2 million properties went into foreclosure proceedings last year , a number that experts fear could jump to 10 million in the next few years .
Foreclosures are n’t just pushing owners into the street .
According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition , renters make up an estimated 40 % of families facing eviction because of foreclosure .
And because the shakiest loans are concentrated in inner cities , the impact of vacant buildings on already fragile neighborhoods can be devastating .

Lenders and lawmakers have been slow to respond to this growing crisis .
The Obama administration ’s mortgage rescue plan announced in February offers limited help to some individual homeowners at risk of foreclosure , but almost completely overlooks the plight of renters in foreclosed buildings .
Families facing eviction are left to fend for themselves , often with little understanding of their legal rights or other options .
But an array of community organizers and legal advocates have been pushing back — organizing tenants , pressuring policymakers and lenders , and throwing wrenches into the legal system .
A 4 - family house in the Fair Haven section of New Haven , CT , before foreclosure and removal of tenants through eviction and payment to move by Deutsche Bank .
The pre-foreclosure price was $ 160,000 .
Steve Meacham , a tenant organizer with City Life / Vida Urbana , a Boston - based social - justice organization , has been on the front lines of the foreclosure battle .
Traditionally , CL / VU had mainly organized tenants facing eviction into unions in order to negotiate with landlords .
“ About a year ago , we noticed something strange , ” explains Meacham .
“ Most of the evictions were being pushed by the banks and lenders . ”
Now the group scans the latest foreclosure listings and goes door to door to alert tenants .
They host meetings with people at risk of eviction , provide assistance and advice about negotiating with lenders , and organize demonstrations outside banks .
They also work with former owners who hope to renegotiate their loans with the banks and keep renting out their properties .
The same house in January 2009 .
After the foreclosure and eviction of all the tenants , the house sat vacant for 17 months until its ultimate sale in December 2008 for $ 16,000 .
The house was completely gutted and stripped by vandals of any items of value , from copper pipes to aluminum siding .

Renters are usually the last to learn about a foreclosure .
“ Tenants will get a letter from a bank offering them a few hundred dollars if they leave in two weeks , and threatening to evict them within a month if they refuse and give them nothing , ” says Meacham .
Those who leave usually lose their security deposits and any prepaid rent .
“ Most banks depend on people getting scared and leaving .
When people resist , especially tenants and former owners , the banks do n’t know what to do with that and back off . ”
Thanks to the group ’s tactics , scores of tenants and former owners have stalled foreclosures , negotiated higher payout deals , and even forced banks to cut mortgages .
Housing advocates are also taking the battle to state and federal policymakers .
In December , New Haven Legal Assistance ( NHLA ) threatened to sue Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for illegally evicting tenants in buildings the federal lenders had foreclosed on .
The agencies backed down and drew up new rules that stopped the practice .
Now activists are pressing for the same rules to apply to private lenders .
“ The current situation is lose - lose for everyone right now , ” says NHLA ’s Amy Eppler - Epstein .
“ Banks can make more money on a full building than an empty one that ’s trashed .
Shareholders , neighborhoods , communities , and tenants are suffering .
It ’s crazy and it ’s got to change . ”

Brits Attempt to Snoop On Everything And Tell Anyone
The UK is already the most surveiled society in the world , with more cameras per capita than any other country .
There ’s no evidence that this reduces crime , but that is n’t stopping the government from wanting to spy even more .
Recently they ’ve proposed spying on social networking sites :
“ The UK government , which is becoming increasingly Orwellian , has said that it is considering snooping on all social networking traffic including Facebook , MySpace , and bebo .
They have also attempted to bypass current privacy protections and share private info with the private sector , other governments , departments and , well , pretty much anyone :
“ Clause 152 of the Coroners and Justice Bill , currently being debated by the UK Parliament , would allow any Minister by order to take from anywhere any information gathered for one purpose , and use it for any other purpose .
Personal information arbitrarily used without consent or even knowledge : the very opposite of ‘ Data Protection . ’
An ‘ Information Sharing Order ’ , as defined in Clause 152 , would permit personal information to be trafficked and abused , not only all across government and the public sector — it would also reach into the private sector .
And it would even allow transfer of information across international borders .
Fortunately public uproar made them withdraw this particular anti-privacy provision .
The UK has been leading the US and other Western nations in the march closer and closer toward surveillance states .
I hope the rejection of the sharing provisions means a reversal in trend , but I suspect it ’s only a small setback to those who believe that taking away citizens ’ privacy and liberty is the route to security .

Advertisement A man who spent 27 years in jail for a murder he did not commit said he was " ecstatic " as he walked free from the Court of Appeal .
Sean Hodgson , now 57 , saw his " unsafe " conviction for killing Teresa De Simone , 22 , in her car in Southampton 30 years ago quashed by senior judges .
Tests prove DNA from the scene was not his and police have reopened the case .
Speaking outside court Mr Hodgson said it was " great to be free " while his brother said his release was a " dream " .
" On behalf of my brother , I would like to thank the solicitor a million , million times , " Peter Hodgson said .
Teresa De Simone had been raped and strangled
DNA doubt cast over other murders Hodgson ' will struggle to cope ' ' Everybody said he was innocent ' " I 've had a dream for 27 years .
I know it 's a hell of a long time , but it 's finally come true . "
Mr Hodgson is one of the longest - serving victims of a miscarriage of justice in the UK .
His solicitor Julian Young said : " I hope that the inquiry , that will undoubtedly take place , will find out how this happened and ensure it does not happen again . "
Lord Chief Justice , Lord Judge , and two other senior judges ruled that his 1982 conviction was " unsafe " .
The body of Miss De Simone , who had also been raped , was found partially clothed in the back seat of her Ford Escort in the car park beneath the Tom Tackle pub where she worked part - time .
In his ruling , Lord Judge said : " The conviction will be quashed for the simple reason that advances in the science of DNA , long after the end of the trial , have proved a fact which ... [ would ] have resulted in quite a different investigation and a completely different trial . "
He said that tests on sperm found at the scene proved it did not come from Mr Hodgson .
" The Crown 's case was that whoever raped her also killed her , so the new DNA evidence has demolished the case for the prosecution , " Lord Judge added .
He announced at the end of his judgement that Mr Hodgson would be " discharged " and there would be no new trial .
Mr Hodgson said he felt " ecstatic " that he was a free man again
At the time of Mr Hodgson 's trial , DNA tests were not available , with the first use of such evidence in court not taking place until 1986 in Leicester .
Mr Hodgson , who is also known as Robert Graham Hodgson and is originally from Tow Law in County Durham , made various confessions to police before pleading not guilty at his trial at Winchester Crown Court .
But his defence said he was a pathological liar and the confessions were untrue .
The prosecution had also been supported during the trial by the fact that blood type analysis available at the time showed that material recovered at the scene belonged to a man with blood of either group A or AB .
Mr Hodgson was in that category along with roughly a third of the male population .
Hampshire Police and the Forensic Science Service undertook a comprehensive forensic case review in November 2008 after requests from Mr Hodgson 's legal team .

It discovered that DNA evidence found at the scene did not match a sample given by Mr Hodgson .
In the light of new evidence , the Criminal Cases Review Commission ( CCRC ) decided to refer Mr Hodgson 's case to the Court of Appeal because it considered that there was a " real possibility that the court would consider the conviction unsafe and quash it " .
Det Ch Insp Philip McTavish , from Hampshire Police , said : " Mr Hodgson was convicted by a jury on evidence which included his own admissions to a clergymen , prison officers and police .
There were also a number of other strands .
" Hampshire Constabulary has consequently started a reinvestigation into the murder of Teresa De Simone and this is aimed at identifying the owner of the DNA profile .
" We are fully committed to pursuing this investigation . "
The Crown Prosecution Service did not oppose the appeal .

In Alaska , climate change is creating an unforeseen humanitarian crisis .
Arctic sea ice – which had protected communities from coastal erosion and flooding – is rapidly disappearing and signalling a radical transformation of this northern ecosystem .
Scientific observations during the summer of 2007 documented a new record low .
In 2006 , the US government completed a $ 2.5 m ( £ 1.7 m ) seawall to protect the native village of Kivalina , located on an island in the Chukchi Sea .
But on the day of the dedication ceremony , a storm surge partly destroyed the newly constructed sea barrier .
One year later , the community was evacuated to protect inhabitants from a severe storm .
The situation looks set to get worse .
Winter temperatures along the northern Alaskan coast have increased an average of 3.5C ( 38.3 F ) since 1975 .
These warming temperatures are causing the arctic seas to freeze later in autumn and the permafrost – usually permanently frozen subsoil – to thaw .
Along the northwestern Alaskan coast , permafrost is the glue that keeps the land intact and habitable .
Approximately 200 indigenous villages that have inhabited the arctic for millennia are located along Alaska 's coasts and rivers .
Dozens of these communities are now endangered because of accelerating erosion and flooding .
Five indigenous communities , located along the Bering and Chukchi Seas , have concluded that relocation is the only durable solution to the climatic events that are threatening their lives .
Government agencies now realise that erosion and flooding control can no longer protect these coastal communities .
In 2006 , a US government report found that relocation of three communities is required because a catastrophic climatic event could submerge them within 10 - 15 years .
Despite these dire predictions , no community has yet been relocated because of the governance issues that must be addressed to facilitate relocation .
The report recognised that no government agency has the authority to relocate communities , no governmental organisation exists that can address the strategic planning needs of relocation , and no funding is specifically designated for relocation .
Since 2006 , government officials have organised numerous meetings to address the policy and practical challenges of relocation .
One village , Newtok , is in the relocation process .
The Newtok Planning Group is the only interdisciplinary governmental workgroup in Alaska focused on relocation .
The Newtok Traditional Council is leading the effort .
Next week in Alaska , the Inuit Circumpolar Conference will host a gathering of indigenous peoples from all over the world .
The goal is to develop recommendations for the UN Convention on Climate Change meeting in December 2009 .
One of the topics will be the creation of a human rights regime to protect those forced to relocate because of climate change .
" Climigration " is the word that best describes this type of population displacement .
Climigration requires a new and unique institutional response based in human rights doctrine .
Communities , rather than individuals , will be forced to migrate .
Permanent relocation will be mandated because there will be no ability to return home because home will be under water or sinking in thawing permafrost .
Catastrophic random environmental events , such as hurricanes , do not cause climigration .
However , these random environmental events , if on - going , may alter ecosystems permanently , cause extensive damage to public infrastructure , repeatedly place people in danger and require communities to relocate .
Determining which communities are most likely to encounter displacement will require a complex assessment of a community 's ecosystem vulnerability to climate change , as well as the vulnerability of its social , economic and political structures .
Permanent relocation must only occur when there are no other durable solutions .
International human rights principles need to be specifically created for climigration to ensure that the social , economic and cultural human rights of individuals and the communities forced to migrate are protected .
These principles will ensure that the affected community is a key leader and decision - maker in the relocation process .
The principles will also affirm that families and tribes remain together .
For indigenous communities , tribal relationships are essential to cultural identity .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) predicts that 150 million people may be displaced by climate change by 2050 .
The United Nations University has developed an international research agenda on climate change and forced migration .
The IPCC needs to convene an expert working group to fully develop the human rights framework that will guide nation - states in addressing climigration .
The time to act is now .

A Sydney police officer has been treated for burns after shooting himself with a Taser stun gun .
Police were called to a nightclub brawl on Elizabeth Street , near Martin Place , at about 3.40 am on Sunday .
They say a Taser stun gun was used in an attempt to subdue a 27 - year - old man after he resisted arrest .
The officer Tasered himself in the struggle , injuring his arm .
The policeman was treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken to St Vincent 's Hospital where he received treatment for minor burns .

Day One of the CanSecWest Pwn2Own hacking contest finished Wednesday , with fully - patched copies of IE8 , Safari , and Firefox all falling to hacker " Nils " .
IE8 and Firefox took longer than Safari , which fell in seconds , according to reports from CanSecWest where the Pwn2 Own contest is held .
Earlier today we reported on the agenda and final rules for the contest .
Pwn2Own is a live hacking contest at which many of the best security researchers in the world attempt to crack the products you run every day live for cash prizes .
Actually , in this case some of the versions of products are a little ahead of what you run , just to make it as challenging as possible .
On a Sony Vaio running Windows 7 the following browsers will be attacked : IE8 , Firefox , Chrome , followed by the Safari and Firefox browser running on a Mac .
On day 1 of the contest , hackers must attack a default installation with no added plugins .
On day 2 Flash , Java , . Net , and QuickTime are added and the " attack surface " is much greater .
On day 3 popular apps such as Acrobat Reader are added .
For these browser tests , success means code execution within context of the application .
Success is defined as either " loss of information ( user data ) " or " incur financial cost " .
For his exploits Nils won a cash prize and the Sony Vaio used in the contest .

While many of our readers are well aware of global environmental laws that are specifically written to protect the environment , such as the Kyoto Protocol , the International Framework Convention on Climate Change , the United Nations Law of the Sea and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) , this post would like to explore what some of the laws of war and humanitarianism ( the Geneva Convention being the most famous ) hold for protecting the environment .
Some of the principles encompassed in the Geneva Convention include :
The prohibition of unlimited warfare ;
That military planners must avoid political and economic targets and focus on military objectives solely ;
Incidental damage incurred by civilians and non-military installations must not be excessive in comparison to the military advantage gained in the attack ;
Avoiding the wanton destruction of property ( i.e. destroying non-military property without justification ) ; and
A general prohibition of destroying objects indispensable to the civilian population ( for example , water supplies ) .
When additional protocols to the Geneva Convention were adopted , further articles were enshrined that were designed to protect the environment .
Article 35 ( 3 ) specifies that
It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended , or may be expected , to cause widespread , long - term and severe damage to the natural environment .
Article 55 prohibits reprisals against the natural environment and enshrines a duty of care on warring parties .
Another convention related to the Geneva Convention , the United Nations Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques ( ENMOD ) specifically prohibits activities that have the potential to modify the environment :
Article I Each State Party to this Convention undertakes not to engage in military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques having widespread , long - lasting or severe effects as the means of destruction , damage or injury to any other State Party .
While this convention addresses military and hostile uses of environmental modification techniques , it does not prohibit the use of environmental modification techniques for non-military purposes ( for example , geo - engineering and other proposed climate modification techniques that are being proposed within the context of climate change ) .
The protocols of the Geneva Convention and ENMOD provide a theoretically solid legal foundation for protecting the environment during warfare and conflict situations .
The challenge that remains is how to ensure that these rules are implemented , respected and enforced by participants and observers throughout the conflict cycle .

Barack Obama
Obama Town Hall Questioners Were Campaign Backers
Updated 7:02 p.m.
By Garance Franke - Ruta
President Obama has promised to change the way the government does business , but in at least one respect he is taking a page from the Bush playbook , stocking his town hall Thursday with supporters whose soft -- though far from planted -- questions provided openings to discuss his preferred message of the day .
Obama has said , " I think it 's important to engage your critics ... because not only will you occasionally change their mind but , more importantly , sometimes they will change your mind , " White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs recounted to The Post 's Lois Romano in an interview Wednesday .
But while the online question portion of the White House town hall was open to any member of the public with an Internet connection , the five fully identified questioners called on randomly by the president in the East Room were anything but a diverse lot .
They included : a member of the pro-Obama Service Employees International Union , a member of the Democratic National Committee who campaigned for Obama among Hispanics during the primary ; a former Democratic candidate for Virginia state delegate who endorsed Obama last fall in an op -ed in the Fredericksburg Free Lance - Star ; and a Virginia businessman who was a donor to Obama 's campaign in 2008 .
Here are their stories :
1. Sergio Salmeron : Self - description at the White House : " My name is Sergio Salmeron .
I want to find out about health care . "
Salmeron became engaged with the Obama campaign early in 2008 , writing on his blog at my.barackobama.com , " We need to mobilize towards changing the trend of ' 2 to 1 Latinos favoring Hillary over Barack . '
Let 's make a resolute commitment ...
Let 's put the facts on the table , ask the questions , until we understand how this all applies to us .
Then strategize [ sic ] to get the word out to Latinos in America , who want change as much as everyone else . "
He was a volunteer canvasser for the campaign , he told The Post , and did voter registration work and translated materials for the campaign , as well .
A partner at Global Paradigm Strategies , Salmeron is volunteer " member of the Democratic National Committee " and continues to be active with the Obama campaign 's successor , Organizing for America , which is how he got the White House invite , he said .
" I got a call from this woman who has been working with me for the pledge drive , " he said , referring to the Organizing for America drive on behalf of the president 's budget proposal .
" You know , we 're trying to get support out for the president 's agenda . "
2. Tom Sawner : Self - description : " Sir , I 'm Tom Sawner .
I 'm a service - disabled veteran , small - business owner in Arlington , Virginia .
My company , Educational Options , works with public schools . "
According to Federal Election Commission records , Sawner made a $ 250 donation to Obama 's campaign on Oct. 27 , 2008 .
He also , as he noted Thursday , served as an adviser on Obama 's educational platform committee .
He said he was invited to the White House town hall through the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Small Business Executive Council .
Sawner 's no stranger to the White House , either ; he attended President Bush 's Feb.
2008 signing ceremony for that year 's economic stimulus package -- another Chamber of Commerce invite .
And in April 2008 , he even became an anecdote in one of Bush 's speeches .
" And I met a guy named Tom Sawner , " the 43rd president said at a small business summit .
" Now , he 's an old fighter pilot , which means there 's no wall he can [ sic ] run through .
He 's a doer , an achiever , and he 's got him a small business called Educational Options . "
But the event with Obama , Sawner said , " was a whole different look and feel " than the one with Bush .
" This is a president who is into openness . "
And he did n't know he was going to be able to ask a question until he got to the forum , he said .
3. Carlos Del Toro : Self - description : " My name is Carlos Del Toro .
I served in the Navy for 26 years , retired four years ago , and started a small business . "
In 2007 , Del Toro stood as a Democratic candidate for the Virginia House of Delegates , but did not win .
A supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic presidential primaries , he backed Obama against McCain in the general , endorsing him in an Oct. 24 , 2008 op - ed in the Fredericksburg Free Lance - Star .
" As a Virginia small - business owner , veteran , and Latino , I 'm voting for Sen. Barack Obama for the same reasons as millions of other Americans : because I believe this country desperately needs change .
Obama will change our economic policies to help middle - class families , promote the growth of small businesses , and increase funding for veterans ' affairs , so no member of our armed services goes without the medical treatment he or she needs and deserves , " he wrote .
In 2008 , he donated $ 2,750 to Virginia Democratic candidates for office , according to the Center for Responsive Politics ; in 2006 , he gave $ 1000 to the campaign of now Sen. Jim Webb ( Va. ) , FEC records show .
He also has ties to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 's Small Business Council .
4. Linda Bock : " My name is Linda Bock and I 'm a registered nurse just in Prince George 's County , Maryland -- been there 34 years at a free senior health center .
And I 'm here with my fellow nurses from SEIU . "
Bock , along with her chapter of the SEIU and her son and daughter , helped campaign and canvass for Obama , she said .
After Obama was elected , she wrote in the Landover , Md. , 1199 SEIU nurses ' newsletter : " Now we have our work cut out for us - to hold our elected officials accountable .
And I hope they hold us accountable too .
We all have work to do to make the changes needed to restore our reputation , to heal the wounds of war , to repair our earth and regulate its resources ; and , to secure our economic future .
It will take sacrifice and service .
It will take prayer and the grace of God .
Now we have hope .
We have President - elect Barack Obama .
God bless America . "
Her invite to the White House came through the Nurse Alliance Leadership Council , she said .
And like Sawner , she did n't know until she got to the forum that it was open to the in real life participants .
" I did not think we would be able to ask any questions , " she said .
" I was n't personally anticipating being chosen to ask anything .
We knew that the Web portion was people already lined up . "
5. Bonnee L. Breese : " Hi , Mr. President .
Thank you so very much for having me , a public school teacher from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , here to be with you .
THE PRESIDENT : What 's your name ?
Q Bonnee Breese .
THE PRESIDENT : Good to see you , Bonnee .
Q Thank you .
I 'm from Overbrook High School .
I have to say that , because I know all the children are watching .
( Laughter . ) "
Breese has not donated a reportable amount to Obama , according to the FEC .
She is a member of the 11,626 - person Pennsylvania for Obama page on Facebook .
A supporter of the president 's -- " Of course ! " she said -- Breese was invited to the meeting through the American Federation of Teachers union .
She sits on the executive board of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers , Local 3 , she said , and is known in her area for being politically engaged .
The sixth in - person presidential questioner , " Ellie " from Maryland , did not give her surname .
The White House did not respond to a request for it , but noted there were roughly 100 people in the audience .
" The audience was composed of approximately 100 people , including teachers , nurses , small business owners , and community leaders -- and the virtual audience of thousands across the country who have submitted questions online , " said White House spokesman Nicholas S. Shapiro .
" The White House reached out to a number of community groups and the chamber of commerce and those groups invited their folks to come and participate . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
More than eight in ten cities are in financial trouble , up from 64 % six months ago , according to a survey released Wednesday .
The recession is straining cities ' ability to meet their financial needs , according to the National League of Cities .
Some 84 % of cities reported facing fiscal difficulties , the highest percentage since the group starting doing surveys in 1985 .
The nation 's cities are counting on billions of dollars from the economic stimulus package now being debated in the Senate .
Mayors gathered in Washington , D.C. , to meet with White House advisers and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , on Wednesday to urge Congress to pass the recovery bill .
The mayors are eager to get funding for transportation and infrastructure projects that will put their residents to work .
While most of those meeting Wednesday have budget deficits , they are not looking for federal money to close those gaps .
" If we 're going to invest to stimulate our economy , we need to invest in our cities , " said Miami Mayor Manny Diaz .
" Cities are ready to go .
This money comes in and goes right back out to create jobs . "
The mayors have put together a " Ready to Go " report that details 18,750 local infrastructure projects in 779 cities that can be started as soon as funding is received .
The projects , which represent an investment of $ 150 billion , would create 1.6 million jobs in 2009 and 2010 and range from creating bridge guardrails in Bessemer , Ala. , to renovating elementary schools in Norfolk , Va .
The economic stimulus package sets aside billions of dollars for highway construction , transit improvements , school modernization and community development block grants .
2009 not looking better
Things will remain tough in 2009 .
Some 92 % of the cities surveyed expected to have trouble meeting their city needs during this year .
To cope , they are implementing hiring freezes and layoffs , delaying capital expenditures and instituting service cuts .
Some 69 % have instituted hiring freezes or layoffs , while 42 % are delaying or canceling infrastructure projects .
Another 22 % have instituted across the board cuts .
Cities are seeing their tax revenues decline as property values drop , shopping slows and unemployment rises .
On top of that , nearly one in two city finance officers report difficulties in access to credit and / or bond financing .
To bring in more revenue , they are adding to raising fees .
Nearly half are increasing charges for services , while 28 % are increasing the number of fees .
Fewer are raising taxes .
Some 14 % have increased property taxes , while 6 % have hiked sales taxes .
" Cities are responding as best they can , " said Donald Borut , the league 's executive director .
" Their citizens have increasing needs for services just at the same time that revenues are declining . "
City finances tend to lag the overall economy by 12 to 24 months , the league said .
The weakening economic conditions will be felt by cities through 2009 and likely through most of 2010 , the league said .
I recently got an email from a friend , who told her son I was an ' oil expert ' .
He had overheard a conversation about future oil shortages and asked his mom if she would email me - below are his questions and my response back ( his mother is a homesteader , and has recently started to home school her 2 children ) .
“ When will the oil run out and how old will I ( Parker ) be when it runs out ? “
Dear Parker ,
What an amazing question for a 7 year old to ask ?
It ’s not a simple answer , but since you asked , here goes …
Your grandparents have grandparents , and those grandparents also had grandparents , and if you imagine this repeated over and over , like 50,000 grandparents of grandparents into the past – that is how long humans have been using energy to live our lives .
But for most of that time , we used the energy from just the SUN .
The sun gives our planet all kinds of energy that we can use .
It gives us warmth and heat from its rays , gives us wind from temperature changes , makes water evaporate which then falls as rain , which can be used for water - power , and all sorts of other uses ( like drying your underwear on a clothesline or growing a Big Beef tomato plant in your garden ) .
But since the time of your grandparents grandparents –only about 150 years ago , people started to use fossil fuels like oil and gas .
Fossil fuels are just sunlight from a really long time ago that was captured by animals and little organisms and was buried under the earth when they died .
Over millions of years , it decayed and turned into a black gooey fuel called oil , which can be made into gasoline and power engines .
Gasoline is very cheap – it is about the same price for 1 gallon of gasoline as a gallon of milk .
But it is very powerful .
One gallon of gasoline ( under $ 2 ) , can do the same amount of physical work as your mom can digging ditches , carrying wood , pushing a wheelbarrow etc. for about 500 hours , which is like working for 10 weeks in a row without stopping .
When you look at it like that , oil and gasoline are almost like magic !!
Oil will never ‘ run out ’ .
But what will happen , and very soon , is it will become unaffordable for society to produce and pay for .
The problem is that people born before you used a lot of the cheaper oil for silly things – things that either were n’t important , or did n’t last too long , like fast car races , wars , and garbage .
Most of our society now depends on this cheap oil – food is grown using oil and gas based fertilizers and tractors .
It is then packaged in plastics that are made from oil , refrigerated in containers that use gasoline , and transported in trucks all over the world .
So oil is very important to how most people live day to day .
During your life , a great many changes will happen to the planet , and to the things we have become used to .
I would say it is highly possible that when you turn 16 , oil will be too expensive for you to even drive a car .
To someone 7 or 17 or even 67 , this might sound scary .
But that ’s only because they are used to it .
We will have to figure out ways to live and enjoy our lives without this extra energy –the oil we found in the ground .
We used just the sun for thousands of generations before .
And you know what ?
For someone young like yourself , running out of cheap oil might actually be pretty cool .
You have an amazing opportunity to be involved in the first ‘ sustainability revolution ’ on our planet .
Sustainability means something that you can do over and over again each year without relying on energy that was stored underground from the ancient past ( like oil , or coal ) .
For example , growing pumpkins from the seeds of last years pumpkins and using chicken poop to fertilize them is something sustainable .
Even if you do n’t have oil , you will still have the sun , the wind , trees and water to provide food , heat and shelter and make things you need .
There is still is a lot of oil left – it is just that it will cost a lot of money and other things we need to get it out .
And remember , money is only worth something because people agree that it has value – it does n’t have REAL value , like a chicken or a windmill or water in a barrel .
But right now we can exchange it for stuff .
In your lifetime that may not always be true .
Parker , you have an amazing advantage !
First you are young , and are n’t too dependent yet on oil .
But more importantly , your Mom has given you a big head start .
Teaching you about the land , and where food comes from , and natural stuff is very important .
Living in the country gives you lots of chances to play and learn at the same time .
Most kids do n’t get that opportunity and when oil becomes real expensive they are going to be scared and confused about things like where food comes from and such – they would n’t know the difference between a chicken and an owl ( I bet you do . )
Try and learn as much as you can about how the natural world works .
Because people too are part of the natural world .
So , to answer your question , oil is a great and powerful energy source , but it does n’t necessarily make people happy .
To catch bugs , play with your sister and friends , have a meal with your family , tell stories , make music , go exploring , design an experiment , raise animals , dream and laugh – all these things do n’t need any oil at all .
So if I were you , I ’d be excited that the cheap oil is soon running out .
Your generation will make an important mark on the future of our planet – maybe you will help out Parker !
– if not , I ’m sure you ’ll have fun and do great stuff in your own little corner of the world , wherever that may be .
My only advice to you is to always be curious about how things work , always be playful and try to see the fun and joy in every situation , and do n’t worry about knowing everything or being good at everything – to be good at the things you are good at and like to do is enough– the world will seek you out and put you on a path .
Oil is awesome , but we do n’t need it .
Personally , I would choose a good friend anyday over oil …
Good luck ,
Nate
P.S. Parker is a really cool name .
Cool and strong .

Amid a blur of blue surgical scrubs , with doctors and nurses whirling by , a row of patients lay in a pre-op room - their feet swathed in surgical booties , their heads covered in bonnets , their arms hooked to tendrils of medical tubing .
" I want to go back to work , " said Adam Mesa , 57 , a field worker from Cloverdale who has been unable to earn an income since developing a painful hernia a year ago .
He was among several dozen uninsured people on Saturday who were given free surgical care , from colonoscopies to hernia repairs to tonsillectomies , at Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco .
Dubbed " Super Surgery Session , " the medical services were donated by about 84 Kaiser doctors , nurses and hospital technicians .
The high - volume surgery was orchestrated by Operation Access , a nonprofit organization launched 16 years ago to mobilize Bay Area hospitals , community clinics and medical volunteers to donate help to low - income people who need surgery but lack health insurance .
Since then , more than 4,300 uninsured patients have undergone medical procedures because of the program .
The Saturday event marked the fifth anniversary of a surgical marathon at Kaiser ; but this year , more than others , it reflected the burgeoning economic plight confronting many .
" We 're seeing greater demand for services , " said John Gressman , president and chief executive of the San Francisco Community Clinic Consortium , a group of 10 clinics where the vast majority of patients are uninsured .
" People are losing their jobs , losing their insurance ; businesses are closing . "
That 's the fate awaiting Enrique Yam , 34 , a San Rafael father of three who had a lipoma , a large fatty growth , surgically removed from his hip early Saturday morning .
Yam , who has worked for a furniture store for 10 years , once had medical insurance .
But six months ago , he went on part - time work status and can't afford $ 550 monthly in health insurance premiums for his family .
Next month , he said , he 'll be out of a job .
" I feel so lucky to get this operation - there are people worse off than me , " he said after surgery .
" Everyone here treated me so well , with such respect . "
The medical services provided Saturday were worth about $ 260,000 in all .
The average annual income of each of the 26 patients is $ 7,800 .
" It 's a wonderful way for us to give back to our community right here in our backyard , " said Dr. Elaine Yutan , a general surgeon at Kaiser who serves on the advisory council of Operation Access .
She performed three surgical procedures Saturday .
" The patients here are a microcosm of what 's going on all over , " she said .
" There 's such a need for health insurance , but people are n't able to afford it . "
Crowding into a small lunchroom on the hospital 's surgical floor , several local politicians , including Assemblyman Tom Ammiano and city Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi , bestowed kudos and certificates of commendation on Kaiser and Operation Access .
" With 7 million Californians ( lacking ) health insurance ,
1 million of them children , we have to be as innovative as possible , " said state Sen .
Mark Leno , who quoted a Hebrew phrase about the importance of healing an ailing society .
" You are indeed repairing the world , " he said .
Renee Timp , an assistant nurse manager at Kaiser , symbolized the spirit of the medical team involved in the surgeries .
She has donated her medical expertise many times to Operation Access .
" Whether it 's a hernia repair or a biopsy , this could help people get back to the workplace and have a better chance , " she said .
" There 's nothing worse than not having health insurance , but being able to look at these patients ' lumps and bumps can really be a help . "
On Saturday morning , just before Mesa was taken into surgery , his anesthesiologist dropped by for a bedside visit .
" Are you nervous ? " asked Dr. Daniel Kong .
" I do n't feel nervous .
I feel thankful , " answered Mesa .
" I 'm going to give you a little medicine now and we 'll go in , " said Kong .
" You 'll go to sleep . "
Nearly two hours later , a groggy Mesa was wheeled back into the unit .
Waiting for him was his wife of 44 years , Socorro .
" You 've been so worried , " she said , stroking his face .
" Now you 're OK . "
• Facebook and MySpace could be required to hold data about every person users chat with for up to year • Privacy campaigners condemn ' centralised snooping '
Privacy campaigners expressed alarm today over government plans to monitor all conversations on social networking sites in an attempt to crackdown on terror .
A Home Office spokesman said that the internet eavesdropping plan , which would be set out in the next few weeks , would cover any social network that allows people to chat to one another , including Facebook , MySpace , Bebo and Twitter as well as internet calls on Skype .
He said the proposal would update existing plans to store information about every telephone call , email , and internet visit made by anyone in the UK on a central database .
" We have no way of knowing whether Osama bin Laden is chatting to Abu Hamza on Facebook .
Or terrorists could be having a four - way chat on Skype , " he said .
He said the government was not interested in the contents of the communication : " What we want to monitor is that so - and - so is logged on to that site and spoke to so - and - so .
It 's the who , when and where , not the content . "
But he conceded that in " high - profile cases " the police would want to examine the contents of social network chatter .
" The security service would want the ability to capture information that could lead to conviction , " he said .
Under the new proposals , the sites that host social networks could be required to hold data about who users correspond with for up to a year .
Privacy campaigners criticised the plan , saying it would be another unwieldy , costly and unnecessary failure .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of human rights group Liberty , said : " The widescale use of social networking websites highlights the enormity of government ambitions for a centralised communications database for the surveillance of the entire population …
Technological development is used as an excuse for centralised snooping of a kind that ought never to be acceptable in the oldest unbroken democracy on earth . "
Michael Parker , spokesman for campaign group NO2ID , said the government was enforcing data sharing and the pillaging of private information .
" Their plans for the intercept modernisation programme were completely unworkable to begin with and are becoming more so with every addition they suggest .
The idea of tracking calls , texts and emails made by people in the country is unspeakably offensive . "
The plans were first revealed by the Home Office minister , Vernon Coaker , last week at a Commons committee hearing on a draft EU directive that does not cover social networking .
He said the government 's intercept modernisation programme proposals may be extended to include " the retention of data on Facebook , Bebo , MySpace and all other similar sites " .
He added : " The government are looking at what we should do about the intercept modernisation programme because there are certain aspects of communications which are not covered by the [ EU ] directive . "
Coaker acknowledged that the plan would raise fresh concerns about the right to privacy .
" I accept that this is an extremely difficult area .
The interface between retaining data , private security and all such issues of privacy is extremely important , " he said .
The Home Office spokesman said a consultation paper , to be published shortly before or after Easter , would explore the practicality of the plan .
In a statement the Home Office added : " The government has no interest in the content of people 's social network sites and this is not going to be part of our upcoming consultation .
We have been clear the communications revolution has been rapid in this country and the way in which we collect communications data needs to change so that law enforcement agencies can maintain their ability to tackle terrorism and gather evidence .
" To ensure that we keep up with technological advances we intend to consult widely on proposals shortly .
We have been very clear that there are no plans for a database containing the content of emails , texts , conversations or social networking sites . "
On Monday the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust published a report claiming that a quarter of all the largest public - sector database projects , including the identity cards register , were fundamentally flawed and clearly breach European data protection and rights laws .
Claiming to be the most comprehensive map so far of Britain's " database state " , the report says that 11 of the 46 biggest schemes , including the national DNA database and the Contactpoint index of all children in England , should be given a " red light " and immediately scrapped or redesigned .
In a night that saw Donald Brashear get knocked to the ice by a stiff left from Wade Belak , Matt Bradley get horribly bloodied by Jordan Tootoo , and essentially a draw between John Erskine and Belak , the Capitals were happy to make it out of Nashville in one piece , let alone with the victory .
In the end though , they took the game 2 - 1 on the Sergei Fedorov overtime winner .
Unfortunately the game did n’t go as well in the tough guy department .

Yesterday 's news that Wii Fit continued to ride high on the U.S. video game sales chart last month told only half the story .

I just confirmed with the NPD Group that the fitness title 's lifetime sales has topped Halo 3's .
As of the end of February Wii Fit has sold 6 million copies in the U.S. while Xbox 360 goliath has moved 5.9 million copies in its life time .
Keep in mind that the $ 90 Wii Fit launched in the U.S. on May 21 of last year , while Halo 3 hit the Xbox 360 on Sept. 25 of 2007 .

With 6 million balance boards out there and a legion of Wii owners , there 's got to be an incoming wave of games developed for the new peripheral .
Long title ?
Yep .
There just so happens to be quite a difference between Spoofs ( parody ) and Satire .
Here , I ’ll help you :
1. Satire : the use of irony , sarcasm , ridicule , or the like , in exposing , denouncing , or deriding vice , folly , etc .
2. Spoof : a mocking imitation of someone or something , usually light and good - humored ; lampoon or parody .
See the difference ?
Though all of these horror films thrive on humor as their backbone , each one has a structure that falls into one of those categories above .
Now , generally , a satirical flick tends to be more of an homage and a tongue and cheek attempt to grasp the genre but with a more , ‘ what if this funny thing happened ’ approach .
Parody , on the other hand , tends to take on a more literal , ‘ poking fun at but with a sly nod to the source material ’ .
These slight differentiations help more easily separate the films below .
Here are the best of the best .
Repossessed – 1990
( Linda Blair , Leslie Nielsen , Ned Beatty ) Spoof
From IMDB : “ Spoofmaster Leslie Neilsen appears in this outrageous , unofficial comedic sequel to ‘ The Exorcist ’ as Father Mayii , the exorcist pro who comes out of retirement when summoned by an idealistic priest , Father Brophy , to help out geeky suburban middle - age mom , Nancy Aglet ( Blaire ) who has recently been re-re - re - repossessed !
But , two tacky popular televangelists , Ernest and Fanny Ray , hosting a local religious wacko program , figure they can cash in on Nancy ’s dilemma and want to broadcast the exorcism . ”
This movie , as a definite spoof of the Exorcist as a whole , is very funny and features a top - of - his - game Neilsen .
Shaun of the Dead – 2004
( Simon Pegg , Nick Frost , Bill Nighy ) Satire
From IMDB : “ Hot on the heels of recent remake Dawn of the Dead comes Simon Pegg and Nick Frost ’s black comedy zombie satire , in which Shawn must save his friends , mum , and ex-girlfriend from the masses of lumbering dead by holding up at the local pub , the Winchester !
Unlike recent zombie - fests , these dead - ites are pretty tame , lumbering monstrosities , much like the ones from the older zombie films .
This is used to simple comic effect throughout as the ‘ heroes ’ seem to have plenty of time to think about things before being attacked . ”
Though often mis-categorized as a spoof , this amazing zombie flick is a full - on homage to Romero himself .
It offers up tons of laughs while simultaneously never spitting in the eye of the genre .
Director Edgar Wright got it , well , right .
Saturday the 14th – 1981
( Paul Prentiss , Richard Benjamin , Jeffrey Tambor ) Spoof
From IMDB : “ Primarily a spoof of the Friday the 13th series , but also takes shots at several other horror films .
After his family moves to a new house , a young boy discovers a mysterious book describing the curse hanging over the date of Saturday the 14th .
Opening the book releases a band of monsters into the house , and the family must join together to save themselves and their neighborhood . ”
A lot of people really hate this movie , which is kind of a shame .
It does a pretty decent job of mocking the myriad horror flicks of the time and dishes out a good deal of laughs .
Sure it ’s stupid , but that ’s the point .
Also , it ’s pretty tame as I recall watching it as a youngster on HBO .
I was a weird kid though .
Scary Movie ( The Series ) – 2000 , ’01 , ’03, ’06
( Anna Faris , Marlon Wayans , David Cross , Charlie Sheen , Regina Hall ) Spoof
Parodying all of the following films over the years :
The Scream trilogy , The Sixth Sense , I Know What You Did Last Summer , The Blair Witch Project , Halloween , The Exorcist , The Shining , Hollow Man , Poltergeist , Urban Legend , The Haunting , Pet Sematary , What Lies Beneath , Friday the 13th , A Nightmare on Elm Street , The Ring , Psycho , The Others , The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , Signs , The Grudge , and the Saw Franchise .
And those are just most of the horror ones , there ’s at least fifty mainstream film spoofs as well !
Yeah , these guys did it all and , though most are pretty funny , for the most part they buried the spoofing genre for everyone else .
The first , as is often the case , is the best .
Young Frankenstein – 1974
( Gene Wilder , Teri Garr , Peter Boyle , Marty Feldman ) Satire
From IMDB : “ Mel Brooks ’ hilarious “ Young Frankenstein ” is one of those strange films that is so outlandish and makes fun of itself so much that it sucks the viewer into its twisted world and does not let up until the final credits roll .
The title character ( Gene Wilder ) decides to go to Transylvania and continue the research of a late relative .
What follows is a comic joy - ride that involves the assistant ( Marty Feldman ) , the love interest ( Teri Garr ) , the stuck - up girlfriend ( Madeline Kahn ) , the weird house - keeper ( Cloris Leachman ) , the odd detective ( Kenneth Mars ) and naturally the monster himself ( Peter Boyle in a priceless performance ) .
Gene Hackman ’s whacked cameo as a the blind man who encounters the monster is one of the best sequences during the history of the cinema . ”
This open - handed salute to the original Universal Horror Movies of the 40’s and 50’s is not only a fine example of the amount of love a director can put into his film , but it ’s also one of cinema ’s greatest movies of all time .
Dracula : Dead and Loving It – 1995
( Leslie Neilsen , Peter MacNicol , Steven Webber ) Spoof
From IMDB : “ Another spoof from the mind of Mel Brooks .
This time he ’s out to poke fun at the Dracula myth .
Basically , he took “ Bram Stoker ’s Dracula , ” gave it a new cast and a new script and made a big joke out of it .
The usual , rich English are attacked by Dracula and Dr. Van Helsing is brought in to save the day . ”
No , it ’s not one of Brooks ’ best films ( see above ) but his handling of the over - popular vampire mythos was pretty well made .
Once again Neilsen , a man not known to turn down a spoof , returns to the very genre that made him so famous and funny .
Pandemonium – 1982
( Phil Hartman , Carol Kane , Judge Reinhold ) Spoof
Put so very eloquently by IMDB : “ Pandemonium ” is a special , but not so loved like maybe could have been , parody about horror movies .
It is about a school of cheerleaders and a crazy man who is out to kill them .
One by one the ’re offed without mercy in myriad ways .
It ’s a spoof that reads like “ Friday the 13th ” but with more cookies , more milk and more laughs . ”
Yes , all in all it ’s a pretty funny flick that really does try hard to be too much like the classic Student Bodies ( see below ) but falls short .
Still , bored one night and have a taste for cheese , it ’s not an entire waste of time .
Student Bodies – 1981
( Kristen Riten , Matthew Goldsby , Ricard Belzer ) Spoof
This is the granddaddy of the horror spoofs .
It ’s spark ultimately ignited the black powder for everyone that followed .
Here ’s the IMDB story : “ A killer named the Breather terrorizes students at a high school .
Whenever the killer finds students having sex , he kills them .
He has some intense issues with which to deal .
He likes to breathe heavily , and he likes to make prank calls while talking through a rubber chicken . ”
Yeah , despite it ’s classic status , this movie is just utterly ridiculous and still manages to have some of the greatest one - liners of all time .
It has just recently been released on DVD for the first time so now there ’s no excuse for you not to watch this .
It ’s amazing .
Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein – 1949
( Bud Abbot , Lou Costello , Bella Lugosi , Lon Cheney , Jr. ) Comedic Satire
Arguably Bud and Lou ’s best film , this comedic homage to the best in Universal Movie Monsters looks like this IMDB write - up : “ The world of freight handlers Wilbur Grey and Chick Young is turned upside down when the remains of Frankenstein ’s monster and Dracula arrive from Europe to be used in a house of horrors .
Dracula awakens and escapes with the weakened monster , who he plans to re-energize with a new brain .
Larry Talbot ( the Wolfman ) arrives from London in an attempt to thwart Dracula .
Dracula ’s reluctant aide is the beautiful Dr. Sandra Mornay .
Her reluctance is dispatched by Dracula ’s bite .
Dracula and Sandra abduct Wilbur for his brain and recharge the monster in preparation for the operation .
Chick and Talbot attempt to find and free Wilbur , but when the full moon rises all hell breaks loose with the Wolfman , Dracula , and Frankenstein all running rampant . ”
A fun , funny flick that speaks completely of the era .
Stands up pretty well today , too .
On a submersible dive off the Bahamas , Mikhail V. Matz of the University of Texas at Austin and several colleagues were seeking big-eyed , glowing animals adapted to darkness .
Yet as they cruised above the seafloor , the team was distracted by hundreds of bizarre , sediment - coated balls the size of grapes .
Each sat at the end of a sinuous track in the seafloor ooze .
Indeed , the balls appeared to have made the tracks ; some even seemed to have rolled upslope .
The team collected specimens and identified the creatures as giant protozoans , Gromia sphaerica , each one a single large cell with an organic shell , or " test . "
When cleaned of sediment , the test feels like grape skin , but squishier , Matz says .
Surprisingly , the tracks on the Bahamian seafloor resemble grooves found in sedimentary rocks formed as long as 1.8 billion years ago .
The ancient grooves , bisected by a low ridge , had constituted the only evidence that multicellular , bilaterally symmetrical animals , such as worms , might have evolved so early in Earth 's history .
Matz 's discovery [ of modern tracks apparently left by G. sphaerica ] suggests that protozoans could have made those fossil traces rather than more advanced animals , which probably appeared much later .
The next earliest evidence of multicellularity and bilateralism in animals occurs in fossils 580 million and 542 million years old , respectively .
G. sphaerica are rhizopods , an ancient protozoan group .
Matz is planning further studies of the species , about which little is known .
The findings were detailed in the journal Current Biology in November .
( OPRAH.com ) --
On a Saturday morning , Colleen Seifert woke up early and ate her usual breakfast : half a bagel , fruit , and coffee .
She walked her Russian wolfhound , Bandit , and tidied her apartment .
Do n't worry , you can influence your own destiny .
Step one : Smile .
Seifert was an assistant professor in psychology at the University of Michigan , and for six years her life had been entirely focused on a single goal : earning tenure .
She was a work machine , putting in seven - day weeks and sleeping fewer than six hours each night .
Even when she left the lab , her mind was consumed with academic research .
" I could n't walk into a shopping mall without feeling I should have been at work , " she says .
Her big indulgence was running errands on Saturday mornings .
On this Saturday morning in February 1994 , however , her life was about to catapult in a new direction .
Seifert 's first stop was Pittsfield Cleaners , a couple of blocks away from her home .
It was a splendid , sunny day , she remembers ; the university was on spring break , and the streets of Ann Arbor , Michigan , were quiet .
She pulled up to the dry cleaner 's drive - through window and handed over a tangle of clothes .
The man at the cash register sorted through the items and held up a hot pink blouse .
" Is this a dress ? " he asked .
" It 's a shirt , " Seifert said .
" I would n't wear a dress that short . "

How two soul mates found each other
The man had a handsome face , and dimples ; he wore his hair in a ponytail .
" If you 've got it , flaunt it , " he said with a smile .
Seifert was 34 years old with a Ph.D. degree , and it had been a long time since a man had even noticed her .
Her 60 - hour workweeks left neither time nor energy for taking care of herself .
She was overweight and overstressed .
She had n't been on a date in more than two years .
Friends had tried to fix her up , but when it came to flirting , she was " out of practice . "
And yet when the man asked for her phone number to include on the dry cleaning ticket , she blurted out : " So ?
Are you going to call me ? "
He looked confused but recovered quickly .
" Sure , " he said .
" I 'll do that . "
Oprah.com : How to find and keep your soul mate
Flustered but " flushed with the daring " of what she 'd said , Seifert drove off .
She figured the man would never call , but it was thrilling to have done something so out of character .
And then , around 7 o'clock that evening , the phone rang .
It was him .
He introduced himself -- his name was Zeke Montalvo -- and asked Seifert to go to the movies that night .
She said yes .
They had a good time .
It turned out that Montalvo was only 25 and had n't gone to college , but the two started dating .
Then they fell in love .
And six years after they met , on a cold Christmas Eve at a house by a lake , Montalvo proposed with an heirloom ring .
They were married the next month .
At the most unlikely time , in the least romantic place , Seifert met the man of her dreams .
It was a random event that changed her life forever .
A classic chance encounter .
Or was it ?
Prepare your mind for what your want
Seifert 's academic specialty is cognitive psychology , the science of why people think the way they do .
And to understand what really happened the day she met Montalvo , she says you need to start the day before her trip to the cleaners .
Oprah.com : A brief history of chance encounters
That afternoon , in her office , she had received a bouquet of flowers from the chair of the psychology department .
The note read , " Congratulations !
Your tenure has been approved . "
If someone else had been in the room , she might have hugged them , but she was alone , so she simply cried with relief .
After six years of single - minded obsession , her work had paid off .
To celebrate , she went for a drink with a colleague that night .
But even as she sat sipping her margarita , a feeling of anticlimax set in .
She wondered if the achievement had been worth the sacrifice .
When Seifert awoke the next morning , everything felt different , as though a weight had been lifted .
" I do n't have to go to work today , " she thought .
Drinking coffee in her breakfast nook , she asked herself : " Now what ?
How do I want my life to go ?
How do I make something good happen ? "
She told herself that her future started today , and that there had to be something better .
She promised herself that in 10 years , she was n't going to be alone like this .
From now on , she would celebrate important occasions with a crowd of friends , not just one colleague .
All of a sudden , she had new goals , and she recognized that she would need to take specific steps to reach them .
An introvert by nature , she decided to interact more with people .
She would shake their hands , look them in the eye , engage in livelier conversation .
For Seifert , these were n't just idle thoughts .
Through her research , she had come up with a concept she called " predictive encoding " -- the anticipation of when a particular piece of knowledge is going to be useful -- and it described exactly what she was doing as she sat at her kitchen table .
Research has shown that most people are n't very good at recalling information -- or intentions -- when they need to .
For instance , you know you want to meet someone and fall in love , but when you 're out and about interacting with people , you somehow manage to come home without having connected with anyone .
Though you know what you want , Seifert says , that knowledge does n't always come to mind at the right time to guide your behavior .
But if , when you 're thinking about what you want , you imagine the situations in which you 'll need to remember it , you 're more likely to succeed .
Preparing your mind for a certain behavior increases ( by as much as 50 percent ) the chance that you 'll pull that behavior off .
And that 's what Seifert was attempting : to prepare -- or encode into memory -- her plans to change her behavior in a way that might change her future .
By imagining a new role as a " people person , " she was giving herself a better chance of behaving like one whenever the opportunity arose .
Seifert is n't alone in believing that if you prepare yourself to make the most of chance encounters , good things are waiting to happen all around you .
Other experts agree that with a few simple steps , you can significantly increase the chances of meeting your soul mate , finding the right business partner , or steering your life in a new direction .
That might sound unlikely or even naive , but there 's real science to prove that while you can't control the randomness of life , you can definitely create your own luck .
Oprah.com :
How to create your own luck
Why do some people find love at the dry cleaner while others simply move on to the next errand ?
Why do some travelers make new business contacts on airplanes while others just hunker down to watch the in - flight movie ?
By definition , a chance encounter is a random event .
Our actions , however , play a crucial role in the outcome .
When we hear about people who manage to turn chance into opportunity , we think of them as lucky .
But that explanation may be too simple .
Shake hands , make 300 new friends
Richard Wiseman , Ph.D , has spent more than a decade investigating why some people have more luck than others .
A professor at the University of Hertfordshire in England , he holds Britain 's only professorship in the public understanding of psychology .
( That 's his actual title . )
His job is to study the ways in which psychological concepts become known to the general public , but he's also conducted international searches for the funniest joke and best pickup line .
A former magician , he has explored the role of chance in our lives and discovered that some people really do have all the luck while others are " magnets for ill fortune . "
Luck is usually defined as an unpredictable phenomenon that leads to good or bad outcomes .
But after years of experiments , Wiseman disagrees .
" Luck is not a magical ability or a gift from the gods , " he writes in " The Luck Factor , " his 2003 book about the essential principles of changing your fortune .
" Instead , it is a way of thinking and behaving . "
He insists that we have far more control over the element -- and outcome -- of chance in our lives than we realize .
" Lucky people create , notice , and act upon the chance opportunities in their lives , " Wiseman notes .
If luck means being in the right place at the right time , he adds , " being in the right place at the right time is actually all about being in the right state of mind . "
In psychological terms , lucky people tend to be more extroverted , a word whose Latin roots mean " turned outward . "
Typically , they 're gregarious .
They have the power to draw others toward them .
They 're adept at maintaining friendships .
And they cultivate what Wiseman describes as a " strong network of luck " that helps promote opportunity in their lives .
Ultimately , Wiseman believes , the bigger your circle of acquaintances , the more opportunities you have .
A typical person knows about 300 people on a first - name basis .
So if you go to a party and meet someone new , he explains , you 're " only two handshakes away from 300 times 300 people ; that 's 90,000 new possibilities for a new opportunity , just by saying hello . "
By the same logic , if you meet 50 new people at a conference , you 're just a couple of introductions away from 4.5 million opportunities to change your life .
But handshakes are n't the only way to increase the odds of a life - changing encounter .
Wiseman claims that 80 percent of the people who try to increase their serendipity are successful .
It takes only a month , he says , and most people report their luck increases by an average of 40 percent .
A few keys to success :
Prepare your mind .
Do n't leave chance encounters entirely to chance , says Colleen Seifert .
Instead , try doing a little predictive encoding and get your mind ready for good things to happen .
" Chance favors the prepared mind , " Seifert says , quoting Louis Pasteur .
If you lay the groundwork , then when something happens by chance , your memory goes right to work and " you notice it for free . "
Give chance a chance .
If you always pick apples in the same part of an orchard , Wiseman notes , you 'll eventually run out of fruit .
The same applies to luck .
Pursue an active life -- get out there and do things -- and you 'll increase the likelihood of good things happening .
Go apple picking -- or grocery shopping , for that matter -- somewhere new .
Eat your lunch on a different park bench .
You never know who will be sitting next to you .
Relax .
If you 're anxious , stressed , or preoccupied , Wiseman believes , you probably wo n't notice good things waiting to happen .
You 'll walk right past money on the ground or miss an opportunity to speak with someone in a coffee shop .
A laid - back attitude can lead to all sorts of possibilities , but you have to be ready to go with the flow .
Build your network of luck .
Stay connected to the people you know , and try to meet new people .
You can become more of a social magnet by paying attention to your body language .
It may sound obvious , but make smiling a habit .
" Remember that you are surrounded by opportunities , " Wiseman writes .
" It is just a case of looking in the right places and seeing what is really there . "
Oprah.com :
See how intertwined our lives really are
Colleen Seifert used to think it was " inefficient to invest in people you were never going to see again . "
Why chat with someone on an airplane -- or at the dog park , or at an academic conference -- if your paths were never going to recross ?
But she now believes that " people are opportunities .
The gift is in the interaction and the connection with another person , whether it lasts forever or not . "
And you never know where that gift might lead .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Countries that buy Chinese goods should be held responsible for the carbon dioxide emitted by the factories that make them in any global plan to reduce greenhouse gases , a Chinese official said on Monday .

Yu
“ About 15 percent to 25 percent of China ’s emissions come from the products which we make for the world , which should not be taken by us , ” said Gao Li , director of China ’s Department of Climate Change .
Speaking at a forum sponsored by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change , Gao added that “ this share of emission should be taken by the consumers , not the producers ” and called the demand a “ very important item to make ( for a ) fair agreement . ”
Gao gave no further details of his proposal , which could nevertheless be controversial as countries like the United States already fear that controlling domestic emissions will lead to sharply higher energy prices and possible job losses .
China , like the United States , did not join the 17 - year - old Kyoto Protocol aimed at reducing global emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants linked to climate change problems .
With an economy that has been booming on its export of manufactured goods , China ’s greenhouse gas emissions also have been growing and are now thought to be around par with those in the United States , which has been the leading emitting nation .
China is the top source of imports into the United States , followed by Canada and Mexico .
DECEMBER DEADLINE ?
Backers of a new international deal to control climate - warming emissions hope a pact is embraced in Copenhagen in December , although they acknowledge that timetable might be ambitious .
In the meantime , international interest in curbing climate change is growing , led by President Barack Obama ’s pledge to put the United States on a path to cut emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 , with an additional 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
Legislation to create a cap - and - trade system to limit businesses ’ emissions could begin moving through the U.S. Congress in coming months .
But enactment of such a bill might not be possible before the Copenhagen meeting .
If not , environmentalists worry it could discourage other countries from signing onto a deal there .
But even without a comprehensive agreement , Eileen Claussen , president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change , said negotiators could try to achieve a “ strong interim agreement ” that would set forth a framework , possibly including a range of targets for countries to reduce emissions .
Shinsuke Sugiyama , director general for global issues at Japan ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs , told the Pew forum that his government views 2009 as a “ make or break ” year in achieving progress on a new global deal .
But noting that the Kyoto Protocol has only covered about 30 percent of global emissions because key economies did not sign on , Sugiyama warned : “ My government is very much determined not to repeat what Kyodo does give us ... in the sense that we were not able to involve United States of America ... and other countries like China . ”
The curse of the 21st century is that we spend our time trying to succeed in everything at once – work , our significant relationship , family , exercise , friendships , keeping the perfect house , the perfect garden …
No matter how hard I try I never succeed at everything .
If I work hard I do n’t have time to walk my dog .
Go out with friends ?
I need to clean the house .
Create some art ?
It never happens .
Is this exhausting perfectionism really what is meant by a work - life balance ?
Can we really do it all ?
When I am busy at work I just do n’t have the head space or emotional energy to cope with doing anything else .
If I put more effort into my personal life I find being at work such a bore .
I want to be out doing all those fun things that matter to me personally , not being stuck at work .
Instead of neatly balanced , my work - life scales are swinging wildly .
One day I read over my journal entries for the past 6 months .
I was horrified to read that the first thing I wrote every single day was , “ I ’m tired ” .
I realized the toll that trying to do it all was having on me : I was exhausted , boring and definitely not succeeding at anything .
I decided there had to be a better way .
After some trial and error my scales have settled into more of a gentle sway .
1. Balance Your Month , Not Your Day
There really are n’t enough hours in the day for everything , but perhaps you can balance your work and life if you widen your timeframe .
Think about all the things that are important to you and how many hours you work each day .
Can you really do it all ?
If I took the work - life balance literally then I ’d have to call my sister and my Mum , go to lunch with my best friend , exercise , draw , sew , garden , walk my dog , spend quality time with my husband , work 7 hours , commute for 2 , cook and meditate all in one day .
No wonder I ’m tired !
It ’s simply not possible to do it all and I fail at everything if I try .
So now I try to achieve balance over a month and I try to be flexible .
Basically I cut myself some slack .
At times when work is really frantic I bump some items off my to do list and allow myself to spend the evenings relaxing , maybe read a little or soak in a bath .
When work eases off then I have the energy to go out , to create and give to others .
2. Make Conscious Choices
If you are going to take a longer - term view of balance you need to be consciously aware of what ’s happening in your life .
Accepting that work is frantic at the moment is great , as long as you notice when you can ease off .
Working long hours can be seductive and you can easily fall into a pattern of always being busy and never taking time for your life .
I used to work through lunch every day and take work home every weekend because I felt I had to .
Now I ’ll occasionally put in extra hours but only when I choose to .
If I know putting in more time at work this week will reward me with a better personal life next week , then I ’ll do it .
It ’s a conscious choice and my eye ’s firmly on the prize : more quality time for me away from work .
Take a few minutes to make a list of what ’s most important to you .
This will help you decide what can wait and what can’t .
Dividing your goals into long and short term can really help too .
I want to defrost my freezer , but work ’s frantic and I ’d rather wind down by going for a walk with my husband and dog .
Most importantly though be kind to yourself and balance what ’s best for you today and tomorrow .
Then you really can have it all .
How do you balance your work and your life ?

A study by researchers at Aberdeen University of 17,000 births found that there was no medical explanation for over 28 % of the induced labors .
[ social_buttons ]
“ We were slightly surprised that it was as high as it was .
It raises the question that there may be some unnecessary interventions and we are planning further studies . ”
- Tracy Humphrey , consultant midwife at Grampian NHS Board .
Of the 17,000 births studied , the researchers found that 32 % of the women had been induced , and 28 % of those inductions had no good reason , medical or otherwise , for performing the procedure .
The study , published in the Journal of Public Health , said that rates of obstetric interventions were rising , and that more research was needed to find out if the inductions were done with good reason .
“ Further research is needed to identify the circumstances of induced labour where there are not good clinical reasons .
If women are asking for induction because they are tired at the end of pregnancy , they may need more support , and encouragement to rest as much as possible , so that they can wait a bit longer . ” – Mary Newburn , National Childbirth Trust
While the majority of the induced labors were for specific conditions ( water breaking before labor , prolonged pregnancy , complications requiring a timed birth ) , the rate of unexplained inductions has some in the birth and labor field concerned .
“ It raises the question that there may be some unnecessary interventions and we are planning further studies .
The main debate about unnecessary interventions has focused on cesareans and we have forgotten about the other interventions that go on . ” – Humphrey
One of our children was induced a month early because of pre-eclampsia , but I know of several other mothers that had an induced labor offered to them because the labor was n’t progressing fast enough for the doctor .
Not being a doctor myself , I do n’t know if inducing those births were necessary , but after reading about this study , it sure does make me wonder …

WASHINGTON - Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona is hosting a film screening at the Capitol on Thursday for a far - right Dutch lawmaker who claims that Islam inspires terrorism .
Kyl is sponsoring the event for Geert Wilders , who was denied entry to London earlier this month because British officials said he posed a threat to public order .
Wilders ' 15 - minute film juxtaposes verses from the Quran with images of violence by Muslims .
Wilders has called the Quran a " fascist book " and said it should be banned .
Kyl agreed to facilitate the event because " all too often , people who have the courage to point out the dangers of militant Islamists find themselves vilified and endangered , " said spokesman Ryan Patmintra .
Thursday 's event was being sponsored by the International Free Press Society , headed by Danish activist Lars Hedegaard , and the Center for Security Policy , a think tank in Washington led by Republican Frank Gaffney .
The event is closed to the public and the media , but the film is being shown to members of Congress and their staff in the ornate " LBJ room , " a Senate office once used by Lyndon B. Johnson as majority leader and later vice president .
Wilders ' film has sparked protests around the world , and it has inspired a debate on freedom of speech .
Wilders had been invited to Britain by a member of Parliament 's upper house , the House of Lords , to show his film .
But the British government refused his entry into the country , saying he posed a threat to " community harmony . "
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband told the British Broadcasting Corp. that Wilders was guilty of " extreme anti-Muslim hate . "
He said , " There is no freedom to stir up racial and religious hatred . "
Hedegaard , who helped sponsor Wilders ' visit to the Capitol , said Europe 's hate speech and blasphemy laws make no sense .
" The way to deal with controversial , offensive or even hateful statements - unless they are directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action - is to expose them to public debate and criticism , " Hedegaard said in a statement advertising Thursday 's event .
While it is unusual for U.S. lawmakers to grant Capitol access to such a controversial figure , it was unlikely Wilders ' appearance would produce the same outcry as it did in Britain .
Several leading senators , including Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , declined to comment .

In a FOXNews.com story on a Dutch television jury ’s verdict of not guilty regarding Osama bin Laden ’s alleged involvement in the attacks of September 11 2001 , former mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani expresses outrage over the verdict .
Lamenting the fact that television programs are free to air doubt , Rudy Giuliani obviously prefers that the media would do nothing but spout the official version of 911 .
As the Hollywood Reporter reported on April 9 , a television jury in the Netherlands has ‘ ruled there was no proof Bin Laden was the mastermind behind the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001 . ’
In the television program defense attorney Gerard Spong casts doubt on Bin Laden ’s involvement in the planning of the attacks .
After a short deliberation , the jury came out and acknowledged there is no real evidence linking the supposed Al - Qaida mastermind to the tragic events of September 11 .
Spong ’s main argument in his sharp and clever plea is the extreme doubtfulness of the ‘ admission ’ given by someone who vaguely resembles the bearded boogieman .
‘ It ’s such a bizarre and irrational ruling ’ , Giuliani said , ‘ that I do n’t think it ’ll have any weight with anyone , other than to fuel conspiracy theories .
The clear damage it does is that it gives people who want to seize on irrational theories something else to talk about . ’
By casting doubt on the Bin Laden tapes as well as pointing to the fact that 911 is not mentioned in Bin Laden ’s rap sheet on the FBI ’s most wanted list , Spong apparently forces the former mayor of New York further in the defensive .
Giuliani tells FOXNews.com :
‘ The message is a very disturbing one .
It ’s a very irrational decision based on all the evidence that ’s been amassed by the 9/11 Commission that has concluded ( Bin Laden ) was the instigator and mastermind of the attacks .
It ’s contradictory to all those factual findings . ’
[ efoods ]
It has of course been exhaustively reported that the 9/11 Commission report is heavy with errors and conflicts of interest - not to mention in regards to Giuliani ’s own role on that fateful day , which is still shrouded in mystery .
According to the Fox News website , Giuliani remarked that ‘it ’s unfortunate that television programs like ‘ Devil ’s Advocate ’ are free to float irrational arguments about who was behind the terror attacks . ’
Lamenting the fact that television programs are free to air doubt , he obviously prefers that the media would do nothing but spout the official version of 911 .

The University of Cincinnati has long been known for its world - record - breaking carbon nanotubes .
Now researchers at the University of Cincinnati have discovered new uses by spinning carbon nanotubes ( CNTs ) into longer fibers with additional useful properties .
Breakthroughs Without Broken Threads
Taking technology that has already been proven to grow carbon nanotubes of world - record breaking lengths , researchers Vesselin Shanov and Mark Schulz in the UC College of Engineering NanoWorld Lab have now found new applications by spinning these fibers into strong threads .
David Mast , from UC ’s McMicken College of Arts and Sciences , saw possibilities in the threads .
Mast , an associate professor of physics , took a 25 - micron carbon nanotube thread and created a dipole antenna using double - sided transparent tape and silver paste .
He was immediately successful in transmitting radio signals .
“ It transmitted almost as well as the copper did , but at about one ten - thousandth of the weight , ” says Mast .
Mast was able to transmit both AM and FM in his lab , broadcasting a local NPR station .

“ Then I decided to dismantle my cell phone , ” says Mast .
He created a cell phone antenna , using CNT thread and tape .
Ripping the back off his own cell phone , he tore out the phone ’s original antenna and replaced it with his home - made one .
With the “ nano - antenna ” or " nantenna , " he was able to get four to five “ bars ” of service , compared to none when he removed it .
“ That was a very pleasant surprise , how easy it was to do , ” Mast says .
“ The hardest thing is to manipulate them .
They float on ambient air . ”
From there it was an easy leap to video , in which he was again successful .
“ I want to now set up a wireless webcam for the lab using these thread antennas so that others can see how well they work . ”
Mast says that the key to the new applications is the quality of the material that Schulz and Shanov came up with using multi-wall carbon nanotubes .
“ They spin thread that is of such high quality , it opens the door to incredible possibilities , ” says Mast .
“ This is just one of many potential applications . ”
Schulz explains that the carbon nanotube threads work well as an antenna because of something called the “ skin effect . ”
advertisement
“ The electrons transfer well because they want to go to the surface , ” he says .
“ Instead of traveling through a bulk mass , they are traveling across a skin . ”
“ Copper wire is a bulk material , ” Shanov points out .
“ With carbon nanotubes , all the atoms are on the surface of these carbon structures and the tubes themselves are hollow , so the CNT thread is small and light . ”
“ Carbon thread that is a fraction of the weight of current copper conductors and antennas could directly apply and would be significant to aerospace activities — commercial , military and space , ” he adds .
“ On any aircraft , there are about several hundred pounds of copper as cables and wiring . ”
Mast points out that the threads have what he calls an “ immensely high tensile strength — perhaps five times that of steel and yet they are less dense than steel . ”
Now that the team has shown the feasibility of such applications , the next steps will be to work on improvements ( such as making yarn out of several threads ) and to find industries that will commercialize CNT thread .
Mast 's next step was going to be to buy a new cell phone .
However , he says , " it works so well now that I decided to just upgrade to a new antenna made of carbon nanotube yarn . "
This research was funded by the National Science Foundation ( with technical monitors Shaochen Chen , Shih - Chi Liu , and K. Jimmy Hsia ) , and North Carolina A&T SU ( collaborators Jag Sankar and Sergey Yarmolenko ) through their NSF - ERC ( technical monitor Lynn Preston ) and ONR - CNN ( technical monitor Ignacio Perez ) projects .
Strange thing , and you might not believe me , but chewing gum ads seem to be as rare as aliens in the White House .

The London daily Al - Sharq Al - Awsat recently published an article by liberal Syrian philosopher Hashem Saleh , who resides in Paris , titled " Towards an Arab - Jewish Conciliation . "
In it , Saleh argues that the time is has come for the Arabs to make peace with Israel and to focus on developing their own countries , and that the Palestinian problem will resolve itself via the natural Palestinian demographic superiority over the Israelis .
Following are excerpts : [ 1 ]
I Want the Gaza War to Be the Last War
" This surprising heading will cause a big fuss .
People will say , ' The blood [ spilled ] in Gaza has barely dried , yet he is already calling for defeat and conciliation with the enemy ! '
Nonetheless , after pondering and deliberating the matter for a long time , I am determined to defend this option .
" I confess that I was surprised at my own conclusion .
I did not expect to reach this conclusion after many years of exploring every aspect of this dilemma .
I spent many an hour in seclusion , reading extensively about this infernal conflict , until I was able to arrive at my [ current ] position .
" As the matter stands , I firmly believe that it would be absurd and meaningless to continue this conflict , because it stifles our revival and our freedom .
It has become a useless burden .
It has become a total waste of time , effort , money , and human lives .
" I want the Gaza war to be the last war .
Let us start a fresh new era in the region , and use all the [ heretofore ] wasted energy and missed opportunities towards construction and development instead of destruction and devastation .
Let us invest [ our energy ] in building schools , universities , hospitals , and children 's playgrounds .
" In order for the Arab cultural enterprise to truly get underway , we cannot continue postponing it indefinitely under the pretext of liberating Palestine .
Let us first of all liberate the Arab thought , and Palestine 's liberation will follow of its own accord .
" I admit that , [ for me , ] the straw was reading the latest book by Palestinian thinker Sari Nusseibeh , recently published in English and French under the title Once Upon a Country : A Palestinian Life . [ 2 ]
It is this book that prompted me to adopt my current position , which is bound to create problems and draw me into arguments with Arab demagogues who are filling TV programs and newspapers with their screeches and yelps … "
The Victory Over Israel Will be Achieved by a Different Tactic : Through Demography
" We take a completely wrong course when we keep locking horns with the Jews , cracking our own skulls along with theirs , to no avail whatsoever .
[ The Jews ] have a long history , which is unique and replete with suffering .
Let us try a different way of managing this conflict , instead of sticking to the same outdated and wretched stratagem .
" I am positive that we can win this battle without firing a single shot .
[ We can do this ] by employing a different tactic - [ namely , ] through [ our ] birthrate and demographics .
The Palestinians will overwhelm the Israelis and influence them [ through their sheer number ] .
" Enough of wars and pointless confrontations !
We have suffered enough [ wars ] and are tired of them .
The Israelis , who intimidate us with their airplanes , missiles , and state - of - the - art military technology , are actually afraid of us .
Their entire existence is founded upon ghettos , persecution , and unending slaughter , which has not ceased throughout [ their ] entire history .
This is the [ correct ] psychological analysis of the Arab - Israeli conflict .
" Victory over Israel will surely come , and I contend that it will come of itself .
How will this happen ?
First of all , though victory over ourselves , through a successful implementation of the Arab cultural enterprise , and through acquiring knowledge and technological [ know - how ] .
" Look at China and what it has achieved .
Do n't you think that the Chinese would like to take revenge on the West , which has been humiliating China from the time of the Anglo - Chinese opium wars in the 19th century ?
Though the British once humiliated the Chinese in their own homeland , the contemporary Chinese are not sacrificing their lives to provoke the British .
[ Instead , ] they are waiting until their economic , technological , and cultural enterprise is completed before standing up to America and taking revenge on Japan .
They do not act [ prematurely ] , since [ they know ] it is necessary to prepare the ground .
" This is the logical way to proceed .
It is the [ kind of ] political reasoning that the fundamentalist or mystical mentality ... is unfortunately unable to grasp .
[ It is this mentality that ] has brought destruction upon us , twice within a span of two years - once [ in the 2006 war between Israel and ]
Hizbullah , and the second time [ in the 2009 war between Israel and ] Hamas . "
" The Future Belongs … to People of Good Intentions and Enlightened Minds , OnBoth Sides - Palestinians and Israelis "
" What is the use of all these wars , which bring no change ?
Unfortunately , they cause a lot of damage .
They destroy our infrastructures , throw us back dozens of years , and bring pain and suffering upon our families , wives and children , taking us back to square one , or even [ to square zero ] …
" The future belongs neither to Hamas , nor to [ Al - Qaeda leaders ] Zawahiri and bin Laden , nor yet to the Israeli extreme right , which has lost its mind .
It belongs to people of good intentions and enlightened minds on both sides - Palestinians and Israelis , Arabs and Jews .
These people are many , though they are frightened and [ therefore keep ] quiet . "

President Obama joined yesterday in the clamor of outrage at AIG for paying some $ 165 million in contractually obligated employee bonuses .
He and the rest of the political class thus neatly deflected attention from the larger outrage , which is the five - month Beltway cover - up over who benefited most from the AIG bailout .
Taxpayers have already put up $ 173 billion , or more than a thousand times the amount of those bonuses , to fund the government 's AIG " rescue . "

We all know the importance of drinking clean pure water but how many of you know that bathing in chlorine water can actually be WORSE than drinking it ?
If you plan to , or have already taken action to effectively filter your drinking water from chlorine and other hazardous chemicals , I commend you for a very smart , healthy decision .
It 's an excellent start to protect yourself and your family by providing clean drinking water … as well as safe water for cooking and washing produce .
However , there 's a much greater source of water toxin exposure that you face every day … which could be as much as 10 to 20 times greater than the water you drink .
The issue with chlorine is not just the way it smells or dries out your hair or skin , but what it produces in your water supply when it combines with organic matter .
When chlorine interacts with this organic matter , disinfection byproducts ( DBPs ) form .
And these DBPs are far more toxic than the chlorine itself .
In fact , DBPs are responsible for the vast majority of the toxic effects of chlorinated water .
As it turns out , estimates range as high as 1,000 times … the toxicity of DBPs compared to the actual chlorine .
So , that 's why I feel closer attention needs to be paid to the DBPs found in your water .
Why are DBPs so dangerous ?
Some of the most common disinfection byproducts that form from the reaction of chlorine and organic matter are trihalomethanes ( THMs ) .
THMs are classified as Group B carcinogens .
I 'll have more details on THMs coming up and how to avoid them , but first you should understand …
Why Filtering Your Drinking Water Is NOT Enough
For many years , researchers believed " exposure " to disinfection byproducts came only when chlorine was swallowed .
But studies now show how drinking the water is not the only risk .
And is likely not even the most severe .
Here 's some startling information about the dangers of chlorine exposure beyond your drinking water …
On average , you drink about 1 to 2 gallons of water per day … but you expose yourself to 25 gallons of water when you shower .
As concluded by the American Journal of Public Health … up to two - thirds of harmful chlorine exposure can be due to skin absorption and inhalation while showering .
The steam inhaled during a shower can contain up to 20 times the concentration of chlorine ( and other synthetic chemicals ) as tap water .
You can easily absorb as many toxins in 1 shower as you would drinking tap water for an entire week .
Studies show that after a 10 - minute shower in chlorinated water , your blood levels of THMs ( common disinfection byproduct – DBP ) can potentially increase by as much as a staggering 700 % .
The bottom line … chlorine and its byproducts are the unseen danger lurking in almost every shower .
And your health risks can far exceed those of simply drinking tap water .
Now you know why I 'm making it clear that filtering only your drinking water is not enough .
That hot steamy shower you love so much and find soothing and relaxing , well , it 's potentially filled with vaporized gasses that could harm you and your family .
So , what can you do to avoid all this ?
I 'll get to that coming up , but first let me get into a few more details on why chlorine , DBPs , and other chemicals found in your shower can get into your system so easily .
How Contaminants Invade Your Body When You Shower
You 've just learned , and maybe for the first time , how your exposure to chlorine and its associated DBPs can be very high when you shower .
But why does n't the chlorinated water just bounce off your body and go down the drain ?
The problem is … a hot steamy shower …
Triggers your skin pores to open , which in turn …
your skin pores to open , which in turn …
Spikes a high absorption rate of chlorine and other chemicals directly into your system and …
a high absorption rate of chlorine and other chemicals directly into your system and …
Helps create a " free pass " of foreign chemicals into your body fluids and bloodstream – unlike drinking tap water where your digestive processes at least get a chance to filter out some of the harmful contaminants .
The other issue most people do n't think about in that hot , steamy shower they enjoy so much … is inhalation .
Your shower is a hotbed for dangerous chemical vapors as they …
Quickly form in the hot , steamy environment – 70 % to 90 % of the chemicals in your shower water vaporize before the water ever hits the shower floor
Get inhaled in high concentrations into your lungs and absorbed through your skin , and can go directly into your bloodstream
Have a magnified effect compared to chemicals you might swallow from tap water because there 's nothing to filter them out
So , this is the unfortunate reality on how chlorine and other potentially harmful chemicals in your shower water can easily end up in your body
But what are the possible consequences of absorbing and inhaling chlorine and other chemicals into your body ?
Potential Health Risks From Unprotected Showers
Simply put … absorbing and inhaling too much chlorine and associated DBPs are not healthy for you or your family .
Long - term health risks certainly can spike due to chlorine effects on your bodily functions .
Cases in point …
American Journal of Public Health – Linked chlorine absorption and inhalation exposure to increased skin irritation risks .
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) –
When chlorine vaporizes in steam in your shower , it converts to chloroform gas .
Chloroform can be a strong respiratory irritant and cause fatigue .
The bottom line – When absorbed or inhaled into your body , chlorine DBPs can potentially cause … weakening of your immune system … disruptions to your central nervous system … damaging effects to your cardio system … unhealthy functioning of your renal system … and harmful impacts to your respiratory system .
These are just a few of the potential risks you face when showering in chlorine water .
Many studies have also been done that point to the dangerous chlorine vapors found in indoor swimming pools .
A European study conducted by the Department of Public Health in Brussels , Belgium , found that even outdoor swimming pool exposure to chlorinated water could be detrimental to your health .
Any doubt as to the risks of absorbing and inhaling chlorine and its associated DBPs ?
But what can you do to avoid all this in your shower ?
I 'll get to that shortly , but first there 's another downside to showering in hot , steamy chlorinated water …
How Chlorine Can Wreak Havoc With Your Hair
Hair color and dye are often among the few cosmetics even " natural - minded " people justify using .
Many people , and not just women , want to cover up what they consider unsightly gray hair .
Well , showering in water with chlorine concentrations can potentially impact the longevity of your hair dye .
How ?
Chlorine strips the natural protective oils from your skin and hair … causing excess drying .
This in turn breaks down the dye .
If you 've been a visitor to my site over the years , you might already know how I feel about the risks of hair dye .
Your scalp has a very rich blood supply capable of transporting dye toxins throughout your body .
So , if you must use it , coloring your hair less often is better than doing it more on a regular basis .
But by showering in steamy chlorinated water , the chances of having to dye your hair more often increases due to the effects of the chlorine .
So , enough already …
Let 's start to look at what steps you can take to make your shower a safer place for both you and your family .
After all , everyone has to shower or bathe to stay clean and refreshed .
How to Minimize Your Exposure to Steamy Shower Contaminants
First of all , your local municipal water supply company is obligated by law to provide you a breakdown of what 's in your water .
It 's extremely likely it contains chlorine and DBPs .
I strongly recommend you request a quality report from your local water purveyor at least once a year ( if you 're not already receiving one ) .
Many companies make the information available online .
If not , contact them directly to find out how you can get a report and what 's in the water you use .
I strongly recommend you do this just to see what you 're up against and to become more informed on water safety .
Here are some simple steps I recommend you take to minimize your exposure to chlorine and DBPs in your shower :
Limit the amount of time you spend in your shower –
The longer you shower the more your exposure to toxins increases .
It 's estimated that doubling your shower time quadruples the amount of vaporized chemical gases you 're exposed to .
– The longer you shower the more your exposure to toxins increases .
It 's estimated that doubling your shower time quadruples the amount of vaporized chemical gases you 're exposed to .
Bath in well water if possible .
Unfortunately , this is not possible for most but if you are fortunate enough to have a well with clean water most of your toxic bathing contaminant concerns are eliminated .

Lower the temperature of your shower water – Hot water opens up the pores of your skin allowing a higher absorption rate of chlorine , DBPs , and other chemicals .
Plus , the steam produced can contain high concentrations of vaporized gasses you can inhale .

Use lower water pressure .
This will decrease the amount of water coming in and contaminants coming out of the fixture .
Additionally , if you have a shower filter , it will also increase the contact time with the media and allow more contaminants to be removed .

Get serious about shower water safety by acknowledging the risks associated with showering in chlorinated water – Consider obtaining a high - quality filtration system for your shower .
To me , that last step could be the most important in protecting yourself and your family from shower water contaminants .
The real challenge is finding a high - quality system that filters out chlorine , DBPs , and other chemicals , as well as is practical and affordable .
Well , my team and I have found such a system and I 'll introduce it to you coming up .
But next , let 's get into some of the details on how we arrived at my recommendation .
We Have the Technology …
Remember 10 to 20 years ago no one really knew very much about the negative effects of chlorine and DBPs .
Back then , most people were just content to have water to drink without any major risks of waterborne diseases .
Well , things have obviously evolved to where these are now more of a concern .
And I do n’t believe municipal water suppliers will change their chlorination policies until a better solution comes along .
So , the very best you can do is to find ways to limit the toxic chemicals , DBPs , and VOCs ( volatile organic compounds ) you 're exposed to .
And the amazing thing is the technology has evolved to provide effective and practical filtering solutions for your shower .
The best way to show you how we arrived at our recommendation is to let you in on the checklist we created … and this goes beyond just the filtration technology .
Why a checklist ?
Well , quite frankly , there are hundreds , if not thousands , of shower filter choices available in the marketplace … many of them technologically advanced .
And they all make filtering claims in one way or another .
So , we needed a way to " filter " out the systems that either did n’t solve the contaminant issues , or simply were not practical to install and maintain in your shower .
My Demanding 10 - Point Selection Checklist … Could We Be Asking Too Much ?
Here 's the selection checklist my team and I used to help us search for the best of the best shower filters .
To be considered for regular use , the shower filtration system must :
Filter out a high majority of chlorine – After all our discussion up to this point , this has to be a top priority in a filter .
At least 90 % of chlorine or greater needs to be removed .
Filter out the vast majority of chlorine DBPs , in particular trihalomethanes ( THMs ) –
As you 've already learned , these disinfection byproducts can be more hazardous to your health than chlorine itself .
Reduce other VOCs ( volatile organic compounds ) – VOCs are contaminants that DBPs are part of .
Examples are byproducts produced by paints , pharmaceuticals , and petroleum fuels .
Reduce heavy metals – Metals like lead and copper need to be significantly reduced as they can be absorbed into your skin during a steamy shower .
Employ a multi-stage filtering system – With today 's technology , a single stage filtering system wo n't cut it anymore .
A system where multiple filtration media go to work is best .
Provide smooth water flow – Your filtering system needs to be designed so it does not clog and water pressure is not compromised .
At the same time , the shower head needs to provide a low flow - rate of 2.5 gpm ( gallons per minute ) to conserve water and energy .
Deliver a system that 's easy to install –
If it takes more than 10 minutes to install with special tools , then it will not even be considered by my team .
The unit must be small enough to fit the vast majority of shower heads and the filtration shower head must be kept at the same height as the existing one .
Look attractive and be practical to maintain –
The filtration system must be appealing and not an eyesore in your shower .
Replacing the filter should be quick and easy , and not required more often than every 6 months .
Note :
It is suggested that people who live in coastal areas replace their filters at shorter intervals ( every two to three months ) due to potentially higher sediment influx and water quality .
Be reasonably priced – System has to be priced so it 's practical to own and can be installed in various shower configurations in your home .
Show proof of the manufacturer 's commitment to quality –
This is at the bottom of the list , but should be considered a top priority .
The filtration system is only as good as the manufacturer backing it .
High scrutiny needs to be given to quality measures , and warranty / guarantees .
So , let 's jump right into the remarkable shower filtration system my team found .
I can assure you it was a very lengthy process finding a filtration system meeting this stringent checklist .
But my team finally uncovered a system that meets , and in many areas exceeds , the selection criteria .
I 'm sure you 'll agree … it was well worth waiting for .
How the Winning Selection Stacks Up
Here 's a handy chart that not only shows how the shower filter I now recommend meets all the selection criteria with flying colors , but also shows you where other systems might come up short .
Here 's how the Pure & Clear Shower Filter stacks up …
Selection criteria : Pure & Clear Shower Filter Other manufacturers

Attractive and practical to maintain ?
YES –
The shower filter comes in an attractive high - gloss finish .
Filter replacement is very practical at every 6 months .
Note :
It is suggested that people who live in coastal areas replace their filters at shorter intervals ( every two to three months ) due to potentially higher sediment influx and water quality .
Many units are attractive , but some are not mainly due to their size .
Filter replacement requirements can be as frequent as 3 months on some systems and as less - frequent as 12 months on others ( but cost of filter replacement is high ) .
Reasonably priced ?
YES – The Pure & Clear Shower Filter is priced at under $ 100 and the cost of ownership quite reasonable .
Few systems meet all of my selection criteria and the less than $ 100 price requirement .
Some comparable systems can retail as high as $ 249 .
So , this comparison chart should give you a better picture why I recommend the Pure & Clear Shower Filter for you and your family .
Plus , there are some areas where the Pure & Clear Shower Filter completely " blew the doors off " the selection criteria and justifies a bit more detail …
How This Filtration System Performs so Well
The attractive Pure & Clear Shower Filter with its 2 - stage patented filtration process
Another area I feel requires more attention and detail is how the Pure & Clear Shower Filter performs … how the 2 - stage patented process really stands out .
Remember how one of my selection criteria was that the filtration system needed to employ a multi-stage filtration process ?
Well , it 's the unique way this filtration process is designed that not only satisfies this requirement , but many more as well .
Let me explain further .
The Pure & Clear Shower Filter multi-stage filtration process works as follows …
Stage 1 – Removes chlorine and enhances pH balance with a natural copper / zinc mineral media called KDF - 55D
– Removes chlorine and enhances pH balance with a natural copper / zinc mineral media called KDF - 55D Stage 2 – Uses a carbonized coconut shell medium to reduce synthetic chemicals , THMs ( DBPs ) , and VOCs that vaporize from your shower water .
The patented " upflow " design of the filtration system maintains water pressure and prevents clogging .
Plus , the unique and patented " upflow " design of the 2 - stage filtration system helps maintain water pressure and prevents the unit from clogging .
The shower water goes down through the filter cartridge and then back up .
Contaminants settle out and wo n’t clog the unit , or require the unit to be flushed to continue the flow .
Your filter only requires replacement every 6 months ( It is suggested that people who live in coastal areas replace their filters at shorter intervals [ every two - three months ] due to potentially higher sediment influx and water quality . ) and the extraordinary design of the Pure & Clear Shower Filter allows you to maintain your current shower head height ( while some units out there require lowering the shower head height by inches ) .
Plus , I will be offering a massaging handheld wand unit as an option .
More details coming up on that soon .

It is a well known fact that when Columbus discovered America , he made the unwitting mistake of letting all the Indians escape from the flight deck of the Mayflower and that it was these escaped Indians that wiped out both the mastodons and several helpless strains of small pox .
If it was n’t for these so called “ red men ” , the great nation in which this paper is currently being written might still have been rich with pox-riddled mastodons and wild disease blankets made fat and delicious from overfeeding .
But , times such as these are long past now , and as my own Grandfather once so elegantly put it– rent a dollar , and get back a hat .
Yes , rent a dollar and get back a hat .
Few statements have had more truth or validity for the common man or the atomic scientist than this lowly combination of seemingly mismatched words .
Attributed to King Ogelvie of Diddlezwhisterificnecrolatinsquashtinstaff ( a barbarian ninja priest warrior monk prince of the third dynasty ) , these words predate text messaging by several months , ( perhaps more ) and have been carbon - dated to a period that perhaps even predates the entire network of large trucks and tubes that we know as the conglomerate entity of the internets today .
How this could possibly be true , only the annals of science in their grand vowel movements may say .
I for one , am not convinced .
My own research indicates that these words are merely three centuries of age , and were perhaps among the “ high fallutin ” terms spoken in the House of Commons as part of the legal proceedings for an insolent drunk .
According to news sources , the Russian army has sort of redefined the concept of security .
At least on the surface it now looks like super modern technology and powerful weapons will be making way for dummies , decoys , inflatable tanks , planes and rocket launchers !
Their function is a more mature kind of detente ; to distract attention and protect real combat units from strikes .
It is odd indeed that even from a distance of only 100 meters ( 328 feet ) , there ’s no telling the difference between fake military hardware and the real thing .
Perhaps it can fool the eye because all the equipment is fitted out to natural size and scale .
Not only that , this military hardware has already been effectively ( albeit quietly ) used for the purpose of protecting Russian strategic installations from surveillance satellites .
Russian balloon - maker Rusbal , is a Research and Development enterprise located near Moscow .
Their designers came up with the idea to inflate tanks like air balloons and they are responsible for exporting many fake weapons and armaments to other countries .
The weaponry looks just like the real thing and it actually comes ready to inflate .
Russia ’s defense minister had placed his own order for a supply of full - scale inflatable weapon models , including the S - 300 long range surface - to - air missile systems and inflatable models of tanks and airplanes , including the Su - 27 ( Flanker ) fighter jet .
One news source claims the Russian army has been purchasing military dummies for the last three years .
The problem with these earlier models was that that they were initially constructed of plywood , rubber or plastic .
They were not only heavy but also unnatural looking .
Now that ’s all changed .
In the words of Aleksandr Talanov , the plant ’s Director General :
“ They can reproduce a radar band , a thermal and near infra-red band similar to those produced by night vision instruments .
All these makeshift models appear as real hardware on all these instruments .
Incredibly , the dummies actually radiate warmth , giving the distinct impression that engines are being warmed up and repelling the radio waves of enemy radars as if they were real combat vehicles .
To foster the illusion , a launcher , for example , when photographed from the air or outer space can actually assume combat or traveling positions .
Inflating a tank requires four minutes to set up on a battlefield ; a launcher needs five .
According to Yury Stepanov , Rusbal ’s laboratory chief :
“ In a real district , a tank ’s tower can be fixed more to the left or more to the right , so we show all these positions .
There can also be additional fuel tanks .
The real vehicles have them . ”
Rusbal has increased production on full - scale inflatable weapons and armaments that are designed specifically to deceive passing satellites and spy planes about the country 's real military strength .
The company head , Aleksandr Talanov , has stated publicly that Rusbal plans to take the illusion of military might even further with the creation of models not only equipped with radar but also armed with radio - technical bands to enable them to imitate radio traffic and the appearance of working radar aids !
But the illusion needs one more thing to make the bogus equipment look real to spy satellites and reconnaissance planes ; soldiers .
Yes , a group of soldiers need to be deployed to allegedly service this equipment .
They can be made to mount guards , carry out repairs and engage in training .
This is one aspect of maintaining the illusion that Rusbal admits may not be feasable .
Russia is not the first country to think of this idea , no matter how wild it may sound .
Dummies have been used throughout world history as part of military deception .
During World War II a mission called “ Fortitude South ” used inflatable rubber armaments to create the illusion of a large invasion force being amassed in Kent , leading Germany to concentrate their forces in Pas - de - Calais rather than Normandy .
In that same conflict , British magician , Jasper Maskylne , is reported to have created dummy submarines and fake tanks to distract Rommel 's army .
More recently , during the first Gulf War , Saddam deployed phony jets and Scuds for the sole purpose of misleading allied pilots on bombing raids .
So we can conclude that nothing about war is really new except for maybe one thing .
If the illusion of fake weapons can be carried to include fake soldiers , why not carry the whole mirage even further by declaring and waging “ fake wars ? ”
Then no one will get hurt or need any weapons and everyone can go home and watch the evening news in a sort of peace !

After years of relying on “ take it or leave it ” technology that often failed to match their ambitions , business schools wishing to create virtual worlds or campuses for their students are taking matters into their own hands .
“ If you want a learning experience with plenty of group work , that is dynamic and engaging , then even some of the newer tools such as Google Hangouts do n’t provide the flexibility and agility of this environment , nor a sense of the nebulous concept of ‘ presence ’ , ”
“ We were very guarded initially in case the virtual participants interfered with the learning experience of those attending in person , ” says Dr Hirst .
“ But virtual and live participants , and faculty , all said this looks really interesting , and the virtual participants engaged in a very significant way . ”

RADAR ALERT :
Valerie Jarrett Unveiled : Tell the White House the Truth During a recent interview on NPR's Morning Edition , Valerie Jarrett , the head of the newly - created White House Council on Women and Girls , remarked , " Domestic violence is still a major issue , not just for women but also for girls , " and stated that in regard to the prevention of violence against women , the first thing the council would do is " take a look at all of the federal agencies and inventory everything [ they ] are currently doing ...[ they ] are not leveraging the federal dollars as well as [ they ] could ... and [ they ] could really do more to enhance the lives of women and girls . "
While on the surface Ms. Jarrett 's stated objective for the Council seems sincere and business - like , conspicuously absent was the plight of male victims of domestic violence as well as the need to maintain integrity in the nation 's fight to prevent domestic violence , which is compromised by the ever - present weapon of false allegations that lead to the destruction of families .
Ms. Jarrett 's comments intimate that the dynamics that are wrong with VAWA at present will not only be ignored , but will actually be worsened .
Please share with the White House your concerns about Ms. Jarrett by filling in this form : http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/opl
As always , be polite .

Jindal aides clarify Katrina story
A spokeswoman for Bobby Jindal says the Louisiana governor did n't imply that an anecdote about battling bureaucrats during Katrina directly involved the governor or took place during the heat of a fight to release rescue boats .
The spokeswoman , Melissa Sellers , said the story Jindal told in his response to Obama actually took place some days later in Lee 's office -- though still in Katrina 's chaotic aftermath -- as Lee was " recounting " his frustrations with the bureaucracy to someone else on the telephone .
Liberal critics have raised questions about the story , which Jindal told this way :
During Katrina , I visited Sheriff Harry Lee , a Democrat and a good friend of mine .
When I walked into his makeshift office I 'd never seen him so angry .
He was yelling into the phone : ' Well , I 'm the Sheriff and if you do n't like it you can come and arrest me ! '
I asked him : ' Sheriff , what 's got you so mad ? '
He told me that he had put out a call for volunteers to come with their boats to rescue people who were trapped on their rooftops by the floodwaters .
The boats were all lined up ready to go - when some bureaucrat showed up and told them they could n't go out on the water unless they had proof of insurance and registration .
I told him , ' Sheriff , that 's ridiculous . '
And before I knew it , he was yelling into the phone : ' Congressman Jindal is here , and he says you can come and arrest him too ! '
Harry just told the boaters to ignore the bureaucrats and start rescuing people .
" It was days later , " Sellers said .
" Sheriff Lee was on the phone and the governor came down to visit him .
It was n't that they were standing right down there with the boats . "
She said she did n't know who Lee , who died in 2007 , was on the phone , about the incident with the boats when the governor described him as yelling into the phone .
UPDATE : I 'd initially misunderstood Sellers to be saying Jindal and Lee did n't meet while rescue efforts were still underway .
In fact , she said , the conversation took place in the aftermath of the storm , but after the boat incident .
" Bobby and I walked into Harry Lee ’s office – he ’s yelling on the phone about a decision he ’s already made , " Jindal chief of staff Timmy Teepell recalled .
" He ’s saying , ' This is a decision I made , and if you do n’t like it you can come and arrest me . ' "
Teepell said the exchange took place in the week following Katrina , when Jindal visited Jefferson Parish multiple times .
" He was boots on the ground all the time , " he said .
ALSO : Sellers insists that there is no difference between Jindal 's account and the one she and Teepell told , and objects to my characterization of a difference in the immediacy of Jindal 's story and the version that has him listening while Lee recounts something that has already happened .
ALSO : " This is liberal blogger B.S. The story is clear , " Teepell adds .
UPDATE : Jindal 's staff sends over a video of Lee talking about Jindal 's visits immediately after the storm , though it does n't mention this particular story :
" Ratatouille " as the story of a homosexual coming out ?
I think I get it , sort of .
I know the subtext of " The Wizard of Oz , " and like Dorothy , Remy -- the cuisinier - protagonist of " Ratatouille " -- is a misunderstood adolescent who embarks on a journey of self - discovery ....
Laure Murat of the UCLA Department of French and Francophone Studies takes the exploration of this topic much further in her lecture Thursday , in which she delves into Remy 's embodiment of " the lonely gay , both refined and the object of disgust , excluded and successful " and the animated movie as " the story of the Oedipus conflict , mixed with issues of race and species ....
If ' anyone can cook , ' any queer guy has a role to play in this world -- at least in Paris . "

Shelbi Day , Staff Attorney , ACLU -FL LGBT Advocacy Project , ( 352 ) 219-4709 or sday@aclufl.org
Howard Simon , Executive Director , ACLU of Florida , cell : ( 786 ) 208-7103
GAINESVILLE , Fla . – The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) of Florida applauds Gainesville voters ’ overwhelming rejection , 58 % to 42 % , of an effort by anti-gay crusaders that would have repealed protections against discrimination for gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) people in housing , employment , public accommodation , and credit extension services .
The Gainesville Charter Amendment was the first vote on civil rights and equality for LGBT persons in Florida since the passage of Amendment 2 , the so - called Marriage Protection Amendment , in November , 2008 .
For over a year , supporters of Charter Amendment 1 have waged a fear - based campaign that blatantly misled voters about the intent and impact of Charter Amendment 1 .
“ Today Gainesville voters turned out in record numbers and said no to discrimination , ” said Shelbi Day , staff attorney for ACLU of Florida ’s LGBT Advocacy Project , who was on the ground in Gainesville working with the local group opposing Charter Amendment 1 .
“ Gainesville voters overwhelmingly rejected a fear - based campaign of lies and misinformation and stood up for protection from discrimination against lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender people .
Voters sent a clear message that the discrimination stops right here , right now . ”
“ Protecting Gainesville ’s anti-discrimination protections for lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender people is a significant achievement .
I congratulate everyone who worked so hard to help bring about today 's victory , ” stated Howard Simon , Executive Director of the ACLU of Florida .
“ But let us also remember that this is but one step toward dismantling the barriers to complete legal equality for LGBT people .
Tonight , we celebrate .
Tomorrow , we go back to work dismantling the many remaining barriers to full equality for LGBT Floridians . ”
The ACLU of Florida , which has approximately 800 members and supporters in Alachua County , including Gainesville , provided significant support to Equality is Gainesville ’s Business ( EQGB ) , the Gainesville - based political committee created to defeat Charter Amendment 1 .
A full time ACLU staff attorney was sent to Gainesville for the final six weeks of the campaign , providing important communications and legal support for the campaign .
Additionally , the ACLU of Florida mobilized volunteers to phone bank from several of its offices around the state and the ACLU - FL ’s Northeast Regional Office Director , Benetta Standly , worked to build important alliances for the campaign .
Anime movies and Manga comics have a certain fanbase and people either love the movies or hate them…usually there is no in - between .
The things that I think are amazing in Manga comics and films are : the amazing gadgets seen , the detailed robots and weapons , and of course the great looking Anime girls which are close to perfect .
In this collection , we gathered many different manga gadgets , anime figures , and some girls .
Some of these below are gadgets for the Evangelion series , some are inspired by Gundam Manga and a few also have Akira to thank .
If you know where some additional great gizmos and items can be found … please share them with us .
Gundam Head as Portable Speaker
We watch Anime on the TV set , and now we can use the Gundam head as a portable speaker for our iPods and other portable MP3 players .
It is a great way to have your favorite Anime series with you even while not watching it .
Image source
Anime Phone Cradle and Charger
The color may be perfect for girls , but it is still a Gundam Manga accessory that was sold as a phone and charger bundle .
I ’m sure die - hard fans were just crazy for it .
Image Source
Anime Girls PC Case Mods
PC Case Mods are amazing as it is , but when they are made by inspiration of beautiful Anime girls , then it is a bonus .
These two cases are made with great detail , and even though they are not as realistic as many would wish , they are still a beautiful replica that would satisfy fans nonetheless .
Anime Star Wars Characters
There are many different Star Wars remakes , such as Steampunk Star Wars and as can be seen here … Anime Star Wars .
It is fun to see two major sagas join to create great artwork with the specs and details as we have come to expect .
So they are not extremely Anime looking , but the hint is still there .
Image Source 1 and 2
Anime Vehicles Remakes
The cars and robots that are maneuvered in the movies are sometimes too cool to fathom , and here are a few remakes .
The plus about these creations is that the Anime fans have built upon working vehicles , so they are functional as well .

Gundam Pure Platinum Figure
This is one of the most expensive figures ever .
It is a Manga Gundam robot replica that is made from pure Platinum to amount to approximately $ 41,000 ( at time created ) .
Probably not affordable by many , it would make a heck of a collectible item…especially to display on the turntable .
Image Source
Nissan DUALIS Mecha Suit
Created by an Anime designer Shoji Kawamori , this 3.5 meters tall suit is a robot version of the Nissan DUALIS .
I wish such a replica would be for sale or even adapted to be within an army … although I would n’t want to be on the receiving end .
Image Source
Gundam USB Ionizer and Hub
The colors of this USB Ionizer and Hub are attractive enough to be something not just Manga fans and geeks would like .
They are made by inspiration from the Gundam Anime show .
Image Source
Anime Girls Busty Mousepad
Does this even need an introduction ?
It is a cool mousepad that has a beautiful Anime Girl printed on it …and a little extra .
Many men would flock for it , but who knows maybe some women would love the comfort .
Image Source
Anime USB Accessories
These four KinnikuMan Warriors are in some weird sit ups position , but are still a fun USB accessory for Manga fans .
They are small , cute , colorful and provide inspiration as they do their exercise while you are working on your computer .
Image Source
Gundam Slippers
Awesome way to walk around professing your Manga love … in giant Gundam slippers .
These huge slippers are designed with the Gundam robot in mind and make the sound effects as you slam your foot down .
Bets idea would be to take it to casual dress day and really act out .
Image Source
Gundam Robot USB
This 4GB USB Flash Drive is a miniature version of the Gundam Robot and will both serve an Anime fan ’s obsession and practicality of a portable storage drive .
Image Source
Evangelion USB Drive
Shaped , modeled , and presenting the Evangelion Anime series , this is a 2 GB flash drive for major fans .
Its actual shape is like the Mecha ’s cockpit … but in a miniature flash drive .
Image Source
Rei USB Drive
Evangelion and Anime Girls fans who love Rei would enjoy this portable flash drive similar to the Gundam Robot one .
It is a miniature Rei version that is also practical , answering daily storage needs .

Build a Gundam Robot
2 children built a 1.5 meters Gundam Robot from a model kit that shows they are major Anime fans .
I ’m just hoping they will get into the full sized Anime girl models as the next project .
Image Source 1 and 2
Anime Bubble Head
I have n’t seen this in any Anime before , but does n’t it seem like it would fit perfectly ?
It is a home entertainment device concept from Toshiba to allow 360 degree view within a dome shaped helmet .
I wonder what kind of a neck ache you would get after watching one episode of Lost .
Image Source
Gundam Nintendo DS
A brand impression of Gundam makes this Nintendo DS a gadget for Anime fans .
It does n’t transform into the huge Robot or make any extraordinary sound effects but is worthy the mention .
Image Source
Evangelion Headphones
These limited edition headphones branded with Evangelion are great for the Anime fans who follow the series , but are not cheap …$ 207 .
They could both provide a collectible item and let you watch the movies with your own personal sound .
Image Source
Evangelion Figures
No Anime collection would be complete without at least a few figures of Anime girls as eye candy .
These two from Evangelion show Rei and Asuka in a 8.75 inches tall figure that come with additional replacement hands .
They could make a perfect display in your geeky room .

It was a fresh morning after a night of rain , and we were hiking up into the mountains in southern France .
The plants and trees glowed with green , vibrant life .
Sheep and cows were meandering in the fields , and the blue sky stretched out for miles .
Then I heard a faint beeping noise that did n't sound like a bird .
The Italian hiker next to me had a heavy pack and was sweating profusely in the cool morning .
He heard the beep and did n't hesitate to pick up his phone .
It was his mother calling to see if he was alright at the start of his hiking trip .
For the next 10 minutes , instead of listening to birds sing and observing the morning view , he had a conversation with someone who was n't there .
This was the start of a month - long hike I took through northern Spain on the Camino de Santiago .
I decided to take this break from work in part to get away from my cell phone – as Americans call mobiles – and computer screen .
This time away offered me some perspectives on how – to paraphrase Henry David Thoreau – I had become a tool of my tools .
Before I left on the hike , I read an interesting essay in the magazine Adbusters called Technoslave , written by Eric Slate .
In the essay Slate recalls : " Once , while I was riding on a crowded bus , the man sitting next to me threw his cell phone out the window .
When his phone rang , instead of dutifully answering it , he casually tossed it away .
I was stunned .
He looked at me , shrugged and looked away .
I had no idea if it was his , if it was stolen or if he even knew what a cell phone was .
But in one seemingly careless motion , he managed to liberate himself from something that has completely consumed me . "
This story resonated with me .
Like so many other people these days , my livelihood is based on being connected – online or on my cell phone .
But five years into what had essentially become an addiction to cell phone use , I realised that instead of keeping me connected to the world , my cell phone had set up a wall between me and the people and community around me .
And I 'm not the only one .
When hiking through Spain , off the Verizon grid of connectedness , I reflected on how cell phone use has crept into every aspect of daily life , ironically weakening the basic human communication that is the fabric of any community .
Billions of people across the world use cell phones .
Though cell phones can be wonderful , liberating tools of communication , freeing us from the confines of an office and providing more leisure time , they often do the exact opposite .
Cell phone use has blurred the boundaries between work and non-work time , increasing stress and tension within families and between friends .
As Slate commented in his essay : " It seems the more ' connected ' we are , the more detached we become . "
Back on the hiking trail in Spain , I saw this play out in myriad ways .
Though I was experiencing cell phone freedom , I found myself surrounded by people , mainly Europeans , on their phones , texting and talking with concerned family members and friends throughout the day .
People were torn between developing friendships with strangers and contacting old friends and family they already knew .
There is a risk of being too connected .
While I was hiking , I got lost a few times .
I saw new sights and was surprised by unexpected landscapes and towns I would n't have otherwise come across .
Back in the US , whenever I got lost , I would always call a friend for directions on my cell phone .
With a cell phone , you 're less likely to go down the wrong street and see new things or unexpectedly meet new people .
So , when I recently returned home to Burlington , Vermont , I got rid of my cell phone and traded in an old , rusty bike for a regular landline telephone that is connected to the wall and everything .
Now , I go outside and do n't immediately make a phone call or check my phone .
Therefore , I 've seen things in my neighbourhood I never noticed before , like a big flower garden around the block and artwork and sculptures down the road .
Now that I 'm not glued to my cell phone , I 've met new people on the street and at the supermarket , struck up conversations with neighbours I have n't spoken with before and talk with my friends face - to - face instead of over the phone .
Instead of cutting me off from the world , getting rid of my cell phone has helped me get in touch with my community .
The other day , my neighbours and I marvelled together at a moose running down the street toward the lake .
Somehow , that moose brought the neighbourhood together more than a cell phone ever could .

やさし いScala入門 – Available Now
平明な例と演習問題で学ぶ
著者 日向俊 二
出版社 : カットシステ ム Scala（スカラ）はオブジェクト指向と関数型プログラミングを結合した、比較的新しいプログラミング言語です。2種類のプログラミング技術を結合しているので、Scalaを使うとプログラムを簡潔に書くことができます。たとえば、他のプログラミング言語で書くと十数行になるコードを、わずか数行で書くことができます。そのため、コードの入力（タイピング）の手間が減るだけではなく、プログラムが短く読みやすくなることで間違いが紛れ込む可能性もそれだけ減り、結果として楽にプログラミングできます。
オブジェクト指向と関数型プログラミングの両方を利用できるということは、Scalaをマスターするためには両方の概念と用語、そして、それらを結合する新しい概念とその用語を学ぶ必要があるということです。しかし、本書では「
Hello , Scala」を出力するための単純なプログラムからはじめて徐々に高度な内容になるので、誰でも気楽にScalaを学ぶことができます。
