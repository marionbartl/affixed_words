Should Barack Obama ’s volunteers mail “ Letters of No Apology ” to survivors of the large number of people killed by U.S. imperial assault in Iraq and Afghanistan ?
Recently Obama was asked by CNN ’s Candy Crowley if “ there ’s anything that ’s happened in the past 7 1/2 years that the U.S. needs to apologize for in terms of foreign policy ? ”
Obama responded by saying , “ No , I do n’t believe in the U.S. apologizing .
As I said I think the war in Iraq was a mistake .
We did n’t keep our eye on the ball in Afghanistan .
But , you know , hindsight is 20 / 20 , and I ’m much more interested in looking forward rather than looking backwards . ”
The United States , Obama told Crowley , “ remains overwhelmingly a force of good in the world . ”
“ SHOT AS THEY RAN ”
I would like the Afghan “ war ” enthusiast Barack Obama to write a Letter of No Apology to Orifa Ahmed .
On October 7 , 2001 , Orifa ’s house in the Afghan village of Bibi Mahru was destroyed by a 500 - pound bomb dropped by an American F - 16 plane .
The explosion killed her husband ( a carpet weaver ) , six of her children and two children , who lived ( and died ) next door .
Away visiting relatives when the bombing occurred , Orifa returned to find pieces of her children ’s flesh scattered around the killing site .
She received $ 400 from U.S. authorities to compensate her for her losses .
I would also like Obama to write a “ Letter of No Apology ” to Gulam Rasul , a school headmaster in the Afghan town of Khair Khana .
On the morning of October 21 , 2001 , the United States dropped a 500 - pound bomb on his house , killing his wife , three of his sons , his sister and her husband , his brother , and his sister - in - law .
Another “ Letter of Apology ” should go to Sher Kahn , an old man who lost seven relatives when the United States assaulted the Afghan village of Niazi Qala on December 29 , 2001 .
Here is how the British author and filmmaker John Pilger describes the attack :
The roar of the planes had started at three in the morning , long after everybody had retired for the night .
Then the bombs began to fall — 500 - pounders leading the way , scooping out the earth and felling a row of houses .
According to neighbors watching from a distance , the planes flew three sorties over the village and a helicopter hovered close to the ground , firing flares , then rockets .
Women and children were seen running from the houses towards a dried pond , perhaps in search of protection from the gunfire , but were shot as they ran .
“ Letters of No Apology ” should also go from the “ antiwar ” Obama campaign to survivors of :
35 Afghan refugees who were bombed by the U.S. for riding in a bus in flight from U.S. assault .
160 Afghanis killed in repeated U.S. bombings of the village of Karam .
93 people killed when U.S. Ac 130 gun-ships strafed the small farming village Chowkar - Karaz .
( The Pentagon said the community was “ supporting terrorists ” and therefore deserved its fate : “ those people are dead , ” a Pentagon spokesman told reporters , “ because we wanted them dead . ” )
Rampant U.S. torture of civilians and non-combatants employed as part of the “ war on terror ” at the Bagram military base , near Kabul , since the fall of 2001 .
64 civilians killed when the U.S. bombed a wedding party in eastern Afghanistan in early July of this year ( This was the fourth wedding party blown up by the U.S. - led “ coalition ” since the fall of 2001 ) .
19 women who died in the gynecology wing of a Kabul hospital bombed by the U.S. in October of 2001 .
The countless other U.S. attacks on Afghan villages that have added to a civilian death toll that certainly goes well into the thousands since the U.S. initiated its “ liberation ” of Afghanistan from a Taliban government the U.S. largely put into place during the 1990s .
The people of Afghanistan can be forgiven for thinking it might not be all bad if Uncle Sam has occasionally taken his eye off “ the ball in Afghanistan . ”
U.S. -“ liberated ” Afghanistan remains desperately poor and violence - plagued under the control of religious extremists , warlords and the deadly U.S. Empire .
Women are less safe there now than under the Taliban .
“ AS ILLEGAL AS THE INVASON OF IRAQ ”
For what it ’s worth , prominent legal scholar Marjorie Cohn notes that “ the invasion of Afghanistan was as illegal as the invasion of Iraq . ”
As Cohn explains :
“ The U.N. Charter provides that all member states must settle their international disputes by peaceful means , and no nation can use military force except in self - defense or when authorized by the Security Council .
After the 9/11 attacks , the Council passed two resolutions , neither of which authorized the use of military force in Afghanistan . ”
“ The invasion of Afghanistan was not legitimate self - defense under article 51 of the Charter because the attacks on September 11 were criminal attacks , not ‘ armed attacks ’ by another country .
Afghanistan did not attack the United States .
In fact , 15 of the 19 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia .
Furthermore , there was not an imminent threat of an armed attack on the United States after September 11 , or Bush would not have waited three weeks before initiating his October 2001 bombing campaign .
The necessity for self - defense must be ‘ instant , overwhelming , leaving no choice of means , and no moment for deliberation . ’
This classic principle of self - defense in international law has been affirmed by the Nuremberg Tribunal and the U.N. General Assembly . ”
Sold as a legitimate defensive response to the jetliner attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan was undertaken without definitive proof or knowledge that that country ’s largely U.S. - created Taliban government was responsible in any way for 9/11 .
It occurred after the Bush administration rebuffed efforts by that government to possibly extradite accused 9/11 planners to stand trial in the U.S. The U.S. sought to destroy the Taliban government with no legal claim to introduce regime change in another sovereign state .
The invasion took place over the protest of numerous Afghan opposition leaders and in defiance of aid organizations who expected a U.S. attack to produce a humanitarian catastrophe .
And , as Noam Chomsky noted in 2003 , U.S. claims to possess the right to bomb Afghanistan — an action certain to produce significant casualties — raised the interesting question of whether Cuba and Nicaragua were entitled to set off bombs in the U.S. given the fact that the U.S. provided shelter to well - known terrorists shown to have conducted murderous attacks on the Cuban and Nicaraguan people and governments .
Under Bush ’s rationale for launching his assault on Afghanistan ( an attack that Obama wishes to significantly expand ) , citizens of Latin American states whose dictatorships were schooled in torture at the School of the Americas ( Ft. Benning , Georgia ) would be free to attack American cities and villages .
“ IRAQ HAS BEEN KILLED ”
As for the U.S. “ mistake ” in Iraq , where to begin with the Letters of No Apology that Obama and his staff need to write ?
The U.S. has undertaken a highly criminal occupation of that country against the wishes of the “ liberated ” nation ’s own populace .
In a marvelous example of what Obama called ( in Berlin last week ) U.S. “ sacrifice ” for “ freedom , ” the U.S. has inflicted a bloody Holocaust on Mesopotamia , killing ( directly and indirectly ) as many as 1.2 million Iraqis and maiming and displacing many millions more .
According to the respected journalist Nir Rosen last December , “ Iraq has been killed , never to rise again .
The American occupation has been more disastrous than that of the Mongols who sacked Baghdad in the thirteenth century .
Only fools talk of solutions now .
There is no solution .
The only hope is that perhaps the damage can be contained . ”
I wonder what Rosen would have had to say about the following comment offered by Barack Obama to autoworkers assembled at the General Motors plant in Janesville , Wisconsin on February 13 , 2008 , just before that state ’s Democratic primary : “ It ’s time to stop spending billions of dollars a week trying to put Iraq back together and start spending the money putting America back together . ”
“ We should support the millions of Iraqis , ” Obama told 200,000 rapt listeners in Berlin , “ who seek to rebuild their lives even as we pass on responsibility to the Iraqi government . ”
“ Rebuild their lives ” from exactly what , pray tell ?
Senator Obama did not elaborate on the two U.S. military attacks , the decade plus of murderous “ economic sanctions ” ( which killed more than half a million children — a cost that the current Obama advisor and supporter Madeline Albright called a “ price worth paying ” ) , and the ongoing invasion ’s ever - climbing death toll .
Obama will continue the occupation as president , something known by those who care to read between the lines of his populace - pleasing campaign rhetoric .
Reading Obama ’s line about “ freedom ” - loving America ’s overseas “ sacrifice ” in his Berlin Address , I was reminded of something he said in a speech to The Chicago Council on Global Affairs in the fall of 2006 : “ The American people have been extraordinarily resolved [ in alleged support of the Iraq “ war ” – P.S. ] .
They have seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah .
This was a spine - chilling selection of locales .
Fallujah was the site for colossal U.S. war atrocity — the crimes included the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians , the targeting even of ambulances and hospitals , and the practical leveling of an entire city — by the U.S. military in April and November of 2004 .
The town was designated for destruction as an example of the awesome state terror promised to those who dared to resist U.S. power .
Not surprisingly , Fallujah became a powerful and instant symbol of American imperialism in the Arab and Muslim worlds .
It was a deeply provocative and insulting place to choose to highlight American “ sacrifice ” and “ resolve ” in the brazenly imperialist occupation — described as “ a colonial war ” by the grand U.S. imperial strategist Zbigniew Brzezinski ( an Obama foreign policy advisor ) — of Iraq .
Recycling the imperial discourse of elite Democratic “ doves ” during and on the Vietnam War , Obama insists that the monumentally illegal and transparently petro-colonial occupation of Iraq was a “ strategic blunder ” resulting from “ our ” over - zealous “ good intentions ” ( sometimes we just get a little crazy with our noble passion to spread liberty ) .
Not true : Operation Iraqi Liberation ( O.I.L. ) is an imperial CRIME ( aggressive warfare was the top crime for which Nazi leaders were executed at Nuremburg ) obviously dedicated to deepening U.S. control over hyper - strategic oil resources in the world ’s energy heartland while serving the ongoing interests of the American military - industrial complex .
Barack No Apology ( Because We Are Good ) Obama wants badly to expand what he calls George W. Bush ’s “ good ” and “ proper ” war on Afghanistan while claiming to want to reduce America ’s “ mistake [n ] ” presence in Iraq .
The world should beware .
Superpower may be getting ready to take on some outwardly new faces , but its dangerous national narcissism will live on along with its empire of bases , bullets , and bombs .

Olbermann gets more critical of Obama 's FISA stance David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday July 1 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Senator Barack Obama 's announcement that he would be supporting the Congressional " compromise " on expanding wireless wiretapping and giving the telecom companies retroactive immunity has created fierce arguments in the liberal wing of the Democratic party over whether Obama 's " move to the center " is a necessary strategy for the general election or a pointless sellout on a core issue .
Last week , blogger Glenn Greenwald fiercely attacked MSNBC's Keith Olbermann over his praise of Obama for " refusing to cower even to the left , " setting off an online argunment that raged between them for several days , drawing in other bloggers and even former Watergate figure John Dean .
In a Special Comment delivered on Monday 's Countdown , Olbermann attempted to find a middle ground in the dispute , suggesting that " the Democratic leadership in the Senate , Republican knuckle - dragging in the same chamber , and the mediocre skills of whoever wrote the final version of the FISA bill have combined to give Sen.
Barack Obama a second chance to make a first impression .
And he damned well better take it . "
" It would be sweet to have a pure , politics - free president , but the last of those retired from office in 1797 , " Olbermann noted sourly .
" Inside that obscenity that was Charlie Black 's comment about how a terrorist attack in this country would be ' good ' -- good for his boy McCain 's chances for election ... there is a sad and cynical reality .
The Republicans can scare some of the people all of the time and they can scare all the people some of the time .
This is all they are right now . "
" Senator , the Republicans are going to paint you as soft on terror no matter how you vote on FISA , " Olbermann continued , addressing Obama directly .
" This political tight - rope act that you 've tried on FISA the last two weeks , which from the outside seems to have been intended to increase the chances of your election , probably has n't helped that chance in the slightest . "
Olbermann then pointed out that there is a loophole in the FISA legislation , since it immunizes the telecoms only from civil liability , leaving them and administration officials subject to criminal prosecution .
He advised that Obama should vote for the FISA bill , but after its passage he should " say , loudly , that your understanding of this bill is such , that if you are elected , your Attorney General will begin a full - scale criminal investigation of the telecom companies . "
" Explain that you are standing aside on civil immunity , " concluded Olbermann , " not just for political expediency , but for a greater and more tangible good : the holding to account of the most corrupt , the most dangerous , and the most anti-democracy presidential administration in our long history .
...
The Republicans are going to call you the names any which way , Senator .
They 're going to cry regardless , Senator .
And as the old line goes :
Give them something to cry about . "
In a post on Tuesday morning , Glenn Greenwald saw much to approve of in Olbermann 's Special Comment , noting that " in general , Olbermann 's commentary about Obama 's FISA position was much more critical , in both senses of the word .
Still , there are numerous , glaring flaws with the fantasy that Obama will criminally prosecute telecoms . "
Greenwald also emphasized that " the FISA bill is dangerous and destructive for reasons having nothing to do with the telecom immunity provisions ( i.e. , the warrantless eavesdropping powers it vests in the president ) . "
He then went on to list half a dozen different ways in which Obama has repudiated his base since securing the Democratic nomination in early June .
" There is no question , at least to me , that having Obama beat McCain is vitally important , " Greenwald concluded .
" But so , too , is the way that victory is achieved and what Obama advocates and espouses along the way .
...
Electing Barack Obama is a very important political priority but it is n't the only one there is , and his election is less likely , not more likely , the more homage he pays to these these tired , status - quo- perpetuating Beltway pieties . "
A full transcript of Olbermann 's remarks is available here .
This video is from MSNBC's Countdown , broadcast June 30 , 2008 .

An advanced satellite that will improve greatly the ability of UK military forces to communicate around the globe has been launched into space .
The Skynet 5C platform rode into orbit atop an Ariane 5 rocket from the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana .
It joins the 5A and 5B satellites lofted successfully last year and which are already handling secure traffic for UK forces in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The £ 3.6 bn Skynet project represents the UK 's single biggest space venture .
Skynet 5C during fuelling in Kourou 's integration complex
The investment includes replacing and updating control centres , and the major antennas and terminals used by military ships , land vehicles and planes to communicate through the satellites .
The 5C spacecraft - the last in the Skynet series - left the launch pad in Kourou at 1905 local time ( 2205 GMT ) .
Skynet 5 allows the British Army , Royal Navy and Royal Air Force ( RAF ) to pass much more data , faster between command centres .
The bandwidth capacity easily surpasses the current satellite constellation , Skynet 4 , whose spacecraft are coming to the end of their design lives .
" Skynet 5 is about two - and - a - half - times more capable than the previous system , and it also gives us the ability to use not just voice communication but also data communication , " explains Patrick Wood from spacecraft manufacturer EADS Astrium .
" So , computers can talk directly to computers , as well giving us pictures and real - time video images . "
See how the Skynet 5 system is being deployed This extra capability can already be seen in Afghanistan , where the RAF is using a robot surveillance plane called Reaper to hunt down Taleban forces .
Although flying in the skies over Asia , Reaper is actually controlled by RAF personnel sitting in the US behind a computer screen .

Commands are sent over Skynet 5's high - bandwidth connections , directing the robot 's every move .
This includes firing missiles at enemy targets .
The new Skynet platforms look much like any of the other modern commercial telecommunications spacecraft launched from Kourou , but the 5s incorporate technologies that are specially prepared for military use .
Four steerable antennas give them the ability to focus bandwidth onto particular locations where it is most needed - where British forces are engaged in operations .
The spacecraft have also been " hardened " to withstand any interference - attempts to disable or take control of the satellites - and any efforts to eavesdrop on their sensitive communications .
Classified receive - antenna technology enables the 5s to " go deaf " to signals that try to " jam " them whilst still continuing to listen to operational traffic .

Advertisement Security was tight in Kourou in the lead - up to 5 C 's launch .
Sentries had been posted outside the spaceport 's giant integration complex during the final phases of the launch campaign .
No unofficial photography was permitted .
The new Skynet infrastructure is not owned by the UK Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) but rather by a private company called Paradigm Secure Communications .
The firm won a contract to supply satellite services to the military and has obtained City money to help fund the new - build .
Its deal with the MoD runs until 2020 and guarantees UK forces a proportion of the satellites ' bandwidth .
Paradigm hopes to earn money for itself by selling spare capacity to Nato countries and other " friendly " forces .
The deal with the AirTanker consortium is one of the biggest deals of its kind " Skynet 5C is actually our self - insurance , " said Paradigm Managing Director Malcolm Peto .
" When we committed to this programme we always promised to give the MoD a certain level of capability ; and space , as we all know , is a variable environment for this type of technology .
So , the importance of our third satellite is that we have an in - orbit spare should anything go wrong . "
Skynet 5 is the largest Private Finance Initiative ( PFI ) yet delivered to the MoD .
The procurement model has now been copied for an even bigger project - the £ 13bn PFI signed with an EADS - led consortium to provide mid-air refuelling services .
This will offer brand new tankers based on the Airbus A330 - 200 , to replace the ageing fleet of VC - 10 and Tristar aircraft .
Skynet 5C was launched along with a commercial " co-passenger " - Turksat 3A , which will beam TV and other telecommunication services to Turkey , Europe and Central Asia .
1 . Skynet 5 overhauls satellite communications for UK forces 2 .
The largely autonomous satellites talk to two UK ground stations 3 . Skynet 5 supports high - bandwidth applications , such as UAV video 4 . Antennas and terminals are upgraded to make best use of Skynet 5 .
New battlefield networks , such as Cormorant , feed into the system 6 .
System gives commanders access to more information , faster 1 .
Improved technologies , including a solar ' sail ' , lengthen the platforms ' operational lives to at least 15 years 2 .
The satellites are ' hardened ' against interference .
A special receive antenna can resist attempts at jamming 3 .
Each spacecraft has four steerable antennas that can concentrate bandwidth onto particular regions 4 .
The system gives near - global coverage , providing 2.5 times the capacity afforded by the previous system 5 .
Each spacecraft is a 3x4x4.5 m box and weighs just under 5 tonnes ; the solar wings once unfurled measure 34 m tip to tip

Help is at hand and there are things you can do to get back on track .
BERLIN --
The German government had to sweeten the yield on its latest debt offering Wednesday , showing that even those European governments with relatively healthy budgets are struggling to overcome tight bank liquidity and market skepticism about economic and fiscal risks .
Out of 17 auctions for German government bonds so far this year , seven tenders undersold after failing to attract enough bids .
The latest shortfall came Wednesday , when the government could sell only € 3.208 billion ( $ 5.06 billion ) of a € 4 billion ...

Visual comparison with GTI version of a bigger Golf model indicates that Volkswagen intends to optical harmonization of its sporty oriented production .
Identical design of 5 - spoked 16 - inch alloy wheels , or equally paced roof spoiler and a leading of double chrome exhaust just affirm this fact .
Volkswagen Polo GTI
Atmosphere in interior is “ dynamized ” especially by three - spoked steering wheel , which is together with a gearstick and a haft of handbrake overstuffed with a leather .
Distinctly shaped seats are decorated by a typical checked overlay Interlagos .
A surface of the central control console made of imitation of dull metal visually corresponds to polished aluminum pedals .
Volkswagen Polo GTI
Engine produces maximum output of 110 kW ( 150 hp ) by sporty 5,800 rpm , maximum torque 220 Nm starts to burden front wheels already by 1950 rpm .
With these parameters it is the strongest serially produced Polo in its whole 30 - year - long history .
Acceleration to 80 kph takes only 5,8 sec. , for 100 kph Polo GTI needs 8,2 sec .
Extremely flat run of turbo engine torque ( in extent from 1950 to 4500 rpm it practically does n’t fall under the maximum ) is also the cause of seductive values of flexible acceleration .
1164 kg - heavy Polo GTI on the 4th grade accelerates from 80 into 120 kph in already 7,5 seconds , on the 5th grade it takes 2,5 sec. longer .

One day I was talking with Brother Jed on the Quad when a rather rude young fellow sprinted by and grabbed Jed 's Bible right out of his hands .
While I may disagree with what is written in said book , I still strongly feel that theft is unjust , so I followed .
The thief ran fast , but I walked far and by - and - by caught up with him , whereupon I used the chaos powers vested in me as a Judicator of the Ancient Order of Walkers to bend his mind in the other direction .
After about half an hour of this spellcasting , his feeble mind snapped and he ran away as fast as he could .
I walked back to the Quad , and by the time I got there Jed had his Bible again — apparently the thief had sprinted past and given it back again .
It seems my magic had worked .
In any event , Jed seems like an okay guy .
His beliefs are insane ( he believes in hell and god and stuff like that ) but if you can have a quiet conversation with him away from angry crowds in the Quad he can actually be quite calm and reasonable and interesting to talk to .
He also gave me a copy of his book , _Who_Will_Rise_Up_ , which seems to be a mixture of some insane beliefs and some quite sound strategies for public speaking and crowd manipulation .

How is it that people like this are able to preach on campus ?
i realize it is a " public institution , " but you can't do this shit in a public library , or at a public pool , or in a public town hall meeting , so why the hell are people allowed to do this on campus ?
There has to be a way to stop people from doing it , because it creates a negative learning environment and makes the students who are paying the private school fees feel unsafe on their own campus !

A university by its nature should be a place where ALL can freely express their views so long as they abstain from violence .
Just because you happen to disagree does n't mean it should be banned .
Also , if you actually feel threatened by an old man holding a sign and jabbering on about hellfire and brimstone you 've got some larger issues .
If you disagree with him and want to do something about it A : debate him ( calmly works best ) or B : do like the two gentlemen behind him in the above did and conduct your own counter demonstration .
He has as much right to be there as anyone else .
Simple as that .

Google today introduced a 3D chat room plug - in called Lively that is easy to embed in websites and blogs .
Ars Technica went hands - on to see if Google actually has introduced us to " another dimension of the web . "
Unveiled on Google 's blog with the disclaimer that it was a " 20 percent " project , Lively is designed to be a portable 3D space where users can build rooms and interact with visitors via avatars .
" Second Life in a web browser " is an applicable analogy , though Google appears to have made sure that rooms and user activities remain in the G to PG range .
Each room can be linked with a unique URL — I Hate Ewoks and Lively : Google Room are two good examples — or even embedded in a website through an iframe .
" If you enter a Lively room embedded on your favorite blog or website , " Google 's Niniane Wang said in the announcement post , " you can immediately get a sense of the room creator 's interests , just by looking at the furniture and environment they chose . "
Apparently , a WordPress theme , Flickr photostream widget , and a Twitter Flash badge are n't enough to show off one 's personality anymore ; we need to know people 's architectural preferences as well .
The Lively room is rendering while we customize our avatar
For now , Lively is only available for Windows XP / Vista PCs running Internet Explorer and Firefox ; Mac and Linux clients are on their way .
While Lively is a custom platform Google has designed , it requires Flash in order to run embedded in a site .
Lively rooms offer a pop -out option if you need more space to strut your 3D stuff .
We hopped into the " Lively : Google Room " to take a virtual walk around .
The room was obviously full of other users just taking their first steps , which were all pretty awkward .
Controlling our avatar on a more - than - capable Vista machine was clunky , and avatars sometimes snapped around the room in jerky movements .
A limited amount of interactivity with objects is provided , though avatars can chose from a range of actions like shaking hands , hugging , picking a fight , or even choking Darth - Vader - style .
Conversations are displayed above individual avatars ' heads while they navigate the room
" Of course , you can chat with each other , and you can also interact through animated actions , " Google 's announcement explains .
" In our user research , we 've been amazed at how much more poignant it is to receive an animated hug than seeing the text [ [ hug ] ] . "
Considering this goal of increased interactivity , Lively 's initial offering looks like a mixed bag .
On the one hand , it 's a very beta Google Labs project and its complex environment is new to everyone trying it out right now , so we saw less interaction among users and more poking around to test the boundaries of the system .
Basic chatting is easy enough to do , but users were spending more time figuring out how to navigate the environment and perform relatively basic actions .
Traditional chat is still around to make sure you do n't miss a word
On the other hand , since Lively is so easy to embed in a website and the plug - in is such a quick install , Google may be on to something here .
3D environments like this are a pretty big hit with a large segment of the gaming market ( Exhibit A : The Sims and Second Life ) , and Lively packs that rich interactive experience into a free plug - in .
If Lively grows some legs during its Google Labs beta phase , the company can monetize it in obvious ways down the road by embedding text and video advertising in the rooms .
Site owners can probably get a slice of the pie as well , giving them an incentive to try the platform .
For now , however , Lively is a clunky beta .
Perhaps more importantly , from a social perspective it 's going to take some time for users to get used to Lively 's cartoony environments and get attached to the ways people can communicate and express themselves .
There is also something out - of - character about Lively that users may need time to digest .
Google is known for its spartan search box and text - based UIs with pastel highlights , not rich , 3D chat rooms embedded at the bottom of blog posts .
You can check out Lively for yourself , as we 've embedded one of the most popular rooms below .
# my custom exception class MyException ( Exception ) : pass if condition : pass # we do n't need this right now - testing
class MyException ( Exception ) : " " " my custom exception " " " if condition : " we do n't need this right now - testing "
The pass statement is simply used where the Python syntax requires a statement , but the application does n't need any logic .
Typically it is accompanied by a comment explaining why it is there .
A simple example : More often than not I will use a triple quoted string in its place .
This makes it more self documenting and looks cleaner to me .
My preferred usage : What do you prefer ?

According to Zach Klein and his valley sources , the Mormon Church ’s Family History Department has made a bid to acquire Facebook :
I heard from an employee close to the deal that the Mormon church ’s genealogy business made an unsolicited bid to acquire Facebook .
The Mormon Church maintains the largest genealogical database in the United States and apparently has the cash reserves necessary to make an offer of the magnitude necessary to acquire Facebook .
According to a 1997 Time Magazine Report , the Church of Latter Day Saints ’ assets exceeded $ 30 Billion in 1996 , and three years later was reported to be making over $ 5 Billion in revenue each year .
The Church is no stranger to the technology world , and in the 1980 ’s even created the first standard for exchange of genealogical information , Genealogy Data COMmunications , or GEDCOM for short .
The sheer depth and breadth of the Church ’s genealogical information is staggering - the specter of pairing it with one of the most detailed , accurate , and widespread social maps in existence ( Facebook ) is truly terrifying .
How much did they offer ?
Well , according the the latest executive stock sale rumors , Facebook may actually be valued at around $ 5 - 8 Billion – so we can only assume that the Church made an offer somewhere north of the $ 5 Billion mark .
My question is – will they roll their own private label version ?
Mormonbook anyone ?
UPDATE ( 2:04 am ) :
My inquiry a couple of hours ago to an old college friend who works for one of the interested parties has indicated that there is more at play here than meets the eye , and definitely more than just a kernel of truth to this rumor .
UPDATE ( 3:09 pm ) : The Church reached out to me this afternoon .
This is the official word from their Public Affairs Spokesperson , Lyman Kirkland :
Brady ,
You can quote this statement : “ This rumor has no foundation whatsoever . ”
A source who was in contact with the LDS Los Angeles office passed on this note to me : “ … no one in Salt Lake is providing our LA office with any information about the issue at this point . "
UPDATE ( 5:49 pm ) :
As of 5:49 pm this afternoon , the LDS website is down .

A study revealed that an illegal drug psilocybin has long - term positive effects on an individual 's well - being .
Psilocybin is a hallucinogenic substance derived from certain types of mushrooms and is considered illegal , claimed to have a high potential for abuse in the United States .
The study conducted at a Johns Hopkins University laboratory began in 2002 with the first results being published in 2006 .
During the experiment , 36 men and women who took the drug were monitored during an eight - hour laboratory visit and two months later .
In the new study scientists followed up the volunteers a year after the experiment .
Scientists found that the volunteers taking the drug reported that their experience made them feel better even 14 months after the study took place .
Almost two - thirds of the participants of the study said that they experienced one of the five most spiritually strong feelings .
Experts warn that it does n't mean that people can use the mushroom drug by themselves as it can be quite dangerous .
Many participants also reported feelings of fear even under a proper supervision in the laboratory .
Further research of the psilocybin may be helpful in treatment of such conditions as alcoholism or drug addiction as well as a useful drug for seriously ill patients to deal with distress .
Roland Griffiths , the leading author of the study said that 64 percent of the participants reported about improved well - being , life - satisfaction and behavior 14 months after the experiment .
Volunteers also said that they felt more self - confident , positive , affectionate , tolerant and creative .
The previous analysis proved that two months after taking the drug , family and friends of the participants also confirmed the behavior changes .

Repetitive stress injury ( RSI ) is an umbrella term for all the different ways you can hurt yourself by doing the same thing over and over again , such as by typing too much .
Keyboards look so harmless , it is counterintuitive that it may be possible to hurt yourself on one , but it is true .
In fact , you do not even need the keyboard .
The profession with the highest incidence of RSI is signed language interpreter [ 1 ] .
There is simply a limit to how many small - and - fast motions muscles can take .
MRI of a right - hand wrist , seen from below .
The long black lines are tendons squeezing between the mobile bones ( in white . )
There is very little space in a wrist .
The nerves , the tendons , the muscles and the blood vessels have to squeeze together through a constellation of small moving bones .
There is friction , tension , stretching and occasionally some amount of damage develops in the soft tissues .
That much is normal .
Wrists develop RSI when the damage done during the day is greater than what heals overnight .
Damage accumulates and eventually triggers pain and inflammation .
Pain and inflammation come in tandem since they are caused by the chemical signal that cells leak when they rip open .
Now , normally inflammation prepares the area for the repair work , but , unfortunately , it is counterproductive in the wrists .
The inflammation adds to the pressure , which increases the amount of friction and the rate of damage .
It is a vicious circle .
On top of that , there is a second vicious circle that operates on a longer timescale .
Muscles often react to a stress or an injury by stiffening .
It can happen throughout the length of the muscle , such as waking up with a stiff neck , or it can happen at a specific point .
For instance , trigger points are millimeter - sized balls of stiffened muscle that form at the connection between the nerve and the muscle in order to protect the connection .
But in the case of RSI , this stiffening is counterproductive .
It shortens the muscle to the point when the muscle - tendon assembly no longer reaches the bone comfortably .
The stiffening often also impedes the gliding action that needs to happen between the different structures , muscles , bones , tendons , nerves , and blood vessels .
The standard advice for any joint injury is :
go see a doctor , make sure nothing critical is damaged
do n't put weight on the joint until it heals
once the pain goes away , resume the activity gradually , with a brace if necessary .
You would n't ski on a bad knee , play tennis with a bad elbow , or play badminton with a bad ankle .
Those who do destroy their joint , often beyond repair .
Programmers who feel pain from typing face a similar risk .
Being suborn and typing through the pain can have serious consequences .
Wrists heal poorly , like any other region of the body with low blood flow .
Wrists are also prone to lose their healing capacity .
Recovery from RSI is often partial .
Programmers will resume work with a typing limit of 8 hours a day , or 6 , or 4 , or 2 .
At times , the handicap is complete and permanent .
The main book on RSI has a chapter titled RSI and your sex life .
It also lists the phone number of nursing associations who can organize a home bath performed by professionals .
Better be careful .
Studies have shown that once you are in pain , each hour spent typing does twice the amount of damage than the previous hour .
The pain snowballs quickly .
There is danger in the temptation to keep typing until the next upcoming deadline has passed .
Those who insist will find that the pain quickly increases to match their pain tolerance , at which point their body forces them to stop .
They miss the deadline anyway and find themselves with mangled wrists .
The higher their tolerance to pain the deeper in trouble they will be .
They are gambling with the possible loss of their hands and of their career .
Fools !
No deadline is worth this !
The body needs to be given a chance to heal .
If you fell over and got a bad rash , you would give it time .
First it would make a scab , then new tissue would form under it , and the scab would fall off .
Nobody rips the scab to play with the injury just to mess with the dedicate repair process .
Instead , we respect and trust , and give the body time to heal .
The same careful attitude is necessary for wounded wrists .
They need one or two months , with the help of a doctor .
RSI sufferers often resist the idea of taking a pause from work to let their wrists heal .
Yet , in my experience , bosses are always understanding .
After all it is against the boss ' interest to push the employees to hurt themselves .
The company would lose a good worker and open itself to liabilities .
But above all , people respect medical imperatives .
For any serious yet invisible condition , like a cancer or heart tremors , people take time off work without hesitating .
Beside , RSI is not as invisible as we think .
To the contrary , it is quite tangible to the trained eye .
Wrists swell up and the hands are weaker than usual since the muscles are refusing to activate at full strength , to protect themselves .
It is also possible that the nerves are losing their conductivity .
With the help of a few tests , a doctor can quantify the condition and pose a diagnosis with confidence .
Know the rules
That said , here are the general rules of RSI :
Never type through the pain .
Computer professional are athletes of the keyboard , in the sense that they push their body to its limits .
Intuitions developed for sports apply to RSI .
It is preferable to listen to the body and respect its message .
Go see a doctor .
There are many different kinds of RSI , and some versions require special medical care .
A doctor will be able to tell which is which , and give specific advice .
The doctor can also prescribe medicine and physiotherapy , and write a release - from - work note .
Resume typing gradually after the convalescence .
The trick is to measure how much typing reactivates the pain .
If it 's 60 minutes , the next time stop at 50 , right before the pain comes back .
Apply the ergonomic principle : work into strength , following the axes of power of your body , as you would in sports .
Recruit as many muscles as possible for each motion .
Reduce damages ; accelerate healing .
There are no silver bullets .
Rather , the best strategy is to accumulate many small contributions .
Ergonomic keyboards may reduce the rate of damage , but alone they are rarely sufficient .
Reduce damage
Concretely , there are many things to do .
First , how to reduce damages :
Buy the dictation software Dragon Naturally Speaking , which costs $ 50 for the English - only version .
Dragon comes with a nice headset ( itself worth around $ 20 . )
This software will let you send email and write documentation during the convalescence , when you cannot type at all .
Dragon requires a bit of practice and training .
However , once that 's done , it is as fast or faster than a keyboard ( up to 200 WPM for people who enunciate well . )
Many RSI sufferers continue using Dragon after their recovery .
I wrote an entire article specifically on using Dragon Naturally Speaking to help your wrists .
Plan time away from the keyboard .
Make a strategy to resist the temptation to type .
Now is a good time to travel .
Those who stay at work can spend time peer coding or doing code reviews .
Teach what you know .
Study a new technology .
The important thing is , once you are firm with your commitment to stop typing , you will find things to do .
Remember that wrists do not distinguish between home keyboards and work keyboards .
Blogging and video games count .
Some mundane activities involving the wrists counts as well , such as doing dishes or rearranging books .
Move the mouse to the left side , or buy a narrow keyboard ( one without a numeric keypad . )
The width of normal keyboards forces the mouse too far to the right , out of the axis of force of the shoulder .
The arm has to hold itself in extension , with the mouse at the end of the lever effect .
Most muscles are recruited to maintain the balance , leaving only a few small muscles to manipulate the mouse .
They easily become overworked .
Placing the mouse on the left avoids the problems .
Alternatively , use a touchpad or a sketch pad .

Install a typing break prompter .
Studies indicate that the incidence of RSI correlates better with the time spent at the keyboard without pauses than with the total time spent daily [ 3 ] .
Pausing will augment the amount of time you can spend at the keyboard before the return of pain .
With pauses , a RSI sufferer might be able to type for 8 sessions of 15 minutes , but for only 1 hour when typing non-stop .
Short and frequent breaks are always better than the same amount of break time consolidated into a single break .
Namely , 10 times ( 5 minutes typing + 1 minute break ) is better than 1 time ( 50 minutes typing + 10 minutes break ) .
I like the open source program Workrave .

Keep an ergonomic posture .
Admittedly , this is easier said than done , since old habits die hard .
Worse , what consist of an ergonomic posture remains a difficult research question .
Soft tissue do n't appear on x-rays and show few interesting structures on a MRI .
Instead medical research uses indirect indicators of damage , such as a behavior where the small muscles responsible for the motion of the fingers begin to duty - cycle , taking on a part of the load of their neighbor in an attempt to relieve them .
Alternatively , it is possible to study the phenomenon with medium - and long - term prospective studies .
One of the best such study is A Prospective Study of Computer Users , by Gerr , Marcus , Ensor , Cohen , Edwards , Gentry , Ortiz , Monteilh , AJIM 41:221-235 ( 2002 )
Over a period of 38 months , they followed 632 computer professionals who were pain - free at the beginning of the study .
By observing who developed pain , and comparing their work habits to those of the pain - free workers , the study was able to measure the risk factors associated with many different postures or practices .
Their recommendations were ( starting with the most effective )
Keep your elbows slightly open , at around 121° ( reduced the risk by 84 % )
Leaves more than 12 cm between the edge of the table and the " J " key ( ... by 62 %) Do n't use your neck to hold the phone ( ... by 60 %) Avoid keyboard wrist rests ( ... by 48 %) Do n't bend your wrists when holding the mouse .
Keep it within 5° ( ... by 45 % ) Strike the keys with a light touch , with less than 48 g of pressure ( ... by 40 % ) Raise the screen so that your neck tilt by less than 3° ( ... by 36 % ) Rest your elbows or forearms on the chair armrests , or on the desk itself ( ... by 35 %) Use a keyboard that is less than 3.5 cm thick (... by 35 %) Keep the keyboard slightly lower than your elbows (... by 23 %) Avoid resting your hands on the leading edge of your desk , or pad the edge ( ... by 22 % )
The highest incidences were for females , for people over 30 , and for people who type more than 20 hours per week .
The risk factor of these groups was about twice that of the general population .

Get a curved keyboard , or get the Kinesis Ergo .
A different study measured the impact of ergonomic keyboards :
The effect of alternative keyboards on musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders , by Moore , J.S. , & Swanson , N. ( 2003 ) .
In J. Jacko & C. Stephanidis ( Eds. ) , Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Human - Computer Interaction , Part I ( pp. 103-107 ) .
Mahwah , NJ : Erlbaum .
They found that concave - well keyboards such as the Kinesis fared best , followed by standard ( non-adjustable ) curved keyboards , followed by adjustable curved keyboards .
All of them were an improvement over standard straight keyboards .
I personally know many individuals who were helped by the Kinesis keyboard .
It is also the only ergonomic keyboard I know that is faster than a normal keyboard , once you get used to it .
http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm
Do not type one - handed .
The size of normal keyboards will force that hand to stretch far from its neutral ergonomic position .
Moreover , since both hands always used to type in concert , if the right hand starts to hurt , the left hand can't be far behind .
Do not look into laser with remaining good eye , said the senior physicist .
Those who insist in typing one - handed should buy a miniature keyboard which has a Q - to - P distance of less than the normal 6.5 inches , or by a netbook computer with a smaller - than - normal keyboard .
http://www.aboutonehandtyping.com/littlefingers.html
Wear a brace , at day , or at night , but not both .
During the day , a weakened wrist struggle simply to balance itself .
At night , most people bend their wrists which slows down healing .
But be careful , wearing the brace too much will lead muscle atrophy , which is as hard to remedy as RSI .
You will find suitable braces in drugstores but it is better to ask your doctor for a custom - fit brace .
Watch out , typing with a brace can press the metallic supports into the flesh , which will impair rather than help .
I like the flexible brace by Softflex .
http://store.ergoguys.com/softflexpair.html
Minimize chording .
I once ran a survey amongst my colleagues .
Users of Emacs had significantly higher incidence of wrist problems , followed by users of VI .
Users of editors with standard key bindings ( CUA - or HIG - style , such as those of Visual Studio ) , fared best , although they did have problems as well .
These results were statistically significant at 5 % .
Interpreting this result raises a cause - versus - correlation problem .
Perhaps the more intense users of keyboards gravitate towards the more challenging editors , and their attitude affects their wrist health more than the editor itself .
Nevertheless , Emacs , with its many shortcuts that seem inspired from circus contortionists , stands squarely against the " into the line of force " rule of ergonomics .
Clearly , ctrl - alt-x is a terrible motion for a wrist .
Scheme programmers will want to try my editor , DivaScheme , as is entirely devoid of chords .

Accelerate healing
Then , as you reduce the damage , you should also accelerate healing .
Go to physiotherapy .
It works , though the generic variety only works to a point .
You should seek therapists who specializes on RSI , either by choosing from the list at the National Association of Trigger Point Therapists , or by asking for a referral on the Sorehand mailing list .
Do stretches and strengthening exercises .
Like in sports , strong wrists heal faster and they are n't injured as easily .
Be careful though , it is easy to wreck a weakened wrist with exercises , even light ones .
It is better to proceed under the advice of a therapist .
Stay healthy : eat well , sleep well , exercise .
A healthy body always heals faster .
Choose a sport that is light on the wrists , such as yoga , swimming , running , or in - line skating .
Apply ice .
Apply the ice until the flesh turns pinkish .
At first , blood vessels contract to save heat , and the skin goes pale .
But soon , there is a switch of strategy .
To protect the skin from freezing the vessels dilate and flood the region with blood .
The cold reduces inflammation and the blood activates healing .
Take anti-inflammatory medicine .
But watch out , daily usage of over - the - counter drugs can have serious side effects .
Proceed only with the advice of your doctor .
The other danger is that anti-inflammation medicine will often act as a painkiller as a side effect to their anti-inflammatory action .
Without the signal from pain it is ridiculously difficult to refrain from typing .
Without pain your willpower must not fail , else the result will be more damage , not less .
Approach cortisone injections with due respect .
Cortisone is a potent drug .
It can be a miracle cure or be as destructive as an injection of pipe cleaner .
In short , you must absolutely refrain from typing while your tendons are under its effects , since at that time they have the structural strength of soft pasta .
The initial pain relief is illusory -- it is a wicked goblin leading you to your downfall .
Read this medical article on cortisone before accepting the injection .
Prevention
I believe that the injured have a responsibility towards their colleagues to prevent that the same thing happens to them .
Though it might be hard to convince them to watch their health or their ergonomics -- some people type their whole life without problems , simply because genetics plays a part in deciding whether someone will be prone to RSI -- we must try .
Keep in mind that so long as they are healthy they will believe they have the lucky gene .
Thus when I talk of prevention , I teach a single message : wrist pain is never normal ; if your wrists hurt , stop typing and go see a doctor .
We have to stay aware .
Notice the colleague who rubs his wrists and help out .
Do n't wait for them to complain , or it will be too late .
At the same time , teach everyone the symptoms and tell them to keep their eyes open , so that they can rescue each other .
My History
You can read the history of my RSI case here .
In short , I pushed through the pain for a deadline , abused the cortisone injections , had to abandon coding , then visited dozens of doctors until I found an effective therapeutic methodology .
As of today , May 24 , 2009 , I still cannot code professionally , but with the help of Dr. Deepak in Bangalore , and his team of dedicated therapists ( including the fantastic Jaba Prabu ) , and their expertise of Trigger Point Therapy , most of the pain has gone and I have been able to return to some amount of computer work .

The Etymology of Slang Sexual Terms
The word horny " sexually excited , lecherous " derives from an interesting yet not surprising source .
As early as the mid-18th century , an erection was known as a horn or the horn , simply because it looked a bit like one .
James Joyce even used the term in his Ulysses .
From there , any man having the horn was called horny , and this is first recorded in 1889 .
It was surely in use long before then , as the horn probably was .
It often takes some time for lewd slang to make it into the written record .
OTHER SEXUAL TERM(S ) PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED : Pussy as a slang term for the female pudenda is thought to derive ultimately from Low German puse " vulva " or Old Norse puss " pocket , pouch " .
It did n't arise in English with a sexual meaning until the 19th century , but prior to that it had been used to refer to women in general ( 16th century ) .
It has since also come to mean " effeminate , feeble , or homosexual men or boys " ( 20th century ) .
A reader has asked about the word cunt , wondering if it had something to do with " cunning " as in " a cunning woman was a negative thing " .
It has nothing to do with cunning ( which is related to the verbs ken and can ) and everything to do with what it means today : " female genitalia " .
It first shows up in a list of London street names of about 1230 .
That street name was , interestingly , Gropecuntelane , one of a warren of streets and alleyways all given over to the lowest forms of prostitution and bawdry .
It lay between Aldermanbury and Coleman Street ( where the Swiss Bank stands today ) and it belonged to one " William de Edmonton " .
Curiously , medieval Paris had a street name with an identical meaning - Rue Grattecon .
Oxford and York apparently also had similar versions of that street name .
Cunt is believed to derive from a Germanic root * kunton " female genitalia " , which also gave rise to Old Norse kunta ( ancestor of Norwegian and Swedish dialectical kunta and Danish dialectical kunte ) , Old Frisian , Middle Low German and Middle Dutch kunte , and the English doublet quaint .
And , by the way , the word was n't always considered derogatory , even though it is today .
Be careful about assuming that a word 's modern connotations must have governed its formation .
By the way , no connection has been made between the Germanic words and Latin cunnus .
The proto-Germanic root of cunt is ku- " hollow place " , while the Indo - European root of Latin cunnus is ( s ) keu- " to cover , to conceal " , the etymological meaning of cunnus being " sheath " .
Poontang is an interesting word .
It is so far removed linguistically from what it means in English that Melanie 's grandmother taught Melanie and her siblings and cousins a rhyme when they were young that goes like this :
What 's my name ?
Pudding Tang .*
Ask me again and I 'll tell you the same .
Grandma was ( and is ! ) a God-fearing , proper woman , and she would never teach her grandchildren something lewd or bawdy .
She probably learned the verse as a senseless rhyme when she was a child .
This smacks strongly of a folk etymology formed by people who did not understand the term poontang .
If that 's what it is , the couplet indicates that the term poontang has been around for some time -- Grandma was born in 1909 !
Interestingly , the first example of the word in writing is from 1929 .
That 's not surprising , as a writer would have had to be mighty brave to record that word before it had become common and lost some of its edge .
SINCE PUBLISHING THE ABOVE , we were made aware of a discussion by linguist Doug Wilson regarding the relationship between puddin ' tain and poontang .
He concludes that the two are not related , and he gives some good evidence .
What exactly does poontang mean ?
It has several meanings : a woman as a sex object , sexual intercourse , and probably the ultimate meaning , female pudenda .
So where did such a bizarre - sounding word come from ?
There are several theories .
Probably the most popular is that it derives from Louisiana ( and standard ) French putain " whore " .
This is possible as most people we know who are familiar with the word are from Louisiana or some state nearby , or they first heard the word from a citizen of that area .
However , the connection to putain is based mostly on conjecture , because of the similarity of the French word to the English one .
Some etymologists specializing in slang think that the word more likely derives from a Chinese language , as there are variant forms like poon tai and poon kai .
One school has it coming from some Filipino language , while Eric Partridge guesses it is of American Indian origin .
Oh , we found it amusing to learn that the following statement is widely attributed to John F. Kennedy immediately after he was elected president in 1960 : " I guess this means my poon days are over . "
* Some variations are Puddin ' Tame and , Puddin ' Tain .
We thought Grandma was saying " Puddin ' Tang " and believe that was influenced by the popularity of the powdered orange drink " Tang " at the time ( late 60s / early 70s ) .
For lovers of modern indie rock , Houston has its very own Pearl Harbor Day — October 13 , 2006 .
The battle took place at the Rice Military nightclub Walter 's on Washington , when , early in the set of San Francisco punk - folk - blues band Two Gallants , all hell broke loose .
It all started with that new bane of live music in a rapidly infilling Inner Loop — a noise complaint from a neighbor who evidently was unduly disturbed by the strummings of the two - piece , acoustic guitar and drums band .
Before it was all over , burly Gabriel M. Rodriguez of the Houston Police Department wound up storming the stage and tackling Two Gallants frontman Adam Stephens — a blond , wispy vegan who looks to weigh about 135 pounds , who may or may not have cussed Rodriguez out .
A melee ensued which ended with Rodriguez Tasing two concertgoers , the dismemberment of a vintage bass guitar belonging to one of the other bands on the bill and the arrests of three other attendees and Stephens 's Two Gallants bandmate Tyson Vogel .
In the aftermath , about ten cop cars and the police chopper descended on the club .
Info touring indie rock bands
For tech - savvy , twentysomething music fans across America , this was a huge story .
Before the night was over , accounts of the debacle raged and crackled over the Internet like a South Texas brushfire .
Footage from several camera - phones found its way to MySpace and YouTube , and , eventually , local TV news .
All the major music sites from new media kings Pitchfork to old - line stalwarts Rolling Stone and Spin ran with the story .
Colin Meloy of the Decemberists haughtily commented on one blog that his band would not be coming back to Houston until the situation was rectified .
Other commenters in the blogosphere aimed potshots at Houston — that we were a suburban wasteland where the nocturnal strummings of San Francisco folkies attract redneck cops hell - bent on cracking skulls .
And indeed , if the comments on the Houston Chronicle 's Web site are anything to go by , there are some locals who positively exulted in presenting that image to the world .
Ryan Chavez , the promoter of this show and hundreds of others over what had then been six years , was crushed .
" As much as I 've tried to have a positive outlook on it since the day I 've started booking , [ after ] the Two Gallants ­incident I kind of started to reassess my actual outlook on how viable Houston is ever going to be as a big scene where people go out to touring band shows en masse like they do in other cities with comparable populations .
It 's not gonna happen . "
At the time of the Two Gallants donnybrook , Chavez , who is now 26 years old , was already a scene veteran , both onstage and off .
As a musician , he 'd toured extensively in local band Panic in Detroit and Chicago punk group the Smoking Popes .
Offstage , he was one of the founders of Hands Up Houston , a booking collective that firmly reestablished Houston as a viable touring option for up - and - ­coming , buzzed - about bands from all over the world .
Back in 2002 and 2003 , Chavez thought , with some justification , that he and his friends were revolutionizing Houston 's live music scene .
Hands
Up stopped the exodus of bands ignoring Houston .
But today , Super Unison , the booking company Chavez founded from the ashes of Hands Up in 2005 , has only five shows on its docket through the end of July .
And beyond Super Unison , what 's left on the agenda for this summer 's touring shows looks weaker than it has since 1999 — other than a couple of gold star dates like June 's Tom Waits coup , it is little more than a litany of crappy butt - rock bands , Branson - style country , the same classic rock shed shows and metal , punk , Christian and American Idol package tours that play everywhere .
And that " Why do all the cool bands skip Houston ? " chorus is swelling to life all over again .
Kurt Brennan , a co-owner of indie- ­centric record store Sound Exchange and an occasional promoter of shows , has heard it all before .
" There 's nothing more depressing than when you bring some band to town that has never been here before , and everyone 's been whining about , ' How come this band never plays Houston , they always play Austin ! '
And so you go to all the time and effort of setting up the show and hardly anybody shows up , and then the next day you hear people whining that there 's never anything going on in this city . "
And for his part , Chavez , the guy who a few years ago thought he could really make things better here , is now resigned about the entire nature of the city of Houston — the average bands , the substandard venues , the sprawling layout of the city .
Everything and nothing is to blame .
" I do n't personally think it 's Houston 's fault , " he says .
" I do n't blame the show­goers , I do n't blame anyone .
It 's just not the kind of town that Houston is . "

So some trendy , overhyped blog bands skip Houston ... So what ?
After all , Radiohead comes to The Woodlands on all their tours , and The Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion in The Woodlands is one of the most well - attended concert sheds in the country .
And getting beyond the indie music bar scene , if you look at the big picture , Houston 's doing pretty well .
Hip - hop and zydeco are thriving here .
In the larger economy , the post - real estate bubble , post - cheap oil economies of many American cities are in free fall , while Houston 's is doing ( relatively ) fine .
In a recent spate of " Places Rated " polls from business magazines , Houston 's rankings have been more than respectable .
In bottom - line terms , why does a lively indie scene matter ?
It 's hard to quantify .
One who has tried is Dr. Richard Florida , an author and urban studies theorist at the University of Toronto .
Florida has studied the economic value of music scenes in 31 North American cities ( Houston not among them ) , and concluded they are a major component in attracting and keeping creative young people in town , and that often those people go on to create lucrative businesses .
" Music combines with technology and business trends to put these places on the map , " Florida writes in his study 's conclusion .
" It reflects their openness to new ideas , new people and new sounds .
If you really want to see entrepreneurs in action , go talk to local musicians . "
Florida 's study further contends that successful music scenes signal " the rise of regional ecosystems that are not only open to new sounds and new ideas , but have the size , scale and commercial oomph to retain key talent and turn their ideas into global commercial successes .
Once music scenes of this scale get going , they produce a logic and momentum of their own and signal that more entrepreneurship is on the way . "
While Florida 's data , methodology and conclusions are debatable , and his focus somewhat blindered in that it was focused on indie rock , the exodus of a certain type of creative person from Houston is not .
For decades , Houston has exported musicians to cities with livelier scenes at a depressingly steady clip , with almost none moving here from elsewhere in return .
As Florida points out in one of his studies , Win Butler founded the Arcade Fire in Montreal after moving from Houston .
We also lost Greg Ashley and Jolie Holland to San Francisco , where their recordings have won attention from fans and critical notice all over the world .
We lost Mando Saenz to Nashville and Hayes Carll to Austin , and each of their latest recordings made at least a dent in the national psyche this year .
And those are just some of the more famous ones — every band in Austin seems to have a couple of exiled Houstonians in it .
And then there are the people who are simply music fans .
How many one - time fixtures at places like Rudyard's , Mary Jane 's or the Proletariat have now decamped to Austin , San Francisco and New York ?
Maybe most of them were just slackers , but surely at least a few have gone on to prosper .
On the flip side , how many recent college grads from other parts of the country turn up their noses at even the prospect of coming to Houston sight unseen ?
In many of their minds , Houston is a cousin city to Coketown in Charles Dickens 's Hard Times , a town populated by and solely for Gradgrind - like engineers and scientists where facts and statistics must always trump fancy and the spirit of bohemia .
Given a choice of moving to , say , Seattle , or Houston at the same salary adjusted to local cost of living , how many would choose Houston ?
The question answers itself .
Music matters , and , like it or not , the music that matters most to a great many young , educated new entrants into the workforce is indie rock .
And that scene in Houston is definitely ailing .
_____________________
Like Chavez , Erik Carter is one of those rare Houstonians who both work in the indie rock industry and have a certain degree of national clout .
Carter helms the Houston office of the Kork Agency , a booking company with offices here and in the San Francisco Bay Area and with a roster comprised of more than 100 of the nation 's top indie rock bands .
( Among them : Of Montreal and locals such as Fatal Flying Guilloteens and Indian Jewelry . )
" For a town of four million people , we have one of the weakest scenes in terms of people going to shows , which perpetuates bands not coming here , " says Carter .
" I just routed a band a day off instead of playing here .
Most of that was because 50 people came to their last show here while they were doing 400 in similarly crappy markets .
We took the cake as the worst show in a seven - week tour .
I proposed Houston to one of my other bands and the immediate response was , ' Houston !
God no ! ' "
Right after the fateful Two Gallants show , several other national booking agents echoed Carter 's complaints in the Houston Chronicle .
One asserted that Houston is not as musical as Dallas or Austin .
Another pointed out Houston 's unlucky geographical setting .
East along I - 10 there is only Baton Rouge and New Orleans , both third - tier markets .
Beaumont is not even on national bookers ' radar , and to the south and southwest of Houston , there is nothing beyond fourth - tier markets .
Then there is local radio , or the lack thereof .
Houston 's dial — even in the best of times , never the beacon of glory that some nostalgists would have you believe — has been unbearably stale for this entire decade .
And yet none of that can fully explain what makes Houston the way that it is .
" I 've talked to so many people around the country and asked them , what do you think it is that your town has that my town does n't have , " Chavez says .
" And no one ever really has an explanation , but usually the one that I come back to is that all these other cities have a decent history of really good local bands , local bands that make it onto the national spotlight , and Houston has never had that . "
_____________________
In the early part of the decade , Chavez and friends Bucky Thuerwachter , Lance Scott Walker , Russell Etchen and Jason Colburn founded the Hands Up Houston show collective to bring to town the bands that had been skipping Houston .
They would also see to it that the musicians were fed and housed while they were here , and see to it that the crowds were at least decent .
They already knew going in that radio would be of little help , so instead they relied on old - fashioned methods such as flyering clubs and telephone poles as well as the Internet , which they had more or less grown up with .
From the beginning , Hands
Up operated under strict " punk " dictates :
None of the founders were to profit from these shows ; instead , the excess cash was to be rolled back into the kitty , so that the others could both attract more and better shows and to subsidize the duds , of which , to be fair , there were more than a few .
" We kept it small at first , and looking back , that was pretty smart , " says co-founder Lance Scott Walker , whose band Port Vale also played the very first Hands Up show .
" In the beginning , what we did was for the city , and not for us . "
As Jeremy Hart wrote in the Houston Press in late 2001 , their hard work was paying off .
" Some national bands are now skipping Austin completely in favor of Houston , believe it or not , and more good independent bands are coming to our fair city now than at any time since the early ' 90s , " Hart enthused .
" In just over a year and a half , Hands Up has managed to build a fan base that will go to just about any show the collective books .
In essence , Hands Up has become a brand name and a focal point for the sprawling Houston music scene . "
What 's more , it gave Houston 's indie music fans a focal point on the Web .
Hands
Up 's online message board became the spot on the Internet for gossip , rants , ­consensus - forming and debate for indie kids from Lake Jackson to Katy and all points in between .
Not to mention bringing people to shows — one of the staples of the board was ( and is , as the board is today all that remains of Hands Up ) a roll call of who was going to see what .
In a city with conservative - to - the - point - of - idiotic commercial rock radio , Hands Up's Web site served as both Houston 's Pitchfork and its de facto version of Seattle 's influential radio station KEXP .
By 2004 , Chavez 's national reputation as a promoter was growing , as was his ambition .
He felt like he had accomplished his goal of making Houston a viable market for touring bands .
Why not make his living at it ?
Teaming up with Andrew Morgan , he formed Super Unison and junked the " no profits " rule .
Hands
Up ground to a halt a few months later , but Super Unison picked up where they left off , and yet , slowly but surely , both Morgan ( who did n't want to speak for this article ) and Chavez were souring on Houston .
After too many months of taking baby steps forward with well - attended shows , followed by expensive debacles that nullified his gains , Chavez admits that he was starting to lose his edge as a super - aggressive promoter .
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were almost the final straw .
During the Rita scare , Morgan and Chavez headed to Austin , which was then in the throes of its annual Austin City Limits music festival .
There , they made a joint decision .
They would leave Houston : Morgan would head to Seattle , and Chavez to Philadelphia , where each had a job waiting for him .
Morgan kept his word .
He is now living in Seattle , working for booking agency Billions and , to hear Chavez tell it , is as happy as he can be .
But despite having a dream industry job waiting for him in Philly , an increasingly glum Chavez stayed put in Houston .
The Two Gallants brouhaha came about a year after that decision , and today , Chavez sounds both far too bitter and far too wise for his 26 years .
" I 've started being a lot more realistic about putting in offers for bands , because Houston 's just never gonna show the support that agents or managers would like to see . "
One problem he sees is that there are too few great local bands .
Local bands , he explains , are the gateway drug for local fans to get into the scene — at any rate , that was the way it worked for him when he first got involved .
" I get the feeling these days that there is no local band that can draw a shit - ton of people on any given night , " he says .
" I 'll help out bands with their CD release shows and it still wo n't do more than 200 , 250 people . "
It 's not just local , he adds .
" I used to blame people for not going to shows , but I do n't do that anymore , " he says .
" I do n't think there 's a whole ton to be excited about right now .
I think the pool of musicians and bands right now is so bad .
There are so few great musicians in the world right now . "
As for the locals , Chavez agrees with the assessment of Houston as a town of a thousand " side projects " and about five ( if that ) really good bands .
Part of the problem , Chavez believes , is that too many local groups are focused on getting out of town and touring .
" I personally used to be one of them — all I wanted to do was get out on the road and tour , tour , tour and be a band for real , but you know , you 're from Houston .
You 've got a lot more to work on besides getting out of here , like writing great songs , and practicing , recording more than one album every four years .
Be a good band .
Make it in Houston first . "
And then there are the venues .
For years , Houston lacked adequate mid-capacity clubs , but when the Meridian and Warehouse Live opened , that void was filled .
Today , the shortage is at the small club level .
" In Chicago , something can be happening at any number of bars that all have a good vibe ; all of your friends want to be there , " says Chavez .
" There 's just not that kind of venue here .
I guess some people like going to the Mink , but I do n't care .
I like the Mink as much as I like Walter 's , and I still do n't go to Walter 's unless it 's a show that I am doing .
All they are is bars with stages , and that 's all there is in this town . "
Walker , Chavez 's old Hands
Up cohort who is living in New York and working on a book about the early days of Houston 's rap scene , thinks Houston 's age - old , ­bigger - is - better attitude is to blame .
" I think the mentality in Houston has always been for big clubs , " he says .
" Houston is big .
Texas is big .
That 's always been the thing .
It 's not a quaint little town . "
Erik Carter , the Kork Agency booker , agrees with Chavez about the substandard venues .
" I quit drinking and now I barely go out , " he says .
" I 'm married and I do n't drink .
Why would I want to go stand up for seven hours so I can see a poorly mixed garage band , let alone one that I 've never heard of ? "
Many would say " passion for live music . "
" My passion leads me to buy the record and stay in my air - conditioned home and listen to it , " Carter retorts .
Chavez will second Carter 's contention about poor mixes .
" I 'm aware of most of the house sound guys in Houston , and man , some of 'em are total train wrecks , " he says , " The second any feedback comes up , they just freak out and can't fix it .
A bunch of them here have been doing it wrong so long that their ears are destroyed .
There were any number of bad ones that came and went through Mary Jane's , and then there was one guy who was great , and then he died . "
Carter also cites the cliquishness of Houston 's Montrose - oriented bohemian set .
" I think there 's such a Main Street mentality where the only place that matters is the Montrose .
As soon as something is Outer Loop or not specifically within your music clique ... People do n't really market to everybody . "
And that 's important , Carter believes , because shows with a critical mass of nothing other than music fanatics can be utterly dreary .
" I was just talking to Larry Pirkle and he said he was DJing downtown and the people there did n't know what song he was playing , but those people were on the dance floor dancing and having fun , " he says .
" They were n't sitting by the turntable trying to see which pressing of the 12 - inch he had like a bunch of indie rockers would , and not dancing .
As a DJ you 've got your regular people and your regular music scene people , and the regular people are actually a lot more fun . "
Which speaks to another concern .
Sure , our local bands , venues and sound men are not the greatest , true enough , and cliques can be off - putting to newcomers and less trendy music fans .
And perhaps the smoking ban has taken a bite out of the draw too , and other factors to consider include Houston 's ridiculous sprawl , woeful nocturnal public transit and relative shortage of traditional college students .
And then there is the puzzling culture some clubs have here of starting weeknight shows at 11 with an interminable sound - check and one or two opening bands .
Maybe the problem goes deeper than that — to the heart of Houston 's multiethnic soul .
In 2006 , Harvard political scientist Robert D. Putnam , the author of 2000's well - received cultural study Bowling Alone , published a paper called " E Pluribus Unum : Diversity and Community in 21st Century America . "
Putnam examined 41 American sites , ranging from rural areas in Washington state and North Dakota to big cities such as Los Angeles and Houston , on the benefits and drawbacks of cultural diversity .
Putnam 's findings were disheartening to all lovers of diversity , Putnam included .
People in diverse communities , he found , lose trust in everybody , not just people from other racial groups but also from within their own kind .
They disbelieve their local newspapers , the mayor , their neighbors , everybody .
Putnam contended that diverse cities like Houston were not marred by anything so dramatic as outright ethnic hostility .
Instead , " inhabitants of diverse communities tend to withdraw from collective life , to distrust their neighbors , regardless of the color of their skin , to withdraw even from close friends , to expect the worst from their community and its leaders , to volunteer less , give less to charity and work on community projects less often , to register to vote less , to agitate for social reform more , but have less faith that they can actually make a difference , and to huddle unhappily in front of the television ... Diversity , at least in the short run , seems to bring out the turtle in all of us . "
Despite his gloom , Putnam believes that over time , these distinctions disappear , noting that in the 1960s , a wedding of an Irish American and an Italian American was thought of as " a mixed marriage , " and that even now in rural North Dakota , it 's the height of cosmopolitanism to invite the Swedes to a Norwegian picnic .
" What we should n't do is to say that they should be more like us , " Putnam later told the Financial Times .
" We should construct a new us . "
_____________________
Sure , there are diverse cities with thriving music scenes — London , New York , San Francisco , Los Angeles .
But with the exception of sprawling L.A. , which also just happens to be the world headquarters of the entertainment business , few of those cities heap on the rest of Houston 's drawbacks : mediocre bands , terrible radio , second - rate venues , poor public transportation , killer sprawl and a diverse populace of mildly paranoid , cynical souls .
Houston could be doing worse .
Every show that has a good draw is a testament to the dedication of those who do turn up .
And there are some shows that go off really , really well .
Those are where the " new us " is being forged .
These would include the Starbucks Mixed Media series of concerts at the Museum of Fine Arts .
The 2005 kickoff of this event , which featured Grandmaster Flash spinning records in front of the Jean - Michel Basquiat paintings his music helped inspire , hit Houston 's indie scene like a double - jolt of espresso .
Upwards of a thousand hip kids were dancing the night away in some of Houston 's most well - appointed and cosmopolitan surroundings , dancing and drinking in cutting - edge sounds .
This and the succeeding events in the still - running summer series give people the feeling that Houston can approach a New York State of Vibe .
" It works because it 's an event , " says Chavez .
" It 's something different — it 's not just another show at another fucking bar . "
Maybe that " same old shows in the same old bars " paradigm is dying alongside the rest of the old - school music business model .
If people are n't willing to pay for recorded music , would n't it follow that many of them would turn up their noses at live music in its most humdrum form too , even if the live experience is , at least theoretically , much more visceral ?
In a day and age when far too many bands eschew showmanship , is it any wonder that the answer is yes ?
Kids today have other priorities .
" No matter what happens , it 's never gonna be like pre-Internet days again , for touring or CD sales , " says Brennan of Sound Exchange .
" Music is now one notch of importance below where it was , especially for kids .
My 14 - year - old niece has to have a cell phone so she can text - message ; she has to have a MySpace account .
If you look back , kids were the number one demographic for buying music and going out for decades and decades , and I think now it 's number four for sales . "
Brennan confesses to a case of scene fatigue .
" I 'm kinda getting tired of going to the same places and seeing the same things .
The bar scene is great for the social aspects , but not so much for the music . "
Maybe the future lies in big events like Eric " Ceeplus " Castillo 's Mixed Media series on one end and in more intimate and inexpensive house parties on the other .
Or in other nontraditional venues : in Houston , NiaMoves , a yoga studio in the Heights , is hosting a Houston offshoot of Dallas 's The Bend Studio series , offering up - close - and - personal evenings with Americana artists in an environment much more serene than a bar .
Houston abounds with odd places .
Brennan thinks we should use them .
" I went and saw that band Extra Golden at the Orange Show , " Brennan says .
" It 's always great to be at the Orange Show , but it is just being in a different place , around people who are just there for the music , not to hang out and drink ; it was so ­enjoyable . "
Special places for special shows in a city that is , perhaps , " special " in the euphemistic sense of the word .
" Yeah , a little bit ! " laughs Chavez . " [ Houston is ] the special child that , when they do something that 's especially smart , you 're like , ' Oh wow !
Look at you ! ' "

The go - fast gurus at Ferrari are working on a successor to the jaw - dropping Enzo that could be the lightest , quickest two - seater ever to roll out of Maranello .
We told you months ago the Scuderia 's next supercar would be based on the Millechili concept that embraces the " less is more " ethos .
Ferrari sees lighter cars as the best way to reach its goal of increasing fuel economy 40 percent and reducing emissions 25 percent without compromising its reputation for performance .
The Millechili is a guidepost to that greener future .
The future arrives in two years in a 600 - horsepower car that weighs 2,200 pounds .
According to Car and Driver , Ferrari will introduce the as - yet - unnamed supercar in 2010 .
* C&D * says it wo n't be called the Millechili – but it will look a lot like the styling concept ( pictured ) Ferrari showed off last year .
The car will have an aluminum space frame similar to the F430 Scuderia but stretched to a wheelbase of 104.3 inches and fitted with a V10 engine .
That 's a break from Ferrari 's tradition of putting V8s or V12s in its road cars , but Ferrari won five consecutive Formula 1 championships with its V10s , so the engine undoubtedly will be a corker .
The only thing sweeter than the car 's engine is its weight .
Millechili is Italian for 1,000 kilos , and that 's just what the car will weigh .
Not only is that 660 pounds lighter than the Enzo , it 's 200 pounds lighter than a Mazda MX - 5 Miata and only 216 pounds heavier than the Lotus Elise .
The Enzo accelerated from 0 to 62 mph ( 100 kph ) in 3.65 seconds and had a claimed top speed of 225 mph , so it 's safe to say the Millechili will be very quick .
It 'll certainly have one of the best power - to - weight ratios of any car on the road , coming in behind the Caparo T1 and SSC Ultimate Aero but ahead of the Saleen S7 and Bugatti Veyron .
Active suspension will adjust the ride height for maximum aerodynamic efficiency and handling .
That kind of performance does n't come cheap .
If you want one of the 300 or so cars Maranello plans to build , be ready to lay out half a million dollars .

Handwritten Typographers
Hit pause for a moment and consider how greatly we – people in the digital age – are indebted to typographers .
Almost all of our visual communication is delivered using the products of their craft : newspapers , SMSes , instant messages , emails , web pages , signs , posters , billboards ; the list of purposes is endless .
In these days where looping strokes have been replaced by keyboard clickety - clack , typographers define the style and tone of our missives .
Would you like to be elegant , modern , childish or ... disturbed ?
Then you can choose between Garamond , Montag , Comic Sans , Zebraflesh , and a thousand more .
There 's great power in a typeface , but what 's always interested me more than the typeface is the designer behind it – why did they create the typeface ?
Where did their inspiration come from ?
How did they start ?
Lately , I 've been asking just one question , though .
Something which has always intrigued me : these people that help us communicate ... how do they themselves communicate ?
If we strip away the monitors , and the printing presses , and the typefaces ... how would William Caslon have written on a post - it note ?
The handwriting of typographers intrigues me because it raises so many questions , big and small :
Do typographers exert some extraordinary control of the pen that laypersons do n't ?
Does a typographer 's handwriting influence the typefaces they produce ?
Has the rise of digital communications made handwriting redundant ?
Do modern typographers , born of digital tools , lack the finesse of their more wizened counterparts ?
If so , does that change the way their type is designed ?
And then , there 's just something strangely ... meta ... about looking at the handwriting of people who work with type .
So , to satisfy my own curiosity I asked a number of prominent typographers to send me a scan of their handwriting .
This is the result .

Marat Safin 's victory over Novak Djokovic underlined his status as one of the game 's greatest and most unpredictable talents
Marat Safin turned back the clock on Wimbledon 's Centre Court to demolish third seed Novak Djokovic .
The Russian former world No1 triumphed 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 2 , producing a masterclass of brutal serves and heavyweight ground strokes that had the Serb reeling .
In the end it was all too much .
Djokovic conceded with a feeble double - fault into the net .
Safin remains one of the great enigmas of world tennis .
When he destroyed Pete Sampras in the 2000 US Open final , a glittering future seemed assured .
Even as recently as 2005 , he seemed the man most likely to break the Federer dominance , up - ending the Swiss on his way to winning the Australian Open .
Since then , however , he has found himself forced to the sidelines as Djokovic and Rafael Nadal stole his thunder .
Today 's victory had a definite whiff of revenge .
It was a good old fashioned pasting .
After exchanging breaks early in the first set , the Russian went into overdrive .
By contrast , Djokovic appeared edgy and intimidated , struggling to match Safin from the baseline and frequently rocked back on his heels when the Russian teed off on his returns .
The writing was on the wall when he slid to 1 - 6 in the second set tie - break .
Safin simply opened his shoulders and finished him off .
Djokovic was a semi- finalist here last year , and many tipped him to go further this time .
But the script has now been rewritten , with the Federer - Nadal - Djokovic stranglehold broken by one of the game 's mightiest , most unpredictable talents .
" It [ the victory ] came at the right moment because I have a lack of confidence and lack of match fitness , " said Safin .
" To beat Djokovic in the Centre Court at Wimbledon , especially which is not my perfect surface , it was a great match .
I have n't won a match like this in a long time .
The way I 'm playing now I think I can go far . "
Safin will face Italian Andreas Seppi in the third round , while Djokovic will be followed through the exit gate by fellow seed Fernando Gonzalez , the world No14 , who was beaten in four sets by Simone Bolelli , the Italian world No46 .
Defending champion Roger Federer eased through to the third round in straight sets , taking exactly two hours to see off the Swede Robin Soderling .

Anyone who has exchanged stories about atrocious technical support calls will no doubt be aware of the horror stories that come from people who were shunted to a foreign call center where a person with an impenetrable accent proved incapable of providing anything resembling support .
There are some pretty significant economic issues behind these anecdotes , though , as it's not clear whether the poor service is truly turning away customers or if the reduced costs are being passed on to buyers at a rate that draws more in .
A new study takes a look at precisely these issues , and concludes that companies that outsource customer service can wind up doing themselves more harm than good .
The study has been placed online for comment prior to publication by its authors , who are looking for feedback from their fellow economists .
It was enabled by a truly heroic effort by one of the authors , who scanned over 50,000 news reports over an eight - year period in order to gain a fairly comprehensive view of which Fortune 500 companies in the US were engaging in some form of outsourcing ( they found 150 of them had ) .
The authors recognize that this dataset is n't complete , but an Indian trade industry group was able to verify about 80 percent of the reports , suggesting it 's reasonably accurate and comprehensive .
The authors then determined how consumers ' views of that company might be changing as a result of the outsourcing .
They divided the services sent out of the company based on whether they were front office ( which would include support calls ) or back - office services , such as in - house IT support .
Various measures of consumer satisfaction were obtained from the National Quality Research Center .
Measurements analyzed included customer satisfaction , loyalty , consumer expectations , and perceived value of products and services .
The authors included adjustments for the industry involved and the year involved , as various measures tend to increase with time .
Overall , the analysis indicates that offshoring back - office services has no effect on most measures of customer contentment .
Oddly , it actually appears to raise customer loyalty slightly , although the marginal statistical significance makes that determination somewhat suspect .
Things were far more clear in the case of front office services , and the news was uniformly bad for the companies that do so .
Measures of customer satisfaction , customer loyalty , perceived quality , and customer expectations all dropped when companies outsourced .
Although impenetrable accents are the stuff of bad tech support legend , they are n't the root cause of this problem , as these negative perceptions held even when companies outsourced their front office work to a company located in the US .
The authors suggest this can , in part , be explained by the lack of specialized expertise in those providing customer support .
Ostensibly , the potential payoff is that saved costs will be passed on to consumers , which will allow them to perceive the company as providing better value .
The reality is that there was no correlation between outsourcing and perceived value ; the authors suggest the companies are simply using the savings to increase their profits instead .
As a result , from the consumer 's perspective , outsourcing is a complete negative .
Should companies care ?
The authors note that they make use of one measure of overall customer satisfaction , the American Customer Satisfaction Index™ , which has significant implications for a company .
" Higher ACSI scores , " they write , " have been linked to higher firm profitability , shareholder value and risk - adjusted stock returns . "
In essence , by reducing customer satisfaction without offering anything in return , companies that have handled outsourcing poorly ( which appear to be in the majority ) may be shooting themselves in their collective feet .
U.S. launch spy agency based on British MI5 ' Spooks ' who will work inside the country to help war on terror
It 's storylines are strictly fictional .
But the hit show Spooks has helped to bring about the creation of a real intelligence agency in America .
Advisers to George W Bush are said to have used the BBC TV series , which is called MI - 5 in the U.S and has a cult following there , to hammer home the message that a domestic spy agency is vital for the war on terror .
Now the U.S. has launched its own version of MI5 .
It will be known as the Defence Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Centre .
Similar : Presidential advisers are said to have used the BBC TV series Spooks - called M - I5 in the U.S. - as an example of why a domestic spy agency was vital for the war on terror
After the September 11 terror attacks , Mr Bush made it clear that he admired the way the UK's intelligence agencies work - with MI5 operating on home soil and MI6 abroad .
The US has masses of intelligence agencies , but it has always been illegal for them to operate domestically .
The CIA has traditionally done the bulk of foreign intelligence work leaving the FBI to chase home - grown terrorists and spies working out of foreign embassies .
Critics said the FBI was overstretched by its normal criminal work and had missed clues that could have prevented the 2001 terror attacks .
The formation of the new service follows years of behind - the - scenes wrangling between the White House , Congress , and civil liberties groups .
As with MI5 , the agency 's main job will be to gather intelligence spies or terrorists , and force them to leave U.S. soil if they are diplomats - not to prosecute them .
Its formation is part of a flurry of intelligence changes ordered by Mr Bush during his final months in office .
Toby Sullivan , director of counterintelligence , told reporters at a Pentagon briefing : ‘ These sensitive , clandestine operations are tightly controlled departmental activities run by a small group of specially selected people . ’
As with MI5 , he said the new agency 's main job will not be to prosecute spies or terrorists , but to gather intelligence on them , and force them to leave American soil if they are diplomats .
Mr Sullivan said : ‘ We are an arrow in somebody 's quiver .
We identify the possible threat ; and we work with those who are feeling the focus of the threat . ’
Prosecutions would be pursued by the FBI in the same way as MI5 uses Special Branch .
The new service operates under the US Defence Department umbrella .

Experts say the next step for sportsmen and women looking for an illegal boost to physical performance could be gene therapy -- so - called " gene doping . "
Sports physician Willi Heepe said gene therapy means the body will basically dope itself .
If that happens , " the human monster will be a reality , " he told CNN .
The headline links to an article ( with video ) about an East German trans man and former athlete who maintains rather incredibly that he became attracted to women and compelled to have a sex change because he was fed illegal steroids without his knowledge .
There is no doubt that East German athletes were given steroids , with or without their informed consent , in the 1980s , and that many of them are suffering severe health consequences to this day because of them .
I am , however , distinctly incredulous about the contention that steroids can provoke gender dysphoria — and I 'm alarmed that CNN would run the piece without any hint of skepticism about the claim , or even a cursory caveat that it is an atypical trans experience .
Now back to that headline for a moment :
The " human monster will be a reality " bit is pulled from a section of the story discussing the next generation of performance enhancements :
Nothing to do whatsoever with trans men and women , and certainly nothing to do with the allegation that steriods can incite transgenderism .
The story is really an incoherent mishmash of ideas — and , in trying to combine them , the headline on AOL 's homepage conflates human monstronsity with being transgender , even as one trans person related to the story seems quite content with his choice , despite his bizarre rationale for it .
As Angela notes , quite rightly : " The grouping of these phrases is not only misleading and sensationalist ; it practically states that trans men are ' human monsters ' .
" Honestly , what a clusterfuck .
I do n't even know what else to say , except to point out that this is further evidence for why journalists should n't be turning in stories on complicated subjects about which they know jack shit .
The trans angle did n't even belong in this story .
And that 's to say nothing of whoever wrote the disastrous headline .
Anna Goeldi was executed for being a witch more than 220 years ago , the last one beheaded in Europe .
On Wednesday , the Swiss cleared her name .
The parliament of the Swiss canton ( state ) of Glarus decided unanimously to exonerate Goeldi as a victim of " judicial murder " , said Josef Schwitter , a government spokesman .
Several thousand people , mainly women , were executed for witchcraft between the 14th and 18th centuries in Switzerland , and elsewhere in Europe .
Yet Goeldi's trial and beheading in the village of Mollis was in 1782 , when witch trials had largely disappeared from the continent .
Goeldi , a maidservant for a prominent burgher , Johann Jakob Tschudi , was convicted of " spoiling " the family 's daughter , causing her to spit pins and have convulsions .
Yet Tschudi , a doctor and magistrate , was said to have had an affair with Goeldi ; if that had come out , his reputation would have been seriously damaged .

The case was brought to light through a book by a local journalist , Walter Hauser .
The move to exonerate came after a long debate in the eastern Swiss region , and was taken after talks with the Protestant and Roman Catholic churches .
Last year , the canton 's executive branch and the Protestant church council refused even to consider exoneration , but the Glarus parliament urged the executive branch to reconsider .
In June , the Glarus executive branch asked parliament to ratify the exoneration .
The Glarus government said the Protestant church council , which held the trial , had no legal authority and had decided in advance that Goeldi was guilty .
She was executed even though the law at the time did not impose the death penalty for non-lethal poisoning .
A museum featuring Goeldi opened in Mollis last year on the 225th anniversary of her death .

Project Introduction :
This page is no longer being updated .
The PowerLabs Rail Gun research is being continued at the new PowerLabs Rail Gun 2.0 page ( click on link to be taken to that page ) .
The PowerLabs Linear ElectroMagnetic Accelerator ( " Rail Gun " , or " RailGun " ) research project officially began on February 21st 2001 when Sam Parler , research Director of Cornell Dubilier Electronics ( CDE ) , e-mailed me praising me for my experiments with electrolytic capacitors .
The experiments he was referring to all involved discharging such capacitors at very high rates to produce intense magnetic fields for hyperplasic deformation in metal as in the PL Solid State Can Crusher Page and also accelerating metallic objects by means of either eddy current induction and subsequent repulsion as in the PL Disk Shooter , or by ferromagnetic attraction as in both the single stage gauss gun and the multi stage linear magnetic accelerator pages .
Mr. Parler asked if I had any future projects in mind , offering to have his company sponsor me a new capacitor bank ( at this time I had recently moved to college and either discarded or left in storage all of my parts and equipment ) .
This was an offer I could not refuse : although over the years I had attempted just about every experiment I could think of with capacitor banks , my previous attempts at building Rail Guns were never very successful : they would either weld the projectile to the rails , or blow apart from plasma pressure ; never producing enough force to shoot a projectile .
Nonetheless , I still believed that a larger capacitor bank would allow me to produce a Lorenz force strong enough to accelerate a metal armature before it became welded onto the rails .
On his e-mail Mr. Parler mentioned some tests he performed for CDE where currents as high as 40 Kiloamperes were obtained from a single electrolytic capacitor .
I found this very impressive and quickly realized that a capacitor bank built from such capacitors could perform as well as any other pulse capacitor , and as such deliver enough power to successfully accelerate a metal armature in a linear accelerator design .
Such a capacitor bank would , however , be well outside of my University student budget .
Mr. Parler not only helped me design a capacitor bank which would fit my request : 3.2 kV , 16000 Joules ( this was actually more than twice the energy I was hoping for ! ) , and the capability to deliver a current pulse of up to 100 thousand amperes , but also had CDE pay for all the costs of the bank , hardware and shipping .
I can not thank him and CDE enough for it !
With a preliminary design and a capacitor bank to power it I submitted a research proposal to my departmental advisor at the Mechanical Engineering / Engineering Mechanics department of Michigan Technological University .
He arranged for me to work at the Advanced Propulsion Laboratory under Dr. Brad King 's supervision .
The gun was built over the summer of 2002 ( my first summer in college , still as a freshmen ) , in 150 hours of machine shop work and was first fired on October 19th 2002 , at Ressonance Research during the Wisconsin Dells Teslathon .
It has been through several upgrades and been fired numerous times since , including televised shootings for TV6 and The Discovery Channel , as well as having been featured on 2 newspaper articles in local Michigan papers .
In 2004 the gun , currently located at the Michigan Technological University Dynamics research laboratory , has been decommissioned and is currently being replaced by a new , vastly improved design ; The Rail Gun 2.0 ... Project Description and Goals :
The primary objective of this project was to successfully design and construct a linear electromagnetic accelerator utilizing Lorenz Forces from a high magnitude electrical impulse to propel an armature down two parallel conducting rails .
A simple graphic representation of the effect is seen on the image to the left ; the current flows up on rail , through the armature which travels perpendicular to the rails , and down the other rail .
The result is a magnetic field between the two rails ( B = 2 x ( u0/2 pi ) x ( I/r ) ) and an intercepting field by the armature .
The rails repel one another ( F = u0I1I2L / 2piR ) a nd they both repel the armature ( F = ILB ) .
Since rails are both fixed the net result is a propulsive force on the armature , which will be accelerated forward by electromagnetic means ( A=ILB / M ) .
This differs from conventional mass accelerators in that no gases are used , and it differs from conventional electromagnetic accelerators in that the field trails behind the projectile at all times ; since no coils are used coupling occurs at a much greater degree and efficiency values would tend to be higher .
The potential velocities achievable can also be much higher .
The accelerating force between the rails and armature depends on the magnetic field present ( which in turn is a product of the rail separation distance and the current through the rails ) and on the area this field acts upon .
In order for acceleration to be maximized optimum parameters must be chosen for all these variables ( and others which will be mentioned later ) .
The rail separation distance was set at twice the electrical breakdown threshold of air at the peak power supply voltage assuming dry at air STP ; 6 mm .
The 2 x safety margin was chosen due to dielectric creepage considerations .
As far as pulse current is concerned , it can be seen that in order for a high acceleration to occur , VERY high currents must be employed , which in turn requires a high voltage so that circuit impedance can be overcome and the required current can be achieved .
The final design is a series of tradeoffs where higher voltages bring higher currents but at the cost of a higher rail separation distance .
A typical design utilizes around 4 - 10 kV , with higher voltages being used at higher energies .
This particular design calls for a 100 kiloampere pulse which should be accomplished at 3.2 kV .
Good part of the many amateur Rail Gun attempts seen on the Internet failed because their power supplies were simply incapable of supplying the currents required ; even " small " military and research designs employ currents in the 300KA + range , with some of the larger guns going over 5 million amperes per pulse .
Acceleration drops off quickly with lower currents and at a certain point drag becomes higher than accelerating force and the projectile becomes welded by the resistive heating that occurs .
At the same time however , a very high current will cause dramatic rail erosion and resistive losses .
Once the goal of successfully accelerating the armature was achieved the device was then fine tuned for maximum efficiency so that it can be used as a platform for investigating the following aspects of electromagnetic acceleration :
1- Rail Erosion :
This is currently the biggest issue holding back the implementation of linear electromagnetic accelerators :
The very high currents employed to accelerate the armature must flow through very small contact patches , which often arc and dissipate a large portion of the energy available .
The resistive heating that occurs quickly rises the surface temperature well above any metal 's vaporization point , causing extensive erosion .
By studying the erosion caused under different conditions it is hoped that a solution will be found for maximizing rail life ( plasma armatures , different armature compositions , conductive greases , coatings , lower current pulses , are some of the options being considered ) .
2- Capacitor bank Life expectancy : Should a capacitor failure occur it will probably be due to magnetic forces within the capacitor causing connections to physically tear due to mechanical motion ; in this case it must be determined at what current this occurs so that a practical limit for the power supply performance can be determined ( 3 spare capacitors are available in case of individual failures ) .
Also , the capacitance of the capacitors is expected to increase due to cathode anodization ( a phenomenon only common to electrolytic capacitors subjected to voltage reversals ) , and their ESR will consequently increase due to the dissolution of the resulting Hydrogen gas into the electrolyte .
This will be analyzed through current waveforms .
Power Supply and pulse shaping :
The power supply consists of 32 Cornell - Dubilier Inverter Grade capacitors , each rated at 6300 uF and 400V ( 450V Surge ) .
Operating Temperature is - 40C to +95C .
These capacitors utilize the latest technology in electrolytic capacitor construction to store 640J each in a can measuring only 3 " dia x 5.63 " length and weighting 900 grams each .
To put in perspective , that is 40 times the amount of energy it takes to electrocute a human in a package the size of a cola can !
The capacitors are assembled in 8 sub banks wired in series , each bank containing 4 capacitors in parallel , for a total rating of 3200 V nominal , 3.6 kV peak charge and 3088.3uF ( measured ) capacitance .
Stored energy ( 1/2CV^2 ) is thus 16 kJ nominal , 20 kJ at peak charge ( see graph ) .
Each individual capacitor has a 50 KOhm 10 W wire wound resistor for charge equalization and also to serve as a bleeder to prevent unwanted charge buildup when power is switched off .
They are charged through a 900 Ohm current limiting resistor and can be safely discharged through a 6.25 k
Ohm resistor bank mounted inside the bank .
The capacitor bank has a measured internal resistance ( ESR ) of 14.7 mOhms and an internal inductance ( ESL ) of approximately 1uH .
The sub banks were designed using a Genetic Algorithm program that matches every individually measured capacitance value in such a fashion that the overall capacitance only varies by 0.02 % from the total average capacitance between each sub bank .
The design current is 100 kA from the bank , meaning 25 kA per capacitor , with a theoretical minimum pulse length calculated at 56uS , giving the pulse an equivalent frequency of approximately ( 1s / ( 56uSx2 ) ) 9KHZ , which implies that the current will only flow on the outer ( 66/sqrt9000 ) = 0.7 mm of the copper inter connecting bus bars due to skin effect .
In order to counter skin effect related losses the capacitors are inter connected by very large surface area ( 30 in ^ 2 ) oxygen free copper strips each 0.064 " thick ( 1.6 m m ) .
The actual pulse length of the bank was measured at 63.4uS .
The bank is currently fitted with a Fluke 80K6 6 - kV probe for voltage monitoring .
To the left some of the inductors experimented with on the gun can be seen .
By adding inductance to the circuit the pulse length can be increased , making power available for the projectile for a greater duration of its travel through the rails .
At the same time , ohmic heating is decreased and the heat generated is dissipated over a larger area .
It is expected that an optimum balance exists between the benefits of lower losses and acceleration over a longer period of time and the drawback of lower accelerating forces due to the lower currents provided by the inductor .
Rails , Rail Enclosure and Armature Design :
The rails consist of two 33.5 cm lengths of 6 mm thick , 3 cm wide ( 12x.25x1.76 " ) silver plated oxygen free copper .
This length was chosen to keep resistance and cost at a minimum whilst still allowing some flexibility in lengthening the electrical pulse .
Currently the Rail Gun is a " hot rail " design ; I.E. the armature acts as the power switch when it meets the energized rails .
For that , the first two inches of the rails is milled down 1/31th of an inch and covered by a glass - filled Teflon composite which insulates the rails from the projectile so as to ensure a stable magnetic field behind it once power switching takes place .
The rails are held together one on top of the other ( wide sides facing , so as to maximize contact area and magnetic field interaction with the armature whilst at the same time minimizing contact resistance ) by a G - 9 ( Garolite / Melanite impregnated inter woven fiberglass ) composite enclosure utilizing virgin grade Teflon spacers to keep them parallel to one another at a distance of 6 mm .
G - 9 was chosen for its exceptional tensile strength ( 68KSI ) and insulating properties .
Teflon spacers were chosen due to the material 's high thermal resistance ( one of the highest working temperatures of any polymer commercially available ) and low coefficient of friction ( the lowest known to man ) .
The maximum expected tensile force between the rails can be estimated by the formula F = u0I ^2L/2piR .
Using half the rail thickness as the radius and 100 kA as the maximum current through the rails , and assuming that all the current is carried by the entire length of the rails the repulsive force thus becomes F = ( ( 4pi*10 ^ -7) * 100000 * 100000*0.3/2pi*0.002 ) = 100KN ( 1Ton ) .
This can actually become a lot greater during plasma armature tests and with projectile injection .
This force is equally distributed amongst 16 5/16 " - 24 Grade 8 ultra coated steel bolts , washers and pressure nuts so as to prevent buckling under the firing forces .
Two armatures were tested : Al1100 25x25x6 mm and plasma - backed Teflon .
Aluminum was chosen being used because it will melt before the rails do , and thus cut down somewhat on rail erosion .
The length of the projectile was adjusted so that its effect on acceleration efficiency can be verified .
On the Teflon projectile , the aluminum backing becomes a plasma during the discharge and recycles some of the efficiency losses in the form of propellant pressure .
Unfortunately this propellant pressure was so great that it ultimately caused the failure of the rail gun enclosure in multiple places .
Thus a new rail gun design was developed to be able to withstand plasma armature pressures , the Rail Gun 2.0 Projectile Injection :
If full power was to be applied to a static armature the rails and whatever was between them would instantaneously melt under the intense localized heat produced by Ohmic heating as 100 thousand amperes tried to make it through the contact resistance .
In order to prevent the Rail Gun from becoming a spot welder it is necessary that the armature be moving with some initial speed prior to electromagnetic acceleration .
Most amateur designs fail because of lack of knowledge of this .
In this design the armature is injected by a gas gun consisting of a 1000CC Schedule 80 PVC gas reservoir connected to a 30 cm long barrel through a reducer that goes from 1/2 " ^2 to 1/4 " x 0.6 " through a 60 degree taper .
A 1/2 " diaphragm pilot operated solenoid valve controls the gas flow and essentially serves as the trigger for the gun .
634.5 fps , 696km/h , 432.6mph ) .
The barrel is an exact replica of the Rail Gun made from Polycarbonate with virgin grade Teflon rails for maximum efficiency and velocity .
Currently the injector is being operated with Nitrogen gas , which , along with decreasing rail oxidation , also has 30 % lower molecular weight than air , providing higher velocities .
Ideally the injection velocity should be as high as possible , as it will allow the armature to travel the longest distance over powered rails and thus minimize localized rail erosion and kinetic friction .
It would be desirable for a future Rail Gun design to employ a supersonic injector .
Charger : Each individual capacitor in the 20000 Joule capacitor bank is fitted with its own 50 k Ohm 10 W resistor for charge equalization and also to serve as a bleeder which will drain the capacitor and prevent unwanted charge build up .
These resistors cause the bank to dissipate 130 Watts continuously when held at peak charge .
That , and the 20 kJ energy storage capability mean that the charger must output a lot of power to achieve the desired fast charge rates .
The current charger consists in a variable autotransformer ( Variac ) and a microwave oven transformer ( MOT ) charging the capacitors through a half wave voltage doubler ( 0.86 capacitor and diode combo ) .
Peak charging current is 0.8A and peak voltage is 3.5 kV .
Both are monitored from the power supply .
This approach was chosen because of low cost , availability and the fact that microwave oven transformers are current limited , which simplifies the charge circuit significantly .
The charging system is further protected by a fast blow 15 A mpere fuse and a current limiting resistor within the Rail Gun .
I hope to replace this with an inverter - based charger some time in the future .
Completed Device :
To the left is an electrical schematic of the gun .
The projectile switching is assumed lossless and an arbitrary value of 1uH has been assigned to the rails temporarily .
This PSpice 9.0 schematic can simulate the electrical pulse that takes place when the gun discharges and by comparing the simulation with actual oscilloscope waveforms values for rail inductance and resistance can be calculated .
Then , by varying the inductance and resistance of the rails I can find the exact values once the expected and obtained waveforms match up ( see Results below ) .
The gun has 4 major parts :
The pneumatic injector consisting in an air tank / valve / teflon barrel assembly , the 20 kJ capacitor bank , the Rail Gun per se ( rails , enclosure and spacers ) , and a high voltage charger to charge up the 20 kJ capacitor bank .
Below parts of the gun can be seen ( hover your mouse over the pictures for a description , or click on them for a full size image ) :
First the injector / air tank attaches to the Rail Gun , than the rail gun attaches to the capacitor bank , and finally the capacitor bank attaches to the charging supply and the tank attaches to the air compressor or Nitrogen tank at the charging supply .

The Rail Gun circuit has a measured shortest discharge time ( full rail length ) of 63.4uS .
This is very close to the 56uS I originally designed the gun for , and means that the peak power of the discharge will be in the hundreds of Megawatts range ( approx . 320 MW ) .
Notice the lack of oscillation in the discharge .
Discharge current should be 80 - 90 thousand amperes .
This power brings with it a whole range of difficulties , with initial tests causing extensive vaporization of the projectile and rail damage .
It thus became necessary to fit the gun with an inductor so that the discharge time could be lengthened so as to reduce the resistive losses and increase acceleration time .
The fra me capture to the left shows the g un firing with 15 kJ and no current limiting inductor ; there was extensive rail and armature erosion , enough to produce a massive plasma cloud that was fired from the gun and traveled towards its target before extinguishing itself .
The low velocities achieved are an indication that this metal vaporization is where most of the energy was spent .
The frame capture to the right shows the gun firing with a plasma armature at 6.5 kJ without a current limiting inductor ; the gun is very loud when fired this way .
The plasma is a lot hotter but it lacks sparks ; an indication of lower rail erosion .
15 kJ power shot video ( You may also view it online as a frame - by frame capture ) Clicking on the still frame to the left will download the latest RailGun test video ; a 8.3 kJ shot utilizing a pulse lengthening inductor and an aluminum backed Teflon projectile ( plasma armature ) .
Velocities are now estimated to be supersonic , although the muzzle flash of the gun does not allow a chronograph to be used to measure its velocity ...
More on research objectives : RailGuns are by far the most spectacular type of electromagnetic accelerators ever developed .
They hold the record for fastest object accelerated of a significant mass , for the 16000m / s firing of a .1 gram object by Sandia National Research Laboratories ' 6 mm Hypervelocity Launcher , and they can also propel objects of very sizeable masses to equally impressive velocities , such as in the picture to the left , where Maxwell Laboratories ' 32 Megajoule gun fires a 1.6 kilogram projectile at 3300m / s ( that 's 9 megajoules of kinetic energy ! ) at Green Farm research facility .
Their ability to propel objects at speeds which are simply impossible for conventional ( chemical or mechanical ) means makes them extremely useful for a range of functions .
The most obvious one being defense , where most of the research money in this area comes from nowadays , but NASA has also been funding RailGun research for hypervelocity impact simulations which will allow shields to be developed which will protect orbiting aircraft from high velocity debris surrounding the earth .
NASA is also researching the possibility of a launcher which would deliver payloads into orbit at a fraction of the cost of a rocket launch .
Similarly , other studies are under progress for the utilization of RailGuns in Fusion Fuel pellet Injectors for experimental nuclear fusion reactors , and also for metallurgical bonding ; the University of Texas ( UT ) in Austin , identified that the Electromagnetic Powder Deposition ( by a railgun ) process is capable of achieving a coating of deposit material with bond strength equal to the base material while achieving less than 3 % porosity .
This should soon become a repair method for jet engine components , as similar processes are also being employed to produce extremely high shock pressures on collisions between dissimilar materials in an attempt to produce new materials .
Rail Gun technology also has the potential to revolutionize transportation : Sandia National Laboratories is working on a Segmented Rail Phased Induction Motor ( SERAPHIM ) , a new type of linear induction motor offering unique capabilities for high - thrust , high - speed propulsion for urban maglev transit , advanced monorail , and other forms of high - speed ground transportation .
Linear induction motors are already in use for applications such as airport transit systems , subway systems , theme park rides , and industrial material handling systems .
Current Research Status :
After performing over 30 firings , the rail gun enclosure failed due to excessive in bore pressure from a plasma armature test .
As such , it has been decomissioned and a new RailGun was developed .
The PowerLabs RailGun research continues with this new , improved accelerator .
Information on it is available at the RailGun 2.0 page .
Information on the tests performed with the first Rail Gun , along with videos , images , and detailed information on its failure are available through The RailGun Testing Page link .
Future Research : Ultimately I would desire to be employed in a professional research where my knowledge and skills displayed here could be put to use so as to further advance this promising technology .
On a more immediate level , my plans are to take everything learned from this first prototype and build a second one , maximizing efficiency and minimizing rail erosion and maintenance costs .
This second prototype is already under construction and can be seen on the Rail Gun 2.0 page .
A third prototype will probably employ advanced power switching technology , probably solid state ( SCR ) as well as external magnetic field augmentation around the rails .
It will use a supersonic injector and a higher energy storage capacitor bank .
The exact specifications of PowerLabs Rail Gun 3.0 will depend a lot on what is learned from the second prototype , as well as what funding becomes available by the time that research begins .
Any help - financial or otherwise - in designing it and acquiring the required components is of course welcome .
Below some of the components obtained can be seen : a 5500V , 3000 uF , 46000 Joule capacitor bank .
Also seen is a photograph of 12 neodymium N45 grade supermagnets each 2x2 " base with a 2x1 " top and one inch high .
These are the strongest magnets I have ever seen ; in one word , they are Dangerous .
Strong enough to crush fingers , drive metal objects through soft wood , or explode on impact when two are released together .
I will be employing their fantastic field strength as external field augmentation for higher efficiencies in Rail Gun 2.0 .
They have been sponsored by Engineered Concepts ; the cheapest and best magnet supplier on the 'net !
Construction , Plans , Schematics , How - To , FAQ : Due to overwhelming demand for plans and schematics for the gun I may some day , time permitting , put together an amateur Rail Gun design and construction manual .
This particular gun took 150 hours of design and construction work before it could finally be fired and although specific plans are not available at the time , a complete and detailed log of the construction effort , including pictures and videos , is available for free at the Rail Gun Construction Effort page .
Information on the tests performed and cause of failure is available at the Rail Gun Testing Page .

Eating a diet high in whole grains and other fiber - rich foods can drastically lower a person 's risk of pancreatic cancer , according to a study conducted by researchers from the University of California at San Francisco and published in the " There is a possibility that diet can affect one 's risk of pancreatic , as well as other cancers , " researcher June M. Chan said , " and that eating a diet rich in a wide variety of grains is likely to not only help in the prevention of diabetes and heart disease , but also this very deadly cancer .
" Researchers examined grain intake among 2,233 Bay Area residents , 532 of whom had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer .
The age , body weight and gender distributions were similar among those who did and did not have cancer , but the cancer patients were more likely to be smokers .
The researchers found that those who ate two or more servings of whole grains per day had a 40 percent lower risk of developing pancreatic cancer than those who ate less than one serving daily .
Similarly , those who ate 26.5 grams or more of fiber daily had a 35 percent lower risk of contracting pancreatic cancer than those who ate 15.6 grams or less .
Those who ate two or more servings per week of donuts or cooked breakfast cereals had a higher risk of pancreatic cancer than those who ate less than one serving per month .
The researchers speculated that their inability to distinguish between sweetened or instant and whole grain breakfast cereals might have been responsible for this finding .
" The risk reductions associated with some whole grain foods and fiber provide general support for the hypothesis that whole grains are better than more refined and sweetened grains for pancreatic cancer prevention , " Chan said .
Each year , 33,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer .
The five - year survival rate for the disease is less than 5 percent .
Exclusive AVG has rejiggered the fake traffic it 's spewing across the internet , causing new headaches for the world 's webmasters .
In late February , AVG paired its updated anti-virus engine with a real - time malware scanner that vets search engine results before you click on them .
If you search Google , for instance , this LinkScanner automatically visits each address that turns up on Google 's results page .
According to the company , more than 20 million people have downloaded the new AVG 8 , and this has caused a huge up - tick in traffic on sites across the web , including The Register .
Because the scanner attempts to disguise itself as a real live human click , webmasters who rely on log files for their traffic numbers may be unaware their stats are skewed .
And others complain that LinkScanner has added extra dollars to their bandwidth bill .
Daniel Brandt , who runs Wikipedia Watch , estimates that LinkScanner traffic to the site has outstripped legitimate clicks by nearly ten times .
In this graph , the pink line represents suspected LinkScanner scans , the blue line legitimate clicks :
LinkScanner meets Wikipedia Watch
When we first told the tale of AVG 's fake traffic earlier this month , we pointed out that if webmasters were wise to the problem , they could filter LinkScanner visits from their log files .
Each scan left a unique user agent : " Mozilla / 4.0 ( compatible ; MSIE 6.0 ; Windows NT 5.1;1813 ) . "
But over the weekend , the company changed this user agent on the for - pay version of AVG 8 .
It appears that scans now use these agents as well :
Mozilla / 4.0 ( compatible ; MSIE 6.0 ; Windows NT 5.1 ; SV1 ) User - Agent : Mozilla / 4.0 ( compatible ; MSIE 6.0 ; Windows NT 5.1 ; SV1 ) User - Agent : Mozilla / 4.0 ( compatible ; MSIE 6.0 ; Windows NT 5.1;1813 )
Judging from the log files of two separate web sites , including Wikipedia Watch , the first agent is by far the most common .
Which is bad news for webmasters .
That 's also the Internet Explorer 6 user agent .
Unlike the other two - and the original " 1813 " agent - it 's a perfectly valid agent that may turn up with real clicks .
AVG 's chief of research Roger Thompson says the for - pay LinkScanner is only using the IE6 user agent .
Presumably , the company believes this is more likely to fool malware exploits .
" There are still ways for concerned web masters to filter LinkScanner requests out of their statistics , " he told us over email .
But he did not divulge these methods and did not say whether they might clip legitimate traffic as well .
Many webmasters may have no choice but to abandon log file analysis , adopting alternative tools from companies like Google , Yahoo ! , comScore , or Nielsen NetRatings .
And these tools have their drawbacks .
comScore 's service tends to underestimate traffic from daytime work machines .
And if you go with Google Analytics , you have to tag your pages with JavaScript - and share your traffic numbers with Google .
Plus , these tools wo n't solve the bandwidth issue .
McCain says he does n't know how many houses he owns RAW STORY
Published : Thursday August 21 , 2008
Print This Email This Sen. John McCain ( R - RZ ) told Politico in an interview Wednesday that he was uncertain how many houses he and his wife , Cindy , own .
" I think  I 'll have my staff get to you , " McCain told reporters Jon Martin and Mike Allen .
" It 's condominiums where  I 'll have them get to you . "
The correct answer is at least four , located in Arizona , California and Virginia , his staff told the site .
Newsweek estimates that he has a total of seven properties .
Excerpts :
In recent weeks , Democrats have stepped up their effort to caricature McCain as living an outlandishly rich lifestyle  a bit of payback to the GOP for portraying Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) as an elitist , and for turning the spotlight in 2004 on the five homes owned by Sen.
John F. Kerry ( D - Mass . ) and his wife , Teresa Heinz Kerry .
Pro-Obama labor groups have sent out mailers highlighting McCains wealth , and prominent Democrats have included references to it in comments to reporters .
Twice in the past two weeks , those Democrats have focused on McCains houses .
FULL STORY HERE .
A new campaign video , " McCain 's Mansions : The Real Elitist , " also attempts to make a case that McCain , who owns myriad homes and flies around Arizona in his wife 's private jet , is an 'elitist . '
br >
The video , produced by Brave New Films in cooperation with the AFL - CIO and the Service Employees International Union , intercuts images of McCain 's pricey residences and clips from his statements about the mortgage crisis with the account of a woman who lost her home because , even with her and her husband working four jobs , they were unable to meet their mortgage payments .
" It was tough to have to pack up and leave the house that we love , " says systems engineer Eileen Gillis .
" In the end , our mortage was 15.75 % and we could no longer afford to make payments . "
John McCain has boasted in his stump speech of how " homeowners are doing what 's necessary , working a second job , skipping a vacation , and managing their budgets to make their payments on time . "
" If it was really just a matter of skipping vacations ! " comments Gillis .
" For us , it was a choice between whether we were going to put food on the table or pay the electric bill . "
" Any assistance must be temporary and must not reward people who are irresponsible at the expense of those who weren't , " McCain has insisted .
" I do n't feel like I did anything irresponsible , " Gillis says .
" I did everything that I could to be able to make the payments , and I just could n't do it . "
McCain has also stated , " I 've always been committed to the principle that it's not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly . "
" I do n't think unless you get in this situation that you can truly appreciate how hard it is for people , " Gillis concludes .
An item in last week 's National Review attempted to downplay the elitism issue , insisting that elitism " is not necessarily connected with wealth .
The very wealthy Bush no doubt was brought up in greater splendor than was Kerry ; but fairly or unfairly , he was more at home at NASCAR and Texas than wind - surfing .
...
McCain looks like an old torn - cat pilot that does n't much care what he eats , and Obama tip - toes down a plane 's steps as if he is in a Ralph Lauren ad . "
The National Review further attempted to suggest that the real issue is not elitism but hypocrisy , arguing that wealthy liberals are perceived as hypocrites , while " family values " Republicans can be charged with hypocrisy only if they get caught in sex scandals or abusing drugs and alcohol .
In a similar vein , a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee , asked to comment on the video , responded , " Considering Barack Obama lives in multi-million dollar house bought with the help of his buddy , Tony Rezko , who is now a convicted felon , it 's odd that Obama 's supporters would choose to make the candidates ' homes an issue .

As home prices decline and Washington struggles to end the economic malaise , Wall Street is starting to send a sobering message :
The worst is yet to come .
One of the strongest warning signs came Monday , when shares of the nation ’s most important mortgage companies , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , plummeted .
After falling almost continuously over the past month , in just one day Freddie Mac tumbled another 18 percent , and Fannie Mae lost 16 percent amid concerns that the companies would need to raise billions of dollars in fresh capital .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the nation ’s largest buyers of home mortgages , and traditionally the government ’s backstop for the housing economy .
But with Monday ’s plunge , each of these giants has now lost more than 60 percent of its market value this year .
The declines , along with a falling stock market and growing unease about the possibility of more red ink at big banks , reflect a growing conviction consensus among investors that the current housing slump will last longer , and prove more severe , than initially feared .
As a result , investors are signaling that they are far from convinced that any enterprise  even ones with the strongest backing  can successfully navigate these choppy waters , and that those who do survive will pay dearly .
Aug. 8 , 2008 -- A new gene silencing technique stops HIV cold in mouse studies and promises to become a potent new AIDS therapy with few side effects .
The technique uses short interfering RNA , also called silencing RNA or siRNA .
These tiny snips of RNA are designed to stick to specific genes , which are then rendered inoperative or " silent . "
Researchers have previously shown that siRNA aimed at HIV can shut down the AIDS virus in the test tube .
It can also target the T cells HIV loves to infect , shutting the window through which HIV enters .
Now Priti Kumar , PhD , Premlata Shankar , MD , and colleagues have linked siRNA to an antibody that delivers them directly to T cells -- and to a molecule that transports them to the cell nucleus where it can attack HIV genes .
They used a siRNA cocktail : two siRNAs that inactivate different HIV genes and one siRNA that keeps T cells from expressing the CCR5 molecule to which HIV attaches .
" In mice pre-treated with the siRNA cocktail and then infected with HIV , we could not find any signs of virus for a long period of time , " Kumar tells WebMD .
" And when we treated mice whose immune systems had been reconstituted with T cells from an HIV infected individuals , they were totally able to block expansion of the virus . "
Working in Shankar 's Harvard lab ( recently moved to the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center ) , the researchers used recently developed mouse models of HIV infection .
In these models , immune - deficient mice have their immune systems reconstituted either with adult human T cells or with human stem cells that provide a continuing source of T cells .
" You get a mouse with the immune system of a human , " Kumar says .
This mouse model is a big advance in the development of new AIDS treatments , says longtime AIDS researcher Margaret Fischl , MD , director and principal investigator of the AIDS clinical research unit at the University of Miami .
" The humanized mouse model is very interesting , " Fischl says .
" It would give me much more information on the effectiveness and toxicity of treatments and save time in human clinical trials . "
A management shakeup at Apple sparked by the poorly executed launch of MobileMe has landed the internet service in the trusted hands of vice president Eddy Cue — a man with a work ethic as grueling and demanding as Steve Jobs , says one insider .
When tossing around the names of Apple 's top brass , Cue 's name rarely pops up , but it should , argues Apple veteran Chuq von Rospach , because he 's " as important to Apple 's success as [ industrial design chief ] Jonathan Ive . "
His forte : mapping out the back - end infrastructures that make the company 's " online universe tick . "
Those who are familiar with Cue know him for managing the iTunes Store to resounding global success , but he was also a force behind .
Mac and the ever popular Apple Online Store .
" It 's the not - sexy part of the company , but it 's the guts that make all of the sexy front ends actually work , " says von Rospach , who crossed paths with Cue during his years of managing Apple 's email lists .
Cue 's teams have long been self - contained , von Rospach adds , spending most of their time in " uncharted territory , " implementing technology that never existed before on large scales " under really scary conditions . "
Over the years , he 's earned the respect of Steve Jobs by delivering projects on time , to specification , all while keeping " the darn thing ( s ) a secret " in the process .
Cue is one of few who 've proven up to the task of meeting the stringent demands of Jobs , which is n't easy , von Rospach explains .
That 's landed him the opportunity to work under the command of one of the most methodical minds in the industry while testing his hand at some " really great stuff , " which can quickly become " addictive . "
His secret is to surround himself with equals who are " just as maniacal " about their work , and who accept the absence of middle ground and the constant aura of " burnout . "
" Eddy 's no easier to work with than Steve is , for obvious reasons , " says von Rospach .
" I invariably warned people not to hire into his groups unless they wanted to donate their life to the cause . "
Cue 's latest challenge , as revealed in an email from Jobs to Apple employees earlier this week , is to rescue MobileMe from the mistakes that plagued its launch , repair its tarnished reputation , and steer it down a path that the company can be " proud of by the end of this year . "
Like Jobs , von Rospach expresses confidence in the Cue 's ability to succeed .
He argues that , contrary to popular opinion , it 's not that Apple lacks the expertise to run an internet service on the scale of MobileMe — it already runs the largest global single - instance SAP environment for iTunes — it 's more about " the MobileMe people blowing it . "
Of course , some of the responsibility for MobileMe 's failure also lies with Jobs , who has the final say on which products his company launches and which it does not .
" He 's never been afraid to say ' this ai n't ready ' and pull something from release , " von Rospach notes .
" His rehearsals for MacWorld Keynotes are legendary ( and sometimes brutal ) , and stuff literally has disappeared in the last 24 hours , if he was n't satisfied with it . "
There is one caveat , however : Jobs was trusting and depending on someone to offer up the truth about MobileMe , and whether it was truly ready for prime time .
And the person who told him it was ready to roll was obviously dead wrong , which caused considerable embarrassment for both Jobs and the company as a whole .
" Steve and Apple are n't terribly tolerant of that kind of major screwup , " says von Rospach .
" Just imagine Steve Jobs wandering the hall with a flame thrower in hand , asking random people ' do you work on MobileMe ? ' "
FORMER Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee may be the only presidential candidate to come out of the campaign with more than what he went in with .
Huckabee quietly taped a pilot in New York for a weekend cable TV show that is set to debut on Fox News Channel sometime this fall .
“ I can say it ’s gonna be unlike anything else that ’s on Fox and maybe on cable , ” the folksy politician told an Arkansas newspaper over the weekend .
He was stingy with details but said it would be taped in front of a live audience – most likely at the news channel ’s studio on West 47th Street , where Fox ’s “ The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet ” is taped on weekdays .
“ Politics will be a part of it , ” Huckabee says , “ but it certainly wo n’t be all of it . ”
And what if Sen. John McCain wins in November ?
Would he take a cabinet post if offered ?
“ Why would I want to do that ? ” Huckabee says .
“ I ’m gonna have a good life out here in the private sector , ” he says .
“ Why would I go back to telling everybody in the world how much money I make and . . . barely surviving to have some obscure cabinet post and have some 20 - year - old from the White House telling me what I ’m gonna do ? ”
GOP Stunned By Loss in Mississippi
In a major blow to national Republicans , a Mississippi congressional seat that once voted for President Bush by a twenty - five point margin elected a Democrat on Tuesday .
Prentiss County Chancery Clerk Travis Childers beat out Republican candidate Greg Davis , the mayor of Southaven , by a 54 % - 46 % margin , a spread that several Republican strategists on Capitol Hill characterized as a startling wake - up call for a party in dire straits .
Voters cast ballots for the fourth time in three months for the seat , vacated when Republican Roger Wicker was appointed to fill the remainder of Senator Trent Lott 's term .
After winning the primary and the runoff election , Childers came within 410 votes of winning the first round of the special election against Davis on April 22 , beating the Republican by a 49 % - 46 % margin .
Last night , Childers , a conservative Democrat , again outperformed Davis in many rural counties .
Childers did better than in April in eighteen out of twenty four counties , while he underperformed in just two counties .
Childers held steady in three of the remaining counties , while Winston County produced just ten votes .
Most importantly , Childers held firm in Lee County , the district 's largest and home to Tupelo , winning 58 % of the vote , while improving his showing in DeSoto County , Davis 's home field .
Childers won 25 % of the vote in DeSoto County , better than his anemic 17 % showing in April .
The results came despite national Republican efforts aimed at winning the seat .
Senators Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker , former Senator Trent Lott and Governor Haley Barbour campaigned hard for Davis .
On Monday , perhaps as an unfortunate measure of how Republican the district really is , Vice President Dick Cheney held a rally for Davis .
Closing the gap in DeSoto County , said Childers pollster John Anzalone , was crucial .
" All we were looking to do was to cut the margins there , " he said .
The loss has already shaken establishment Republicans in Washington .
After losing special elections in Illinois and Louisiana , the House GOP conference already expects a bad year for their party .
But those two districts voted for President Bush by eleven and nineteen points , respectively , not by a whopping twenety five points .
" People are going to want change , " said a top aide to a leading House Republican .
" The excuses , that [ Davis ] did n't have the resources or that he was n't from the right part of the district , that 's just not going to hold up . "
In the earlier special elections , Republicans blamed their candidate -- businessman Jim Oberweis in Illinois and former state legislator Woody Jenkins in Louisiana -- for the party 's loss .
As polls showed Davis losing to Childers , national Republicans began to signal they would blame Davis for being from the wrong part of the district .
But instead of blaming Davis , National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Tom Cole issued a surprisingly blunt statement about his party 's own chances , coming a week after a national poll showed Democrats leading Republicans by a wide 50 % - 32 % margin on generic congessional ballot tests .
" Tonight 's election highlights two significant challenges Republicans must overcome this November , " Cole said .
" First , Republicans must be prepared to campaign against Democrat challengers who are running as conservatives , even as they try to join a liberal Democrat majority .
Though the Democrats ' task will be more difficult in a November election , the fact is they have pulled off two special election victories with this strategy , and it should be a concern to all Republicans . "
" The political environment is such that voters remain pessimistic about the direction of the country and the Republican Party in general , " Cole continued .
" I encourage all Republican candidates , whether incumbents or challengers , to take stock of their campaigns and position themselves for challenging campaigns this fall by building the financial resources and grassroots networks that offer them the opportunity and ability to communicate , energize and turn out voters this election . "
Still , losing heavily Republican seats in the Deep South is a big blow to the Washington GOP .
" To lose two Southern seats in two weeks , I mean , oh my God , " the leadership aide said .
The aide told Real Clear Politics that something new is going to happen at the NRCC .
" People look at Cole , and they say , ' What are you going to do to change ? '
And if he does n't want to change , change is going to be forced on him . "
A top adviser to a Republican incumbent who has a difficult race in November already says his boss is not looking to the NRCC for the same help he got in 2006 .
" This chairman badly underestimated how important it is to have top - flight staff , " the adviser said , adding that some NRCC staffers are " toiling " under supervisors with less campaign experience .
" We had been planning all along to operate without much help from them . "
The leadership aide suggested that a former NRCc chairman , Virginia Rep .
Tom Davis , could take on a larger role in the coming months .
Davis , who is retiring after this session of Congress , ran the committee earlier this decade and currently serves as chairman of the NRCC executive committee .
The adviser suggested , instead , that the wounded NRCC presents an opportunity for other members of the caucus to help out their fellow Republicans with political action committee donations , setting up future advancement for themselves .
While Republicans faced a renewed crisis of confidence Tuesday , Democrats celebrated what they said was another failed GOP angle of attack .
" These are districts we have no business playing in , " said Anzalone , who polled for Democratic winners in both Louisiana and Mississippi .
" In ten days , you have two candidates who were attacked at high levels with [ Barack ] Obama and [ the Rev. Jeremiah ]
Wright , and Nancy Pelosi and all that , and in neither place it worked . "
National Republicans ran advertisements slamming Childers for associating with Obama , forcing the conservative Democrat to respond with an advertisement asserting he had never met the likely Democratic presidential nominee .
Both parties spent heavily on the district .
The NRCC spent at least $ 1.29 million on the seat , according to Federal Election Commission reports released yesterday , while the DCCC expended $ 1.84 million in the same race .
Democrats point out that , as reported on Politics Nation earlier this week , Freedom 's Watch , a group that backs Republican candidates , spent another approximately $ 500,000 on the seat .
Adding insult to injury , Davis , the losing Republican , outspent Childers by a little less than a two - to - one margin .
Through April 23 , Davis had raised $ 876,000 and spent $ 803,000 ; Childers had raised just $ 485,000 and spent $ 419,000 .
With more than $ 44.3 million in the bank after the end of March , Democrats can afford that kind of expenditure in a special election .
But with only $ 7.2 million on hand , the NRCC will not be able to sustain that kind of spending in the future .
After spending millions in the three losing special elections , the NRCC is likely to face seriously disappointing fundraising reports for the next several months .
As Childers heads to Washington in the next several days to take the oath of office , Republicans now find themselves at a 37 - seat disadvantage in Congress .
And with a difficult election coming in November , one in which they will likely find themselves financially and politically outgunned , national Republicans are already making plans for the future .
No one , though , is likely to try to force leadership changes before November .
" I do n't imagine anyone running against Chairman Cole , " the adviser to the endangered Republican said .
" Because Who would want this job ? "

Just add class=sortable to a table tag and its column headers automatically support click to sort .
Pretty slick .
But sometimes sorting just is n’t enough .
What if you want to focus on just one or two of the columns in a table ?
In a client - side application you could drag the columns you care about next to each other .
Why not in a web application ?
Enter dragtable .
Like sorttable , it teaches HTML tables a new trick through a simple class attribute .
Here ’s a sample :
Name Date Favorite Color Dan 1984 -07 - 12 Blue Alice 1980 - 07 - 22 Green Ryan 1990 - 09 - 23 Orange Bob 1966 -04 -21 Red
Drag the column headings to rearrange the data in this table .
This is a plain old HTML table with class=draggable set .
To achieve kMaxDHTMLGoodness , use sorttable and dragtable on the same table !
Just set class = " draggable sortable " :
Name Salary Extension Start date Bloggs , Fred $ 12000.00 1353 18/08/2003 Turvey , Kevin $ 191200.00 2342 02/05/1979 Mbogo , Arnold $ 32010.12 2755
09/08/1998 Shakespeare , Bill $ 122000.00
3211 12/11/1961 Shakespeare , Hamnet $ 9000 9005
01/01/2002 Fitz , Marvin $ 3300 5554 22/05/1995
To make the columns of a table reorderable , just follow these three easy steps :
Download the dragtable Javascript library .
Include the library by putting this in your document ’s HEAD : < script src=" dragtable.js " ></ script >
Mark the table whose column headers you want to be draggable by
giving it a class of “ draggable ” : < table class = " draggable " >
That ’s it !
Your table will instantly become interactive .
Q&A
Which browsers does dragtable work with ?
These are just the browsers I ’ve checked .
If you try dragtable on
a browser not listed here , please let me know whether it works .
dragtable
should work for at least 99 % of all web surfers .
Browser Works ?
IE 8.0.6001.18702 Yes IE 7.0.5730.13 Yes IE 6.0 Yes Firefox 3.5 Yes Firefox 3 RC2 Yes Firefox 2.0.0.14 Yes Firefox 1.5 Yes Safari 3.1.1 Yes Safari 2.0 Yes Camino 1.6.1 Yes Opera 9.2.7
Yes
dragtable keeps forgetting my column ordering !
If you set an id on your table , dragtable will save all column reorderings for that table in a cookie and replay them the next time you visit the page .
If you do n’t want it to do this , either 1 . do n’t set an id or 2 . set class = " draggable forget - ordering " .
How does dragtable distinguish a click from a drag ?
This should only be relevant if you ’re using dragtable together with sorttable .
If a user clicks a column header and then moves the mouse some amount , dragtable assumes they want to rearrange the columns .
If they do n’t move the mouse very much , dragtable considers it a click and sorttable will take it as a cue to sort on that column .
The exact cutoff is a 10 pixel radius , but you can customize this by calling :
dragtable.setMinDragDistance(5 ) ;
somewhere on your page .

Roman sarcophagi discovered in Newcastle , 1,800 years after they were sealed
Archaeologists found the remains of a middle - aged adult who lived during the end of Britain 's Roman occupation when they opened a 1,700 - year - old sarcophagus yesterday .
The discovery of the sandstone coffin - and another believed to be from the same family - in central Newcastle was one of the most important finds in the area for a century .
The coffins were buried side by side and were thought to hold powerful residents of the adjacent walled fort of Pons Aelius , close to where the city 's railway station now stands .
Archaeologists from Durham University clean a Roman Stone Sarcophagi which was uncovered at a dig on the site of former office buildings
The lid of one sarcophagus will be lifted by Durham University experts tomorrow morning to discover what it holds inside .
The other sarcophagus has already been opened and removed from the site for safekeeping .
This was found to contain the poorly - preserved skeleton of a child , aged around six years old , which was submerged in water and sludge .
The head of the child appeared to have been removed and placed elsewhere in the coffin , which was an unusual but not unknown practice in Roman times .
It is possible the burial included the remains of an older person in the same coffin .
The tombs , the most archaeologically significant find at the dig , were discovered by a team from Durham University .
In 1903 , two sarcophagi were found at the former Turnbull Warehouse site , in Newcastle upon Tyne , which is now home to a block of luxury flats .
The Durham University team was hired by a development company which aims to build a modern office block on the site once its archaeological riches have been preserved for future generations .
The archaeologists lift the lid of the sarcophagus .
The area it was found in has been populated since the Stone Age
Other discoveries at the site , on Forth Street , include cremation urns , providing evidence of other Roman burials on site ; a cobbled Roman road which experts believe may have been part of the old main road from the South of England to the North ; a Roman well and a Medieval well ; the remains of the foundations of Roman shops and workers ' homes , along with the remains of flint tools from Stone Age hunter - gatherers .
The site has been home to numerous developments since the Middle Stone Age .
It was most recently home to warehouses and offices of the British Electrical and Manufacturing Company and still hosts a disused 19th century Presbyterian Church , which is a listed building .
Richard Annis , from Durham University , said : ' These sarcophagi would have been a prominent feature of the landscape , as they were carefully placed to be viewed , being close to the road and , at the time , raised above the ground .
' They would certainly have had to belong to a wealthy family of a high status in the community , perhaps at Fort Commander level or at senior level in the Roman army .
' Very few people could have afforded to bury their child in such a grand fashion . '
The sarcophagi , about 70 cm wide and 180 cm long , have walls around 10 cm thick and weigh up to half a tonne each .
They are both carved out of a single piece of sandstone .
Each lid was fixed in place with iron pegs sealed with molten lead .
After analysis by the Durham University team , all of the finds from the site will eventually go to the new Great North Museum in Newcastle , where the sarcophagi will be preserved for the public to see .
In Roman times , it was unlawful to bury bodies inside settlements .
Cemeteries were laid out at the roadside , near the gates of forts and towns .
Mr Annis added : ' It is very likely that a burial ceremony would have been held at the tombs , perhaps attended by many people .
' We know that some families hired professional mourners , who would weep and wail and add to the atmosphere of the burial . '
David Heslop , Tyne and Wear County Archaeologist , added : ' For the first time , we are starting to understand the layout of the civilian settlement that provided services to the garrison of the fort , and we can catch a glimpse of the Roman way of life , and death , on the northern frontier of the Empire . '

Meltdown
( Image credit : AP / John McConnico )
The Arctic has a normal melting cycle in which about half of the ice pack disappears in the summer , only to grow back to the size of the United States during the winter .
Still , an alarming recent study determined that the 2 - mile - thick ice sheet in Greenland is melting so rapidly that half of it could be gone by the end of the century .
Other studies have found that the entire Arctic could be ice - free during summer in a few decades .
Lately , research has also found that the Antarctic is also losing ice , which if all melted ( no one expects this to happen anytime soon ) , would cause sea levels to rise roughly 200 feet .
Cracks in the Ice

Being primarily a thin layer of ice , the arctic is very sensitive to changing climate conditions .
Warmer temperatures during the summer months cause the 12 to 15 feet thick ice sheet to melt and break apart .
Last year , researchers reported for the first time that cracks in the ice had reached all the way to the North Pole .
The Ozone Hole
While the Antarctic has an ozone hole that has grown to about three times the size of the United States ™ land mass , the Arctic is losing ozone coverage as well .
In truth , there is no actual hole ; the " hole " is a region of severely depleted ozone , a chemical that helps protect the planet from harmful solar radiation .
Ozone losses in the Northern Hemisphere are lower than in the Southern because warmer Arctic temperatures limit the formation of polar stratospheric clouds that destroy ozone .
But temperatures in the stratosphere , high above the Arctic , have gradually cooled over the last decade , resulting in increased ozone loss .

The Antarctic is so cold that the snow never melts in many areas of the continent .
The region 's average temperature is about - 56 degrees Fahrenheit ( - 49 degrees Celsius ) , making it the coldest climate on earth .
In contrast , the Arctic 's average winter temperature is - 29 degrees Fahrenheit ( - 34 degrees Celsius ) , but it gets warmer in the summer .
The lowest temperature ever recorded on Earth was - 128 degrees Fahrenheit ( - 89.6 degrees Celsius ) , recorded July 21 , 1983 , at the Vostok Station located near the South Geomagnetic Pole .

Every Christmas , thousands of letters mailed to Santa Claus do make it to the North Pole ... North Pole , Alaska that is .
The small town of roughly 1,778 people advertises its ZIP code as the ZIP code of Santa .
The Holiday spirit is felt year - round as candy - cane striped street lights keep things moving along festive places such as St. Nicholas Drive , Snowman Lane and Kris Kringle Drive .
Penguins and Polar Bears

Christmas cards and Coke commercials can be blamed for the misconception that polar bears and penguins live in the same frigid neighborhood .
If penguins of the Antarctic and Artic - dwelling polar bears ever did cross the same frozen paths , the waddling birds would make for very easy prey for the giant bears .
But since penguins neednâ€™t worry about land predators , they have adapted their wings into paddle - like flippers to maneuver through the ocean .

Energy - hungry nations are forging northward as an estimated one quarter of all untapped oil reserves lie north of the Arctic circle , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
Russia has taken the bold step of laying claim to a large swath of the Arctic region in hopes of exploring gas deposits in the Lomonosov Ridgeâ€ ” a 1,200 - mile underwater mountain range purported to hold up to 10 billion tons of the coveted resource .
Even the U.S. is getting involved , sending an icebreaker ship to map out their Arctic territory off Alaska .
While it is believed by some that deposits of petroleum exist in the southern continental shelf , such as the area under the Ross Sea , the Antarctic Treaty makes oil drilling momentarily off - limits .
No -Manâ€™s Land
( Image credit : National Science Foundation )
Despite symbolic images of past explorers triumphantly planting flags at the South Pole , the continent remains the only place on Earth not owned by anyone .
It has no history of native peoples and is governed by the Antarctic treaty , which maintains that the land and resources be used for peaceful and scientific purposes .
This is in stark contrast to the more than 4 million people living within the Arctic circle in several small towns as well as major cities such as Barrow , Alaska ; Tromso , Norway ; and Muramansk and Salekhaard in Russia .
Most Ice
( Image credit : NOAA )
The southernmost continent has roughly 90 percent of the worldâ€™s ice , which amounts to nearly three quarters of the Earthâ€™s fresh water being locked away there .
This has led some to float the idea of towing icebergs to quench dry , drought - stricken areas .
In fact , Prince Mohammed al Faisal of Saudi Arabia once considered a plan to find a 100 million - ton iceberg off Antarctica and tow it to the Arabian peninsula .
Polar Opposites

The Arctic region is essentially a frozen ocean surrounded by land .
Conversely , Antarctica is a continentâ€ ” with mountain ranges and lakesâ€ ” surrounded by an ocean .
Socially and politically , though , the Arctic region includes the northern territories of Canada , Greenland ( a territory of Denmark ) , Russia , Iceland , Norway , Sweden , Finland and the United States .
Bob Barr AP COLUMBUS , Ohio ( AP )  Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr should be allowed to appear on the November ballot with the party 's label , a federal judge ruled .
The party had sued Ohio , saying its requirements for recognizing third parties are too restrictive .
U.S. District Court Judge Edmund Sargus Jr. said Thursday that the state Legislature failed to revise ballot rules after they were struck down as unconstitutional in 2006 by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati .
But Sargus also put his order on hold for 10 days to allow Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , the state 's elections chief , to seek an expedited appeal .
The judge 's ruling is being reviewed , a spokesman for Brunner 's office said .
Ohio requires third parties to turn in more than 20,000 signatures 100 days before the March primary .
The Libertarian Party 's goal is to get Barr , a former Republican congressman from Georgia , on the ballot in 48 states either as an independent candidate or under the Libertarian label .
So far he is on the ballot in 31 states , including crucial general election battlegrounds such as Florida , Colorado and New Mexico .

After 16 years and one kid , my husband and I are considering an open marriage .
Over a year ago , I met another man who I was attracted to and wanted to fuck .
I had met men like this throughout our marriage but never did anything because I was married and respectful of the monogamous relationship we had .
I would just bring that “ crush ” energy home and take it out on my husband .
Our sex life has always been okay , nothing mind - blowing , but steady .
Well , we hit the inevitable rut that couples sometimes get into , and I was bored and frustrated and wanted more than my husband was giving me .
I asked , but he just was n’t interested in exploring anything more than the vanilla sex we were already having .
I gently tried toys , porn , going out to bars and checking out others for three - ways .
He was n’t interested .
So I made peace with the fact that I was stuck with a vanilla guy and just focused on the other parts that worked — good partner , good man , steady guy .
A little boring , but better than a drama freak .
Then about a year ago , I met someone who turned from a friendship into a strong attraction .
Instead of having an affair , I told my husband that I wanted to be able to pursue sex with this person since I was n’t getting what I wanted at home .
Husband got pissed and said no way ( no surprise ) but that if I did do anything , he did n’t want to know about it .
Do n’t ask , do n’t tell .
I did n’t do anything out of respect for him , but it made me resentful .
So I decided to ask for a divorce before entering into an affair , and about five months ago my husband and I separated .
I have been seeing the other man during this time and the sex has been amazing : he ’s doing the things that I begged my husband to do with me .
My husband has been miserable without me and has agreed to an open marriage so we can still be together , be a family , and I can be free to have an outside relationship .
My husband is also free to have an outside relationship .
He now accepts that I ’ve been with another man ( whom he has met ) and that I am capable of loving him as a husband while having a sexual relationship on the side .
This has been a long letter , I realize , but all I want to know is if this is a recipe for disaster .
Am I fooling myself about the reality of opening a marriage up to include outside lovers ?
Does it only sound good in theory ?
> Trying To Find Happiness
Open marriages work , TTFH , but only sometimes — just like , um , what are those other things that only work sometimes called again ?
Oh , right : closed marriages .
Will your open marriage work ?
I could n’t tell you .
But I can tell you something that you already know : your closed marriage definitely was n’t working .
You were no longer willing to settle for the sex life you shared with your husband , you decided to separate , and you were headed for divorce .
Then your husband concluded that being together and being a family was more important to him than being sexually exclusive .
And so you ’re back together — for now .
Will it work out over the long run ?
It could , TTFH , but only if you keep those lines of communication open , treat each other with love and respect , and make sure that , emotionally if not sexually , you are each other ’s top priority .
And if your open marriage does n’t work out , if it ’s a disaster , what ’s the worst that can happen ?
You wind up getting a divorce — which you were about to do anyway .
So I would n’t say that openness is a threat to your marriage , TTFH .
I ’d say it ’s your marriage ’s last chance .
I just started dating a great girl who is significantly younger than me .
I ’m 35 and she ’s 20 .
As a long - time reader , I know and agree with your “ campsite rule ” about having sex with younger people : I have a responsibility to leave her in better shape than I found her .
Part of that is easy — be honest , caring , open , GGG , et cetera — but I would like to humbly request that you ask your readers who have been in relationships with a large age gap what their partners did for them that left them better off ?
Or worse off ?
Love the column and podcast !
> One Less Douche
Honouring my campsite rule — which applies to older folks sleeping with significantly younger folks — does n’t merely require that you be honest , caring , open , and GGG , OLD .
It also means that you do all you can to make sure this young woman emerges from this relationship with no STIs , no fertilized eggs , no restraining orders , no emotional trauma , and with improved sexual skills .
To aid you in doing that , I ’m happy to invite readers to serve up specific , real - life examples of older partners honouring the campsite rule .
Were you once involved with a significantly older partner ?
Did you emerge in better shape ?
Please write in and let us know what your older partner did right — or wrong .
I ’m a loyal fan and a physician who cares for people living with HIV .
I was reading a column from a few months back and appreciated your candid response to an HIV–negative man who was embarking on a new sexual relationship with a known HIV –positive man .
However , I would have hoped that you would touch upon what a guy should do if a condom does break .
According to CDC [ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ] guidelines , if a person receives HIV medicine within 72 hours of a condom breaking or another “ exposure ” , there is evidence that you can actually prevent HIV infection .
Of course , these medicines have to be taken for 28 days , have lots of side effects , and are not always effective .
I would never promote unprotected sex with the idea that you could just take the medicines afterward and have no worries .
The medical world has termed this “ postexposure prophylaxis ” .
It has been the standard of care since January 2005 .
I was just hoping that you would share this with your readers .
From the number of patients I continue to see , I am unsure if this is public knowledge .

Thanks for sharing , PD .
Now for a little sex- positive journalism : recently , the sex- negative journalism of a certain teeveenewz reporter — Kandiss Crone of WLBT News in Jackson , Mississippi —
annoyed me so much that I devoted an entire column to slapping Crone around .
I even urged my readers to send Crone angry e-mails and , er , used sex toys .
Perhaps I went a little overboard .
Crone is n’t the only “ journalist ” out there doing idiotic , sex - negative work .
Fact is , most of what gets written and published about sex is negative and sensationalistic .
This sad state of affairs inspired the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom , the Center for Sex & Culture , Babeland , and journalist Miriam Axel - Lute to launch the Sex - Positive Journalism Awards .
By drawing attention to good , sex - positive reporting , the “ Sexies ” hope to promote fair , accurate , and nonsensationalized coverage of sexual topics .
“ The fact that sex - positive journalism is so rare means we need the help of all of you readers out there to help us turn up those gems of good , objective , sex - positive reporting , ” Axel - Lute says , “ especially in mainstream sources . ”
I ’m proud to have been asked to serve as a judge for the first annual Sex - Positive Journalism Awards .
The deadline for submissions for the first annual “ Sexies ” is March 23 , 2008 .
( The piece must have been published during 2007 . )
Anyone can submit a piece for consideration at the “ Sexies ” Web site : www.sexies.org/.
Anything by Kandiss Crone is , of course , ineligible .

According to reporter Nobuyuki Hayashi , the camera of the iPhone 3G sold in Japan will make a shutter sound every time you take a photo , even if you put the telephone in silent mode .
The reason : all those pervs taking photos up the skirts of unsuspected women in public places .

According to Hayahi , the problem of up - skirt photography is so bad in Japan that most new cellphones have this feature ( if you are a women ) or bug ( if you are a perv . )
According to him , " some manufacturers have even put a louder shutter sound . "
The Japanese edition of the iPhone , however , just makes the normal one .
I really do n't see the point of this measure however : the iPhone does n't have a physical photo button , which really makes extremely difficult to take a clear up - skirt shot .

I mean , I can only guess that 's the case .
Two things to Japanese pervs everywhere : fiber optics and video cameras .
Update : as readers have noticed , you can use Pwnage to jailbreak your iPhone and remove the sound .
Why would you want to do this , I do n't know .
In February 2007 , an article that Jeremy Paxman had originally written for Ariel , the BBC ’s house magazine , was published on the Newsnight website .
It included this remarkable statement about global warming :
I have neither the learning nor the experience to know whether the doomsayers are right about the human causes of climate change .
But I am willing to acknowledge that people who know a lot more than I do may be right when they claim that it is the consequence of our own behaviour .
I assume that this is why the BBC ’s coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago .
But it strikes me as very odd indeed that an organisation which affects such a high moral tone cannot be more environmentally responsible .
[ My emphasis ] Jeremy Paxman , Newsnight Homepage 02/02/2007
This stark admission of partisan reporting by the BBC – coming from someone who has been at the centre of current affairs broadcasting for decades – was a surprise to me , not because I was unaware of bias on this subject , but because someone so highly placed in the organisation was prepared to make such a frank admission .
In June of the same year , the BBC published an 80 - page report with the astonishingly obscure title , From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel .
Now there may be quite a few people who are concerned about the odd wheel coming off our national broadcaster ’s wagon , but why would they be talking about see - saws ?
A subtitle on the cover of the report sheds some light on this mystery , but not much : safeguarding impartiality in the 21st century ’ .
The connection between this relatively straightforward expression of intent , wagon wheels , and seasaws is explained in excruciating detail in the early pages of the report , but thankfully it is not the subject of this post .
In fact , once one has got past the silly title , the report is very interesting , even courageous in its attempt to confront a difficult problem .
This seems to be a genuine attempt to address concerns that editorial policy at the BBC too often reflects the views of its young , metropolitan , university educated , middle class , mildly left of centre employees , rather than the full spectrum of public opinion .
This problem is not just the preserve of people who sign letters of complaint , ‘ disgusted , Tonbridge Wells ’ but as the report makes clear , it is also causing alarm among senior staff within the organisation .
Not surprisingly , I thumbed through From Seesaw to Wagon
Wheel to see if it included any attempt to justify the blatantly partisan line that the BBC takes in the climate change debate .
I was not disappointed .
Skilfully dovetailed into a section that also considers the problems of reporting Holocaust denial impartially , I found a few paragraphs dealing with what the Corporation obviously considers to be an equally tedious and morally reprehensible group : climate change sceptics .
Immediately it became clear why Jeremy Paxman had felt able to be so forthright about editorial policy on the climate change debate in his article .
This is what the report says :
The BBC has held a high - level seminar with some of the best scientific experts , and has come to the view that the weight of evidence no longer justifies equal space being given to the opponents of the consensus [ on anthropogenic climate change ] .
From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel , Page 40
That sentence worried me .
Years of watching the BBC ’s coverage of this subject – with growing astonishment – during which numerous ‘ scientific experts ’ who clearly hold very partisan views on climate change , have been interviewed to provide viewers with what they were lead to believe were objective opinions on the evidence for anthropogenic global warming , has made me despair of BBC impartiality .
I am thinking of people like George Monbiot , Mark Lynas , Professor Chris Rapley , Lord May of Oxford , Sir David King and Professor Tom Burke in particular .
Anyone who has followed this controversy will be well aware that , although such people may be experts on the subject , they are anything but impartial or objective .
In an attempt to discover whether the BBC had organised this seminar in order to acquaint itself with the issues , or whether the purpose had been to obtain some kind of spurious authority for an editorial policy that had long since become ingrained in their news coverage , I thought that it would be worth trying to find out who had been invited to advise them .
Under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act and the Environmental Information Regulations I made the following request to the BBC for information :
1 . What was the name or title given to this seminar ?
2 . Where and when was this seminar held ?
3 . When did the seminar start and when did it end .
4 . A copy of the invitation that was sent to prospective participants .
5 . The agenda for the seminar together with any notes that were provided for the participants .
6 . The names of all those who were invited to attend the seminar as participants , observers or in any other capacity together with their job description , organizational affiliation ’s or any other information relating to their eligibility for being invited to be present .
7 . The names of all those who attended the seminar as participants , observers or in any other capacity together with their job description , organizational affiliation ’s or any other information relating to their eligibility for being invited to be present .
8 . Any minutes , notes , electronic communications , recorded material or other records of the proceedings of the seminar .
Letter to the BBC , 20th July , 2007
Eventually I received their response :
In this case , the information you have requested is outside the scope of the Act because information relating to the seminar is held to help inform the arc ’s editorial policy around reporting climate change .
The only exception to this is the logistic details which you have requested
In this respect I can confirm that the seminar was called ‘ Climate Change – the Challenge to Broadcasting ’ and was held at the BBC ’s Television Centre in White City London on 26 January 2006 .
The seminar ran from 9.30 am to 5.30 prn .
We are also happy to voluntarily provide you with some further information relating to the seminar .
The attendees at the seminar were made up of 30 key BBC staff and 30 invited guests who are specialists in the area of climate change .
It was hosted by Jana Bennett , Director of Vision ( then Television ) , BBC and Helen Boaden , Director of News BBC .
It was chaired by Fergal Keane , Special Correspondent with BBC News .
The key speaker at the seminar was Robert McCredie , Lord May of Oxford .
Seminar had the following aims : · To offer a clear summary of the state of knowledge on the issue
· To find where the main debates lie
· To invoke imagination to allow the media to deal with the scope of the issue
· To consider the BBC ’s role in public debate .
Letter from the BBC , 21st August , 2007
So we know that Lord May , an ex-government chief scientific adviser , ex-president of the Royal Society and a vehement advocate of climate alarmism played an important role in the proceedings .
But apparently the BBC would prefer that just about everything else to do with a seminar which formed their editorial policy on a matter of immense public importance should remain a secret .
There may be people outside the realms of the BBC and environmental activism who would attempt to justify this decision , but I doubt if there are many .
As the BBC does not offer any internal review procedure when a request under the
Freedom of Information
Act is refused , I referred my application to the Information Commissioner ’s Office for adjudication .
After a delay of almost a year , they are just beginning to investigate .
Future developments will be reported on this blog .
You might know Daniel Sudar as the executive chef of Red Lantern , the Redwood City small - plates restaurant specializing in Southeast Asian street food .
But what you might not know is that Sudar also does fashion photography , crafts silver jewelry that 's been featured in San Francisco Fashion Week , designed the stylish black jackets worn by the waitstaff at his restaurant and has performed as a singer and dancer in his native Indonesia .
" I'm the type of person where I can't stop doing things .
One thing always leads to another , " he says .
As the middle of six children born to a silversmith father and a caterer mother who also was a musician , maybe it's not surprising that the 34 - year - old Sudar possesses so many artistic talents .
The only one of his siblings who went into cooking , Sudar knew he wanted to be a chef since he was 7 years old .
He learned how to cook from his mother .
His family raised almost all their own food - everything from guavas to cinnamon to cloves .
If chicken or goat was to be served , Sudar would help slaughter it .
One of his favorite dishes he grew up eating in Central Java is gado gado .
Literally " potpourri , " it is a salad of cooked and raw vegetables drizzled with a warm , creamy peanut sauce .
The year - round dish , he says , can be found everywhere in the Netherlands and Indonesia , a former Dutch colony .
The traditional salad mix includes mung bean sprouts .
But Sudar favors upping the amount of other vegetables .
Sudar 's peanut sauce includes lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves , which he grows in pots on his tiny condo balcony overlooking San Francisco 's bustling South of Market neighborhood .
Sudar left his homeland at age 18 , spurred by his dream to come to the California , a place where he knew people appreciated good food .
Although he had already attended culinary school in Indonesia , he enrolled in the California Culinary Academy in San Francisco to hone his skills .
He went on to cook alongside Gary Danko and Sylvain Portay at the Dining Room at the Ritz - Carlton , with George Morrone at One Market , and with Bruce Hill at the Waterfront , all in San Francisco .
He rose to be chef de cuisine at San Francisco 's Betelnut before leaving to open Red Lantern last year .
Close call in the kitchen
It was a frightening accident at Betelnut four years ago that reinforced just how much cooking meant to him .
A line cook was heating a wok , when flames erupted .
Sudar tried to put them out , but the oil in the pan exploded , burning the right side of his face , and missing his eye by only 1/4 inch .
He was rushed to the emergency room .
" It happened on Halloween , " Sudar says , now able to joke about it .
" I was wrapped in bandages , and everyone said , ' Great costume ! ' "
It took a year for his face to heal , as well as his right hand , which also suffered burns .
Through it all , he missed only two days at Betelnut .
That 's emblematic of his work ethic .
When Red Lantern opened , Sudar worked the first four months without a day off .
Now he enjoys Sundays and Mondays off , when he can relax with his partner , Ray Voorheis , an information technology contractor , whom he married three years ago in San Francisco .
At his own wedding , Sudar cooked the food for 250 guests , made the Sichuan - peppercorn chocolate truffle favors , and also made the five - tier wedding cake he raced to complete just two hours before the ceremony began .
Nowadays , he does n't have much time to entertain , but when he does he likes to go French , bringing out foie gras and cooking with piles of earthy morels .
For simpler gatherings , gado gado offers a taste of home .
With a few quick jabs with a mortar and pestle , Sudar makes quick work of turning heady garlic , shallots , jalapenos and shrimp paste into a thick mash .
As he sautes the paste in a pan with kaffir lime leaves and lemongrass , the aroma is extraordinary .
He stirs in a little water , then coconut milk , palm sugar , a dash of soy sauce and ground peanuts , which will thicken the sauce .
Tamarind time - saver
Lastly , he adds a little tamarind juice to give a subtle sweet - tart note .
If you do n't want make your own tamarind juice from tamarind paste , there 's a shortcut .
Sudar suggests using canned Sour Soup Base Mix ( available in Asian markets ) , which contains tamarind juice .
Butter lettuce leaves , shredded cabbage , green beans , long beans , carrots , cucumber , potatoes and tomatoes are arranged on serving plates .
Then , a generous amount of the thick , zesty peanut sauce is ladled in the center .
It 's a striking contrast in textures and temperatures .
Sudar hopes to open his own Indonesian restaurant some day .
Indonesia is made up of more than 17,000 islands , each with its distinctive flavor profile .
Sumatra is spicy ; Java is sweet .
He believes the complexity of the cuisine has yet to be fully explored in this country .
" I think the cuisine has a lot of potential here , " Sudar says with a smile .
" There are no famous Indonesian chefs here yet .
I 'd like to be the first one . "
Peanut Sauce ( Sambal kacang )
Makes about 2 cups 3 large cloves garlic , chopped
2 shallots , chopped
1 jalapeno chile , chopped ( with seeds )
1 teaspoon shrimp paste ( optional )
Kosher salt
2 tablespoons peanut oil
2 kaffir lime leaves ( optional )
1 stalk of lemongrass , smashed
1 ( 13 - or 14 - ounce ) can unsweetened coconut milk
1 teaspoon palm sugar or brown sugar
1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
1 cup roasted peanuts ( without skins ) , ground into a fine powder using a blender or coffee grinder
1 tablespoon tamarind water or juice of a lemon ( see Note ) Instructions :
Blend the garlic , shallots , jalapeno and shrimp paste with a mortar and pestle or in a blender or small food processor with a pinch or two of salt .
Heat peanut oil in a wok or nonstick frying pan .
Sweat the blended paste with kaffir lime leaves , and lemongrass in the oil for about 3 minutes on medium heat , reducing the heat if it starts to burn .
Add 1/2 cup water , and scrape up any dry bits that have stuck to the pan .
Then add coconut milk , sugar and soy .
Bring the mixture to a boil , and then add the ground peanuts .
Simmer , stirring occasionally , until the sauce becomes thick ; this should take about 8 - 10 minutes .
Add tamarind water or lemon juice and more salt if needed , and serve .
Note :
To make tamarind water , dissolve tamarind paste in an equal amount of water .
An easy alternative to making your own tamarind water is to use canned Sour Soup Base Mix , which contains tamarind .
You can find both products in Asian markets .
Even if this experiment fails , it can be a worthwhile data point in discussions about broadband deployment .

Stock Market Collapse In Pictures
What does a market crash look like ?
Forget charts and graphs , if you want to see what investment risk , a market slide or a volatile stock looks like , then here ’s a different kind of visual .
All around the world , a market crash looks the same , etched in the faces of many who watch it unfold .
When stocks falter , we are faced with the global reactions of disbelief , shock , dismay and fear .
This just brings home the point that we ’re all tiny cogs in a huge economic wheel that works the same no matter where we live or who we are .
Greed and fear are universal .
And we ’re all at the mercy of the same dynamic forces and factors that make us rich or poor .
We are the market after all .
~ The Faces Of Market Gloom and Doom ~
If you ’re experiencing deja vu , then you are not alone .
Every few years , our stock portfolios , our jobs and confidence in our financial situation get shaken by a new economic storm .
It seems like it was just yesterday when the rug got pulled right from under us when the subprime crisis ( and the accompanying credit crunch and real estate market slide ) dominated our consciousness .
This time around , it ’s the global debt crisis , which we ’ve touched upon somewhat during the past year .
Perhaps this page will turn into an album of sorts that captures moments of discomfort and paranoia over troubled markets throughout the years .

Our expressions do n’t lie — it hurts to lose money in the stock market .
But there are ways to alleviate our fears somewhat .
I ’ve written quite a number of articles on surviving stock market volatility , so what ’s a few more suggestions ? 🙂
How To Take A Stock Market Dive In Stride
# 1 Stay diversified and you ’ll better manage your risks .
Do n’t overexpose yourself in stocks in a way that will hurt you financially , especially in the short term .
Spread your risk around by building a well - balanced portfolio , particularly one that suits your investment temperament .
# 2 Do n’t panic .
The market will do what it will do … we ca n’t control the herd .
But what we can do is control our attitude towards it — being emotional will not help and may even hurt .
Panicking may influence you to react impulsively to market movements , which is usually disruptive to a long term investment plan .
Accepting volatility as part and parcel of the markets will keep you better focused on your investment goals .
# 3 Be aware of the fundamentals .
You ’ll feel better by keeping an eye on the fundamentals of the markets , the economy and your specific investments .
Most of the time , the market overreacts to news and the underlying fundamentals are n’t as weak as they may seem , especially when we look at the bigger picture .
# 4 View it as a buying opportunity .
I ’ve mentioned this often — that I love playing the contrarian .
It makes me look forward to corrections and even the occasional bear market ( although when a bear becomes extended , I do start to get uncomfortable ! ) .
If you can afford it , why not move some of your short - term savings into the discounted market , then build your savings back up later ?
You ’ll be buying low !
# 5 Take the long term view .
The longer your investing horizon , the less likely you ’ll lose money ( hence the argument that you should invest as early as you can ) .
This graph by MainStay Investments says it all :
Since 1950 , the best and worst one - year returns widely fluctuate .
However , over longer time periods , the volatility flattens out .
As you can see here , based on rolling periods , the stock market is positive a majority of the time .
In fact , over the past 50 plus years there is no 10 - year period that the stock market has not posted positive gains .
Here ’s more discussion on long term investing vs short term trading .
# 6 Try not to obsess .
It ’s hard not to do but try to keep your mind away from the gloom and doom .
My spouse is addicted to these types of stories and it ’s made him more anxious than he should be .
Think that “ this too , shall pass ! ”
# 7 Put things in perspective .
Check the historical financial charts a bit and it can help put things in perspective .
What ’s happening now will probably be happening repeatedly into the future so hopefully the market ’s cyclical behavior is something you can get used to .
If not , then you may want to rethink your participation in equities .
# 8 Pick up some valuable lessons .
It ’s when things get tough that most of us learn a lesson or two .
I have .
And it can only make you a better investor !
Just check out my bumbling foray into the markets and the things I ’ve learned along the way …
# 9 Reflect .
By reminding ourselves what we ’re in the markets for , it may give us pause and prevent us from making abrupt decisions that may derail our financial goals .
I ’ve put some of my own thoughts into writing , which helps me live through a rough market patch :
Here ’s how I reflect : I blog .
For me , blogging about the stock market is therapy 😉 .
It helps me release my tensions and anxieties in a way that I find productive .
And by keeping connected with my financial blogging peers , I do n’t feel alone ; it makes me less likely to do something hasty .
Funny as it may sound , I do think that some form of release will do a “ stock market chicken little ” a whole world of good ! 🙂

The night her roommate was raped , Angel Castro says , she had a ringside seat .
She was in the upper bunk when the bed below her began to shake .
The man who came into their room that night had no worries about locks or the law .
He did n't seem to care that his victim might try to summon help or that a witness was hovering five feet above his head .
Why should he ?
He worked for the Colorado Department of Corrections , and these girls were his prisoners .
Castro and her roommate were among a handful of females in the Youthful Offender System , the state 's costly , controversial " last chance " program for adolescent felons .
In YOS , juveniles convicted of violent crimes are put through a rigorous boot camp , followed by years of classes and counseling sessions designed to change criminal behavior , then intensive supervised parole -- all with the prospect of being sent to adult prison if they foul up at any stage .
The typical YOS teen is not simply wayward but deep in the woods , and Angel Castro , let 's face it , was no angel .
She arrived at the program 's Pueblo " campus , " on the grounds of the state mental hospital , in early 2001 , after a crazy - ass carjacking that resulted in a woman being stabbed .
Castro pulled the woman from the car and Maced her , but she did not wield the knife .
The judge gave her sixteen years and then suspended the sentence , on the condition that she complete five and a half years in YOS .
Huffing and straining through weeks of boot camp , Castro figured she 'd landed in some kind of super - sized " Scared Straight " program .
But being one of only six girls in YOS , surrounded by 200 male offenders , made her uneasy from the start .
Some of the boys were downright nasty , and nobody seemed to give a damn .
" They were always talking about your butt , harassing you , trying to grab you and stuff , " Castro recalls .
" And the staff would be like , ' It 's no big thing . '
They could n't understand that a lot of us girls have issues with that because of our past history . "
Angel Castro had issues , all right .
She could handle the boys ; they were no worse than the boys she knew on the street , the ones who would try to take you in a basement or a car , with a knife to your throat or a gun to your head .
But the guards -- the grown men who were supposed to protect you from the YOS boys -- they were a whole different kind of threat .
In boot camp , there was a drill instructor named Duane Coleman who made her uncomfortable .
Although he was 36 years old and married , his eyes seemed to be all over her .
One day , when she asked a boy how to put a crease in her shirt , Coleman accused her of doing a striptease .
She 'd never known a cop who talked like that .
When she finished boot camp and moved into the girls ' dorm , she was surprised to find male staff working there .
" They were always in the dayroom , always going into your room , giving you little looks , " she says .
One of the most persistent was her former DI , Coleman .
" He would make small talk , leave , and five minutes later he'd come back . "
In YOS , the guards have tremendous power .
A bad report from one of them can send you back to boot camp .
They can drop - kick your ass to solitary confinement or even start the revocation process , which could lead to your serving your full sentence in an adult prison .
You do n't defy staff unless you really , really want to grow old behind bars .
So when the male staffer showed up in Castro 's room one night , five months into her stay at YOS , she did n't cry out .
Neither did her roommate .
They just tried to pretend that the intruder -- later identified by both girls as Duane Coleman -- was n't there , that this was n't happening .
" I looked down , and Coleman was sitting on my roommate 's bed , " Castro says .
" She had a pillow over her head , and his hand was down her pants .
He looked up at me .
I rolled over and looked at the wall .
He left and came back .
He said something about how his dick 's too big , he broke the condom , but that 's okay because he has a whole bunch more . "
The bed began to shake .
Castro looked at the wall .
After it was over , she listened to her roommate sobbing quietly in the dark .
" She cried and she cried and she cried .
I told her , ' I am so sorry , ' " Castro says .
" I was just sixteen years old .
I did n't know what to do . "
She did n't know what to do about her roommate 's situation any more than she knew what to do about her own .
The night before , in another dark room , she 'd received her own grim initiation into the kind of " opportunities " YOS offered to sixteen - year - old girls .
A 44 - year - old corrections officer named Gary Neal had forced himself on her , Castro says , and she had n't told anyone .
Who was there to tell , she wondered , in a place like this ?
" People do n't understand that you can't always be telling staff what 's going on , " Castro says .
" I did n't want to tell anybody that I was raped , you know what I 'm saying ?
I really did n't .
I was so scared . "
Forged out of Denver 's so - called " Summer of Violence " in 1993 , YOS was a bold approach to a rising tide of youth crime .
The core idea , hammered out in a special session of the Colorado Legislature called by then - governor Roy Romer , was to fashion a hybrid program -- tougher than juvenile corrections , but insulated from the harsh realities of adult prison -- that stressed discipline , education and responsibility .
As originally conceived , YOS would require young offenders -- known as " residents , " not inmates -- to earn privileges and status through hard work and academic achievement .
Rival gang kids would be expected to work together and confront each other over their bad behavior , establishing a " positive peer culture . "
Trained youth counselors would serve as role models and open up lines of communication .
Nothing quite like it existed anywhere .
Corrections officials were wary of its experimental nature and its emphasis on rehabilitation .
Other critics balked at the heavy staffing and staggering price tag ; the average cost per resident -- now around $ 52,000 a year -- was double what it took to keep an adult prisoner in a medium - security prison , making YOS one of the most expensive corrections programs in the country .
But supporters argued that if enough YOS graduates stayed out of the adult system , that would more than justify the cost .
Early results were encouraging .
Through its first four years , YOS boasted a recidivism rate that was less than one - fourth of the rate in the adult prison system .
But in 1998 , the program was moved from its cramped quarters at the high - security Denver Reception and Diagnostic Center on Smith Road to the more expansive campus in Pueblo , and things quickly began to fall apart .
Although the move had been planned for some time , it resulted in a startling shakeup of staff , leadership and policy .
More than 80 percent of the Denver staff refused to make the move or soon fled the program .
Those who hung on found themselves in a demoralizing clash of cultures with corrections officers who'd transferred into plum jobs at YOS from other DOC facilities , often with little or no prior experience working with juveniles .
The number of assaults , escape attempts and revocations -- residents failing the program and being shipped to adult prison -- shot up dramatically .
Several YOS top administrators , including former legislator Regis Groff and psychologist Richard Swanson , the principal author of the program , resigned in disgust , publicly denouncing the DOC brass for transforming their innovation into a junior - varsity slammer .
Perhaps the most disastrous aspect of the YOS move to Pueblo , though , was the impact on its female residents .
Girls had n't been much of a factor when the program operated out of the Denver diagnostic center ; the place simply did n't have room for them .
The occasional female was put through boot camp alongside the boys for four to six weeks and then sent to an all - girl contract facility in another state to complete the remainder of her sentence .
One of the reasons for the move to Pueblo was to end the out - of - state placement .
In theory , there would be room for the girls to have their own dormitory and lots of one - on - one attention .
In practice , however , part of the building was soon handed over to male residents and male staff , and the one - on - one sessions that resulted were probably not what the administration had in mind .
Other parts of the grounds that had been originally allocated to YOS , and the jobs that went with them , were soon assigned to an overflow of adult female prisoners , then to a group of adult male inmates , as the DOC made a series of dubious decisions to deal with overcrowding at other prisons .
Allegations of sexual misconduct within YOS were first reported in Westword more than three years ago ( " What We Have Here ... Is a Failure to Rehabilitate , " December 2 , 1999 ) .
The situation erupted into a major criminal investigation in late 2001 , and administrators eventually acknowledged that there had been a series of " inappropriate " relationships , consensual or otherwise , between male and female residents , between residents and staff , and between YOS adolescents and adult prisoners .
One female resident was pregnant , and so was one adult prisoner ; in both cases , the fathers were young males in YOS .
Three girls claimed to have been sexually assaulted by male staffers , while at least three others appear to have been involved in an ongoing exchange of sexual favors for goods and services , ranging from candy and takeout hamburgers to favorable progress reports .
Ultimately , at least three - quarters of the dozen or so girls who 've been through YOS over the past four years have had sexual misadventures of one kind or another .
The DOC 's response to this dismal revelation has been curious .
On the one hand , the agency has fired five corrections officers , including one woman ; four of them have since been charged criminally in connection with YOS - related incidents .
But the DOC has also gone after several female residents in court , seeking to revoke them and impose their full adult prison sentences -- arguing , in effect , that it takes two to tango .
This tactic has bewildered and incensed judges presiding over the revocation hearings , most of whom have flatly rejected the notion that YOS 's teenage bad girls are as much to blame for the sexual misconduct as the adult guards who were supervising them .
Several have expressed their reluctance to return the girls to YOS or to send them to adult prison for engaging in relationships that were , at best , coercive .
They have openly questioned whether YOS has taken any effective steps to protect its female prisoners or is simply trying to exact revenge on them for exposing the program 's pimply flanks .
The judge in Angel Castro 's case , Arapahoe County Judge Gaspar Perricone , even ripped into YOS director Brian Gomez for what he considered an " appalling " lack of security .
" The court believes , from the testimony , that the problem must still exist in that facility , " Perricone said .
" I cannot send her back to a place where she 's subject to further sexual assault and harassment by inmates and staff ....
After hearing the testimony , it appeared to me that the youth services -- whatever this organization is -- that Mr. Gomez is running a private brothel for the benefit of his staff . "
Gomez , who 's been in charge of YOS since 1999 , has tried to portray the entire affair as a chain of unfortunate , isolated events involving rogue employees .
" I have 202 hardworking , dedicated staff , " he says .
" I had four employees who were inappropriate and did n't follow the rules .
I feel comfortable that the situation was dealt with . "
Yet the pattern of sexual exploitation may say more about the real culture of YOS , and how far it has strayed from the discipline - and - education approach of its founders , than DOC officials care to admit .
For the girls involved , their experience has been a lesson in degradation and hypocrisy .
How could these men claim to be mentors and counselors when they could n't keep their pants zipped ?
But several of them never got a chance to tell the judge what they thought .
They 've never spoken publicly about what they went through -- until now .
The girls ' stories are n't always consistent ; as with most cases involving sex in prison , there 's more than one version of what occurred .
But many crucial details of their accounts have been confirmed by the official investigation and subsequent court proceedings .
" At YOS , all [ the administration ] ever did was cover it up , " says former resident Jessica Jiron .
" I knew they 'd never believe me if I told them what happened to me .
The staff were supposed to be role models , but they never listened .
It seemed like they were just there to get their paychecks . "
After her first few days of boot camp in the fall of 1999 , Pene Carsen - Tate had already recognized several familiar faces in YOS .
There were boys from her old neighborhood , boys she 'd met in elementary and middle school .
Boys who used to drop by her mama 's house for a meal .
Hell , there were boys in that place she 'd hooked up with before .
Carsen - Tate grew up in Montbello , mostly -- which , in her experience , was n't the cool burb some people might think , all parks and barbecues and like that .
The place had its war zones , riddled with crack and gangs .
" A lot of people from the east side and Park Hill look at Montbello and say , ' Those are uppity middle - class kids ; they think they 're better , ' " she explains .
" So we have to fight them to prove we are not .
People get hurt .
People get jacked .
We have to prove to ourselves we 're not punks , so we 're constantly doing something , you know ? "
At sixteen , Carsen - Tate had already seen more of life 's dark corners than many of the adult corrections officers assigned to YOS .
Her file documented a long history of mental and emotional problems -- childhood physical and sexual abuse , depression , bulimia , self - mutilation , suicidal behavior , " sexually acting out " -- and involvement in one horrific , senseless crime .
Her family lost control of Carsen - Tate long before she wound up in Pueblo .
" I could n't do nothing with her , " says her mother , Terri Tate - Smallwood .
" She 'd run away from home and I 'd go find her .
I asked social services if there was a home I could put her in until she could get her direction straight , and they said there was nothing they could do because she 'd never been in trouble with the police . "
Between the ages of six and nine , Pene was molested by a male relative .
When the girl was thirteen , her mother sent her to live with other family members in Georgia , where a cousin tried to have sex with her .
Carsen - Tate says she is n't sure how all this might have contributed to her wild adolescence , but various therapists have suggested a connection .
" People say that I was just used for men's pleasures , " she says .
" They say that 's how I see myself , that I think that 's all I 'm good for .
It 's probably something I do n't want to admit . "
In 1998 , Carsen - Tate was living with her twenty - year - old cousin , Natalie Murdock , who was involved in ongoing domestic battles involving fist and knife fights with her husband , Arthur .
That summer , Natalie talked repeatedly about killing Arthur , who'd been arrested after one fight and then moved out .
Carsen - Tate brought a recently acquired boyfriend , Terrence Wilder -- a troubled seventeen - year - old known as the " Iceman " because of his supposed expertise as a hit man -- into the discussions .
In August , Arthur was supposed to return to the Murdocks ' house with the landlord , 24 - year - old Promise Keepers minister Joel England , who was attempting to mediate the dispute between the couple .
According to testimony , Natalie figured that would be a fine time to get rid of her husband .
The day it all went down , Carsen - Tate took the Murdocks ' three young children to the park because , as she later explained , Natalie " did n't want them to see their daddy dead . "
But Arthur Murdock never showed ; instead , England went to the house accompanied by another Promise Keepers minister , Rodney Marable .
Accounts differ as to whether it was Wilder or Natalie Murdock who fired the gun , but both of the ministers were shot right after they walked in the door .
When Carsen - Tate came back from the park , she found England still alive , lying on the living room floor and calling out for help .
She left , found Wilder and told him what she had seen .
The Iceman returned to the house and finished England off with a baseball bat .
Natalie Murdock and Terrence Wilder were both convicted of the double homicide and received life sentences .
Carsen - Tate , who was n't present for the killings and testified against her cousin , pleaded guilty to second - degree murder and received 32 years .
The sentence was suspended on condition that she complete six years in YOS .
That arrangement had been worked out with the approval of Joel England 's family , who hoped to salvage at least one life out of the tragedy .
" She was the last one to see my son alive who could have done something about it , " says Joel 's father , Gordon England , director of evangelism for Promise Keepers .
" A simple call to 911 and he'd be with us today .
Still , we had hoped that , because she was young , she could be rehabilitated . "
Carsen - Tate says she went into YOS expecting to work on her problems , but she soon became disillusioned with the program .
Three weeks into boot camp , a male friend of hers tried to confront a girl she was having trouble with .
Carsen - Tate was " remediated " over the incident , which meant she had to start boot camp all over again .
" They threw it in my face , like it was my fault , " she says .
" And I had nothing to do with it .
That 's when I knew it was n't going to work for me . "
Girls , she realized , were at the very bottom of the pecking order at YOS .
They were seen as trash , troublemakers , liars , a stumbling block to the boys .
" Nine out of ten males go to prison behind females , " one female officer was fond of reminding them .
Some of the male guards were part - time preachers , always ready to unload a few choice words about how women were vessels of sin ; more often than not , these homilies were delivered while ogling some female resident 's sweet - peach behind .
" They were trying to make it easier for the boys and harder for the girls , " Carsen - Tate says .
" There were more of them than there were of us , so they took the guys ' word over ours .
You get boys touching your ass , and you can't say nothing .
I finally said to one of them , ' If you touch my ass again , I 'm going upside your head ' -- and I got in trouble for threatening a boy , and nothing was said to him .
So what was the point of telling anybody ? "
The best way to avoid unwanted ass - grabbing , Carsen - Tate figured , was to have a boyfriend .
Preferably a large , physically intimidating boy that the others respected .
" If you did n't have one , or if he was n't somebody who had status , you were fucked , " she explains .
" At any point , one of the boys could have got you in a back room and got you to do whatever he wanted you to do because he'd know he was n't going to get into trouble . "
Over the next two years , Carsen - Tate had at least five boyfriends in the male population at YOS , a situation that was bound to cause strife among the various rivals for her affections .
Her first was a young man who met the physical requirements but was also abusive .
" I loved him , but I was afraid of him , " Carsen - Tate says .
" They made a bet on me when I first got there .
He said , ' I 'm going to be the first guy to get her , then I 'm going to pass her around . '
It did n't work the way he planned , and he tried to beat me .
He was doing bad things to me , and I tried to tell on him , but it did n't go anywhere . "
Carsen - Tate did n't consider herself particularly promiscuous .
" I was one of the good ones compared to some , " she says .
But her behavior led to frequent confrontations with other female residents , who were concerned that she 'd bring administrators ' wrath down on all of them .
" I liked Pene a lot , " says Jessica Jiron , who arrived on campus the same day as Carsen - Tate .
" But she had a lot of issues with men , and she did n't listen to anybody .
She was going to do what she was going to do . "
Since she had a relatively short sentence , Jiron was determined to avoid the kind of sexual entanglements that might get her revoked .
But she still had less intimate arrangements with boys , for her own protection if nothing else .
" We all had boyfriends , " she says .
" But Pene was the one who got caught . "
The other girls were n't the only people concerned about Carsen - Tate 's torrid romances .
Her counselor , Sergeant Dwayne Evans , got on her case frequently about flirting with boys .
But after a few months , around the time Carsen - Tate turned seventeen , Evans 's attitude toward her changed , she says : " He was telling me how sexy I was , how great my ass looked . "
One day Carsen - Tate had to get into a deserted classroom to work on the computer .
Evans had the keys and agreed to escort her .
Once they were alone , she says , Evans brushed up against her and " made it clear that there were things he could do for me . "
A YOS girl with a friend on staff could find life inside a lot easier to manage .
The friend could bring in all kinds of forbidden treats -- hair gels and perms , for instance , or Sonic hamburgers and Good Times fries .
More important , the friend might look the other way when it came to having boyfriends or other infractions that could otherwise get a girl bounced from the program .
Carsen - Tate considered all this .
She thought about the six years she had to endure in YOS and the 32 years she was facing if she failed .
At some point , Evans 's suggestion that he could help her out was no longer just an idea .
" We had sex right there in that classroom , " she says .
Although she denied the relationship when investigators first questioned her about it , Carsen - Tate would later claim that she had sex with Dwayne Evans at least fifty times during her stay at YOS -- in classrooms , bathrooms , on office desks , you name it .
Toward the end , she says , Evans was even unlocking doors so a couple of her boyfriends could have conjugal visits with her .
Even if Carsen - Tate had been inclined to report the arrangement , she doubts any of the staff would have taken her seriously .
" Evans had status over us and among the staff , " she says .
" With the trouble I 'd been in , they would n't have believed me .
They would have just said , ' No , she 's just a little gang thug bitch off the street .
She 's not trustworthy . ' "
Evans has denied having a sexual relationship with Carsen - Tate .
But she insists it was common knowledge among the YOS residents .
" Every black resident knew about it , " she says .
" For me staying in the program , it was worth it . "
Jiron says Carsen - Tate made little effort to conceal the relationship : " I did n't believe it at first , but she was getting all this candy .
Evans would give her big bags of Hershey 's Kisses .
" She 'd say she had to get schoolbooks and go upstairs , and she'd be gone for an hour .
I eventually asked what she was doing , and she told me .
But she did n't make it sound like she was being forced . "
Pene Carsen - Tate 's first boyfriend in YOS whispered to her that if he caught her even talking to another guy , they were going to have some issues over that .
When she got out , he added , he was going to keep her on a dog leash .
Despite such tender sentiments , the relationship was a tense and unhappy one .
The boy had several fist - clenching confrontations with other residents , boys he suspected of trying to make time with his girl or friends of Carsen - Tate 's who did n't like the way he was treating her .
In August 2000 , after Carsen - Tate had been in the program almost a year , the affair resulted in a rumble in the yard that one senior staffer described as " probably the most serious resident incident " he 'd ever witnessed at YOS .
That day a young man named Micah , who 'd known Carsen - Tate before she arrived at YOS , approached her boyfriend with the intention of " advocating for Pene 's honor , " as one attorney would later put it .
The two teens had exchanged blows before , and the boyfriend 's response to Micah 's latest overture was to grab a brick and smash it into his face , knocking out several teeth .
Other combatants -- accounts range from three to a dozen -- soon joined the fray .
With many other inmates milling on the grounds , the situation had the potential to turn into a full - scale riot , and dozens of guards were quickly summoned to the scene .
Micah and the boyfriend were thrown in the hole .
Neither one was cast out of the program , but there was talk about charging Carsen - Tate , who was regarded as the instigator of the whole mess , with the serious offense of " advocating facility disruption . "
Nothing came of it ; still , the incident alarmed many officers , and over the next few months , they pushed to revoke Carsen - Tate from YOS .
" They said I had a sense of control over other inmates , and for them to succeed , I must fail , " she says .
" I was a security risk because boys were fighting over me , male staff were hitting on me , looking at my ass , looking down my shirt .
They did n't like me there from the get - go . "
In fact , Carsen - Tate had the disconcerting habit of admitting to carrying on with boys whenever she was confronted about her activities .
She even tried to report the ones who hurt her -- protectors turned tormentors -- to no avail .
( One entry in her file reads : " Refused to perform oral sex .
Got a black eye . " )
But her disciplinary record also included numerous writeups for other kinds of infractions , including refusing to take her medications , unauthorized use of phone privileges , and threats to staff .
Carsen - Tate says many of the charges were overblown and that she was trying her best to get an education and complete the program .
The " threats " complaint , for example , stemmed from asking a female staffer why the slaying of a police officer would " get you more time " than killing somebody else ; the staffer regarded the inquiry as a personal threat .
" You can get written up for damn near anything , " Carsen - Tate says .
" I 'll admit that I could be manipulative .
I had to manipulate a few COs [ corrections officers ] to get phone calls to my mom .
There are certain things you have to do to get what you need , but it 's a two - way street . "
Any effort to revoke a YOS resident must go through channels before it reaches a judge .
In December 2000 , YOS director Gomez denied the first attempt to revoke Carsen - Tate .
She did , however , spend long weeks in RFP , or Removal From Population , the program equivalent of solitary confinement .
" Instead of trying to figure out why she was doing what she was doing , all they did was lock her up in a little - ass room for a month , " says Jiron .
" Pene was really emotional , really suicidal at times , and that was n't good for her . "
She was also required to take birth - control pills .
The official rationale was that the pills helped to regulate her period , but Carsen - Tate says it was common knowledge among staff and residents alike that she was having sex ; she was tested regularly for pregnancy and venereal disease while she was in the program .
Other residents say that after another girl turned up pregnant , they were required to take the pills , too -- whether they were sexually active or not .
" They made all of us take birth control , " says Jiron .
" They knew stuff was going on .
I was pissed off about it .
I was n't having sex , and the pills made me sick .
They gave us all the same kind of pill , this super - high dosage that has all these side effects and was n't right for me at all .
They made
Pene take hers in the med line , in front of the nurse . "
YOS director Gomez says he was " not aware " of any directive requiring female residents to be on the Pill ; he denies that the program has any policy on the matter .
Staff sources , though , insist the practice continues today .
Whether the staffers who wanted to revoke Carsen - Tate suspected that she was involved with one of their own is n't clear .
But the strong evaluations she received from her counselor , Dwayne Evans , probably did n't hurt her case .
Evans wrote a total of fourteen entries in her progress reports , all of them positive .
He noted , for example , that he was counseling her on her inappropriate relationships with boys : " We talked about her contact with male residents , and she knows she has a lot of other things to focus on . "
One of the things Evans wanted her to focus on , Carsen - Tate says , was Evans : " He gave me counseling on how to be a good bitch . "
Her progress reports also contain some encouraging words from Duane Coleman , the man accused of sexually assaulting Angel Castro 's roommate .
" Followed directions , " Coleman wrote .
" Gave one hundred percent . "
Coleman " was always hitting on me , " Carsen - Tate says .
He once approached her in the girls ' bathroom after she emerged from the shower , she says , urging her to drop the towel .
" He 's sick , " she adds .
" There was a bad storm one night , and all the power went out .
He kept coming into our room , saying he was looking for the cookie jar .
He put his hand under my sheet .
I told him there was no cookie jar there for him . "
She refused , she says , to give him anything close to a hundred percent .
Some girls went into YOS with the idea of getting through the program as cleanly and quickly as possible , and they managed to do it without attracting all of the attention that surrounded Pene Carsen - Tate .
But that does n't mean they escaped unscathed .
Jessica Jiron was fifteen in 1998 , when Lakewood police officer Peg Halpin visited Jiron 's stepsister 's apartment to inquire about a theft .
Jiron , a runaway who'd been drinking heavily , became belligerent , grabbed a knife and barricaded herself in a bedroom .
Halpin pursued her ; Jiron threatened to kill herself .
It 's disputed whether the knife was poised at Jiron 's own throat ( as she claims ) or over her head , as if ready to attack ( as Halpin reported ) ; in any event , Halpin felt sufficiently threatened to shoot Jiron in the abdomen .
Jiron originally faced enough charges to put her away for most of her life , including assault on a police officer and attempted murder .
She wound up with a sympathetic judge and a six - year suspended sentence for felony menacing -- suspended , that is , on condition of completing three years in YOS .
She sailed through boot camp and worked hard on her classes .
She pretended not to notice the leers and taunts from the boys , the calls of yo , ho and whassup , slut .
" The staff heard it , " she says .
" They never said anything . "
She knew another girl who was tormented mercilessly by the boys , called horrible names because she could n't afford basic hygiene items ; the girl eventually lost it , got into fights and was revoked to prison .
Jiron kept her eyes trained on the calendar .
Three years , maybe less if the judge granted reconsideration of her sentence .
She heard about Carsen - Tate 's exploits and the rumors that boys were sneaking over to the girls ' side of the building late at night , possibly with staff collusion .
She steered clear .
Three years .
Maybe less .
Duane Coleman made remarks about her having a nice body .
She ignored him .
Three years .
Maybe eighteen months .
But she could n't ignore Steve Chavez , a 38 - year - old corrections officer who , like Coleman , often worked in the girls ' building .
One summer night soon after Jiron 's arrival , Chavez came into her room and started touching her .
She asked him to stop .
He did n't .
" Basically , he assaulted me , " Jiron says .
" After it was over , I was crying .
I told him I was going to report him for this .
And he grabbed me by my arm and said , ' If you say anything , I will have you revoked so quick .
I 'm staff .
They wo n't believe you . '
And he was right .
I was scared .
I just wanted to get out of there . "
Jiron never reported Chavez .
Months later , she received a letter from him , listing his home phone number and " telling me that if I ever needed anything to call him .
That he loved me .
Just weird stuff .
I showed it to another girl . "
Eighteen months after she arrived in Pueblo , Jiron was out on parole , her sentence modified by Jefferson County Judge Brooke Jackson .
But YOS was n't done with her yet .
More weird stuff :
In the summer of 2001 , while living in Fort Collins , she says , she received a phone call from Coleman , who 'd apparently tracked her down through her parole officer .
" He was saying things like , ' I want to come see you .
I want to be with you , ' " Jiron says .
She did n't want to see Coleman .
All she wanted to do was finish parole and get away from these people .
A few months later , DOC investigators visited Jiron .
They told her they had a signed statement from Steve Chavez , in which he admitted forcing her to have sex with him .
She told them it was true .
They seemed quite willing to believe her .
Something had changed since she 'd left YOS .
Somebody had finally decided to report the bastards .
Angel Castro never considered herself any kind of crusader .
The few times in her life she 'd tried to get justice for anybody , including herself , the results had been disappointing .
You could say she did n't have a lot of faith that people in authority knew how to fix what was wrong , or even cared .
Despite all the violations she 'd endured at the hands of boys and men -- the assault by one of her mother 's boyfriends , the abuse by her own , the rapes by gangbangers who threatened her life -- she only went to the police one time .
When she was fourteen , she and another girl invited some boys from the Thornton City Players over to Castro 's place , just to kick it , maybe smoke a little something .
But the TCP members had ideas of their own .
Two of them grabbed Castro 's arms .
The third pulled down her pants .
They took turns on her .
There were other people in the house , but the boys told her they had a gun in their car , and Castro did n't want to cause more trouble .
She might have let the whole business go , but on their way out , the boys helped themselves to her brother 's PlayStation and a bunch of rented games .
She went to the Westminster police to complain .
" I talked to the detective once , and he said nothing could be done because we were around the same age , " she says .
" These boys were sixteen , seventeen , eighteen , but they did n't do nothing about it . "
The carjacking that put her behind bars was connected to another unavenged rape .
This time it was a friend of Castro 's who'd been raped , and her friend 's sister wanted to even the score , to go to the rapist 's house and raise hell .
Angel went along to try to keep things from going bad , but first they had to get a car ... and... and... well , things went from bad to hyperbad , and Angel ended up in Pueblo .
So when bad things started happening in YOS , Castro did n't see any reason to stick her neck out .
Okay , so she was raped .
So she watched her roommate go through the same thing .
What was she supposed to do about it ?
" I did n't want to think about it , " she says now .
" All these females are out here doing all this stuff willingly with male inmates and male staff members .
If I was to bring this to the table , who 's going to believe me ?
As far as they 're concerned , I was just like every one of those other females . "
But Castro could n't stop thinking about it .
There was too much anguish , too much anger over what corrections officer Gary Neal had put her through , what her roommate had suffered .
A few days after the incidents , gang graffiti was discovered in a boys ' bathroom .
Privileges were being taken away campus - wide :
In YOS lingo , everybody was getting " consequenced " for the misbehavior of a few .
One of the new rules was that the girls , who usually tried to look as shapeless and slovenly as possible , were required to have their shirts tucked in their pants .
The girls revolted .
At a meeting with Captain Angel Medina , one of the top managers of the program , they explained that they did n't want to tuck in their shirts because of the sexual harassment they 'd receive .
This was news , it seems , to Captain Medina .
Five girls , surrounded by 200 testosterone - charged boy - criminals , complaining of harassment ?
How could this be ?
" Medina was like , ' Just come tell us , and we 'll handle it , ' " Castro recalls .
" Pene was like , ' You 've never handled it before . ' "
The meeting touched off an alarm bell with YOS management , a bell that had remained silent for months -- despite the pregnancies , the birth - control pills , the fights .
Soon the girls were being summoned individually and quizzed about whether anyone had touched them .
Castro denied it at first , but she must not have been too convincing .
A female staff member , one of the few she trusted , pleaded with her to tell the truth .
" I started crying so hard I could n't breathe , " Castro says .
" Then she rushed me into a bathroom , and I was shaking and crying .
And I told her what happened with Neal , and she sent me to the hospital that night to get a rape kit . "
What happened with Neal , according to Castro , was this :
Another girl had tried to get her to stay up with her , watching television , because the other girl was trying to put off the attentions of one Steve Chavez , the guard who 'd assaulted Jiron months earlier .
Then Chavez had showed up with fellow officer Neal , who struck up a conversation with Castro .
" He told me this is his birthday , and he was asking me would I give him a kiss , " Castro recalls .
" I kept telling him no .
I did n't feel pressured till we went to the back .
I was thirsty , so we went to where they had the snacks , and he gave me a soda and some candy .
I was getting ready to go , and he grabbed my shoulder .
I was up against the wall , and he was telling me , ' How come I can't get a kiss ?
I 'm just trying to get a kiss . '
" He was touching me and stuff , and I was like , ' No , stop . '
He kept kissing me and putting his hands down my pants , and I kept pulling them out and pushing him away .
But he just kept forcing that on me ; I felt like I had no control whatsoever , you know what I 'm saying ?
" I told him I could n't do this , I had n't showered today .
So I took a shower and sat down with [ the other girl ] and watched TV .
He was standing right behind me .
He had me go into the office with him , and he was listening to the walkie - talkie to see where the other guards were .
He went into the bathroom to put a condom on .
I kept telling him , ' This is n't right .
I 'm an inmate ; you 're staff . '
" He told me he wanted to do it standing up , and I told him I did n't want to , I was ashamed .
I just laid there while he was doing his thing , and I just cried .
I wanted to block everything out .
Then we went back to the unit , and I was sitting there watching TV until I could n't handle it no more . "
When Castro first told her story , many people were openly skeptical .
They questioned her story about her roommate , too .
Some of the other girls in the program , involved in a variety of sexual arrangements of their own , had a hard time believing that the pair were n't trying to cover up their own misconduct .
Carsen - Tate even accused Castro of crying rape to get her sentence reduced .
" She said , ' You ca n't deal with the fact that you 're a ho , ' " Castro says .
" I was like , ' Excuse me ? '
Everybody was trying to stop me from getting this information out .
It hurt me a lot .
Pene even had me thinking I had AIDS .
They ripped my self - esteem so much , it was n't even funny . "
Carsen - Tate admits talking trash to Castro about her " relationship " with Neal .
" If it had n't been for her , none of this would ever have come out , " she says .
" She went to one of the few guards there that really care about our well - being . "
Castro was asked to take a polygraph test .
She passed it .
As the investigation heated up , she received threats from guards , male residents and even other girls .
" Everybody was trying to get me , " she says .
" They were telling me if I was smart , I 'd keep my mouth shut . "
After some dawdling by the administration , Castro was kept isolated from the other girls , then sent back to Arapahoe County for reconsideration of her sentence , where she languished in a medical ward for months -- without classes , without therapy .
Investigators had promised to protect her .
Instead , Arapahoe County prosecutors tried to get her revoked and sent to adult prison .
At her revocation hearing , YOS director Gomez conceded that it was possible that all six of the girls then in the program had been sexually assaulted .
He said that he could not guarantee Angel Castro 's safety but was unaware of any threats made against her .
His testimony was followed by that of Castro 's grandmother , who stated that she had personally met with Gomez and informed him of specific threats that had been made against Castro and her roommate for coming forward about the alleged rapes .
Judge Perricone had heard more than enough .
He ordered that the rest of Angel Castro 's sentence be served in a community corrections program , far from YOS .
Over the next few months , the DOC fired Steve Chavez , Gary Neal , Duane Coleman and Dwayne Evans .
If the allegations against them could be proved in court , they faced the possibility of months behind bars .
Several of the girls they 'd allegedly used were looking at revocation hearings that could land them in prison for years , even decades .
Prosecuting sexual misconduct within a prison is tough , concedes Rick Mattoon , the chief trial deputy district attorney in Pueblo County .
" These girls are all convicted felons , so there is an underlying credibility issue , " he notes .
" Some of these men were saying that these girls were coming on to them , trying to take advantage .
But all the same , the men had the ability to stop it . "
Last year , facing charges of sexual assault , Chavez and Neal both pleaded guilty to the lesser crime of sexual conduct inside a penal institution .
They both received sentences of eighteen months in the county jail and must register as sex offenders upon their release .
When questioned by investigators , Chavez admitted having sex with two female residents ; he made a tearful expression of remorse in court .
Neal , too , told the judge that he'd made a terrible " mistake . "
The pair did not respond to requests for interviews .
Coleman was charged with sexual assault and sexual conduct inside a penal institution for the alleged incident involving Castro 's roommate .
He has denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty .
His trial is scheduled for next month .
He , too , did not respond to an interview request .
Evans has not been charged in the investigation .
( He could not be reached for comment for this story . )
According to Mattoon , Carsen - Tate 's story about her alleged relationship with the sergeant changed over time .
" The victims in the cases we pursued were cooperative , " he explains .
" The one we did n't , the victim eventually said he'd done it , but at a point where it made her credibility worse . "
Last spring , investigators built a case against a fifth guard , 35 - year - old Alicia Bramall , who'd been visiting a YOS parolee in Pueblo and receiving calls at his residence from another male who was still in the program .
Bramall was fired .
In December she pleaded guilty to one count of sexual conduct inside a penal institution ; because her relationships with the two males were consensual , with no evidence that she 'd used her position to extract favors , she received probation .
So many cases at once puzzled Mattoon , but he says he's had no reports since of misconduct by other employees .
" I certainly have questions about how they chose to staff the place , " he says .
" It just seemed to be a recipe for disaster , to staff the female residence with men and to put women working with the males . "
Gomez says that at least one female staffer is now assigned to the female wing at all times .
YOS has also placed cameras in hallways , added locks and beefed up staff training in " the pro-social values of working with mixed - gender populations , " all in an effort to curtail the rampant fraternizing that went on .
But some YOS veterans scoff at the new procedures , saying sexual contact is unavoidable in a place where a handful of girls are surrounded by scores of males -- including some of the guards -- who want to get at them .
" The camera ca n't see everything , " says Carsen - Tate .
" The staff can still come into our rooms all they want ; the guys can still sneak in there .
The locks ?
I can open them up with the end of a pair of safety glasses .
Where there 's a will , there 's a way . "
Carsen - Tate says that some of the efforts to increase security , such as replacing the adult female prisoners who worked on the grounds with adult male prisoners , just made things worse .
At the time she was pulled from the program in late 2001 , Carsen - Tate had several letters in her possession from male prisoners .
" You got all those males , and only four or five females ?
Come on , " she says .
" Half those men have nothing but a life sentence , and they 're just horny dogs .
And the men that 's working there have no married life .
Hell , there 's pussy right there , so they 're going to take advantage of it . "
According to Gomez , there are currently no adult prisoners of either sex on YOS grounds .
He maintains that he 's unaware of any harassment of female residents before or after the misconduct investigation and insists that the " culture " within YOS remains a healthy one .
" You always have concerns if it 's a pro-social environment for the residents , " he says .
" But statutorily , we 're mandated to have the females there . "
Gomez 's views on the soundness of the program were n't shared by the judges presiding over the revocation hearings , several of whom spurned efforts to ship the girls off to adult prison .
The biggest battle was over what to do with the program 's bad Pene , who kept turning up in the most unlikely places .
A second attempt to revoke Carsen - Tate began late in 2001 ; this time Gomez approved the move .
That set up a year - long battle in which YOS and Arapahoe County prosecutors argued that Carsen - Tate should serve her entire 32 - year prison sentence , while her attorney , Jason Meade , tried to establish that whatever violations his client had committed in the program were overshadowed by the environment of sexual coercion , in which savvy girls did what was necessary to survive .
" She is very manipulative , " Captain Medina testified .
" We have offered her a buffet of resources and opportunities , and she has failed to take advantage of them ....
She 's a contributor to a negative subculture . "
" She 's part of the negative subculture , " Meade shot back .
" What are the guards ? "
As the hearings dragged on -- postponed repeatedly because the DOC refused to comply with various subpoenas Meade had served in an effort to obtain witnesses and documents -- Judge James Macrum Jr. could n't conceal his irritation with the program .
" When you 've got three guards having sex with inmates , " he said , " then you revoke her because she can't follow the rules , and the same guards are writing reports about this inmate -- it 's an intolerable situation .
This was brought about by the way YOS handles its inmates .
The system does n't work ... but my hands are pretty well tied . "
Macrum was n't the trial judge in Carsen - Tate 's case and was in no position to reconsider her sentence .
His options were to send her back to YOS or to impose her full sentence , and he pressed both sides to come up with another solution .
That meant consultations with the families of the murder victims and Carsen - Tate 's relatives , all of whom thought they had found some kind of judicial resolution of the case four years ago .
Joel England 's father was adamant that Carsen - Tate should not be allowed to benefit from her own misconduct by getting less time than she would have done in YOS .
" What she 's demonstrating is nothing new , " says Gordon England .
" Her manipulative tool of choice is promiscuous sex .
She shacked up with Terrence Wilder for two weeks , and it got him life without parole . "
Two months ago , Carsen - Tate sat nervously shaking her leg in Judge Macrum 's courtroom while prosecutor John Hower recounted her crime once more , how she found Joel England alive and left him there : " She could have prevented this .
She was involved in it from the beginning .
She literally and figuratively closed the door on Joel England and sicced Terrence Wilder on him to knock his brains out . "
An arrangement had been reached .
Carsen - Tate would serve fifteen years in prison , with credit for time already served going back to 1998 .
Her family members wept .
She turned to look at them and broke down herself .
Later , cooling her heels at the Arapahoe County jail , she seemed resigned to her fate , but she was still stewing over Hower 's description of her .
" I did not sic Terrence on that guy , " she says .
" I did n't want nobody to die .
Where I 'm from , you hear all day long , ' I 'm gonna kill this person , ' ' I 'm gonna kill that person . '
Nobody does it .
It 's just talk .
" I 'd seen one dead body before , but that was an overdose .
I 've seen my mom get beat and I 've seen blood get shed , but I 'd never seen anybody with bullets in them .
It seemed unreal .
And when I went to tell Terrence , I do n't know what I was thinking .
I did n't believe he would go back and do what he did . "
Carsen - Tate says she 's sorry she ever took the deal to go to YOS .
" If I 'd had fifteen years from the get - go , I would have just gone to prison .
I would n't have done this program , not if I knew what was there waiting for me .
I only took it because I was facing so much time . "
Gordon England expressed satisfaction with the sentence .
" She 'll do fine in a women 's facility , " he says .
" She 's a lot more streetwise than most of them . "
Last fall , Angel Castro was granted a home visit from her halfway house .
She did n't return on time and was arrested .
Although the violation was a relatively minor one , she was charged with " escape " and is now facing years in prison -- the hammer of her original sentence coming down on her after all , despite her whistle - blowing effort at YOS and months of progress in community corrections .
" My granddaughter is going to prison , and the man who raped her gets eighteen months , " says Castro 's grandmother , Theresa Lucero .
" Cops take care of cops .
Angel would have been better off if she 'd kept her mouth shut , I guess . "
Castro still has nightmares about YOS .
She sees the faces of male guards -- not just Gary Neal , but others , too -- and wakes up in a cold sweat .
Because the assault happened in the dark , it is hard for her to be in a room with the lights off .
If YOS is going to help troubled girls , she reasons , then it needs " a lot of different staff . "
The problem was n't just the molesters .
It was the teachers who talked to her chest , not her face , the guards who did n't harass but tolerated the harassment .
In the old YOS , " fronting " -- pretending to buy into the program when you really thought it was a crock -- was discouraged .
Down in Pueblo , staffers encouraged her to " fake it until you make it . "
" We go in there with issues , " Castro says .
" We 're juveniles .
We turn to people for help , and when we do n't find it , we get angry .
And then you get punished for that . "
Jessica Jiron completed her parole successfully .
She has a job and a boyfriend .
She does n't think much about YOS , or the troubles she endured there , unless something happens to remind her .
Not long ago , Jiron met up with a boy who had been in the program when she was there .
The boy had been romantically linked to a female guard , a guard who was recently transferred from YOS to another prison for reasons that DOC authorities refuse to discuss .
Jiron asked him if he still saw the woman .
" He told me they were getting married , " she says .
Apparently , Bush and Cheney did n’t get Bin Laden because we do n’t have a draft .
But , McCain will get him .
Anyone of draft age should watch this video .
Anyone with kids who are draft age — or approaching draft age — should watch this video .
As John wrote last night , McCain ’s instinct is to go to war .
Today , McCain exposed how he ’ll have the forces to do it .
The draft is part of his equation .

JOHN MCCAIN : Ma’am let me say that I do n’t disagree with anything you said and thank you and I am grateful for your support of all of our veterans .
Then , it would be a t.v. ad .
PHYS771 Lecture 16 : Interactive Proofs and More
Scott Aaronson
Scribe : Chris Granade
Last lecture , I ended by giving you a puzzle problem : can I do ornithology without leaving my office ?
I want to know if all ravens are black .
The old - fashioned approach would involve going outside , looking for a bunch of ravens and seeing if they 're black or not .
The more modern approach : look around the room at all of the things which are not black and note that they also are not ravens .
In this way , I become increasingly convinced that all not - black things are not ravens , or equivalently , that all ravens are black .
Can I be a leader in the field of ornithology this way ?
A : Well , when you 're doing the not - black things , there 's a lot more possible observations .
You could get the same effect as measuring millions of not - black things by measuring just one raven .
Scott : Yeah , I think that 's a large part of it .
Anyone else ?
A : You would n't be getting a good random sample of non-black things by just sitting in your office .
Scott : I would n't be getting a random sample of all ravens either .
I 'd be getting some of those ravens that live in Waterloo .
Something completely tangential that I 'm reminded of : there 's this game where you 're given four cards , each of which you 're promised has a letter on one side and a number on the other .
If what you can see of the cards is shown in the figure below , which cards do you need to flip over to test the rule that all cards with a K on one side have a 3 on the other ?
Anyway , the point is that there are many , many more not - black things then there are ravens , so if there were a pair ( raven , not - black ) , then we would be much more likely to find it by randomly sampling a raven then sampling a not - black thing .
Therefore , if we sample ravens and fail to find a not - black raven , then we 're much more confident in saying that " all ravens are black , " because our hypothesis had a much higher chance of being falsified by sampling ravens .
Interactive Proofs
Why should we in quantum computing care about interactive proofs ?
I 'll answer this question in a rather unconventional way , by asking a different question : can quantum computers be simulated efficiently by classical computers ?
I was talking to Ed Fredkin a while ago , and he said that he believes that the whole universe is a classical computer and thus everything can be simulated classically .
But instead of saying that quantum computing is impossible , he takes things in a very interesting direction , and says that BQP must be equal to P .
Even though we have factoring algorithms for quantum computers that are faster than known classical algorithms , that does n't mean that there is n't a fast classical factoring algorithm that we do n't know about .
On the other side you have David Deutsch , who makes an argument that we 've talked about several times before : if Shor 's Algorithm does n't involve these " parallel universes , " then how is it factoring the number ?
Where was the number factored , if not using these exponentially many universes ?
I guess one way that you could criticize Deutsch 's argument ( certainly not the only way ) , is to say he 's assuming that there is n't an efficient classical simulation .
We believe that there 's no way for Nature to perform the same computation using polynomial classical resources , but we do n't know that .
We can't prove that .
Q : How many people have tried to prove that you can't classically simulate a quantum computer ?
Scott : I do n't even know that anyone has looked specifically at this question or tried to prove this directly .
The crucial point is that if you could prove that P≠BQP , then you would have also proved that P≠PSPACE .
( Physicists might think it 's obvious these classes are unequal and it does n't even require proof , but that 's another matter ... )
As for going in the other direction and proving P = BQP , I guess people have tried that .
I do n't know if I should say this in public , but I 've even spent a day or two on it .
It would at least be nice to put BQP in AM , or the polynomial hierarchy --- some preliminary fact like that .
Unfortunately , I think we simply do n't yet understand efficient computation well enough to answer such questions , completely leaving aside the quantum aspect .
The question is , if P≠BQP , P≠NP , etc. , why can't anyone prove these things ?
There are several arguments that have been given for that .
One of them is relativaztion .
We can talk about giving a P computer and a BQP computer access to the same oracle .
That is , give them the same function that they can compute in a single computation step .
There will exist an oracle that makes them equal and there will exist another oracle that makes them unequal .
The oracle that makes them equal , for example , could just be a PSPACE oracle which kind of sandwiches everything and just makes everything equal to PSPACE .
The oracle that makes them unequal could be an oracle for Simon 's Problem , or some period - finding problem that the quantum computer can solve but the classical one can't .
Then , you see that any proof technique is going to have to be sensitive to the presence of these oracles .
This does n't sound like such a big deal until you realize that almost every proof technique we have is not sensitive to the presence of oracles .
It 's very hard to come up with a technique that is sensitive , and that --- to me --- is why interactive proofs are interesting .
This is the one clear and unambiguous example I can show you of a technique we have that does n't relativize .
In other words , we can prove that something is true , which would n't be true if you just gave everything an oracle .
You can see this as the foot in the door or the one distant point of light in this cave that we 're stuck in .
Through the interactive proof results , we can get a tiny glimmer of what the separation proofs would eventually have to look like if we ever came up with them .
The interactive proof techniques seem much too weak to prove anything like P≠NP , or else you would have heard about it .
( Note : A year after giving this lecture , Avi Wigderson and I proposed algebrization , which gives a formal explanation for why the interactive proof techniques are too weak to prove P≠NP and other basic conjectures in complexity theory . )
Already , though , we can use these techniques to get some non-relativizing separation results .
I 'll show you some examples of that also .
Q : What about P versus BPP ?
What 's the consensus there ?
The consensus is that P and BPP actually are equal .
We know from Impagliazzo and Wigderson that if we could prove that there exists a problem solvable in 2n time that requires circuits of size 2 Ω ( n ) , then we could construct a very good pseudorandom generator ; that is , one which cannot be distinguished from random by any circuit of fixed polynomial size .
Once you have such a generator , you can use it to derandomize any probabilistic polynomial - time algorithm .
You can feed your algorithm the output of the pseudorandom generator , and your algorithm wo n't be able to tell the difference between it and a truly random string .
Therefore , the probabilistic algorithm could be simulated deterministically .
So we really seem to be seeing a difference between classical randomness and quantum randomness .
It seems like classical randomness really can be efficiently simulated by a deterministic algorithm , whereas quantum " randomness " can't .
One intuition for this is that , with a classical randomized algorithm , you can always just " pull the randomness out " ( i.e. , treat the algorithm as deterministic and the random bits as part of its input ) .
On the other hand , if we want to simulate a quantum algorithm , what does it mean to " pull the quantumness out ? "
Q : I could see how , with two classes that are different , adding an oracle could kind of " boost " them up to the same level , but if two classes are the same , intuitively , how can giving them more power make them different ?
Scott :
That 's a good question , and the key is to realize that when we feed an oracle to a class , we are n't acting on the class itself .
We 're acting on the definition of the class .
As an example , even though we believe P = BPP in the real world , it 's very easy to construct an oracle O where PO ≠BPPO .
Clearly , if what we were doing was operating on the classes , then operating on two equal classes would give two results that were still equal .
But that 's not what we 're doing , and maybe the notation is confusing that way .
( A rough analogy : " The third planet from the Sun is the third planet from the Sun " is a tautology , whereas " Earth is the third planet from the Sun " is not a tautology --- even though , as it turns out , Earth = the third planet from the Sun . )
Q : Are there any classes that are provably equal , for which there 's an oracle that makes them unequal ?
Scott : Yes .
We 're going to see that today .
So let 's see this one example of a non-relativizing technique .
So we 've got a Boolean formula ( like the ones used in SAT ) in n variables which is not satisfiable .
What we'd like is a proof that it 's not satisfiable .
That is , we 'd like to be convinced that there is no setting of the n variables that causes our formula to evaluate to TRUE .
This is what we saw before as an example of a coNP - complete problem .
The trouble is that we do n't have enough time to loop through every possible assignment and check that none of them work .
Now the question that was asked in the 80s was , " what if we have some super - intelligent alien that comes to Earth and can interact with us ? "
We do n't trust the alien and its technology , but we'd like it to prove to us that the formula is unsatisfiable in such a way that we do n't have to trust it .
Is this possible ?
Normally in computational complexity , when you can't answer a question , the first thing you do is find an oracle where the question is true or false .
It 's probably like what physicists do when they do perturbative calculations .
You do it because it you can , not because it necessarily tells you what you ultimately want to know .
So this is what Fortnow and Sipser did in the late 80s .
They said , all right , suppose you have an exponentially long string , and the alien wants to convince you that this exponentially long string is the all - zero string .
That is , that there are no 1's anywhere .
So can this prover do it ?
Let 's think of what could happen .
The prover could say , " the string is all zeroes . "
" Well , I do n't believe you .
Convince me . "
" Here , this location 's a zero .
This one 's also a zero .
So is this one ... "
OK , now there 's only 210,000 bits left to check , and so the alien says " trust me , they 're all zeroes . "
There 's not a whole lot the prover can do .
Fortnow and Sipser basically formally proved this obvious intuition .
Take any protocol of messages between you and the prover that terminates with you saying " yes " if you 're convinced and " no " if you are n't .
What we could then do is to then pick one of the bits of the string at random , surreptitiously change it to a 1 , and almost certainly , the entire protocol goes through as before .
You 'll still say that the string is all zeroes .
As always , we can define a complexity class : IP .
This is the set of problems where you can be convinced of a " yes " answer by interacting with the prover .
So we talked before about these classes like MA and AM --- those are where you have a constant number of interactions .
MA is where the prover sends a message to you and you perform a probabilistic computation to check it .
In AM , you send a message to the prover , and then the prover sends a message back to you and you run a probabilistic computation .
It turns out that with any constant number of interactions , you get the same class AM , so let 's be generous and allow polynomially many interactions .
The resulting class is IP .
So what Fortnow and Sipser did is they gave a way of constructing an oracle relative to which coNP is not in IP .
They showed that , relative to this oracle , you cannot verify the unsatisfiability of a formula via a polynomial number of interactions with a prover .
Following the standard paradigm of the field , of course we can't prove unconditionally that coNP is not in IP , but this gives us some evidence ; that is , it tells us what we might expect to be true .
Now for the bombshell ( which was discovered by Lund , Fortnow , Karloff , and Nisan ) : in the " real , " unrelativized world , how do we show that a formula is unsatisfiable ?
We 're going to somehow have to use the structure of the formula .
We 'll have to use that it 's a Boolean formula that was explicitly given to us , and not just some abstract Boolean function .
What will we do ?
Let 's assume this is a 3SAT problem ( since 3SAT is NP - complete , that assumption is without loss of generality ) .
There 's a bunch of clauses ( n of them ) involving three variables each , and we want to verify that there 's no way to satisfy all the clauses .
Now what we 'll do is map this formula to a polynomial over a finite field .
This trick is called arithmetization .
Basically , we 're going to convert this logic problem into an algebra problem , and that 'll give us more leverage to work with .
This is how it works : we rewrite our 3SAT instance as a product of degree - 3 polynomials .
Each clause --- that is , each OR of three literals --- just becomes 1 minus the product of 1 minus each of the literals : e.g. , ( x OR y OR z ) becomes 1 - ( 1 - x ) ( 1-y ) ( 1 - z ) .
Notice that , so long as x , y , and z can only take the values 0 and 1 , this polynomial is exactly equivalent to the logic expression that started with .
But now , what we can do is reinterpret the polynomial as being over some much larger field .
Pick some reasonably large prime number N , and we 'll interpret the polynomial as being over GF N ( the field of N elements ) .
I 'll call the polynomial P( x 1 , ..., x n ) .
Now what we want to verify is this : there are no satisfying assignments , or equivalently , that if you take P( x 1 , ...,x n ) and sum it over all possible Boolean settings of x 1 , ..., x n , then you get zero .
The problem , of course , is that this does n't seem any easier than what we started with !
We 've got this sum over exponentially many terms , and we have to check every one of them and make sure that they 're all zero .
But now , we can have the prover help us .
If we just have this string of all zeroes , and he just tells us that it 's all zeroes , we do n't believe him .
But now , we 've lifted everything to a larger field and we have some more structure to work with .
Q : Why does it follow that if the formula is unsatisfiable , then the sum evaluates to zero ?
Scott :
If the formula is unsatisfiable , then no matter what setting x 1 , ..., x n you pick for the variables , there 's going to be some clause in the formula that is n't satisfied .
Hence one of the degree - 3 polynomials that we 're multiplying together will be zero , and hence the product will itself be zero .
And since this is true for all 2n Boolean settings of x 1 , ..., x n , you 'll still get zero if you sum P( x 1 , ..., x n ) over all of them .
So now what can we do ?
What we ask the prover to do is to sum for us over all 2n−1 possible settings of the variables x 2 , ... , x n , leaving x 1 unfixed .
Thus , the prover sends us a univariate polynomial Q 1 in the first variable .
Since the polynomial we started with had poly ( n ) degree , the prover can do this by sending us a polynomial number of coefficients .
He can send us this univariate polynomial .
Then , what we have to verify is that Q 1 ( 0 ) +Q 1 ( 1)=0 ( everything being mod N ) .
How can we do that ?
The prover has given us the claimed value of the entire polynomial .
So just pick an r 1 at random from our field .
Now , what we would like to do is verify that Q 1 ( r 1 ) equals what it 's supposed to .
Forget about 0 and 1 , we 're just going to go somewhere else in the field .
Thus , we send r 1 to the prover .
Now the prover sends a new polynomial Q 2 , where the first variable is fixed to be r 1 , but where x 2 is left unfixed and x 3 , ... , x n are summed over all possible Boolean values ( like before ) .
We still do n't know that the prover has n't been lying to us and sending bullshit polynomials .
So what can we do ?
Check that Q 2 ( 0 ) +Q 2 ( 1 ) =Q 1 ( r 1 ) , then pick another element r 2 at random and send it to the prover .
In response , he 'll send us a polynomial Q 3 ( X ) .
This will be a sum of P( x 1 , ..., x n ) over all possible Boolean settings of x 4 up to x n , with x 1 set to r 1 and x 2 set to r 2 , and x 3 left unfixed .
Again , we 'll check and make sure that Q 3 ( 0 ) + Q 3 ( 1 ) = Q 2 ( r 2 ) .
We 'll continue by picking a random r 3 and sending it along to the prover .
This keeps going for n iterations , when we reach the last variable .
What do we do when we reach the last iteration ?
At that point , we can just evaluate P( r 1 , ... , r n ) ourselves without the prover 's help , and check directly if it equals Q n ( r n ) .
We have a bunch of tests that we 're doing along the way .
My first claim is that if there is no satisfying assignment , and if the prover was not lying to us , then each of the n tests accepts with certainty .
The second claim is that if there was a satisfying assignment , then with high probability , at least one of these tests would fail .
Why is that the case ?
The way I think of it is that the prover is basically like the girl in Rumpelstiltskin .
The prover is just going to get trapped in bigger and bigger lies as time goes on until finally the lies that will be so preposterous that we 'll be able to catch them .
This is what 's going on .
Why ?
Let 's say that , for the first iteration , the real polynomial that the prover should give us is Q 1 , but that the prover gives us Q 1 ' instead .
Here 's the thing : these are polynomials of not too large a degree .
The final polynomial , P , has degree at most three times the number of clauses .
We can easily fix the field size to be larger .
So let the degree d of the polynomial be much smaller than the field size N .
A quick question : suppose we have two polynomials P 1 and P 2 of degree d.
How many points can they be equal at ( assuming they are n't identical ) ?
Consider the difference P 1 −P 2 .
Since this is also a polynomial of degree at most d , by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra , it can have at most d distinct roots ( again , assuming it 's not identically zero ) .
Thus , two polynomials that are not equal can agree in at most d places , where d is the degree .
This means that if these are polynomials over a field of size N , and we pick a random element in the field , we can bound the probability that the two will agree at that point : it 's at most d/N .
Going back to the protocol , we assumed that d is much less than N , and so the probability that Q 1 and Q 1 ' agree at some random element of the field is much less than 1 .
So when we pick r 1 at random , the probability that Q 1 ( r 1 ) =Q 1 ' ( r 1 ) is at most d/N .
Only if we 've gotten very unlucky will we pick r 1 such that these are equal , so we can go on and assume that Q 1 ( r 1 ) ≠Q 1 ' ( r 1 ) .
Now , you can picture the prover sweating a little .
He 's trying to convince us of a lie , but maybe he can still recover .
But next , we 're going to pick an r 2 at random .
Again , the probability that he 'll be able to talk himself out of the next lie is going to be at most d/N .
This is the same in each of the iterations , so the probability that he can talk himself out of any of the lies is at most nd / N .
We can just choose N to be big enough that this will be much smaller than 1 .
Q : Why not just run this protocol over the positive integers ?
Scott : Because we do n't have a way of generating a random positive integer , and we need to be able to do that .
So we just pick a very large finite field .
So this protocol gives us that coNP ⊆ IP .
Actually , it gives us something stronger .
Does anyone see the stronger thing that it gives us ?
A : Strictly contained ?
Scott :
No , we can't show that , though it would be nice .
A standard kind of argument shows us that the biggest IP could possibly be in our wildest dreams would be PSPACE .
You can prove that anything you can do with an interactive protocol , you can simulate in PSPACE .
Can we bring IP up ?
Make it bigger ?
What we were trying to verify was that all of these values of P( x 1 , ..., x n ) summed to zero , but the same proof would go through as before if we were trying to verify that they summed to some other constant ( whatever we want ) .
So that actually lets us do counting , and shows that IP contains P♯P , which in turn we know to contain the entire polynomial hierarchy ( by Toda 's Theorem ) .
After this " LFKN Theorem " came out , a number of people carried out a discussion by e-mail , and a month later , Shamir figured out that IP = PSPACE --- that is , IP actually " hits the roof . "
I wo n't go through Shamir 's result here , but this means that if a super - intelligent alien came to Earth , it could prove to us whether white or black has the winning strategy in chess , or if chess is a draw .
It could play us and beat us , of course , but then all we'd know is that it 's a better chess player .
But it can prove to us which player has the winning strategy by reducing chess to this game of summing polynomials over large finite fields .
( Technical note : this only works for chess with some reasonable limit on the number of moves , like the " 50 - move rule " used in tournament play . )
Q : Chess on an n×n board , right ?
Scott : Sure .
The protocol works in particular for n = 8 , but you can generalize chess to arbitrary board sizes .
You just have to limit the number of moves to some polynomial in n , or else you get EXP .
Then you 'd need two provers to convince you --- which is another story !
This is already something that is --- to me --- pretty counterintuitive .
Like I said , it gives us a very small glimpse of the kinds of techniques we 'd need to use to prove non-relativizing results like P≠NP .
A lot of people seem to think that the key is somehow to transform these problems from Boolean to algebraic ones .
The question is how to do that .
I can show you , though , how these techniques already let you get some new lower bounds .
Heck , even some quantum circuit lower bounds .
First claim : if we imagine that there are polynomial - size circuits for counting the number of satisfying assignments of a Boolean formula , then there 's also a way to prove to someone what the number of solutions is .
Does anyone see why this would follow from the interactive proof result ?
Well , notice that , to convince the verifier about the number of satisfying assignments of a Boolean formula , the prover itself does not need to have more computational power than is needed to count the number of assignments .
After all , the prover just keeps having to compute these exponentially large sums !
In other words , the prover for ♯P can be implemented in ♯P .
If you had a ♯ P oracle , then you too could be the prover .
Using this fact , Lund et al. pointed out that if ♯ P⊂P / poly --- that is , if there 's some circuit of size polynomial in n for counting the number of solutions to a formula of size n--- then P♯P=MA .
For in MA , Merlin can give
Arthur the polynomial - size circuit for solving ♯ P problems , and then Arthur just has to verify that it works .
To do this , Arthur just runs the interactive protocol from before , but where he plays the part of both the prover and the verifier , and uses the circuit itself to simulate the prover .
This is an example of what are called self - checking programs .
You do n't have to trust an alleged circuit for counting the number the solutions to a formula , since you can put it in the role of a prover in an interactive protocol .
Now , we can prove that the class PP , consisting of problems solvable in probabilistic polynomial - time with unbounded error , does not have linear - sized circuits .
( This result is originally due to Vinodchandran . )
Why ?
Well , there are two cases .
If PP does n't even have polynomial - sized circuits , then we 're done .
On the other hand , if PP does have polynomial - sized circuits , then so does P♯P , by the basic fact ( which you might enjoy proving ) that P♯P=PPP .
Therefore P♯P = MA by the LFKN Theorem , so P♯P = MA = PP , since PP is sandwiched in between MA and P♯P .
But one can prove ( and we 'll do this shortly ) that P♯P does n't have linear - sized circuits , using a direct diagonalization argument .
Therefore , PP does n't have linear - sized circuits either .
All I 'm trying to say is that once you have this interactive proof result , you can leverage it to get new circuit lower bounds .
For example , you can show that there 's a language in the class PP that does n't have linear - sized circuits .
In fact , for any fixed k , there 's a language in PP that does n't have circuits of size nk .
Of course , that 's much weaker than showing that PP does n't have polynomial - sized circuits , but it 's something .
( Note : After I gave this lecture , Santhanam improved on Vinodchandran 's result , to show that for every fixed k , there 's a language in the complexity class PromiseMA that does n't have circuits of size nk . )
I 'd like to go back now and fill in the missing step in the argument .
Let 's say you wanted to show for some fixed k that P♯P does n't have circuits of size nk .
How many possible circuits are there of size nk ?
Something like n2n^k .
Now what we can do is define a Boolean function f by looking at the behavior of all circuits of size nk .
Order the possible inputs of size n as x 1 , ... , x 2^n .
If at least half of the circuits accept x 1 , then set f(x 1 ) = 0 , while if more than half of the circuits reject x 1 , then set f(x 1 ) = 1 .
This kills off at least half of the circuits of size nk ( i.e. , causes them to fail at computing f on at least one input ) .
Now , of those circuits that got the " right answer " for x 1 , do the majority of them accept or reject x 2 ?
If the majority accept , then set f(x 2 ) = 0 .
If the majority reject , then set f(x 2 ) = 1 . Again , this kills off at least half of those circuits remaining .
We continue this Darwinian process where each time we define a new value of our function , we kill off at least half of the remaining circuits of size nk .
After log 2 ( n2n ^k ) + 1≈2nklog ( n ) steps , we will have killed off all of the circuits of size nk .
Furthermore , the process of constructing f involves a polynomial number of counting problems , each of which we can solve in P♯P .
So the end result is a problem which is in P♯P , but which by construction does not have circuits of size nk ( for any fixed k of our choice ) .
This is an example of a relativizing argument , because we paid no attention to whether these circuits had any oracles or not .
To get this argument to go down from P♯P to the smaller class PP , we had to use a non-relativizing ingredient : namely , the interactive proof result of LFKN .
But does this actually give us a non-relativizing circuit lower bound ?
That is , does there exist an oracle relative to which PP has linear - sized circuits ?
A couple years ago , I was able to construct such an oracle .
This shows that Vinodchandran 's result was non-relativizing --- indeed , it 's one of the few examples in all of complexity theory of an indisputably non-relativizing separation result .
In other words , the relativization barrier --- which is one of the main barriers to showing P≠NP --- can be overcome in some very limited cases .
It would be nice to overcome it in other cases , but this is what we can do .
Q : So these arguments show that there are no quadratic - size circuits for PP ?
Scott : Yes .
Let me put this another way : for any fixed k , there exists a language L in PP such that L can not be decided by a circuit of size O( nk ) .
That 's very different from saying that there is a single language in PP that does not have any circuits of any polynomial size .
The second statement is much harder to show !
If you give me your ( polynomial ) bound , then I find a PP problem that defeats circuits constrained by your bound , but the problem might be solvable by circuits with some larger polynomial bound .
I could also defeat that larger polynomial bound , but I 'd have to construct a different problem , and so on indefinitely .
While we 're waiting for better circuit lower bounds in the classical case , I can tell you about the quantum case .
We always have to ask about the quantum case .
Here , a simple extension of the previous argument shows that not only does PP not have circuits of size nk , it does n't even have quantum circuits of size nk .
You can get a quantum circuit lower bound , but that 's peanuts .
Let 's try to throw in quantum to something and get a different answer .
We can define a complexity class QIP : Quantum Interactive Proofs .
This is the same as IP , except that now you 're a quantum polynomial - time verifier , and instead of exchanging classical messages with the prover , you can exchange quantum messages .
For example , you could send the prover half of an EPR pair and keep the other half , and play whatever other such games you want .
Certainly , this class is at least as powerful as IP .
You could just restrict yourself to classical messages if that 's what you wanted to do .
Since IP = PSPACE , QIP has to be at least as big as PSPACE .
The other thing that was proved by Kitaev and Watrous , using a semidefinite programming argument , was that QIP is contained in EXP .
This is actually all we know about where QIP lies .
It would be a great Ph.D. thesis for any of you to show ( for example ) that QIP can be simulated in PSPACE , and hence QIP=PSPACE .
The exciting thing that we do know ( also due to Kitaev and Watrous ) is that any quantum interactive protocol can be simulated by one that takes place in three rounds .
In the classical case , we had to play this whole Rumpelstiltskin game , where we kept asking the prover one question after another until we finally caught him in a lie .
We had to ask the prover polynomially many questions .
But in the quantum case it 's no longer necessary to do that .
The prover sends you a message , you send a message back , then the prover sends you one more message and that 's it .
That 's all you ever need .
We do n't have time today to prove why that 's true , but I can give you some intuition .
Basically , the prover prepares a state that looks like ∑ r |r〉|q ( r ) 〉 .
This r is the sequence of all the random bits that you would use in the classical interactive protocol .
Let 's say that we 're taking the classical protocol for solving coNP or PSPACE , and we just want to simulate it by a three - round quantum protocol .
We sort of glom together all the random bits that the verifier would use in the entire protocol and take a superposition over all possible settings of those random bits .
Now what 's q( r ) ?
It 's the sequence of messages that the prover would send back to you if you were to feed it the random bits in r .
Now , the prover will just take the q register and second r register and will send it to you .
Certainly , the verifier can check that then q(r ) is a valid sequence of messages given r.
What 's the problem ?
Why is n't this a good protocol ?
A : It could be a superposition over a subset of the possible random bits .
Right !
How do we know that the prover did n't just cherry - pick r to be only drawn from those that he could successfully lie about ?
The verifier needs to pick the challenges .
You can't have the prover picking them for you .
But now , we 're in the quantum world , so maybe things are better .
If you imagine in the classical world that there was some way to verify that a bit is random , then maybe this would work .
In the quantum world , there is such a way .
For example , if you were given a state like
Still , the trouble is that our |r〉 is entangled with the |q( r ) 〉 qubits .
So we can't just apply Hadamard operations to |r〉--- if we did , we 'd just get garbage out .
However , it turns out that what the verifier can do is to pick a random round i of the protocol being simulated --- say there are n such rounds --- and then ask the prover to uncompute everything after round i .
Once the prover has done that , he 's eliminated the entanglement , and the verifier can then check by measuring in the Hadamard basis that the bits for round i really were random .
If the prover cheated in some round and did n't send random bits , this lets the verifier detect that with probability that scales inversely with the number of rounds .
Finally , you can repeat the whole protocol in parallel a polynomial number of times to increase your confidence .
( I 'm skipping a whole bunch of details --- my goal here was just to give some intuition . )
Q : So this is kind of like quantum MAM ( Merlin - Arthur - Merlin ) ?
Scott : Yes .
In the classical world , you 've just got MA and AM : every proof protocol between Arthur and Merlin with a larger constant number of rounds collapses to AM .
If you allow a polynomial number of rounds , then you go up to IP ( which equals PSPACE ) .
In the quantum world , you 've QMA , QAM and then QMAM which is the same as QIP .
There 's also another class , QIP [ 2 ] , which is different from QAM in that Arthur can send any arbitrary string to Merlin ( or even a quantum state ) instead of just a random string .
In the classical case , AM and IP [ 2 ] are the same , but in the quantum case , we have no idea .
That 's our tour of interactive proofs , so I 'll end with a puzzle for next week .
God flips a fair coin .
Assuming that the coin lands tails ,
She creates a room with a red - haired person .
If the coin lands heads , She creates two rooms : one has a person with red hair and the other has a person with green hair .
Suppose that you know that this is the whole situation , then wake up to find a mirror in the room .
Your goal is to find out which way the coin landed .
If you see that you 've got green hair , then you know right away how the coin landed .
Here 's the puzzle : if you see that you have red hair , what is the probability that the coin landed heads ?

It pays to go in a small south Indian town .
A slum resident in India uses a toilet that opens into the water below as children swim .
The remote town of Musiri in the Tamil Nadu state has hit upon a unique idea to teach its residents proper hygiene :
Pay them money each time they use the toilet .
Users can make up to $ 0.14 a month to relieve themselves in a specially constructed toilet .
Not a princely sum , but it 's extra cash flow that low - income residents can make just for answering nature 's call .
The government - backed program serves two purposes :
It encourages people to discard age - old practices of urinating and defecating in the open , leading to diseases .
And the waste products go into research to test their effectiveness as fertilizers .
" We 're motivating people to know the value of their urine , " said Marathi Subburaman , who came up with the novel idea .
" The urine that is collected goes into fields for paddy crops , and of course the feces becomes good compost in a matter of months . "
Aid groups estimate that more than 330 million people in India do not have access to proper sanitation facilities .
And in the case of Musiri , many residents relieve themselves on river banks , leading to infectious diseases such as diarrhea .
And while both governmental and non-governmental agencies have taken on projects to build toilets in rural areas , they also have had to undertake campaigns to encourage people to use them .
The Musiri plan seems to be working , Subburaman said .
About 150 residents use the eco-sanitation toilet daily .
It has special chambers that collect the fecal matter that researchers then use as fertilizer .
It 's a win -win scenario , said Subburaman .
His nonprofit Society for Community Organisation and People 's Education ( SCOPE ) has teamed up with Tamil Nadu Agricultural University , and the two are studying how much urine is needed to fertilize a field .
" Next year , we can install urine banks so we can sell the urine to farmers , " he said .
For now , residents queue up twice a day .
They are given cards on which each trip is marked off .
At the end of the month , residents can cash out the cards , making up to $ 0.14 .
Subburaman arrived at the amount by calculating that an average person will need to relieve himself two times for each of the 30 days and make 10 paisas per visit .
" If they ask to go three , four times a day , then something 's wrong , " he said .
" We ask them to go to a doctor . "

Baltimore Chronicle & Sentinel ( Dave Lindorff ) :
The dramatic hearing on presidential crimes and abuses of power held on Friday by the House Judiciary Committee was both a staged farce , and at the same time , a powerful demonstration of the power of a grassroots movement in defense of the Constitution .
It was at once both testimony to the cowardice and self - inflicted impotence of Congress and of the Democratic Party that technically controls that body , and to the enormity of the damage that has been wrought to the nation ’s democracy by two aspiring tyrants in the White House .
[ Most mainstream media outlets ] have blacked out news of impeachment .
Incredibly , the New York Times , for example , has not even reported on Friday ’s hearing , even as a news “ brief . ”
Those news organizations , like the Washington Post and the Philadelphia Inquirer , that did report on the hearings did so only in short , inside articles .
Though the hearing was aired in full on C - Span ( and is still available for download ) , many Americans do n’t even know it happened .
Jeff sez , " Researchers often use Photoshop to clean up the images they produce in the laboratory .
If the experiment did n't go quite right , a bit of tampering can make a gel look like things did work .
Editors at Science , Nature , and other journals are turning into detectives , using new tools to hunt for fraudulent images . "
And the level of tampering they find is alarming .
" The magnitude of the fraud is phenomenal , " says Hany Farid , a computer - science professor at Dartmouth College who has been working with journal editors to help them detect image manipulation .
Doctored images are troubling because they can mislead scientists and even derail a search for the causes and cures of disease .
Ten to 20 of the articles accepted by The Journal of Clinical Investigation each year show some evidence of tampering , and about five to 10 of those papers warrant a thorough investigation , says Ms. Neill .

( CNN ) --
A federal court on Wednesday struck down two provisions of the Patriot Act dealing with searches and intelligence gathering , saying they violate the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures with regard to criminal prosecutions .
" It is critical that we , as a democratic nation , pay close attention to traditional Fourth Amendment principles , " wrote Judge Ann Aiken of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon in her 44 - page decision .
" The Fourth Amendment has served this nation well for 220 years , through many other perils . "
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review , set up to review wiretap applications in intelligence cases under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA , " holds that the Constitution need not control the conduct of criminal surveillance in the United States , " Aiken wrote .
" In place of the Fourth Amendment , the people are expected to defer to the executive branch and its representation that it will authorize such surveillance only when appropriate . "
The government " is asking this court to , in essence , amend the Bill of Rights , by giving it an interpretation that would deprive it of any real meaning .
The court declines to do so , " Aiken said .
The Justice Department was reviewing the decision , said spokesman Dean Boyd .
The ruling was a response to a lawsuit filed against the federal government by Brandon Mayfield , a Portland , Oregon , attorney who was wrongly arrested for alleged involvement in the 2004 Madrid train bombings .
The federal government later apologized to Mayfield and settled part of Mayfield 's lawsuit for $ 2 million .
But Mayfield was permitted to keep pursuing the portions of his lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Patriot Act .
Mayfield claimed in the suit that his home and law offices were secretly broken into by the FBI , his clients ' files at his office were searched , his business and personal computers were secretly copied , his telephone was wiretapped and his home was bugged .
Mayfield said he was " excited and happy " with the ruling .
" This , to me , is not so much personal , " he said .
" I think it 's just the right thing to do .
It was the right thing to continue to challenge the constitutionality of the Patriot Act . "
" This is an example of the judicial branch doing what it should do , and that 's to be a check and balance for the legislative and executive branch of government , " he said .
" I feel wonderful today , because the Fourth Amendment has been restored to its rightful place , and the balance between liberty and security is balanced again . "
Mayfield 's attorneys -- Gerry Spence , Elden Rosenthal and Michelle Longer Eder -- lauded the ruling .
" Judge Aiken , in striking down the challenged provisions of the Patriot Act , has upheld both the tradition of judicial independence and our nation 's most cherished principle of the right to be secure in one 's own home , " they said in a written statement .
" We are relieved that the Bill of Rights can be honored and preserved even in times of perceived crisis . "
Aiken ruled that FISA , as amended by the Patriot Act , permits the government to conduct surveillance and searches targeting Americans without satisfying the probable - cause standard in the Fourth Amendment .
" Prior to the amendments [ to FISA ] , the three branches of government operated with thoughtful and deliberate checks and balances -- a principle upon which our nation was founded , " Aiken wrote .
But the Patriot Act , she said , eliminated " the constitutionally required interplay between executive action , judicial decision and Congressional enactment . "
" For over 200 years , this nation has adhered to the rule of law -- with unparalleled success .
A shift to a nation based on extra-constitutional authority is prohibited , as well as ill - advised , " she wrote .
Aiken noted that FISA does not require that the subject of a search be notified , although the Fourth Amendment ordinarily does .
In addition , she said , the Fourth Amendment requires particularity -- authorities seeking a search warrant , for example , must list what they are looking for and where they are looking for it .
Named to the bench in 1997 by President Clinton , Aiken is considered one of the more liberal judges on the federal bench in Oregon .

All About Espionage and Intelligence
INTRODUCTION
In Greek mythology , Prometheus defied the will of Zeus by stealing fire and giving it to the mortal race of men in their dark caves .
Zeus was enraged by Prometheus ' deceit , so he had Prometheus carried to Mount Caucasus , where an eagle would pick at his liver ; it would grow back each day and the eagle would eat it again .
Fire transformed mortal life by providing light , warmth , cooking , healing and ultimately the ability to smelt and forge metals , and to bake bricks , ceramics , and lime .
Fire became the basis for the Greek culture and ultimately all Western culture .
It is no wonder , therefore , that the Greeks attributed fire not to a mortal origin , but to a Titan , one of the godlike giants who were considered to be the personifications of the forces of nature .
If fire was the first Promethean energy technology , then Promethean II was the heat engine , powered first by wood and coal , and then by oil and natural gas .
Like fire , heat engines achieve a qualitative conversion of energy ( heat into mechanical work ) , and they sustain a chain reaction process by supplying surplus energy .
Surplus energy or ( net energy ) is the gross energy extracted less the energy used in the extraction process itself .
The Promethean nature of fossil fuels is due to the much larger surplus they deliver compared to animate energy converters such as draft animals and human labor .
The changes wrought by fossil fuels exceeded even those produced by the introduction of fire .
The rapid expansion of the human population and its material living standard over the past 200 years could not have been produced by direct solar energy and wood being converted by plants , humans and draft animals .
Advances in every human sphere — commerce , agriculture , transportation , the military , science and technology , household life , health care , public utilities — were driven directly or indirectly by the changes in society 's underlying energy systems .
In the coming decades , world oil production will peak and then begin to decline , followed by natural gas and eventually coal production .
There is considerable debate about when these peaks will occur because such information would greatly aid energy companies , policy makers , and the general public .
But at another level , the timing of peak fossil fuel production does n't really matter .
A more fundamental issue is the magnitude and nature of the energy transition that will eventually occur .
The next energy transition undoubtedly will have far reaching impacts just as fire and fossil fuels did .
However , the next energy transition will occur under a very different set of conditions , which are the subject of the rest of this discussion .
The Magnitude of the Shift
Figure 2 . Composition of U.S. energy use .

The last major transition occurred in the late 19th century when coal replaced wood as the dominant fuel .
Figure 2 illustrates this transition for the United States , a period often referred to as the second Industrial Revolution ( the first being the widespread replacement of manual labor by machines that began in Britain in the 18th century , and the resultant shift from a largely rural and agrarian population to a town - centered society engaged increasingly in factory manufacture ) .
Wood and animal feed suppled more than 95 % of the energy used in the United States in 1800 .
The population of the nation stood at just 5.3 million people , per capita GDP was about $ 1,200 ( in real US $ 2000 ) , dominant energy converters were human labor and draft animals ( horses ) , and the population was overwhelmingly rural and concentrated near the eastern seaboard .

The nation was completely transformed by World War I. Coal had replaced wood as the dominant fuel , meeting 70 % of the nation 's energy needs , with hydropower and newcomers oil and natural gas combining for an additional 15 % .
Steam engines and turbines had replaced people and draft animals as the dominant energy converters .
The population had soared to more than 100 million , per capita GDP had increased by a factor of five to $ 6,000 , more than half of the nation 's population lived in cities , and manufacturing and services accounted for most of the nation 's economic output .
Thus , the transition from wood to fossil fuels , and its associated shift in the energy - using capital stock , produced as fundamental a transition in human existence as did the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture .
How much renewable energy is needed if it were to replace fossil fuels in the same pattern as coal replaced wood ?
The United States first consumed as much coal as wood in about 1885 .
Total energy use then was about 5.6 quadrillion BTU ( 1 quadrillion = 1015 ) , equal to about 0.19 TW ( Terawatts or 10 12 > watts ) .
Consider what it would take today to replace even just one - half of U.S. fossil fuel use with renewable energy : we would need to displace coal and petroleum energy flows of 2.9 TW , or 32 times the amount of coal used in 1885 .
Current global fossil fuel use is about 13 TW , so we need more than 6 TW of renewable energies to replace 50 % of all fossil fuels .
This is a staggering shift .
Is renewable energy up to this challenge ?
There are physical , economic , technical , environmental , and social components to this question .
Figure 3 depicts one slice of the picture : pure physical availability as measured by the global annual flow of various energies .
The only renewable energy that exceeds annual global fossil fuel use is direct solar radiation , which is several orders of magnitudes larger than fossil fuel use .
To date however , the delivery of electricity ( photovoltaics ) or heat ( solar thermal ) directly from solar energy represents a tiny fraction of our energy portfolio due to economic and technical constraints .
Most other renewable energy flows could not meet current energy needs even if they were fully utilized .
More importantly , there are important qualitative aspects to solar , wind , and biomass energy that pose unique challenges to their widespread utilization .
ENERGY QUALITY
Most discussions of energy require the aggregation of different forms and types of energy .
The notion of " total energy use " in Figures 2 and 3 indicates that various physical amounts of energy — coal , oil , gas , uranium , kilowatt - hours ( kWh ) , radiation — are added together .
The simplest and most common form form of aggregation is to add up the individual variables according to their thermal equivalents ( BTUs , joules , etc. ) .
For example , 1 kWh is equal to 3.6x106 joules , 1 barrel of oil is equal to 6.1x109 joules , and so on .
Despite its widespread use , aggregation by heat content ignores the fact that not all joules are equal .
For example , a joule of electricity can perform tasks such as illumination and spinning a CD - ROM that other forms of energy cannot do , or could do in a much more cumbersome and expensive fashion ( Imagine trying to power your laptop directly with coal ) .
These differences among types of energy are described by the concept of energy quality , which is the difference in the ability of a unit of energy to produce goods and services for people .
Energy quality is determined by a complex combination of physical , chemical , technical , economic , environmental and social attributes that are unique to each form of energy .
These attributes include gravimetric and volumetric energy density , power density , emissions , cost and efficiency of conversion , financial risk , amenability to storage , risk to human health , spatial distribution , intermittency , and ease of transport .
Energy Density
Figure 4 . Energy densities for various fuels and forms of energy .
( Source : Cutler Cleveland ) Click to Enlarge
Energy density refers to the quantity of energy contained in a form of energy per unit mass or volume .
The units of energy density are megajoules per kilogram ( MJ/ kg ) or megajoules per liter ( MJ/l ) .
Figure 4 illustrates a fundamental driver behind earlier energy transitions : the substitution of coal for biomass and then petroleum for coal were shifts to more concentrated forms of energy .
Solid and liquid fossil fuels have much larger mass densities than biomass fuels , and and an even greater advantage in terms of volumetric densities .
The preeminent position of liquid fuels derived from crude oil in terms of its combined densities is one reason why it transformed the availability , nature and impact of personal and commercial transport in society .
The lower energy density of biomass ( 12 - 15 MJ /kg ) compared to crude oil ( 42 MJ / kg ) means that replacing the latter with the former will require a significantly larger infrastructure ( labor , capital , materials , energy ) to produce an equivalent quantity of energy .
The concept of energy density underlies many of the challenges facing the large scale utilization of hydrogen as a fuel .
Hydrogen has the highest energy to weight ratio of all fuels .
One kg of hydrogen contains the same amount of energy as 2.1 kg of natural gas or 2.8 kg of gasoline .
The high gravimetric density of hydrogen is one reason why it is used for a fuel in the space program to power the engines that lift objects against gravity .
However , hydrogen has an extremely low amount of energy per unit volume ( methane has nearly 4 times more energy per liter than hydrogen ) .
Hydrogen 's low volumetric energy density poses significant technical and economic challenges to the large - scale production , transport and storage for commercial amounts of the fuel .
Power Density

Click to Enlarge
Power density is the rate of energy production per unit of the earth ’s area , and is usually expressed in watts per square meter ( W/ m2 ) .
The environmental scientist Vaclav Smil has documented the important differences between fossil and renewable energies , and their implications for the next energy transition .
Due to the enormous amount of geologic energy invested in their formation , fossil fuel deposits are an extraordinarily concentrated source of high - quality energy , commonly extracted with power densities of 10 2 or 10 3 W/m2 of coal or hydrocarbon fields .
This means that very small land areas are needed to supply enormous energy flows .
In contrast , biomass energy production has densities well below 1 W/m2 , while densities of electricity produced by water and wind are commonly below 10 W / m2 .
Only photovoltaic generation , a technique not yet ready for mass utilization , can deliver more than 20 W / m2 of peak power .
The high power densities of energy systems has enabled the increasing concentration of human activity .
About 50 % of the world 's population occupies less than 3 % of the inhabited land area ; economic activity is similarly concentrated .
Buildings , factories and cities currently use energy at power densities of one to three orders of magnitude lower than the power densities of the fuels and thermal electricity that support them .
Smil observes that in order to energize the existing residential , industrial and transportation infrastructures inherited from the fossil - fueled era , a solar - based society would have to concentrate diffuse flows to bridge these large power density gaps .
Mismatch between the inherently low power densities of renewable energy flows and relatively high power densities of modern final energy uses means that a solar - based system will require a profound spatial restructuring with major environmental and socioeconomic consequences .
Most notably according to Smil , there would be vastly increased fixed land requirements for primary conversions , especially with all conversions relying on inherently inefficient photosynthesis whose power densities of are minuscule : the mean is about 450 mW / m2 of ice - free land , and even the most productive fuel crops or tree plantations have gross yields of less than 1 W/m2 and subsequent conversions to electricity and liquid fuels prorate to less than 0.5 W/m2 .
Energy Surplus
Figure 6 .
The energy return on investment ( EROI ) for various fuel sources in the U.S. ( Source : Cutler Cleveland ) Click to Enlarge
Energy return on investment ( EROI ) is the ratio of the energy extracted or delivered by a process to the energy used directly and indirectly in that process .
A common related term is energy surplus , which is the gross amount of energy extracted or delivered , minus the energy used directly and indirectly in that process .
The unprecedented expansion of the human population , the global economy , and per capita living standards of the last 200 years was powered by high EROI , high energy surplus fossil fuels .
The penultimate position of fossil fuels in the energy hierarchy stems from the fact that they have a high EROI and a very large energy surplus .
The largest oil and gas fields , which are found early in the exploration process due to their sheer physical size , delivered energy surpluses that dwarfed any previous source ( and any source developed since then ) .
That surplus , in combination with other attributes , is what makes conventional fossil fuels unique .
The long - run challenge society faces is to replace the current system with a combination of alternatives with similar attributes and a much lower carbon intensity .
Most alternatives to conventional liquid fuels have very low or unknown EROIs ( Figure 6 ) .
The EROI for ethanol derived from corn grown in the U.S. is about 1.5:1 , well below that for conventional motor gasoline .
Ethanol from sugarcane grown in Brazil apparently has a higher EROI , perhaps as high as 8:1 , due to higher yields of sugarcane compared to corn , the use of bagasse as an energy input , and significant cost reductions in ethanol production technology .
Shale oil and coal liquefaction have low EROIs and high carbon intensities , although little work has been done in this area in more than 20 years .
The Alberta oil sands remain an enigma from a net energy perspective .
Anecdotal evidence suggests an EROI of 3:1 , but these reports lack veracity .
Certainly oil sands will have a lower EROI than conventional crude oil due to the more diffuse nature of the resource base and associated increase in direct and indirect processing energy costs .
Intermittency
Figure 7 .

Intermittency refers to the fraction of time that an energy source is available to society .
It is an essential feature of electricity generation systems that must combine power generated from multiple sources and locations to supply electricity " 24/7 . "
The wind does not blow all the time and the sun does not shine all the time , so a wind turbine and PV array sometimes stand idle .
One aspect of intermittency is the load factor or capacity factor , which is the ratio of the output of a power plant compared to the maximum output it could produce .
Due to the more or less continuous nature of fossil fuel extraction , thermal power plants have capacity factors of 75 to 90 percent .
Typical annual average load factors for wind power are in the range of 20 to 35 percent , depending primarily on wind climate , but also wind turbine design .

The figure compares the hourly output of 500 MW wind power capacity in two situations , calculated from observed data in Denmark .

Load profiles show characteristic daily and seasonal patterns ( Figure 7 ) .
For example , most hourly profiles for commercial and institutional facilities rise in the middle of the day and then taper off during early morning and late evening hours .
Wind and solar energy availability frequently do not match typical load profiles ( Figure 8 ) .
Such intermittency means that wind and solar power are really not “ dispatchable ” — you ca n’t necessarily start them up when you most need them .
Thus , when wind or solar power is first added to a region ’s grid , they do not replace an equivalent amount of existing generating capacity — i.e. the thermal generators that already existed will not immediately be shut down .
This is measured by capacity credit , which is the reduction of installed power capacity at thermal power stations enabled by the addition of wind or solar power in such a way that the probability of loss of load a peak times is not increased .
So , for example , 1000 MW of installed wind power with a capacity credit of 30 % can avoid a 300 MW investment in conventional dispatchable power .
A recent survey of U.S. utilities reveals capacity credits given to wind power in the range of 3 to 40 percent of rated wind capacity , with many falling in the 20 to 30 percent range .
A large geographical spread of wind or solar power is needed to reduce variability , increase predictability and decrease the occurrences of near zero or peak output .
These and other " ancillary costs " associated with wind and solar power are small at low levels of utilization , but rise as those sources further penetrate the market .
In the longer run , the impacts of these additional costs on the the deployment of wind and solar power must be compared with the effective costs of other low - carbon power sources such as nuclear power , or the costs of fossil thermal generation under strong carbon constraints ( i.e. , carbon capture and storage ) .

All natural resources show distinct geographical gradients .
In the case of oil and natural gas for example , the ten largest geologic provinces contain more than 60 percent of known volumes , and half of those are in the Persian Gulf .
Coal and uranium deposits also are distributed in distinct , concentrated distributions .
The pattern of occurrence imposes transportation and transaction costs , and in the case of oil and strategic minerals , also imposes risk associated with economic and national security .

Of course , renewable energy flows exhibit their own characteristic distributions ( Figures 9 and 10 ) , producing mismatches between areas of high - quality supply and demand centers .
Many large urban areas are far from a high - quality source of geothermal energy , do not have high wind power potential , or have low annual rates of solar insolation .
Indeed , many of the windiest and sunny regions in the world are virtually uninhabited .
The spatial distribution of renewable energy flows means that significant new infrastructures will be needed to collect , concentrate and deliver useful amounts of power and energy to demand centers .
THE ENVIRONMENTAL FRONTIER IS CLOSED
The transition from wood to coal occurred when the human population was small , its affluence was modest , and its technologies were much less powerful than today .
As a result , environmental impacts associated with energy had negligible global impact , although local impacts were at times quite significant .
Any future energy transition will operate under a new set of environmental constraints .
Environmental change has significantly impaired the health of people , economics and ecosystems at local , regional and global scales .
Future energy systems must be designed and deployed with environmental constraints that were absent from the minds of the inventors of the steam engine and internal combustion engines .
Air Pollution and Climate Change

Atmospheric releases from fossil fuel energy systems comprise 64 percent of global anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions from 1850 - 1990 ( Figure 11 ) , 89 percent of global anthropogenic sulfur emissions from 1850 to 1990 , and 17 percent of global anthropogenic methane emissions from 1860 - 1994 .
Fossil energy combustion also releases significant quantities of nitrogen oxide ; in the United States , 23 percent of such emissions are from energy use .
Power generation using fossil fuels , especially coal , is a principal source of trace heavy metals such as mercury , selenium , and arsenic .
These emissions drive a range of global and regional environmental changes , including global climate change , acid deposition , and urban smog , and they pose a major health risk .
According to the Health Effects Institute , the global annual burden of outdoor air pollution amounts to about 0.8 million premature deaths and 6.4 million years of life lost .
This burden occurs predominantly in developing countries ; 65 % in Asia alone .
According to the World Health Organization , in the year 2000 , indoor air pollution from solid fuel use was responsible for more than 1.6 million annual deaths and 2.7 % of the global burden of disease .
This makes this risk factor the second biggest environmental contributor to ill health , behind unsafe water and sanitation .
Climate change may be the most far - reaching impact associated with fossil fuel use .
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre-industrial value of about 280 parts per million ( ppm ) to 379 ppm in 2005 ( Figure 6 ) .
The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650,000 years ( 180 to 300 ppm ) as determined from ice cores .
The primary source of the increased atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide since the pre-industrial period results from fossil fuel use , with land use change providing another significant but smaller contribution .
The increase in carbon dioxide concentrations are a principal driving force behind the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century .
Carbon intensity is an increasingly important attribute of fuel and power systems .
Social and political forces to address climate change may produce another distinguishing feature of the next energy transition : environmental considerations may be a key important driver , rather then the inherent advantages of energy systems as measured by energy density , power density , net energy , and so on .
Appropriation of the products of the biosphere

The low energy and power density of most renewable alternatives collides with a second global environmental imperative : human use of the Earth 's plant life for food , fiber , wood and fuelwood .
Satellite measurements have been used to calculate the annual net primary production ( NPP ) — the net amount of solar energy converted to plant organic matter through photosynthesis — on land , and then combined with models to estimate the annual percentage of NPP humans consume ( Figure 12 ) .
Humans in sparsely populated areas , like the Amazon , consume a very small percentage of locally generated NPP .
Large urban areas consume 300 times more than the local area produced .
North Americans use almost 24 percent of the region 's NPP .
On a global scale , humans annually require 20 percent of global NPP .
Human appropriation of NPP , apart from leaving less for other species to use , alters the composition of the atmosphere , levels of biodiversity , energy flows within food webs , and the provision of important ecosystem services .
There is strong evidence from the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and other research that our use of NPP has seriously compromised many of the planet 's basic ecosystem services .
Replacing energy - dense liquid fuels from crude oil with less energy dense biomass fuels will require 1,000 - to 10,000 - fold increase in land area relative to the existing energy infrastructure , and thus place additional significant pressure on the planet 's life support systems .
The rise of energy markets
When coal replaced wood , most energy markets were local or regional in scale , and many were informal .
Energy prices were based on local economic and political forces .
Most energy today is traded in formal markets , and prices often are influenced by global events .
Crude oil prices drive the trends in price for most other forms of energy , and they are formed by a complex , dynamic , and often unpredictable array of economic , geologic , technological , weather , political , and strategic forces .
The rise of commodity and futures markets for energy not only added volatility to energy markets , and hence energy prices , but also helped elevate energy as to a key strategic financial commodity .
The sheer volume of energy bought and sold today combined with high energy prices has transformed energy corporations into powerful multinational forces .
In 2006 , five of the world 's largest corporations were energy suppliers ( Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , BP , Chevron , and ConocoPhillips ) .
The privatization of state - owned energy industries is also a development of historic dimensions that is transforming the global markets for oil , gas , coal and electric power .
Global market forces will thus be an important driving force behind the next energy transition .
There is considerable debate about the extent to which markets can and should be relied upon to guide the choice of our future energy mix .
Externalities and subsidies are pervasive across all energy systems in every nation .
The external cost of greenhouse gas emissions from energy use looms as a critical aspect of energy markets and environmental policy .
The distortion of market signals by subsidies and externalities suggests that government policy intervention is needed to produce the socially desirable mix of energy .
The effort to regulate greenhouse gas emissions at the international level is the penultimate example of government intervention in energy markets .
The political and social debate about the nature and degree of government energy policy will intensify when global crude oil supply visibly declines and as pressure mounts to act on climate change .
Energy and poverty

The energy transition that powered the Industrial Revolution helped create a new economic and social class by raising the incomes and changing the occupations of a large fraction of society who were then employed in rural , agrarian economies .
The next energy transition will occur under fundamentally different socioeconomic conditions .
Future energy systems must supply adequate energy to support the high and still growing living standards in wealthy nations , and they must supply energy sufficient to relieve the abject poverty of the world 's poorest .
The scale of the world 's underclass is unprecedented in human history .
According to the World Bank , about 1.2 billion people still live on less than $ 1 per day , and almost 3 billion on less than $ 2 per day .
Nearly 110 million primary school age children are out of school , 60 percent of them girls .
31 million people are infected with HIV / AIDS .
And many more live without adequate food , shelter , safe water , and sanitation .
Energy use and economic development go hand - in - hand ( Figure 14 ) , so poverty has an important energy dimension : the lack of access to high quality forms of energy .
Energy poverty has been defined as the absence of sufficient choice in accessing adequate , affordable , reliable , high quality , safe and environmentally benign energy services to support economic and human development .
Nearly 1.6 billion people have no access to electricity and some 2.4 billion people rely on traditional biomass — wood , agricultural residues and dung — for cooking and heating .
The combustion of those traditional fuels has profound human health impacts , especially for woman and children .
Access to liquid and gaseous fuels and electricity is a necessary condition for poverty reduction and improvements in human health .
CONCLUSIONS
The debate about " peak oil " aside , there are relatively abundant remaining supplies of fossil fuels .
Their quality is declining , but not yet to the extent that increasing scarcity will help trigger a major energy transition like wood scarcity did in the 19th century .
The costs of wind , solar and biomass have declined due to steady technical advances , but in key areas of energy quality — density , net energy , intermittancy , flexibility , and so on — they remain inferior to conventional fuels .
Thus , alternative energy sources are not likely to supplant fossil fuels in the short term without substantial and concerted policy intervention .
The need to restrain carbon emissions may provide the political and social pressure to accelerate the transition to wind , biomass and solar , as this is one area where they clearly trump fossil fuels .
Electricity from wind and solar sources may face competition from nuclear power , the sole established low - carbon power source with significant potential for expansion .
If concerns about climate change drive a transition to renewable sources , it will be the first time in human history that energetic imperatives , especially the the economic advantages of higher - quality fuels , were not the principal impetus .

Trapped in the city subway system due to a sudden disaster , you explore the depths of the tunnels to find your way out .
The further you explore , the more you realize there is more to this disaster …and the lurking shadows are following your every move .

Superconducting magnets are cooled down using liquid helium
A vast physics experiment built in a tunnel below the French - Swiss border is fast becoming one of the coolest places in the Universe .
The Large Hadron Collider is entering the final stages of being lowered to a temperature of 1.9 Kelvin ( - 271C ; - 456 F ) - colder than deep space .
The LHC has thousands of magnets which will be maintained in this frigid condition using liquid helium .
The magnets are arranged in a ring that runs for 27 km through the giant tunnel .
Exchanging a single component which today is cold , is like bringing it back from the Moon
Roberto Saban , Cern
Once the LHC is operational , two particle beams - usually consisting of protons accelerated to high energies - will be fired down pipes running through the magnets .
These beams will then travel in opposite directions around the main ring at close to the speed of light .
At allotted points along the tunnel , the beams will cross paths , smashing into one another with cataclysmic force .
Scientists hope to see new particles in the debris of these collisions , revealing fundamental new insights into the nature of the cosmos and how it came into being .
The most powerful physics experiment ever built , the LHC will re-create the conditions just after the Big Bang .
Currently , six out of the LHC 's eight sectors are between 4.5 and 1.9 Kelvin , though all sectors of the machine have been down to 1.9 Kelvin at some stage over the last few months .
By comparison , the temperature in remote regions of outer space is about 2.7 Kelvin ( - 270C ; - 454 F ) .
The CMS detector will search for the Higgs boson - the so - called " God particle "
Roberto Saban , the LHC's head of hardware commissioning , said that in order to obtain high magnetic fields with a modest power consumption , the magnets were required to be " superconducting " .
This is the property , exhibited by some materials at very low temperatures , to channel electrical current with zero resistance and very little power loss .
Helium exhibits spectacular properties at 2.2 Kelvin - becoming " superfluid " .
This allows it to conduct heat very rapidly , making it an extremely efficient refrigerant .
No particle physics facility on this scale has ever operated at such low temperatures .
But , so far , the hardware was performing as predicted , Roberto Saban explained .
" We have a very systematic process for the commissioning of this machine , based on very carefully designed procedures prepared with experience we have gathered on prototypes . "
He added : " Our motto is : no short cuts ... exchanging a single component which today is cold , is like bringing it back from the Moon .
It takes about three to four weeks to warm it up .
Then it takes one or two weeks to exchange .
Then it needs three to six weeks to cool down again .
" So , you see , it is three months if we make a mistake . "
Two sectors of the LHC are currently not cold enough for testing to proceed .
Electronics that control the cryogenic systems in these sectors are being moved to an area where they will be better shielded against particles that shoot out of the machine during collisions .
Closing the circle
One sector of the ring is being run as if the LHC was operational and carrying a beam .
This is so that crews can de-bug software and hardware and gain experience of running operating cycles .
The LHC 's magnets must also undergo electrical testing .
Each sector of the machine contains about 200 electrical circuits .
Each circuit may consist of as many as 154 magnets or as few as one .
They are being tested for their ability to handle very high currents - up to 12,000 Amps .
The Alice experiment recreates the conditions just after the Big Bang " We power each circuit , making sure it goes to its design current .
But above all , we are verifying that all the protection systems around it - which are there to detect an eventual quench - are operating as expected , " said Roberto Saban .
A quench occurs when some part of the magnet starts to heat up , becoming resistant to electrical current .
Engineers have built in a recovery system to detect these quenches before they affect the magnetic field bending particles around the ring and shut off the circulating beams .
The machine 's cool - down should take another two weeks to complete , provided no serious problems are found .
Electrical testing of the magnets may take another couple of weeks .
Before the LHC is " switched on " for the first time , the proton beams have to be boosted to high energies in a chain of particle accelerators called the injectors .
Once the machine is cold , operators will inject beams into the main ring , threading them through each independent sector of the LHC until they close the circle .
A timing , or synchronisation , system is used to ensure each of these sectors behaves as if they were a single machine .
When the LHC is switched on it will operate at an energy of five trillion electron - volts .
It will then be shut down for the winter , so that the magnets can be " trained " to handle a beam run at seven trillion electron - volts .

What are these ?
Millions of people world - wide who have contracted a highly resistant strain of the HIV virus could benefit from a new drug to treat the infection .
Research co-authored by the University of New South Wales ' ( UNSW ) National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research ( NCHECR ) shows that the majority of patients who have not responded to traditional treatments have had good results from a new combination therapy .
The drug raltegravir is already available in Australia and was listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme on July 1st , with clinical trials showing that it is safe , effective and with minimal side - effects when used with other anti-HIV medicines .
The study , which has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine , shows the raltegravir effectively lowers the amount of virus in the blood to undetectable levels in 62 percent of people taking it in combination with other anti-HIV medicines .
Only one in three people who received a placebo plus other anti-HIV medicines had the amount of virus in the blood reduced to similar levels .
" This is the first drug in a new class of antiretroviral drugs called integrase inhibitors , " said UNSW Professor David Cooper AO , the Director of NCHECR .
" The drug has a different mechanism of action , is very potent , seems very safe and has helped patients who have a virus that is resistant to older drugs and classes , " said Professor Cooper .
" It initially will be used in developed countries , but hopefully , it will be made available at cheaper prices for patients in developing countries who are facing the same problems , " said Professor Cooper .
The results were based on analyses of viral load reductions and CD4 cell count increases .
A high CD4 cell count is crucial for a healthy immune system .
Professor Cooper said the efficacy shown at 48 weeks of treatment was consistent with observations at 24 weeks , indicating that the drug in combination has a durable effect .
The study shows the drug is well - tolerated by patients .
It showed that only 0.9 percent of those receiving raltegravir discontinued therapy due to side - effects including nausea and headaches .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The number of people in U.S. prisons has risen eight - fold since 1970 , with little impact on crime but at great cost to taxpayers and society , researchers said in a report calling for a major justice - system overhaul .

The number of Americans in prison has risen eight - fold since 1970 , with little impact on crime but at great cost to taxpayers and society , researchers said in a report calling for a major justice - system overhaul .
REUTERS / Clay McLachlan
The report on Monday cites examples ranging from former vice - presidential aide Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby to a Florida woman ’s two - year sentence for throwing a cup of coffee to make its case for reducing the U.S. prison population of 2.2 million -- nearly one - fourth of the world ’s total .
It recommends shorter sentences and parole terms , alternative punishments , more help for released inmates and decriminalizing recreational drugs .
It said the steps would cut the prison population in half , save $ 20 billion a year and ease social inequality without endangering the public .
But the recommendations run counter to decades of broad U.S. public and political support for getting tough on criminals through longer , harsher prison terms and to the Bush administration ’s anti-drug and strict - sentencing policies .
“ President ( George W. ) Bush was right , ” in commuting Libby ’s perjury sentence this year as excessive , the report said .
But he should also have commuted the sentences of hundreds of thousands of other Americans , it said .
“ Our contemporary laws and justice system practices exacerbate the crime problem , unnecessarily damage the lives of millions of people ( and ) waste tens of billions of dollars each year , ” it said .
The report was produced by the JFA Institute , a Washington criminal - justice research group , and its authors included eight criminologists from major U.S. public universities .
It was funded by the Rosenbaum Foundation and by financier and political activist George Soros ’ Open Society Institute .
The Justice Department dismissed the recommendations and cited findings that about 25 percent of the violent - crime drop in the 1990s can be attributed to increases in imprisonment .
“ The United States is experiencing a 30 - year low in crime , in large part due to the tough enforcement actions we ’ve taken in the last decade , ” department spokesman Peter Carr said .
SHIFTING ATTITUDES
But there are signs of shifting attitudes on sentencing policies .
Some financially strapped states are shortening sentences and Congress is moving to pass increased help for released prisoners , said Executive Director Marc Mauer of the Sentencing Project , which has advocated alternatives to long sentences .
“ Compared to where we were in the mid-( 19) 90s , it ’s been a very significant change , ” Mauer said .
More than 1.5 million people are now in U.S. state and federal prisons , up from 196,429 in 1970 , the report said .
Another 750,000 people are in local jails .
The U.S. incarceration rate is the world ’s highest , followed by Russia , according to 2006 figures compiled by Kings College in London .
Although the U.S. crime rate began declining in the 1990s it is still about the same as in 1973 , the JFA report said .
But the prison population has soared because sentences have gotten longer and people who violate parole or probation , even with minor lapses , are more likely to be imprisoned .
“ The system is almost feeding on itself now .
It takes years and years and years to get out of this system and we do not see any positive impact on the crime rates , ” JFA President James Austin , a co-author of the report , told a news conference .
The report said the prison population is projected to grow by another 192,000 in five years , at a cost of $ 27.5 billion to build and operate additional prisons .
At current rates , one - third of all black males , one - sixth of Latino males , and one in 17 white males will go to prison during their lives .
Women represent the fastest - growing segment of the prison population , the report said .
“ The massive incarceration of young males from mostly poor - and working - class neighborhoods , and the taking of women from their families and jobs , has crippled their potential for forming healthy families and achieving economic gains , ” it said .
The context
Recently at GiraffeSoft we started a new project , based on another existing project we already had going .
We could call this a long term fork .
Let me give you a little bit more context on the situation .
These projects will both keep being actively developed in the future ;
They will have some fundamental differences that will not be reconciled ;
They will however keep many similarities and we expect that they will benefit from the exchange of some specific patches , as development on both moves forward .
In days past , this problem could have been solved reasonably well by cloning the central repository and then exchanging patches and applying them manually .
As you ’ve guessed already , we ’ve decided to try using Git to help manage this long term relationship .
I must warn you however .
It ’s the first time we attempt keeping a long term fork like that .
We ’re not sure whether it ’s going to be worth the trouble and whether the diverging of the two projects will eventually prevent us from efficiently benefiting from using Git to manage the exchange of patches .
We ’re not sure whether this is the best way to accomplish this either .
On one hand , all this trouble may or may not be worth the effort .
On the other hand , all of this sounds like ultra elite Git - fu .
Hence our decision to explore this approach .
Another less technical reasons was also at play in our decision .
We wanted to have one wiki per project on GitHub :-)
What we ’re going to do
So at first , we have a remote repository for the initial project .
There are of course an arbitrary number of client side clones of the repository ( what Subversion calls working directories ) .
None of them will be affected in any way .
The first thing I will do is clone the initial project to a new client side repository .
I ’ll set this up in such a way that it wo n’t use the initial project as its default origin .
On the other hand I ’ll make sure it has one branch that interacts with the initial project for future patch exchanges .
Then from that client - side repository , I ’ll initialize a new remote repository , which will serve as the default remote repository for the new project .
What we ’ll end up with is 2 remote repositories which will have a lot in common but wo n’t be linked to one another in any way .
It wo n’t be a GitHub fork , for instance .
There will be exactly one client side repository that knows about the two central repos and that can exchange commits between them .
All other new client - side clones of the new project will be plain old regular Git clones .
It would be easy to set up more client side repositories to be aware of both repositories , but to me it does n’t really seem necessary .
Article too long ?
As with my previous articles about Git , I ’ll provide detailed instructions for you to follow along on dummy repositories ( if you ’re interested ) .
When you return to this article to attempt something similar , you may want to skip to the executive summary section , where I list strictly the important operations without all the rambling .
The instructions with the rambling
Setting up a dummy initial project
Find yourself a comfortable directory and run these few commands to initiate a dummy client - side repository and its corresponding dummy remote :
mkdir test ; cd $ _ mkdir initial_project initial_wd GIT_DIR=initial_project / git init #
Creating a dummy repo cd initial_wd git init echo foo > file .
txt git add .
git commit - a -m " initial commit " echo bar >> file .
txt git commit - a -m " modification " #
Setting up what 's gonna be the central repo for our initial app git remote add origin ../ initial_project / git push origin master git config branch .
master .
remote origin git config branch .
master .
merge refs/heads / master
The last 2 config commands configure your master branch to automatically track remote master when issuing the command ‘ git pull ’ .
In other words , it ’s equivalent to running the command ‘ git branch −−track master origin / master ’ , with the only difference being that ‘ branch −−track ’ is primarily intended to create a new local branch , whereas here we already have our local branch .
We can now check for the expected behavior :
# [ email protected ] initial_wd ( master ) $ git pull # Already up - to - date .
Note also that here I simplify the instructions for following along by creating a dummy remote repository that ’s in fact only in another local directory .
If for example you wanted to use GitHub , your Git remote command would simply look like :
git remote add origin [ email protected ] : username/initial_project.git
The actual fork
# Create a directory to host the new remote repository cd .. mkdir project2 GIT_DIR=project2 / git init
Now we will use
Git clone with the -o option .
This lets us give the initial project another name than the default ‘ origin ’ .
We ’ll want to use the name ‘ origin ’ for the new repository we ’ll create to actually track the new project .
I decided to name it the initial project ’s origin ‘ ip_origin ’ .
# Specify origin name , then the path to the shared repo # and finally a directory name for the local working directory .
git clone -o ip_origin initial_project wd
Setting up the relationship with the initial repository
We first create a branch specifically to track the initial project ’s master branch .
Then we set it up to track the initial project .
cd wd git branch ip_master git config branch.ip_master .remote ip_origin git config branch.ip_master.merge refs/heads / master
Setting up the relationship with the new project ’s repository
git remote add origin ../ project2 git push origin master git config branch .
master .
remote origin git config branch .
master .
merge refs/heads / master
Let ’s pretend some new development happened
echo ' shareable modification ' > shareable_file.txt git add shareable_file. txt git commit -m " shareable modification " echo " specific to new project " > not_shareable .txt git add not_shareable .
txt git commit -m " specific to new project "
So I have now begun working on the new project and I already have one commit that could benefit the initial project as well .
The progress looks a little like this :
So I switch to the branch that manages the relationship with the initial project and I pick the commit before the last one in master .
git checkout ip_master git cherry - pick master ^
Everything ’s dandy so far , except for the subtle fact that I have brought us all to the edge of a cliff .
If I tried to push to the initial repository right now , I ’d be in for a nasty surprise :
# [ email protected ] wd ( ip_master ) $ git push # Counting objects : 7 , done .
# Compressing objects : 100 % ( 4/4 ) , done .
# Writing objects : 100 % ( 6/6 ) , 564 bytes , done .
# Total 6 ( delta 1 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 ) # Unpacking objects : 100 % ( 6/6 ) , done .
# To / Users/mat/blog/long-term-fork/test/initial_project # 7178a89..3ca0240 master -> master
Oops !
By default , ‘ git push ’ syncs up all branches of the same name with the current branch ’s origin .
So that would push the new project ’s master branch on our initial project ’s shared master .
This is obviously not what we want .
We only want ip_master to be pushed to the initial project ’s master .
Trying to remember to always explicitly run ‘ git push ip_origin ip_master : master ’ would n’t do it for me .
To keep the analogy , that would be akin to doing a cartwheel on the edge of said cliff : a lot of fun until you make a mistake .
So obviously we ’d like a simple ‘ git push ’ to do the right thing .
So here ’s how we configure it :
git config remote.ip_origin.push refs/heads/ip_master:master
Now we can safely issue the ‘ git push ’ command from ip_master and have Git push ip_master to ip_origin / master .
git push # Counting objects : 4 , done .
# Compressing objects : 100 % ( 2/2 ) , done .
# Writing objects : 100 % ( 3/3 ) , 310 bytes , done .
# Total 3 ( delta 0 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 ) # Unpacking objects : 100 % ( 3/3 ) , done .
# To / Users/mat/blog/long-term-fork/test/initial_project # 027a48f..9db6c3f ip_master -> master
There ’s now only one remaining annoyance we ’re not yet protected against .
If new branches are created in the initial project ’s central repository , a ‘ git pull ’ when standing in the ip_master branch would pull them all in our new project ’s working directory .
I consider this one only an annoyance , since I could just decide not to pay attention to them .
On the other hand they will be distracting and may also clash with the branches I create for the development on my new project .
So we want to avoid that behavior as well .
To better understand the current Git configuration , let ’s have a look at .git/ config :
... [ remote " ip_origin " ] url = / Users/mat/blog/long-term-fork/test/initial_project fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/ip_origin/*
[ branch " master " ] remote = origin merge = refs / heads / master [ branch " ip_master " ] remote = ip_origin merge = refs / heads / master [ remote " origin " ] url = ../ project2 fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
So in both ‘ remote ’ sections I can see that fetch is configured to bring everything locally ( the * wildcards ) .
So here ’s how I limit what gets pulled when I pull from the initial project ’s repository .
git config remote.ip_origin.fetch +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/ip_origin/master
The part before the colon is the name of the interesting branch on the remote server .
The part after the colon is your local Git repo ’s internal branch , used to track the remote branch ( not to be confused with our user branch ip_master ) .
Setting up remote branches on both projects , pulling , pushing and exchanging more commits is left as an exercise to the reader .
Conclusion
So that ’s the gist of it , my friends .
I am basically set up to work on my new project like I would in a more typical situation .
I also have a special branch set up to interact with the initial project .
With this branch I ’ll be able to do two things :
Pull new developments from the initial project and then cherry - pick only the shareable commits into the new project ’s other branches .
Cherry - pick in the other direction to bring certain commits from the new project into this branch and then push them up to the initial project .
For this approach to be useful however , we ’ll have to make sure we create as concise commits as possible .
Gone are the days of committing a whole afternoon in one meaningless commit containing 12 different modifications .
Of course coding sprees of a couple hours are not out of the question .
Features like ‘ git add −−patch ’ are a great help when comes time to extract meaningful commits out of the result of a few hours of intense coding .
For a good introduction to −−patch ( and a few other powerful features ) , be sure to read Ryan Tomayko ’s The Thing about Git .
The executive summary
So let ’s reiterate strictly the interesting bits necessary to set up a long term fork when starting a new project from an existing one .
We already have :
the initial project ’s repository at url [ email protected ] : username/initial_project.git
the new project ’s empty repository , also created at [ email protected ] : username/new_project.git
# Create new local clone for the new project git clone -o ip_origin [ email protected ] : username/initial_project.git new_project cd new_project #
Set up a standard track between initial master and local ip_master git config branch.ip_master.remote ip_origin git config branch.ip_master.merge refs/heads / master #
Automatically push the right branch git config remote.ip_origin.push refs/heads /ip_master:master #
Do n't bring in the other shared branches from initial project git config remote.ip_origin.fetch +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/ip_origin/master
#
Push new local repo it to new shared repo git remote add origin [ email protected ] : username/new_project.git git push origin master #
Configure standard track of master with new local repo git config branch .
master .
remote origin git config branch .
master .
merge refs/heads / master
That ’s it !
We now only have to cherry - pick like there ’s no tomorrow .

IT WAS not difficult to distinguish between George Bush 's farewell visit to Europe this week and a victory lap .
True , things have sometimes been even worse : back in 2003 he was greeted by some of the biggest protests in European history .
But this time he was being greeted by sullen indifference .
Mr Bush is worse than a failure in European eyes .
He is yesterday 's failure .
Across the continent Bush hatred has been replaced by Obamamania .
Barack Obama is playing the “ good American ” to Mr Bush 's ugly one — articulate where Mr Bush was cloth - tongued and cosmopolitan where Mr Bush was Texas - insular .
Europeans are perhaps even more entranced than Americans by Mr Obama 's message of “ change ” and “ hope ” .
They are also being forced to rethink some of their deepest prejudices about America .
How can the land of “ Stupid White Men ” produce a Barack Obama ?
And how can Europe go on feeling quite so superior to America when it treats so many of its own minorities so badly ?
The French parliament has only one black person representing mainland France .
John McCain hardly enjoys Obama - like levels of enthusiasm .
A new Pew poll shows that , in both France and Germany , only about 30 % of people think that Mr McCain will do the “ right thing ” in foreign affairs compared with more than 80 % for Mr Obama .
But the Republican senator is still regarded as a huge improvement on Mr Bush .
He has spent decades networking with European leaders , for example as a regular at the annual Munich Conference on Security Policy .
Just as significant for the future of the alliance is that both candidates agree on the importance of reversing the collapse of America 's image in Europe .
They are both determined to tackle three of its root causes — by banning torture , closing Guantánamo Bay and embracing a cap - and - trade policy on climate change .
Here Mr McCain is proving himself , if anything , to be the bolder Atlanticist of the two , not only praising the relationship more loudly but also pitting himself against powerful groups within his own party , including the White House .
The two senators will also inherit plenty of materials for bridge - building .
The Bush administration has pursued a much more conciliatory policy since 2004 .
Indeed , Condoleezza Rice , Mr Bush 's secretary of state , argues that , in some ways , the relationship is deeper than ever before : for the first time ever NATO forces are fighting outside the European theatre , in Afghanistan .
Two pro-Americans , Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy , have replaced the troublesome Gerhard Schröder and Jacques Chirac in Berlin and Paris .
Mr Sarkozy has been particularly vocal in praising America and embracing a more pro-American position on Iraq and Iran ( he argues that an Iranian nuclear bomb is “ unacceptable ” , for example ) .
It is notable that when Mr Sarkozy visited Washington back in 2006 the only two people he found time to see on Capitol Hill were Messrs Obama and McCain .
The only worry is that things are looking a bit too good at the moment .
The biggest danger for transatlantic relations now comes from out - of - control expectations — particularly where Mr Obama is concerned .
Obamamania may be less of a problem than Bush derangement syndrome .
But it contains the seeds of its own destruction .
The world 's dictators will be less inclined to melt before Mr Obama 's charm than New England college professors .
And , as the world 's only superpower , America has no choice but to continue to worship Mars as well as Venus .
Mr Obama gave a hint of possible future tensions with Europe in a speech he delivered to AIPAC hours after winning the nomination .
He declared that “ Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel ” and that “ it must remain undivided ” .
He dismissed the Palestinian “ right of return ” ( “ Israel 's identity as a Jewish state must be preserved ” ) .
He hedged on his promise to meet Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and declared that “ I will do everything in my power to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon ; everything in my power ; everything . ”
Plus ça change
The speedy collapse of a cap - and - trade climate bill on June 6th also hinted at problems to come .
The bill was the most ambitious to reach the Senate floor thus far , and enjoyed bipartisan support .
But it collapsed without a single vote .
Optimists argue that the bill is just a dry run for a successful push under a different president and with a different constellation of power in Congress .
But pessimists rightly point out that Americans face a harder job adjusting to higher energy prices than Europeans , given their dependence on cars and taste for suburban living .
Paris , Texas , is not Paris , France ; $ 4 - a - gallon petrol is already creating widespread angst .
Any politician who promises ever - rising energy prices , even in a good cause , faces obliteration .
Mr Obama 's views on trade could also spell problems for the relationship .
In a speech in Raleigh , North Carolina , on June 9th he declared himself a free - trader .
But in the Ohio and Pennsylvania primaries he saturated the airwaves with ads denouncing NAFTA for devastating entire American cities .
He also favours tougher standards on labour and the environment in trade deals .
Mr Obama feels about free trade exactly what most Americans feel about tackling climate change — it 's a great idea so long as it involves all gain and no pain .
The transatlantic relationship faces very different problems from the ones that plagued it in the Bush years .
But it faces problems nonetheless .
Avoiding disappointment will require a careful management of expectations from both sides .
It will also require hard work .
The American presidential candidates have already demonstrated that they are willing to invest in rebuilding the relationship .
It is now up to the Europeans to produce some concrete suggestions of their own .
They should not wait until January 2009 to get their act together .
McCain ad suggests Lieberman is strong contender for VP John Byrne
Published : Wednesday August 27 , 2008
Print This Email This Novak claims Lieberman warned McCain picking him could be a ' disaster '
The McCain campaign is currently running an ad campaign through Google which suggests that Sen .
Joe Lieberman is a strong contender for the Republican 's vice presidential slot , RAW STORY has learned .
The ad , which appears below , has appeared on myriad political sites which employ words related to politics and the 2008 campaign , including Raw Story .
Google 's Adwords program allows advertisers to have their ads appear on sites which use certain words in their content .
Raw Story 's advertising policy does not prohibit advertising from particular candidates of either party .
While the ad could simply be an attempt to win over independent voters , or increase the campaign 's war chest from Jewish voters ( Sen. Lieberman is Jewish ) , the choice of words could offer a hint as to McCain 's decision - making in picking a running mate .
Lieberman joined former Democratic Vice President Al Gore on his 2000 presidential ticket .
McCain 's campaign floated his name among possible running mates last week .
The Connecticut senator told the Hartford Courant Monday that he has n't ruled out joining his Republican colleague on the ticket .
" The rest of us , particularly those of us who are privileged to be his friends , ought to take a temporary vow of silence , " Lieberman said .
" So , there 's not much I can say about this . "
New York Times columnist Bill Kristol -- a longtime GOP pundit -- wrote Sunday that McCain may be hankering to formally include the New England independent in his White House .
Kristol wrote : " He could select the person he would really like to have by his side in the White House -- but whose selection would cause palpitations among many of his staffers and supporters : the independent Democratic senator from Connecticut , Joe Lieberman . "
" Reports of strong support within John McCain 's presidential campaign for Independent Democratic Sen. Joseph Lieberman as the Republican candidate for vice president are not a fairy tale , " conservative columnist Robert Novak writes in his first " occasional column " since he retired from the regular beat after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor .
" Influential McCain backers , plus McCain himself , would pick the pro-choice liberal from Connecticut if they thought they could get away with it . "
However , Novak continues , " they ca n't get away with it -- and this has been made clear to McCain by none other than Joe Lieberman himself . "
Novak claims a Republican friend " prevailed on Lieberman to tell McCain that a McCain - Lieberman ticket would be a disaster for all concerned , and especially for the GOP , " because " aside from the war , he votes the straight liberal line , including pro-choice on abortion . "
" Lieberman 's Republican friend told him that the Republicans would leave Minnesota in a state of disarray with a McCain - Lieberman ticket , alienating social conservatives who now make up the core of Republican voters , " Novak adds .
Lieberman has given McCain visible and important counsel already .
When McCain said Iran had been allowing al Qaeda fighters to enter Iraq during a trip to the Middle East in March , Lieberman , who was among the delegation , was seen to whisper in his ear .
 Im sorry ; the Iranians are training the extremists , not Al Qaeda .
Not Al Qaeda , " McCain said .
" Im sorry . 
That 's twenty five issues that Obama gives a page to and McCain does not .
And some of them are pretty striking : Foreign Policy , Homeland Security , and Poverty are surprising absences in one way ; Faith , Family , and Service in another .
Here 's a list of issues McCain covers that have no counterpart on Obama 's Issues page : The Sanctity of Life ( question : why is " Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers " part of McCain 's Sanctity of Life policy ? ) , Judicial Philosophy , Space Program .
If you hunt around , you can find a link to a little page with two paragraphs on autism which has , to my knowledge , no counterpart on Obama 's site .
[ UPDATE : in comments at ObWi , ulpian246 points out that Obama does have a page on autism . ]
That 's four three issues that McCain gives a page to and Obama does not .
Moreover , Obama 's pages are a lot more detailed than McCain's , and they usually contain links to both to pdfs that are even more detailed and to speeches Obama has given on the topic in question .
Almost none of McCain 's do .
This is a pity : McCain 's speeches often contain more detailed expositions of his policy than you can find on his Issues page , and on issues like foreign policy , they are the only source of information about what he thinks .
But there is no systematic way to find them .
I do n't mean to suggest that this is any sort of serious critique of McCain 's campaign .
I do think that issues pages give a rough guide both to the care with which a candidate has thought through the issues , and to which ones he gives priority to , but it is rough .
( It 's a better guide to the professionalism of the campaign , as an organization . )
I also love issues pages , myself : I recall the bad old days when " Position Papers " were something you had to actually write off to campaigns for : most people had no access to them at all , and so we were entirely dependent on the media to tell us what the candidates actually believed .
The fact that we can now just go and read them all on our computers fills the once frustrated wonk in me with joy , and I like to see campaigns make it easy for us to inform ourselves .

Breaking news on Tuesday 's Countdown , as Keith Olbermann reveals that former Senator Phil Gramm , a general co-chair of Senator John McCain 's campaign , actually lobbied Congress on behalf of financial giant UBS to try and stop legislation aimed at installing industry regulations that could have prevented the current mortgage foreclosure crisis .
As with many issues , McCain has done a full flip flop on the mortgage crisis and the gaffe filled train wreck that is his campaign continues to fall deeper into the muck .
Can you imagine the outrage from the right and McCain 's media if Gramm worked for a Democratic candidate 's campaign ?

As recently as Dec. 31st of last year , still working for Swiss bankers specifically to help kill the " Emergency Home Ownership and Mortgage Equity Protection Act " and the " Helping Families Save Their Homes in Bankruptcy Act , " a bill that would have let bankruptcy judges adjust mortgage terms so American families facing foreclosure could repay their loans , and keep their homes .
At the same time he was giving that advice , federal disclosure forms reviewed by Countdown show that Gramm was simultaneously being paid by UBS to lobby the U - S Senate about the mortgage crisis ... opposing government regulation ... helping to kill a 2006 anti-predatory lending bill that would have tightened consumer protections , and might have mitigated the current crisis ...
Gramm officially joined the McCain campaign on March 12 , 2007 ... but as early as October , 2006 , RealClearPolitics reported that McCain was already relying on Gramm for fundraising help ...
McCain 's top political operative at the time saying , Gramm , quote , " obviously gives us advice on economic issues . "
UPDATE : The McCain campaign asked Olbermann to read a statement from them : Download Download
Three months later , McCain gave his broadest statement to date on the mortgage crisis ...
" Our financial market approach should include encouraging increased capital in financial institutions by removing regulatory , accounting and tax impediments "
" Removing regulatory impediments , " a Gramm mantra ...
Politico dot - com writing , " some housing experts and economists see Gramm 's thinking in the recent housing proposal . "
The McCain campaign confirmed that Gramm had input on the speech and that McCain consulted Gramm specifically on the housing issue .
Some economists blame Gramm in part for the crisis itself .
As Senate Banking Chairman , Gramm consistently weakened federal regulations ... his deregulation of energy commodities first helped his wife 's employer ... then killed it .
In 1999 , the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act , which McCain voted for , broke down the decades - old wall separating commercial banks , heavily regulated ... from the wild and woolly world of investment banking ... a wall erected in 1933 to prevent a repeat ... of the Great Depression .
One month after Gramm knocked that wall down , UBS bragged to investors that his bill would " liberalize restrictions . "
UBS bought Paine Weber the very next year ... and hired Gramm before he even left the Senate .
Gramm 's deregulation helped set the stage for an explosion of banks slicing up subprime mortgages , bundling them with other mortgage slices to hide the credit risks , and selling mortgage stew to other investment firms .
That gave lenders powerful incentive to make as many loans as possible , regardless of risk ... because they could turn around and sell those mortgages almost immediately .
Gramm himself said he was " totally unaware " just how many bad mortgages his own company bought .
At last count , UBS had lost 37 billion in the mortgage crisis , and plans to lay off 55 - hundred people next year , primarily in the US .
McCain has hinted he might make Gramm his Treasury Secretary .
But Gramm 's economic track record worries even McCain 's own advisors ... one of them telling the Washington Post last month , " I , for one , have thought about it a lot . "
One economist said , " McCain is counting on people having very short memories and not connecting some pretty obvious dots here . "
Two weeks after that report , UBS removed Gramm from its list of registered lobbyists .
But federal lobbying forms show at least two other McCain staffers ... congressional liaison John Green ... and national finance co-chairman Wayne Berman ... were both still lobbying on behalf of the mortgage industry as recently as the first quarter of this year .
Just over a month after consumer backlash caused MSN Music to rescind its decision to deactivate the digital rights management ( " DRM " ) servers that allowed MSN Music purchasers to " reauthorize " music files after upgrading operating systems or buying new computers , Yahoo !
Music has decided to deactivate its own DRM servers .
The ironically named Yahoo !
Music Unlimited
Store will shut its virtual doors in September , and , as of October 1 , will no longer provide license keys for music purchased from the store , nor will it authorize song playback on additional computers .
That means Yahoo !
Music customers will not be able to transfer songs to “ unauthorized computers ” or access the songs after changing operating systems .
Yahoo !
advises customers to back up their music to a CD if they want to be able to access it in the future .
In other words , Yahoo !
wants its customers to invest more time , labor and money in order to continue to enjoy the music for which they have already paid .
In fact , the more music they bought , the more work they 'll have to do .
What is worse , this suggestion could put customers at legal risk , as they may not have documentation of purchase .
Furthermore , there is no certainty that all relevant copyright owners would agree that making such backup copies without permission is lawful .
We ’ve warned music fans for years that they could lose their DRM - wrapped music if vendors decided to withdraw support for it .
Nonetheless , we hoped that the experience of MSN Music would encourage other vendors to think twice before making their customers pay the price for the vendors ’ own faulty business decisions .
If Yahoo !
wants to make things right , it should do the following :
• Issue a full public apology to your Yahoo !
Music customers .
• Offer to refund the purchase price of the affected downloads or , at the customer 's option , provide replacements from an online store that offers the same tracks in a DRM - free format .
• Ensure that all Yahoo !
Music buyers have ( or have permanent access to ) receipts identifying dates , amounts , and titles purchased , so they have proofs of purchase .
Or , better yet , offer to cover their legal costs if they are hit with a copyright infringement claim based on a song purchased through Yahoo !
Music .
• Widely publicize the above measures so that Yahoo ! customers know their options .
That publicity should include , at a minimum , advertising in major music magazines and newspapers in every major U.S. city , as well as targeted keyword advertising .
At the very least , this announcement is further evidence ( if such evidence were needed ) that DRM is just bad business .
It 's bad for the consumers who do n't actually own the music they pay for ; it 's bad for the rightsholders who lose out when legal copies of their songs are worth less than illegally obtained copies ; and it's bad for the companies that must choose between maintaining technology that is defective by design or violating the trust of their customers .

Analysts estimate it would take at least 260,000 turbines , each 300 feet tall , to meet the United States ' electricity needs .
These turbines are in King City , Mo .
Thanks to blow - hard winds , the United States has just become the world 's largest generator of wind energy .
Germany previously held this distinction , though since the United States has about 26 times more land than Germany , the milestone is n't a huge surprise .
Nonetheless , we were n't expected to reach this point until late 2009 .
" Our wind energy capacity is growing faster than anyplace else , " said Randall Swisher , the executive director of the American Wind Energy Association , the national trade organization for the wind energy industry .
" So it 's no longer really alternative energy .
This is very mainstream . "
During the first half of 2008 , the United States , for the first time , generated more wind energy electricity than Germany , despite the fact that the smaller European country still has more turbines than we do .
Germany has enough turbines to collect about 22,000 to 23,000 megawatts of power , while the United States has a capacity of about 18,000 megawatts , Swisher said .
" The difference is that because the winds are so much stronger here in the U.S. we are actually providing more wind - generated electricity than Germany , " Swisher told LiveScience .
" Our turbines are so much more productive that theirs . "
Though we are winning the race in terms of volume of wind energy produced , we are far behind when it comes to the proportion of our total energy we get from wind .
While wind currently supplies about 1.2 percent of the United States ' power , it accounts for about 7 percent of Germany 's total energy consumption .
And the even - smaller country of Denmark gets roughly 20 percent of its energy form wind .
Most of America 's wind power is being collected in Texas ( which provides more than 25 percent of the country 's wind - generated electricity ) , the Midwest , and West Coast , Swisher said .
The main issue with ramping up our use of wind power is not a lack of wind — have you seen how gusty it gets on the plains of Iowa ? — but a lack of good ways to transport that energy from where it 's collected to homes and offices and factories where it will be used .
" The major constraint is the transmission infrastructure , " Swisher said .
" To be able to build more turbines we have to build more transmission lines to carry the electricity from where it 's generated to major areas where energy is being used . "
Though America 's wind energy use is certainly ramping up , we still have a ways to go toward harnessing its full potential .
The U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) reported that wind has the capability to provide 20 percent of our country 's energy needs by the year 2030 .
Since wind is a " green " form of energy , the DOE predicted this change would lead to a 25 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation in 2030 .
" We need to back away from fossil fuel and embrace renewable energy , " Swisher said .
" The survival of the world depends on it . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - New government estimates show that nearly 24 million people in the United States have diabetes , an increase of more than 3 million in two years .

This means that nearly 8 percent of the U.S. population has diabetes , mostly the type - 2 diabetes linked with obesity , poor diet and a lack of exercise , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday .
The estimates , based on 2007 data , also show that 57 million people have pre-diabetes , a condition that puts people at increased risk for diabetes .
And up to 25 percent of people with diabetes do not know they have it , the CDC said -- down from 30 percent two years ago .
Almost 25 percent of the population 60 years and older had diabetes in 2007 , the CDC found .
The highest rates are among Native Americans and Alaska Natives , with 16.5 percent affected .
Close to 12 percent of blacks and 10 percent of Hispanics have diabetes , but just 7.5 percent of Asian Americans and 6.6 percent of whites .
Diabetes causes the body to produce less insulin , or to use it less effectively , which in turn causes blood sugar levels to rise .
This in turn damages blood vessels and organs , leading to blindness , kidney disease , limb loss and heart disease .
It is the seventh - leading cause of death in the United States .
“ It is concerning to know that we have more people developing diabetes , and these data are a reminder of the importance of increasing awareness of this condition , especially among people who are at high risk , ” said Dr. Ann Albright , director of the CDC ’s Division of Diabetes Translation .
“ On the other hand , it is good to see that more people are aware that they have diabetes .
That is an indication that our efforts to increase awareness are working , and more importantly , that more people are better prepared to manage this disease and its complications . ”

For months investors reaped the rewards of long positions in energy - related stocks while simultaneously going short financial names .
That trend abruptly reversed in July after oil hit its apex and financial shares began to recover .
However , popular strategies tend to die hard , and some analysts believe the fundamental picture remains strong for energy stocks and cloudy for financials .
" There are fundamental investors who still believe that in the long - term this is the right trade , " says Sveinn Palsson , U.S. derivatives strategist ...
Home sales in California surged more than 12 % in July from a year ago -- the biggest jump in sales in four years , a research firm said Tuesday .
A total of 39,507 new and pre-owned homes were sold statewide last month .
That ’s up 12.3 % from July 2007 and up 12.2 % from June ’s total , MDA DataQuick said in a report .
Foreclosed homes accounted for 44.8 % of all the homes sold last month .
The surge in foreclosure sales and home depreciation , coupled with fewer sales of high - end homes , helped drive down the statewide median home price to $ 318,000 , a decline of 33.5 % from July 2007 .

The statewide median home price peaked in May 2007 at $ 484,000 .
In the San Francisco Bay Area , prices plunged 29.3 % in July to a 53 - month low .
The median price for new and resale homes and condos stood at $ 470,000 last month , down from $ 665,000 in July 2007 .
The figure also marks a decline from $ 485,000 in June .
The nine - county area did see a slight increase in annual sales .
There were 7,586 new and resale homes and condos sold last month , up 2.2 % from July 2007 .
The rise is the first year - over - year gain for home sales in the region since January 2005 .

Walsh said the sales increases did n’t necessarily point to a sustainable rebound in the housing industry .
STRASBOURG , France  European Union lawmakers voted Wednesday to allow undocumented migrants to be held in detention centers for up to 18 months and banned from European Union territory for five years .
Criticized by groups like Amnesty International as “ severely flawed ” and an erosion of human rights standards , the so - called return directive was passed in the European Parliament here by a 369 - to - 197 vote , with 106 legislators abstaining .
Manfred Weber , the German center - right legislator from Bavaria who shepherded the measure through Parliament , said that it provided minimum common standards for the treatment of migrants throughout the European Union while still showing citizens it was tough on illegality .
As for the migrants , he said : “ The member states must decide whether they need them ; if so , then please legalize them .
If you do n’t need them for your labor markets , then send them home . ”
Elaine Wynn Captures Gold - Jason Kidd's Beijing Medal ( Photos )
Dallas Mavericks point guardis fresh off a gold medal win at the Beijing Games .
The US Men's Basketball team took the top prize after losing out in 2004 at the Athens Games .
Kidd , who already won gold in 2000 at the Sydney Games , has no intention of holding on to his newest medal .
It turns out Kidd promised the gold medal to Elaine Wynn , wife of casino mogul Steve Wynn .
The US Men 's team stayed at the $ 2.7 billion Wynn Casino in Las Vegas for three weeks last year while preparing for Beijing .
Kidd met Elaine Wynn and struck up a friendship .
He was reportedly impressed with her kindness and her amazing grasp of the game and told her he'd give her his gold medal if Team USA took gold in Beijing .
The ' redeem team ' pulled off the win and true to his word , Kidd will present the medal to the Wynn's .
He hopes they will display the gold medal at one of their casino properties - which he would consider a Win -Wynn situation .
Steve Wynn , who owns a collection of resorts , is the 277th richest man in the world and is worth $ 3.9 billion .
The art collection of Picassos and Matisses at Wynn Casino were purchased for $ 150 million , though their worth continues to appreciate in value .
Surely the Wynn 's can make room for an Olympic gold medal somewhere on the premises .

Tom Cruise Named in $ 250 Million Scientology Lawsuit
Former Scientologistis suing the Church of Scientology for harassment to the tune of $ 250 million .
Court documents include actorin the suit , referring to him as a right hand associate of church head
Letterese was a member of the Church on and off for over two decades beginning in 1973 .
During that time he held several positions of power within the organization .
That all began to sour in the early 90's when Letterese accused the Church of copyright infringement for their illegal use of a course of study that he had acquired the exclusive rights to some years earlier .
Letterese was eventually excommunicated for violating Church policy - read that to mean disagreeing with the mother ship .
Letterese filed a lawsuit in Southern District Court in Florida on July 15 , 2008 .
Court documents submitted on behalf of the disgruntled former member refer to the Church of Scientology as a crime syndicate .
Letterese intends to level racketeering and corruption charges against the powerful organization and hopes to force an investigation under the RICO statute ( Racketeering Influenced and Corruption Organization ) .
Court documents name David Miscavage and Tom Cruise as being instrumental in committing crimes while lobbying for and soliciting huge sums of money from foreign and domestic sources .
Lawyers for the Church of Scientology call the lawsuit frivolous and based upon falsehoods .
Katie Holmes was said to have undergone a dangerous Scientology purification ritual recently that discolored her hands .

With the trade deadline looming , the Boston Red Sox are engaged in serious conversations to trade Manny Ramirez to the Florida Marlins , as well as other teams , sources told ESPN The Magazine 's Buster Olney .
The deadline to trade players without going to waivers is Thursday at 4 p.m. ET .
As a player with 10 years in the majors and five with the same team , Ramirez has the right to veto any deal .
As of Thursday morning , Ramirez told ESPNdeportes.com 's Enrique Rojas that he has n't heard anything about a possible trade .
" Nobody has called me from Boston , and neither has my agent [ Scott Boras ] , " Ramírez told ESPNdeportes.com .
" The only thing I know of a possible trade is what I 've seen in ESPN . "
Olney , citing an executive involved in the conversations regarding Ramirez , reports that progress is being made Thursday .
The feeling is momentum is building toward completion of a deal .
SI.com reported Thursday that Ramirez had approved a possible trade to the Marlins , but no agreement has been reached .
However , Ramirez told ESPNdeportes.com that he has n't approved a trade to Florida .
Ramirez said he would call Boras to check on SI. com 's story .
" They have n't asked me for anything , " Ramirez told ESPNdeportes.com on the phone from Fenway Park before the Red Sox -Angels matchup on Wednesday night .
" The Red Sox do n't deserve a player like me , " Ramirez said .
" During my years here , I 've seen how they [ the Red Sox ] have mistreated other great players when they did n't want them to try to turn the fans against them .
" The Red Sox did the same with guys like Nomar Garciaparra and Pedro Martinez , and now they do the same with me .
Their goal is to paint me as the bad guy , " Ramirez added .
" I love Boston fans , but the Red Sox do n't deserve me .
I 'm not talking about money .
Mental peace has no price , and I do n't have peace here . "
Still , Boston players were n't convinced Ramirez would be dealt before Thursday 's deadline .
" I think around here there 's a lot more smoke than fire .
If something happens , it happens , " Boston 's Mike Lowell said .
The deal might be a long shot , but Marlins president David Samson did n't rule it out Wednesday .
On his weekly radio show , Samson addressed reports the Marlins are discussing a trade to acquire Ramirez from the Red Sox .
" The Marlins always seem to be in the middle of everything , " Samson said on WAXY - AM .
" It takes two to tango .
We 're looking everywhere .
We 're making calls .
We 're getting calls .
But we 're not going to be stupid . "
Asked specifically whether a deal for Ramirez was possible , Samson said , " I 've always told you everything is possible .
There are all sorts of crazy things .
There 's no way to say which trades are going to happen . "
Ramirez , who went 0 - for - 3 in the Red Sox 's 9 - 2 loss to the Angels on Wednesday night , is hitting .299 with 20 home runs and 68 RBIs this season .
If the Red Sox plan to get rid of Ramirez , they have n't told the left fielder .
" If something happens , it will not be tonight .
And frankly , I do n't think that will ever happen .
Let 's wait if something happens before 4 p.m. Thursday , " Ramirez told Rojas from his home after the Red Sox 's loss .
" This situation is not a strange one for me because it 's more of the same story in my eight years in Boston . "
To avoid losing the habit of striking weird solutions to problems , Ramirez suggested a change that would solve two issues at the moment .
" I should go to Green Bay straight up and they should send Brett Favre to Boston .
That will end two soap operas at the same time , " Ramirez told Rojas .
Ramirez makes nearly as much as the Marlins ' entire roster -- he's in the final guaranteed year of his eight - year , $ 160 million contract .
The Red Sox have options for each of the next two seasons at $ 20 million .
The Marlins ' payroll of $ 22 million is by far the smallest in the majors .
They 're among the most surprising teams in the majors , and a 7 - 5 victory Wednesday over the New York Mets left them 1½ games behind NL East leader Philadelphia .
The Mets fell a half - game behind the Phils .
After the game , Florida president for baseball operations Larry Beinfest had only one comment for reporters as he attempted to cut off questions about Ramirez .
" Talk about tonight 's game , guys , " Beinfest said .
Ramirez 's often turbulent relationship with the Red Sox took a new twist Sunday when he said , " I 'm tired of them .
They 're tired of me . "
But there 's a good chance the Red Sox will keep him .
And Samson said the Marlins might stand pat with confidence they have " as good a chance to win the division as the Mets and Phillies . "
If the Red Sox make a deal with the Marlins , it is likely they would kick in money to offset Ramirez 's salary , and they would look for three young players in return -- perhaps outfielder Jeremy Hermida or outfielder Josh Willingham , plus pitchers , sources told Olney and ESPN.com 's Jayson Stark .
" Trying to find a match is just hard , " Samson said .
" I can't say teams are exactly lining up to deal with the Marlins at the moment . "
The Pittsburgh Pirates have joined the talks in a possible three - way deal for Ramirez .
The sides are also discussing moving lefty reliever John Grabow from Pittsburgh to the Red Sox .
The current sticking point , a well - placed source told Olney , is that the Marlins want the Red Sox to add a prospect to their take in the deal .
Pittsburgh - area newspapers are reporting that sources say the Pirates could get Hermida from the Marlins and send left fielder Bay to the Red Sox while Boston would send Ramirez to Florida .
There would be other players involved in the trade as well , though who 's going where depends on the report .
According to The Beaver County ( Pa. )
Times , the three clubs have talked about various versions of a deal including some that would send Boston rookie shortstop Jed Lowrie to the Pirates with veteran Pittsburgh shortstop Jack Wilson going to the Red Sox .
The Pirates also have interest in Red Sox left - handed pitcher prospect Hunter Jones .
Part of the deal could also have Grabow going to Florida and Marlins outfield prospect Mike Stanton ending up in the Pittsburgh farm system .
The Pittsburgh Post - Gazette , citing an unnamed source , had Ramirez going to Florida with a prospect and cash and Bay and Grabow headed for Boston , with the Pirates obtaining prospects including 21 - year - old right - handed starter Ryan Tucker , who was called up from Class AA and made six appearances with the Marlins .
He went 2 - 3 with an 8.39 ERA .
The Palm Beach Post reported on its Web site late Wednesday that the three teams had a tentative deal in which Pirates outfielder Jason Bay would land in Boston .
Responding to the report , Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria said : " There 's no news , nothing to talk about . "
Speculation about a possible Ramirez deal was greeted with amusement in the clubhouse before Florida 's game Wednesday night against the Mets .
Hermida was among the players mentioned in reports as possible trade bait for the Red Sox .
" You going to Boston ? " teammate Dan Uggla shouted at Hermida .
" I do n't know .
I guess so , " Hermida said with slight smile .
Hermida went 2 - for - 4 with a triple in Wednesday 's win and said he did n't think during the game about the prospect of being traded .
" You put that aside when you step between the white lines , " Hermida said .
" You go out there and try to beat the Mets , and let other people take care of that stuff .
I 've still got a Marlins jersey on .
It did n't affect me whatsoever . "
Willingham has also been mentioned as a candidate to go to Boston .
" I had n't heard anything about myself until today , " Willingham said after going 2 - for - 3 .
" It 's strange because that was the last thing on my mind -- a trade rumor .
" I 'm happy here .
Until something happens , I 'll continue to be happy . "
Manager Fredi Gonzalez laughed off questions about a possible deal and where Ramirez would play for Florida .
" I think we 'll just straight DH him , " Gonzalez said .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Anti-graft authorities in a southern Chinese city are questioning mistresses of suspected corrupt officials and finding the information is paying off prettily , state media said on Thursday .
Mistresses and “ second wives ” are common among government officials and businessmen in China and are often blamed for driving officials to seek money through bribes or other abuses of power .
“ At least 80 percent of corrupt officials exposed in Dongguan had mistresses who gave us important information that we did not possess , ” Zhou Yuefeng , deputy director of the industrial city ’s anti-graft bureau told the China Daily .
He declined to give details .
Besides having mistresses , Zhou said receiving bribes in the form of share dividends was also common among corrupt officials in Dongguan .
“ Our focus this year will be on the taxation and medical departments . ” he said .
“ However , that does n’t mean we wo n’t be looking at corruption in other areas . ”
A report by China ’s top prosecutor ’s office last year said that of 16 provincial - level officials punished for serious graft in the previous five years , most were involved in “ trading power for sex , ” along with gambling , money - laundering and shady land sales to developers .
About a year ago , I compiled a huge list of artistic sites .
It seems like the trend has carried on in 2008 and is growing stronger ( thank God the glossy style is gone ) .

Johnny Carson might have quipped about the economy , " Inflation is so bad these days … that pennies are now selling on the street for two cents . "
This joke may not be all that funny , even with the great Carnac delivering it , but it does have the underpinnings of good comedy : an absurd story based on a kernel of truth .
Old pennies are routinely traded at premium prices , sometimes twice or more their face value .
This is not because they are rare or precious — they were minted by the tens of billions — but simply because they are worth more as metal than as money .
Because of this " bullion premium " on the older pennies , a small cadre of penny hoarders is actively searching through America 's stock of pennies to pick out these undervalued coins .
Casual observers are not struck with a deep sense of economic import when they learn about penny hoarding .
Neither are most economists .
The government dealt with the problem by simply making the coin out of a much cheaper metal : zinc .
So what 's the big deal ?
Well , it turns out that the cheaper metal did n't stay cheap forever , and again it costs the US mint more than a cent to make a penny ( and , incidentally , more than 5 cents to make a nickel ) .
By one estimate , the mint lost over $ 100 million making pennies in 2007 , with costs ranging from 1.2 to 1.7 cents for each penny made .
So the government is likely to change these coins to an even cheaper metal , this time steel , which is as cheap as it gets .
The next step would be to abandon the coin altogether ( as many countries have done with their smallest denominations ) and have people round prices off to the nearest nickel or dime .
At that point , governments should have the " coinflation " problem pretty much taken care of .
But debasing coins usually fails in the long run , as the metal value of small coins tends to rise above face value .
It has happened several times in American history , with various coins during the colonial era , the thick copper - nickel pennies during the Civil War , and with silver dimes , quarters , and half dollars during the mid-1960s .
The connecting link in all these stories turns out to be paper - money inflation .
Paper money is inherently inflationary , and , over the long term , tends to drive up the prices of commodities to the point at which certain coins become undervalued relative to paper currency .
These coins are hoarded out of circulation , then traded for their metal value rather than their face value .
That this is happening again with the penny should cause us to stop and take notice of a deep - seated , and potentially troublesome , economic phenomenon at work .
It turns out that the penny is an economic bellwether — an indicator of the long - term course of the US dollar and of the soundness of US monetary policy .
The penny does have a story to tell .
Like a canary in the coal mine of America 's monetary system , the penny can warn of lurking inflationary troubles .
The lowly penny indeed has economic relevance far beyond its size and value .
From 1864 until 1982 , US pennies were made of copper .
[ 1 ]
Rising copper prices through the 1970s made it cost the US mint more than a penny to make a penny , and so a cheaper substitute metal was sought .
Late in 1982 , the mint began making pennies out of zinc — with a thin copper veneer to make them outwardly identical to previous issues .
Something else happened in 1982 .
Under Chairman Paul Volcker , the Federal Reserve engaged in a tight - money policy that finally brought the raging inflation of the 1970s down to earth .
Prices of copper and most other commodities actually declined over the next several years .
Some economists now refer to the period from then until now as the " great moderation , " a time of low inflation , low unemployment , and steady economic growth .
The monetary moderation has been so successful that most economists these days do not list inflation among the big problems facing the US economy .
Despite this moderation , inflation never really went away .
Inflation is the monetary policy of the United States , and has been , with minor interruptions , since the advent of central banking almost a hundred years ago .
This is no secret ; according to the government 's own inflation calculator , it takes $ 21.57 in current dollars to purchase what one dollar would have bought in 1913 .
[ 2 ]
The low and stable , " creeping " inflation of the past 25 years has perhaps been acceptable , especially when compared to the " galloping " inflation of the 1970s and early ' 80s .
Businessmen and consumers are able to cope with the moderate inflation , and economic performance seems to be pretty good .
But neither of these considerations changes the fact that , in less than 100 years of inflationary monetary policies , the dollar has depreciated more than 21 - fold .
To see how the penny neatly tracks this long - run inflation , we need to look at its " melt value " — the market price of its metal content — and how it has changed through history .
In 1864 , the first year of the small copper cent , melt value per penny stood at 0.3 cents , less than one - third of face value .
This low melt value makes sense , given that the small copper cent was born amidst a tremendous episode of unbacked paper - money issuance — the Civil War–era " greenbacks . "
The printing of greenbacks naturally drove prices up , and led to hoarding of small coins , which quickly rose to a premium in terms of the new paper money .
The small copper cent was issued as a debasement of the heavier , more valuable copper - nickel cent .
By 1879 , the greenback currency had been ( remarkably ) completely redeemed in gold , and America was back to a sound , gold - backed money .
This return to gold completely wiped out the inflation of the 1860s .
The penny 's melt value fell , as did the general price level .
Four decades of the classical gold standard saw remarkably stable — at times gently falling — prices .
By 1913 , the copper penny 's melt value had fallen to one - tenth of a cent , about as far from a bullion premium as it could get , thus precluding the possibility of hoarding .
Nineteen - thirteen was a turning point , marking the advent of the Federal Reserve Bank , and the rebirth of inflationary currency not backed by precious metals .
If the launch of the Federal Reserve did n't open the door to massive inflation , it at least left it unlocked .
From 1913 , the price level began to rise gradually — and the penny 's melt value along with it .
Yet melt value did n't come close to face value until the roaring inflation of the 1970s .
Not coincidentally , 1971 marked the final death knell of the gold standard : after a long series of dollar / gold debasements , President Nixon finally closed the " gold window , " removing the last vestige of gold backing from the dollar .
With this impediment removed , inflation took off , taking the penny 's melt value with it .
The rising copper value of pennies forced the mint to seek alternative metals .
After experiments with aluminum and copper - plated steel , mint authorities finally settled on copper - plated zinc in 1982 , which , coincidentally , just happened to be the beginning of the great moderation .
The great moderation stinted inflation , and actually made the penny debasement seem superfluous for a while .
Copper prices actually went down in the mid 1980s , but never back to pre-1971 levels .
Volcker and the Fed had sent the inflationary dragon running for cover ; copper pennies remained in circulation .
They did not slay the beast , though , and the price level continued its steady ascent .
Inflation finally caught up to the copper penny , with melt value braking through the 1 - cent barrier in 2005 .
When this " melt - parity " barrier was breached , it happened with gusto : copper prices soared in 2005 – 2006 , pulling the copper cent 's melt value as high as 2.6 cents in April of 2008 .
As the chart below shows , the penny 's melt value roughly follows the overall price level as measured by the Consumer Price Index .
Despite fairly wide variations in melt value through the ' 70s , '80s , and '90s , its overall trend is upward , as if the price level is tugging at the melt value .
The bullion premium on copper cents is mostly a product of inflation .
The close relationship between official inflation rates and the bullion value of pennies makes it clear that inflation killed the copper penny .
And now , because inflation has n't really abated during the last 25 years , inflation is also killing the zinc penny .
Inflation imposes many costs on an economy .
One of these costs is exposed by the phenomenon of 2 - cent pennies : inflation eventually drives the prices of monetary metals above the face value of particular coins .
When inflation becomes entrenched in a nation 's monetary policy , it leads almost inevitably to coin debasement and hoarding .
Copper - penny hoarding and zinc - penny debasement may or may not mean the " great moderation " is officially over , but they surely are signs that it wo n't last forever .
The debasement of the penny from copper to zinc , and the coming debasement from zinc to steel are clear indicators that US monetary policy makers have cast their lot with inflation .
Wise citizens would do well to stay tuned to the penny and observe what it reveals about monetary policy and the future of the dollar .
A lowest law enforcement priority of adult personal use of cannabis will be placed on the Hawaii ballot .
The proposal defines personal use as an individual who has less than 24 plants or 24 ounces of cannabis .
According to The Honolulu Advertiser August 19 , 2008 article , ( " Big Isle Vote Could Lessen Marijuana Enforcement " )
" The off - and - on political struggle over eradication and enforcement of anti-marijuana laws on the Big Island is moving to the fall election , when voters will be asked whether law enforcement officials should make busts of small - time marijuana users the county 's lowest policing priority .
The proposed ordinance advanced by a group called ' Project Peaceful Sky ' -- and ordered onto the ballot by a split vote of the County Council - - would also prohibit the county from accepting any further state or federal money for marijuana eradication operations . "
The article states , " However , County Corporation Counsel Lincoln Ashida said the proposed ordinance to be placed on the ballot may be unenforceable even if the voters do approve it because it apparently violates the pre-emption doctrine arising from the U.S. and Hawai 'i state constitutions .
That doctrine says legislative bodies such as the County Council cannot dictate to executive branch agencies such as the police and prosecutors how to run their day - to - day operations .
The initiative to de-emphasize marijuana enforcement appears to do just that , Ashida said , and he will ask the state attorney general 's office to rule on whether the ordinance is legal if the voters approve it . "
The article adds , " Councilman Bob Jacobson , who introduced the council resolution to put the proposal on the ballot , said he wants to see the issue put to a public vote .
Jacobson said a variety of people told him privately they wanted to sign the petition , but were embarrassed or were afraid to sign for fear they would suffer repercussions at work .
Adam Lehmann , board director of the Peaceful Sky effort , said his group collected the nearly 5,000 signatures in about two months , proving there is significant support for the idea .
' People are really tired of seeing money misappropriated away from education and healthcare to fund a military - style war on a plant , ' said Lehmann , 30 .
' It 's clearly going to give law enforcement more time and resources to focus on serious crimes .
It 's going to provide lots of space in our prisons , it 's going to help courts run smoother , and it 's going to essentially save this county 's taxpayers millions of dollars every year , ' because they will avoid the costs of strict marijuana enforcement , he said . "
We ’ve recently joined the whole urban homesteading movement and one thing I ’ve been focused on is trying to really up the ante on having a low - waste , self - producing kitchen .
I ’ve concentrated on wasting less and producing more with local and / or homegrown ingredients .
Repurposing waste–finding new ways to use things that would end up composted , recycled , or trashed , has been very rewarding as I rethink and organize my kitchen , refrigerator , and pantry .
Here ’s six tips I ’ve found to turn would - be trash into items easily utilized in my kitchen .
1. Compost .
What are you waiting for ?
You do n’t need a fancy container .
I just have a pile in my yard .
All my produce waste , plus eggshells , teabags , and coffee grounds , go in the pile , along with dead leaves and grass clippings ( after they ’ve dried ) .
Give it a good shower and a turn once a week .
Get some worms going in there
You ’ll get unbelievable fertilizer in as little as six weeks , all from stuff that would have gone in a landfill or down the disposal .
2.. Homemade stock .
I almost always use veggie stock–a habit I got into during my years as a vegetarian and my current diet as a infrequent meat eater .
Those vacuum - sealed boxes are around $ 3 , sometimes more .
Why pay that when I can make my own from stuff that would end up in my compost pile ?
I started saving odds and ends of veggies from cooking and keeping them in a container in the freezer .
I never use an entire onion and always have some type of limp veggie that I do n’t want to throw out .
When I had an entire container ( about two or three cups ) , I chopped up some garlic , sauteed it in olive oil in the bottom of a stockpot , added the veggies , and filled the pot up with water .
Brough it to a boil , reduced to a simmer , and let this baby bubble away for an hour .
Seasoned it midway through with salt , pepper , and whatever herbs I had in my garden .
I let this all cool , then strained it through a cheesecloth into freezer - safe containers .
I made the equivalent of three and a half of those boxes of stock for absolutely nothing .
The veggies went into the compost pile , where they were heading before .
The best part about this is you can use almost anything that ’s not gone completely bad–we ’re talking onion papers , veggie peels , etc .
I even threw in some parmigiano - reggiano rinds that I did n’t want to go to waste to give it a richer flavor .
3. Croutons and bread crumbs .
We ’ve always got odds and ends of bread around this house .
Either someone ( okay , me ) does n’t want to eat the heel of the bread , or I ’ve got a quarter of a bakery loaf that looks like it might start sprouting dreaded mold at any moment .
My new solution –pop it in a bag in the freezer .
When I ’ve got a bunch saved up , I oven - toast those bad boys up , either cubed and tossed with garlic - herb butter for croutons , or plain , which I then run through my little food processor .
Add italian seasoning ( or any seasoning you like ) , and you do n’t have to buy bread crumbs .
Let me tell you , much like dressing , once you start eating homemade croutons , you wo n’t buy them anymore .
I made some the other day with some old challah … I could have eaten them alone , sans salad .
4. Glass jars .
Yes , they ’re recyclable .
But , even better , they ’re infinitely reusable .
I ’ve got them everywhere .
They mostly come to my kitchen by way of housing store - bought pasta sauce , salsa , or condiments .
Why buy storage containers when you can use jars you ’ve got at home ?
Wash them , take off the labels , and use them to store dry goods .
I ’ve got various grains , beans , lentils , and baking supplies all stored in glass jars , all labeled with my handy - dandy label maker .
We also use them to drink out of , to cold - brew coffee in the summer , and to store non-kitchen things like nails , screws , old batteries to be recycled , etc .
5. Lemons .
If you use lemons for cooking and baking , they do n’t necessary have to go straight to the compost pile after you ’ve zested or juiced them .
They ’ve got another life as a freshening agent .
I use an already - juiced half to wipe down my cutting board or counters .
You can also run them through your disposal to freshen things up a bit .
It can get nasty down there .
6 . Ends of bottles of wine .
At our house , there ’s usually not much , if any , wine left after we ’ve cracked a bottle .
But sometimes you find yourself with less than a glass that you are thinking about throwing away .
Freeze it in an ice - cube tray to use later in a sauce , stock , or soup .
Good wine adds great flavor to all of these .

When you get on the scale in the morning , you may be hoping that it registers a smaller number than the day before -- you may be hoping that you 've lost weight .
It 's the quantity of mass in you , plus the force of gravity , that determines your weight .
But what determines your mass ?
That 's one of the most - asked , most - hotly pursued questions in physics today .
Many of the experiments circulating in the world 's particle accelerators are looking into the mechanism that gives rise to mass .
Scientists at CERN , as well as at Fermilab in Illinois , are hoping to find what they call the " Higgs boson . "
Higgs , they believe , is a particle , or set of particles , that might give others mass .
The idea of one particle giving another mass is a bit counter - intuitive ...
Is n't mass an inherent characteristic of matter ?
If not , how can one entity impart mass on all the others by simply floating by and interacting with them ?
Higgs - like Particle Discovered !
On July 4 , 2012 , CERN announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that 's consistent with the Higgs boson a particle that 's been searched for since the 1970s .
Whether it's the Higgs or something that closely resembles it , a new particle is a historic discovery .
See " Higgs within reach " on CERN 's website .

Click on the image above for a helpful cartoon explanation of the Higgs Mechanism .
An oft - cited analogy describes it well : Imagine you 're at a Hollywood party .
The crowd is rather thick , and evenly distributed around the room , chatting .
When the big star arrives , the people nearest the door gather around her .
As she moves through the party , she attracts the people closest to her , and those she moves away from return to their other conversations .
By gathering a fawning cluster of people around her , she 's gained momentum , an indication of mass .
She 's harder to slow down than she would be without the crowd .
Once she 's stopped , it 's harder to get her going again .
This clustering effect is the Higgs mechanism , postulated by British physicist Peter Higgs in the 1960s .
The theory hypothesizes that a sort of lattice , referred to as the Higgs field , fills the universe .
This is something like an electromagnetic field , in that it affects the particles that move through it , but it is also related to the physics of solid materials .
Scientists know that when an electron passes through a positively charged crystal lattice of atoms ( a solid ) , the electron 's mass can increase as much as 40 times .
The same might be true in the Higgs field : a particle moving through it creates a little bit of distortion -- like the crowd around the star at the party -- and that lends mass to the particle .

Scientists at CERN use the enormous ALEPH detector in their search for the Higgs particle .
The question of mass has been an especially puzzling one , and has left the Higgs boson as the single missing piece of the Standard Model yet to be spotted .
The Standard Model describes three of nature 's four forces : electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces .
Electromagnetism has been fairly well understood for many decades .
Recently , physicists have learned much more about the strong force , which binds the elements of atomic nuclei together , and the weak force , which governs radioactivity and hydrogen fusion ( which generates the sun 's energy ) .
Electromagnetism describes how particles interact with photons , tiny packets of electromagnetic radiation .
In a similar way , the weak force describes how two other entities , the W and Z particles , interact with electrons , quarks , neutrinos and others .
There is one very important difference between these two interactions : photons have no mass , while the masses of W and Z are huge .
In fact , they are some of the most massive particles known .
The first inclination is to assume that W and Z simply exist and interact with other elemental particles .
But for mathematical reasons , the giant masses of W and Z raise inconsistencies in the Standard Model .
To address this , physicists postulate that there must be at least one other particle -- the Higgs boson .
The simplest theories predict only one boson , but others say there might be several .
In fact , the search for the Higgs particle (s ) is some of the most exciting research happening , because it could lead to completely new discoveries in particle physics .
Some theorists say it could bring to light entirely new types of strong interactions , and others believe research will reveal a new fundamental physical symmetry called " supersymmetry . "

CERN scientists were unsure whether these events recorded by the ALEPH detector indicated the presence of a Higgs boson .
Check out the links listed below for the latest information on the search for the Higgs Boson .
First , though , scientists want to determine whether the Higgs boson exists .
The search has been on for over ten years , both at CERN's Large Electron Positron Collider ( LEP ) in Geneva and at Fermilab in Illinois .
To look for the particle , researchers must smash other particles together at very high speeds .
If the energy from that collision is high enough , it is converted into smaller bits of matter -- particles -- one of which could be a Higgs boson .
The Higgs will only last for a small fraction of a second , and then decay into other particles .
So in order to tell whether the Higgs appeared in the collision , researchers look for evidence of what it would have decayed into .
In August 2000 , physicists working at CERN 's LEP saw traces of particles that might fit the right pattern , but the evidence is still inconclusive .
LEP was closed down in the beginning of November , 2000 , but the search continues at Fermilab in Illinois , and will pick up again at CERN when the LHC ( Large Hadron Collider ) begins experiments in 2005 .

It looks like the opening of an ad seeking aid , but it 's a spot created by coffee giant Starbucks .
It 's to let viewers know that with every cup of coffee they buy , they are supporting social projects like the construction of a water cistern in Tanzania .
" It 's a new trend we 're noticing , " said Spencer Crooks , a spokesman for the video - sharing site .
" A lot of companies turn to YouTube to raise awareness of global concerns like renewable energy , climate change or poverty .
Now , socially conscious businesses are following suit by leveraging their brands to showcase important issues and encourage people to get involved . "
Starbucks is one of several major retailers using the site to display their concern for making the world a better place .
Nike produced a six - part series called " The Girl Effect , " promoting education and support for girls and young women in the fight against poverty in developing countries .
Then there 's organic grocer Whole Foods , whose YouTube spot - called " Whole Earth Generation " - teaches users how to save money by using biofuel and encourages them to present their own videos about what they do to protect the environment .
" It 's the company 's opportunity to get into pretty personal communication and interaction with its own customers , " Crooks said .
" They strengthen their brand by putting a face to things .
Customers can hear and see them talk . "
Timberland also has joined the social causes movement .
The outdoor company produced a video in which its employees talk about their values and give tips on saving energy .
Like Whole Foods , Timberland solicits feedback , asking viewers to submit video of their efforts to become an Earthkeeper .
Viewers can vote on the clips Sept. 2 - 14 to choose an Earthkeeper Hero who will receive $ 5,000 .
" The Earthkeeper channel on YouTube is one of several vehicles by which we seek to engage consumers in a dialogue around the environment and climate change , " said Margaret Morey - Reuner , Timberland 's senior manager of values marketing .
" The reason we chose to sponsor a contest on YouTube is because video is such a popular and powerful medium that allows consumers to explore very creative , stimulating methods of communicating their messages . "
Of course , the companies are motivated by more than altruism .
For Timberland , the YouTube exposure is a marketing instrument , Morey - Reuner said .
And it reaches the target groups of the young and keen to consume .
The Timberland Earthkeeper spot , for example , has been watched by nearly 107,000 viewers since it was posted in April .
The Nike clip has drawn more than 125,000 viewers since May .
" Companies have an interest to be perceived as socially responsible , but they want to sell their products at the same time , " said David Stewart , dean of the School of Business at UC Riverside .
" You Tube is a new vehicle , and companies are offering these types of media .
Therefore , the spots are not completely altruistic .
There 's an element of both selling and doing good . "
Robert Duncan , executive creative director of the San Francisco ad agency Duncan / Channon , said it 's a trend that former Vice President Al Gore started with his film " An Inconvenient Truth . "
" He not only indicated the problem of climate change , but he also set a new form of demonstration : Short clips , brief presentations , " he said .
" No company can ignore the whole climate ( problem ) .
I have no doubt that the PR ( department ) of every company is telling their bosses ' We have to have a presence ' because it 's part of being in business today . "
As long as the result is good , Duncan said , he does n't condemn companies for getting attention through social causes .
" Is a good result worse because the motivation was bad ? " he asked .
" I do n't think so . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush heads to Japan on Saturday for his final G - 8 summit of world leaders as the global economy slumps , energy prices soar and food shortages loom in the developing world .
Bush says he will press other leaders of the Group of Eight industrialized nations to follow through on their commitments from earlier summits , but has warned there is nothing he or anyone else can do in the short term about oil prices .
" It took us a while to get into the energy situation we 're in and it's going to take us a while to get out of it , " he said Wednesday in an appearance at the Rose Garden to preview his trip .
He continued to advocate more drilling in protected areas of the U.S. as a medium - term fix for skyrocketing fuel costs .
" Ultimately , of course , we 're going to transition away from hydrocarbon .
But we 're now just in a transitional period and we need more oil to be able to do so , " he said .
Watch what may be in store for the world economy »
Bush 's main economic goal at the summit in Toyako , on Japan 's northern Hokkaido island , may be defensive , said CNN analyst David Gergen , former adviser to Presidents Nixon , Ford , Reagan and Clinton .
Watch what 's at stake at the summit »
" What 's essential in this summit for George W. Bush is to make sure the world economy does not spin downward , " he said .
Yet Bush is not raising expectations about what he and the other G - 8 leaders can realistically accomplish on the economic front .
" One thing we need to make clear when I 'm with our partners is that we 're not going to become protectionists , that we believe in free trade and open markets , " he said Wednesday .
A former administration official who served on the National Security Council under Bush says the G - 8's purpose is not to come up with quick solutions .
" This is not a meeting of heads of state that leads to a treaty .
It 's really kind of public opinion shaping and trying to get people to agree that issues are important , " said Michael Green , now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
Watch how protesters are anticipating the summit »
At the summit , Bush , mindful of his legacy , also plans to press G - 8 countries to keep their past financial commitments of aid to the developing world .
" G - 8 countries have made pledges to help developing nations address challenges , from health care to education to corruption .
Now we need to show the world that the G - 8 can be accountable for its promises and deliver results , " he said Wednesday .
Still , even as he presses other nations to write checks to back up their pledges , Bush is having trouble persuading U.S. lawmakers to do the same .
Congress has not yet authorized funding to continue the president 's emergency plan for HIV / AIDS relief , a program that supplies HIV medicine to roughly 1.5 million people worldwide and is widely considered a foreign policy success for the Bush administration .
Bush arrives in Japan on Sunday , his 62nd birthday , and will meet Japan 's prime minister , Yasuo Fukuda .
In addition to meeting among themselves , the G - 8 leaders will be joined Monday by leaders from seven African countries : Algeria , Ethiopia , Ghana , Nigeria , South Africa , Tanzania and Senegal .
On Wednesday they will meet the leaders of Brazil , China , India , Mexico and South Africa .
Bush will have bilateral meetings with South Korea 's President Lee Myung - bak and China 's President Hu Jintao on Wednesday , in preparation for his visits to their countries next month .
Police : Taser use is “ not one of the unanswered questions ” surrounding the case
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Tuesday , July 29 , 2008
You could n’t make it up if you tried .
Police in Ozark , Missouri repeatedly tased a critically injured sixteen year old boy after he “ refused to comply with the officers ” .
The cops were called to investigate reports of a boy walking along a busy overpass , but when they got there they found young Mace Hutchinson had fallen 30 ft to the ground below , breaking his back and and foot in the process .
When he did not co-operate with the cops they pulled out their stun guns and fired them into his body , shocking him up to nineteen times with 50,000 volts .
According to the boy ’s father , the actions of the police caused an elevated white blood cell count leading Mace to develop a fever that delayed vital surgery by two days .
Ozark Police Capt .
Thomas Rousset tried to condone the use of the taser in comments to the media :
“ He refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their Tasers in order to subdue him .
He is making incoherent statements ; he ’s also making statements such as , ‘ Shoot cops , kill cops , ’ things like that .
So there was cause for concern to the officers . ”
Watch a local report from KY3 News :
The idea that a boy with a broken back would need to be “ subdued ” by a team of cops is not patently ludicrous but also smacks of a desperate attempt to cover up the true events in this case .
This is a perfect example of how it has become the norm for cops to react with extreme physical force towards anyone who acts out of the ordinary in any way whatsoever .
We have previously carried reports of police tasing an already restrained disabled man , a 6 - year - old boy who was wielding a piece of glass and a woman having diabetic seizure to name but a few , but this case trumps them all .
This behaviour is not limited to cops in the U.S. either , last November a man who slipped into a diabetic coma on the top deck of a bus in Leeds , England described how he was used for electric stun gun “ target practice ” after he “ failed to respond to instructions ” and police “ mistook him for a suicide bomber ” .
Tasers are supposed to be the last response before lethal action , yet police now use the taser as if it is a pair of handcuffs or pepper spray .
The latest figures show that over 300 people died in one year in admitted cases in the US alone from being tased .
Prominent heart doctors have declared that there is no doubt that Tasers can cause heart problems and even induce sudden and lethal cardiac arrest .
The UN ’s Committee Against Torture issued a statement on the TaserX26 , in November of last year which read : “ The use of TaserX26 weapons , provoking extreme pain , constituted a form of torture , and that in certain cases it could also cause death , as shown by several reliable studies and by certain cases that had happened after practical use . ”
Despite these facts , we see stories every week of old women , children and disabled people being shot with tasers .
The weapons are even being used in schools .
The police are now trained that “ pain compliance , ” a euphemism for torture , is acceptable in apprehending anyone even if that person poses no physical danger .
The heart of the issue is that this was another act of wanton police brutality and torture by means of tasing .

SURPRISES , in the staid world of banking , tend to be of the unpleasant sort , as customers at IndyMac Bancorp , a California thrift , can attest .
Cross a few palms with silver , however , and there is a new way to profit from others ' unexpected losses .
Punters can now bet on bank failures in America , thanks to 12 new contracts against individually named banks listed on July 16th by Intrade , the largest online prediction market .
Once viewed as grubby gambling dens , prediction markets have sharpened up .
Intrade says it has brokered $ 76 m of bets this year .
Its data have been used as a price - discovery tool by America 's Commodities Futures Trading Commission , the United States Navy , various Federal Reserve banks , and the European Central Bank .
The accuracy of prediction markets makes them hard to ignore ; they were better than Gallup polls in predicting the outcome of elections between 1998 and 2004 .
Using the wisdom of crowds , they do a good job of forecasting the outcome of sporting events .
Exchanges such as Britain 's Tradefair and America 's HedgeStreet have sought to apply this predictive power to financial markets , offering contracts on financial instruments , interest rates and commodities .
CME Group , a Chicago - based exchange , launched its first economic - event contracts in April .
But these markets do not appear to have taken off as successfully as election or sports markets , possibly because they struggle to strike the right balance between experts and laypeople .
A bet on the merger that created CME Group received only 82 trades in its 80 - day lifespan .
When markets are that small , punters should watch carefully for signs of manipulation .
So far , it must be said , there appear to have been no deals on Intrade 's bank - failure market .
Top of its danger list , based on the bid - offer spread , is Miami - based BankUnited Financial , which has featured in news reports as one of several banks with a high ratio of non-performing loans to total assets .
On July 16th BankUnited 's share price more than doubled , however .
The stockmarket is a more liquid place to bet on banks — but hedging against failure may be a sensible option if banks continue to go bust .

I 'm by no means a fan of McCain , but you need to have your facts lined up before going on the offensive .
When a fire breaks out on the flight deck , the " Crash and Smash " team are the first to respond .
After that are the ship 's primary firefighting team , usually called either the Flying Squad or the Nucleus Fire Party .
If the fire is bad enough , General Quarters is called , and the entire crew participates in combating the casualty , as either support or relief teams for the fire party .
All of the sailors on all the fire parties are enlisted .
An officer , especially a pilot , especially from a command separate from the ship ( a fighter / attack squadron , for example ) , will never take direct part in firefighting .
It 's good to be open - minded , just do n't let your brain fall out .

And I quote : " On January 14 , 1969 , the USS Enterprise , steaming 75 miles southwest of Pearl Harbor , suffered a major fire .

Ok I figured it out now .
You all on the internet convinced me .
McCain has to be to blame !
I was on the flight deck on July 29,1967 .
I saw the Zuni missile fire off the F4 that WAS COMPLETLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FLIGHT DECK POINTING AT HIS PLANE !!!
McCains plane was on the other side with his EXHAUST HANGING OVER THE SIDE OF THE SHIP .
So this must be what happened ........ He must have jumped out of his own plane , ran over to the F4 and fired a Zuni at his own plane , running back into his plane before the Zuni hit it ( very fast runner ) OR he turned his plane around on the flight deck with out his engine running , aimed his exhaust on the F4B and did a hot start .
Of course no one would have noticed this .
I can't believe you people post this drivel and actually believe it .
You are either very nieve or just plain ignorant .
I was there .
I know McCain was only responsible for being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
He also was not " wisked off the ship " to save him from crewmen as has been posted on other places .
He stayed there just like the rest of us did .

I saw the Zuni missile fire off the F4 that WAS COMPLETLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FLIGHT DECK POINTING AT HIS PLANE !!!
McCains plane was on the other side with his EXHAUST HANGING OVER THE SIDE OF THE SHIP .
So this must be what happened ........ He must have jumped out of his own plane , ran over to the F4 and fired a Zuni at his own plane , running back into his plane before the Zuni hit it ( very fast runner ) OR he turned his plane around on the flight deck with out his engine running , aimed his exhaust on the F4B and did a hot start .
Of course no one would have noticed this .
I can't believe you people post this drivel and actually believe it .
You are either very nieve or just plain ignorant .
I was there .
I know McCain was only responsible for being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
He also was not " wisked off the ship " to save him from crewmen as has been posted on other places .
He stayed there just like the rest of us did .

If you were there , were you aware that McCain crashed FIVE MULTI - MILLION DOLLAR aircraft -- that this was just ONE -- and got away with it ?
Do you know any other reverse aces who are allowed to continue to fly after that ?
Were you aware that McCain became a pow as a Lt. Cmdr , and came back at the same rank , when he should have been promoted along with his peers , to Captain ?
Why ?
What 's in his record that he was held back by TWO RANKS that WE do n't know about ?
Were you aware that he sang like a songbird -- making THIRTY EIGHT video tapes for Radio Hanoi , one of which quotes him as having said : " Things are taking place in a favorable opinion .
The United States at present seems to be standing alone .
So much is its isolation " .
Can you even imagine the negative effect that had on our troops , on other POWs and on the sheer outcome of the war ?
If you WERE THERE , then you were undoubtedly told what would have happened to YOU , according to the Uniform Code of Military Justice , had you commited TREASON like that -- YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN SHOT ON THE SPOT , would n't you ?
Even IF McCain is just mightily unlucky [ and graduating 4th from the bottom out of almost 900 Annapolis graduates indicates something other than bad luck ] , you do n't want him to hold ANY job with an ounce of responsibility , much less continue to be an officer or pilot , much less RUN FOR PRESIDENT .
There 's only ONE reason this moron is so " popular " now -- his jewish wife is the daughter of a jewish mafia leader , Hensly , who works directly for Bronfman , who is now financing his campaign .
Even those not on the internet realized that there was something really odd about a LOSER like McCain suddenly becoming so " popular " that he 's now a serious contender for the presidency .
This is a man who receives the support of only FOUR PERCENT of his fellow Senators , 3 % in a Post Independent poll , 2 % in a CNN poll , 7 % in an MSN poll , 1 % in a Pajama 's Media poll , 0.7 % on a Melanie Morgan Poll , 2 % on an SV GOP Poll , 1 % on a Care Public Poll , ZERO percent on the June 5 , 2007 Poll , 1 % on a Vote.com Poll , ONE THIRD OF ONE PERCENT on a Topicfy Poll , 6 % on an MSNBC poll , 1 % on a Worldnet Daily Poll , and 6 % on another MSNBC Poll .

Report Copyright Violation Re : McCain to blame for the USS Forrestal mishap ?
Political " Swift Boat " tactics .
The Zuni rocket was fired from an F - 4 as the result of an electrical short .
Zuni rockets were notoriously unsafe .
The carrier Enterprise also had a similar Zuni related accident .
And I quote : " On January 14 , 1969 , the USS Enterprise , steaming 75 miles southwest of Pearl Harbor , suffered a major fire .
In that episode , similar unstable 1000 - pound bombs detonated , killing 27 sailors and injuring more than 100 .
At the time of the Enterprise disaster , the Commander - in- Chief of US Pacific Forces was Adm. John S. McCain , Jr. , Sen. McCain ’s father .
At the time of the Forrestal disaster , Admiral McCain was Commander - in - Chief of US Naval Forces Europe ( CINCUSNAVEUR ) and was busy covering up the details of the deadly and pre-meditated Israeli attack on the NSA spy ship , the USS Liberty , on June 8 , 1967 .
The fact that both McCains were involved in two incidents just weeks apart that resulted in a total death count of 168 on the Forrestal and the Liberty , with an additional injury count of 234 on both ships ( with a number of them later dying from their wounds ) with an accompanying classified paper trail inside the Pentagon , may be all that was needed to hold a Sword of Damocles over the head of the ‘ family honor ’- oriented ( McCain ’s persona is supported by his book about his father and grandfather , both Navy admirals , titled ‘ Faith of My Fathers ’ ) and the ’ straight talking ’ McCain . "
The McCain 's did more damage to our military than the Vietcong did in 2 years -- and all we call this Manchurian Candidate is " Reverse Ace McCain " ?

It was exhaust from a starter engine which was blamed for launching the Zuni rocket on the USS Enterprise .
Those who want to believe that a hot start could n't have set off a Zuni rocket have to explain exactly how * exhaust * from a starter engine could have done it .
This scene was such a wreck that I 'd like to know exactly how they pinpointed the blame on simple exhaust on the Enterprise .
AND why they had such dangerous bombs on a carrier which were never intended for that purpose .
I was not in the Navy , but I was in the USAF and have a hard time believing such things happened in the Navy without some REAL tough political pressure -- like from Admiral McCain .
The McCain 's involvement in the USS Liberty , AND the USS Forrestal , AND the USS Enterprise , AND the USS Oriskany , all begin to look like a SERIOUS breach of procedure , to say the LEAST .

“ Outrage is not a policy , ” said Strobe Talbott , who was deputy secretary of state under President Clinton and is now the president of the Brookings Institution .
“ Worry is not a policy .
Indignation is not a policy .
Even though outrage , worry and indignation are all appropriate in this situation , they should n’t be mistaken for policy and they should n’t be mistaken for strategy . ”
For Washington , there are limited options for applying pressure .
Senator John McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , wants to throw Russia out of the Group of 8 major powers .
Such a move would effectively admit the failure of 17 years of bipartisan policy aimed at incorporating Russia into the international order .
Yet Washington ’s menu of options pales by comparison to Moscow’s .
Masha Lipman , an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center , said “ there ’s a lot more ” that the United States needed from Russia than the other way around , citing efforts to secure old Soviet nuclear arms , support the war effort in Afghanistan and force Iran and North Korea to give up nuclear programs .
“ Hence Russia has all the leverage , ” she said .
In forecasting Russia ’s potential for causing headaches , most specialists look first to Ukraine , which wants to join NATO .
The nightmare scenario circulating in recent days is an attempt by Moscow to claim the strategic Crimean peninsula to secure access to the Black Sea .
Ukrainian lawmakers are investigating reports that Russia has been granting passports en masse to ethnic Russians living in Crimea , a tactic Moscow used in the Georgian breakaway republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia to justify intervention to protect its citizens .
Arms sales , as Mr. Assad ’s visit underscored , represent another way Russia could create problems .
Israeli and Western governments have already been alarmed about reports that the first elements of the Russian - built S-300 antiaircraft missile system are now being delivered to Iran , which could use them to shoot down any American or Israeli planes that seek to bomb nuclear facilities should that ever be attempted .
While Mr. Rogozin expressed support for assisting NATO in the war in Afghanistan , other officials have warned darkly about cutting off ties with NATO .
The two sides have already effectively suspended any military cooperation programs .
But Russia could also revoke its decision in April to allow NATO to send nonlethal supplies overland through its territory en route to Afghanistan .
Russia could also turn up pressure on Kyrgyzstan to evict American forces that support operations in Afghanistan and could block any large - scale return to Uzbekistan , which expelled the Americans in 2005 .
“ The argument would be , ‘ Why help NATO ? ’ ” said Celeste A. Wallander , a Russia scholar at Georgetown ’s School of Foreign Service .

Get and Scott 's book " Waging Peace . "
I recognize that for years you have been a strong supporter of aggressive forward - looking actions to mitigate dangerous climate change .
Also , since your election as Prime Minister of Australia , your government has been active in pressing the international community to take appropriate actions .
We are now at a point that bold leadership is needed , leadership that could change the course of human history .
I have read and commend the Interim Report of Professor Ross Garnaut , submitted to your government .
The conclusion that net carbon emissions must be cut to a fraction of current emissions must be stunning and sobering to policy - makers .
Yet the science is unambiguous : if we burn most of the fossil fuels , releasing the CO2 to the air , we will assuredly destroy much of the fabric of life on the planet .
Achievement of required near - zero net emissions by mid-century implies a track with substantial cuts of emissions by 2020 .
Aggressive near - term fostering of energy efficiency and climate friendly technologies is an imperative for mitigation of the looming climate crisis and optimization of the economic pathway to the eventual clean - energy world .
Global climate is near critical tipping points that could lead to loss of all summer sea ice in the Arctic with detrimental effects on wildlife , initiation of ice sheet disintegration in West Antarctica and Greenland with progressive , unstoppable global sea level rise , shifting of climatic zones with extermination of many animal and plant species , reduction of freshwater supplies for hundreds of millions of people , and a more intense hydrologic cycle with stronger droughts and forest fires , but also heavier rains and floods , and stronger storms driven by latent heat , including tropical storms , tornados and thunderstorms .
Feasible actions now could still point the world onto a course that minimizes climate change .
Coal clearly emerges as central to the climate problem from the facts summarized in the attached Fossil Fuel Facts .
[ See note below ]
Coal caused fully half of the fossil fuel increase of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) in the air today , and on the long run coal has the potential to be an even greater source of CO2 .
Due to the dominant role of coal , solution to global warming must include phase - out of coal except for uses where the CO2 is captured and sequestered .
Failing that , we cannot avoid large climate change , because a substantial fraction of the emitted CO2 will stay in the air more than 1000 years .
Yet there are plans for continuing mining of coal , export of coal , and construction of new coal - fired power plants around the world , including in Australia , plants that would have a lifetime of half a century or more .
Your leadership in halting these plans could seed a transition that is needed to solve the global warming problem .
Choices among alternative energy sources - renewable energies , energy efficiency , nuclear power , fossil fuels with carbon capture - these are local matters .
But decision to phase out coal use unless the CO2 is captured is a global imperative , if we are to preserve the wonders of nature , our coastlines , and our social and economic well being .
Although coal is the dominant issue , there are many important subsidiary ramifications , including the need for rapid transition from oil - fired energy utilities , industrial facilities and transport systems , to clean ( solar , hydrogen , gas , wind , geothermal , hot rocks , tide ) energy sources , as well as removal of barriers to increased energy efficiency .
If the West makes a firm commitment to this course , discussion with developing countries can be prompt .
Given the potential of technology assistance , realization of adverse impacts of climate change , and leverage and increasing interdependence from global trade , success in cooperation of developed and developing worlds is feasible .
The western world has contributed most to fossil fuel CO2 in the air today , on a per capita basis .
This is not an attempt to cast blame .
It only recognizes the reality of the early industrial development in these countries , and points to a responsibility to lead in finding a solution to global warming .
A firm choice to halt building of coal - fired power plants that do not capture CO2 would be a major step toward solution of the global warming problem .
Australia has strong interest in solving the climate problem .
Citizens in the United States are stepping up to block one coal plant after another , and major changes can be anticipated after the upcoming national election .
If Australia halted construction of coal - fired power plants that do not capture and sequester the CO2 , it could be a tipping point for the world .
There is still time to find that tipping point , but just barely .
I hope that you will give these considerations your attention in setting your national policies .
You have the potential to influence the future of the planet .
Prime Minister Rudd , we cannot avert our eyes from the basic fossil fuel facts , or the consequences for life on our planet of ignoring these fossil fuel facts .
If we continue to build coal - fired power plants without carbon capture , we will lock in future climate disasters associated with passing climate tipping points .
We must solve the coal problem now .

Gunman murders Arkansas Democratic Party chairman
By Patrick Martin
15 August 2008
The Arkansas state chairman of the Democratic Party was shot to death Wednesday by a gunman who was himself killed in a later exchange of gunfire with police .
Bill Gwatney , 48 , was murdered in his office in Little Rock .
While little evidence has yet been released to the public , it is already clear that he was deliberately targeted by his attacker .
The gunman , Timothy Dale Johnson , entered the premises pretending to be interested in volunteering , then pushed past several staff members to reach the chairman ’s office .
He introduced himself to Gwatney and they shook hands , whereupon he pulled out a handgun and opened fire , hitting the Democratic Party official four times , including once in the head .
Gwatney died four hours later .
Johnson fled the scene , and six blocks away pointed a gun at a security guard at the offices of the Arkansas Baptist Convention , but did not open fire .
He told the guard , “ I lost my job . ”
He then drove south from the Arkansas state capital with sheriff ’s deputies in pursuit , finally hitting a police roadblock near Sheridan , about 30 miles away , where he got out of his truck , fired at police , and was shot to death himself .
Gwatney was the son of a wealthy automobile dealer who became prominent in state politics before he was 35 .
He served as a state senator before giving up his position because of term limits .
He was the finance chairman for Mike Beebe , the successful Democratic candidate for governor in 2006 , and Beebe named him state Democratic Party chairman after that campaign .
Like most Arkansas Democratic politicians , Gwatney was a supporter of the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton , whose husband was a five - term governor of the state .
He was a superdelegate to the Democratic National Convention being held in Denver later this month .
The incident that apparently served as the trigger for the violence came early Wednesday morning , as Johnson was working the midnight shift at a Target warehouse in Conway , about 30 miles north of Little Rock .
Johnson became angry at his supervisors and wrote on a store wall , “ Target is run by dumb jocks and sorority bitches . ”
A Target spokesman said that when his manager called him in to discuss the incident , Johnson turned in his employee badge and stormed out .
Until then his work record was good , the spokesman said .
He added , “ This was different behavior for him ...
When he left yesterday , he voluntarily left .
We asked him ` What ’s going on ?
Do you want to talk about something ? ’
It was , ‘ Let ’s talk . ’
It was not about termination . ”
While the specific motivation for the shooting remains unknown , Johnson sought out Gwatney and was not merely shooting randomly after losing his job .
He left the Target warehouse about 8 a.m. and drove into the city , stopping at the state Democratic Party headquarters and ignoring several other potential victims as he searched for the party chairman .
Police found Gwatney ’s name written on a Post - It in Johnson ’s home in Searcy , northeast of Little Rock , when they searched it after the shooting , together with a phone number .
Investigators would not reveal whether the phone number was Gwatney ’s , either at his Democratic Party office or at the family - owned auto dealership in the Little Rock suburb of Jacksonville .
A state police spokesman said that Johnson also had the keys to two vehicles from Gwatney family car lots , but that he was not a former employee of the family or its chain of dealerships .
The police also found a will at Johnson ’s home , as well as a laptop computer which they have begun searching .
The Little Rock murder is the fourth recent incident in the South of violence or threatened violence against groups or individuals demonized by the ultra - right .
On July 27 , Jim Adkisson , 58 , walked into the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church near Knoxville , Tennessee and opened fire with a semiautomatic shotgun on the audience attending a children ’s play , killing two members of the church , Greg McKendry , age 60 , and Linda Kraeger , age 61 , and wounding six others .
He subsequently killed himself , leaving a suicide note in which he stated “ his hatred for the liberal movement , ” particularly the church ’s openness to gays .
On August 2 , 22 - year - old Raymond Hunter Geisel was arrested in Miami and charged with making death threats against Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama .
Police found weapons , body armor and other military gear in his car and hotel room .
Geisel made the threats against Obama , including a reference to the candidate with a racial epithet , during a training session he was undertaking to become a bail bondsman .
Others in the class reported him to the police .
He faces federal charges .
On August 8 , 48 - year - old Jerry M. Blanchard was arrested in North Carolina for making similar threats to kill Obama .
A Secret Service agent claimed that Blanchard may have mental health issues due to a recent head injury , and Blanchard has denied threatening the Democratic presidential candidate .
Johnson fits the social profile of these cases .
He was white , middle - aged and under considerable economic stress .
He was socially isolated , living alone in the home he had shared with his parents until his father ’s death in 2006 .
He owned a small arsenal of weapons — 14 guns in the house , two more in the truck in which he died — and took regular practice at a local shooting club .
He was undoubtedly conservative in his political views , and had voted in Republican primaries for most of the past decade , except in 2006 when he voted in a Democratic primary .
He voted in the Republican presidential primary February 5 , which was won by the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee .
The internet has opened up a wealth of options when it comes to saving money online .
More than ever before , it ’s become easy for the consumer to find deals and compare an offer from various places .
This has created a sense of competition between various outlets .
For a long time , consumers would go to third party sites to get better deals on hotels .
But today , the answer of when to book hotels via a third - party site and when to book directly is n’t so clear .
Read on , and we ’ll walk you through what you need to know .
When You Want Benefits
There are some instances where booking hotel through a third - party site can get you a better deal .
But it can also cause you to miss out on a variety of opportunities .
For one , you ca n’t receive any loyalty points when you book in this fashion .
This might not be a big deal to you , but if you ’re a frequent traveler , these points can really add up .
You might be saving money in the short run by going third party , but you also might be losing money in the long run .
Booking directly with a hotel also tends to allow you a better selection of your room at the hotel .
You have a much better chance of getting your preferred set up when you contact a hotel directly .
During A Last Minute Trip
Sometimes you find yourself traveling across the country or to a new place with little notice .
If you go directly to a hotel during these moments , the rates might be too high .
But if you go through a third - party seller , the rates might be very affordable .
As a date draws near and a hotel has a better sense of their vacancies , they might offer these rooms up to sellers at a major discount .
You might be able to get a room for half the price as you normally would if you book the day before or even the morning of .
Booking a today only kind of special can save you a lot of money , but you might not be happy with the kind of room you receive .
If You ’re Staying Local
Most of the time , travelers stay at hotels that are national brands and have locations around the country .
With these hotels , you can expect consistent pricing and an expectation of your stay that you can rely on .
Although , if you look at local hotels in the area you ’re staying in , you might be able to find a better deal .
These hotels probably wo n’t show up on third - party sites , so this is another scenario where you might want to buy direct from the hotel instead of going to a third party .
You might be able to find a perfect new experience that you never would have envisioned prior to searching .
When To Book Hotels Directly Vs. Third - Party
It can be hard to know when to book hotels directly or when to look elsewhere for deals .
The above information can help you make the right decision for your personal situation .

Everyone knows there is a lot of crazy stuff on the internet , but did you know there is a lot of great writing about genes , genetics , and human diseases ?
And believe it or not , sometimes these pieces are written by people who know what they 're talking about .
If you 're looking for what 's new in human genetics , you 've come to the right place .
Welcome to the 31st Gene Genie , a blog carnival dedicated to great blogging about human genes and how they impact our health .
This Mother 's Day edition includes an in - depth highlight of the growing industry of personalized genetics .
Too Many Genes for Height That Do Too Little
Can we find the gene that controls our height ?
Well , it looks it 's not just one gene , it 's many , and on his blog , Yann tells us that scientists are having a hard time figuring out how important these many genetic variants really are .
Which is a little discouraging , because the studies to find them cost so much .

A Gene Therapy Cure for Blindness
Finding a cure for retinal degeneration , a genetic disease that results in blindness before you turn 30 , has been tough .
Finding ways to cure genetic diseases using gene therapy , instead of drugs ( which do n't really cure anyway ) , has also been extremely tough .
A team of researchers in Philadelphia and Italy may have cracked both of these tough nuts at once .
Josh over at Think Gene tells us about new results from a clinical trial that has successfully used gene therapy to improve the vision of patients with congenital retinal disease , which is good news not only for retinal disease patients , but also for anyone with a severe genetic disease .
Your Kids and Genetic Testing
As we proceed full steam ahead with genetic testing , is anyone stopping to ask " But what about the children ? "
Elaine at Genetics and Health is asking questions about genetic tests , ethics , and kids .
The US Congress may be ready for personalized genetic testing , but are we ?
Becky , at A Truth Universally Acknowledged talks about the genetic non-discrimination act that will soon become US law , but notes that there are hurdles to leap before personalized genetics will function smoothly and ethically .

A Gene To Stop Spinal Muscular Atrophy
The Gene Genie is n't just about genes and blogs , but you will need a blog post to translate this piece from the journal Science : " Plastin 3 Is a Protective Modifier of Autosomal Recessive Spinal Muscular Atrophy . "
What this means is that researchers have solved a mystery behind spinal muscular atrophy , a very lethal childhood genetic disease .
This disease comes about when motor neurons die off in your spine because you 're missing a critical gene for keeping them alive .
Amazingly , some kids with missing this important gene remain healthy , while their siblings with the same mutation die of the disease .
The solution to this puzzle may be the gene Plastin 3 , which in larger doses may prevent the development of spinal muscular atrophy by keeping critical motor neurons from dying off .
The Anonymous Human Genome
We talk about THE Human Genome , but of course there are billions of them .
What do we really mean when we talk about THE genome ?
At Genomicron , Ryan tells us who was sequenced and what makes each of our genomes different .
Genetic Variants and Breast Cancer
Another piece by Josh at Think Gene has more Mother 's Day news , telling us about newly discovered genetic variants that may be linked to breast cancer .
We already have a few solid genes known to be involved in breast cancer , but it 's a complex disease , and the more we know , the better we can find new cures .
The interesting thing about these particular genetic variants is that they do n't damage the protein produced by this gene ; they cause your cells to make too much of this protein , which can lead to cancer .
Anti-Social Mice and Schizophrenia
You do n't have to go anywhere for this one .
Right here at Adaptive Complexity , you can read about a gene that affects brain size and social interaction in mice , which may also be responsible for brain changes in schizophrenics .
PERSONALIZED GENETICS
In this edition of Gene Genie , we have an in - depth look at the fledgling personalized genetics industry , which , for better or worse , is destined to play a large role in 21st century medicine .
Genetic Tests for Osteoporosis
Steve Murphy , the Gene Sherpa gives us advice on genetic tests for osteoporosis ( good Mother 's Day advice for many of our mothers , I 'm sure ) : do n't take 'em .
At this point , the genetic risk factors we can test for do n't add anything to the already well known risk factors , like smoking , low estrogen , and ... I 'll let Dr. Murphy tell you the rest .
What 's it like to have your own genome sequenced ?
What does genetic testing have to do with a 100,000 watt blowtorch lighting the LA afternoon skies ?
Andrew , over at Buzzyeah , has had his entire genome sequenced , and he bares it all on the John and Ken Radio Show .
Just like those geeks who like to blog about every step of unpacking a new computer , Andrew has a whole series of pieces about unpacking his genome sequencing results .
I promise that these pieces are much more interesting than some guy pulling his new iMac out of a box .

Sergey Gorshkov ( photographed in the Moscow subway ) says he's in it for the money , not the politics . *
Photo : Benedict Redgrove *
It was a freakishly warm February morning in Moscow , eight days before Russia 's 2008 presidential election .
Green army trucks packed with bleary - eyed soldiers crawled through the city streets , a sign of a paranoid government mobilizing itself against an election - eve revolution .
But Sergey Gorshkov did n't notice .
He was hunched in his apartment , frantically trying to fix his Web site .
Gorshkov publishes kompromat.ru , a scandal page that has antagonized the ruling elite since 1999 and made him one of his country 's top Internet personalities .
He does n't write his own stories but provides links to muckraking reporters whose work would otherwise be overlooked or silenced .
Over the years , Gorshkov has posted embarrassing exposè 's on some of the most powerful members of the Russian government :
He linked to articles accusing Kremlin officials of funneling state money into personal offshore accounts , charging Boris Yeltsin with hiding the existence of an autistic grandson , and alleging that Vladimir Putin ordered politically motivated assassinations as director of the Federal Security Service , or FSB .
That kind of indiscretion has won kompromat .ru a loyal monthly audience of more than a million Russian journalists , politicians , business types , and assorted media vultures .
But it has also inspired a pattern of government harassment against Gorshkov .
Since 2000 , police squads have raided his ISP , customs officials have seized his laptops , and FSB thugs have made a number of surprise visits to his apartment .
Now the Kremlin was at it again .
A half dozen of Russia 's largest ISPs — all with government ties — had blocked kompromat.ru .
Readers who tried to access the site were redirected to a blank screen , with no explanation or error message .
As a result of this sabotage , Gorshkov 's readers were n't able to peruse his latest posts in the lead - up to the election , including many items concerning Putin 's handpicked successor to the presidency , Dmitri Medvedev — charging him with illegal use of the presidential plane for campaign purposes , or of ritually ego - browsing the morning news for mentions of his name .
The trouble from the government could n't have been a big surprise .
Under the Putin regime , Russia 's independent media — once run by rival oligarchs who used their newspapers and TV stations to promote their own agendas and fling mud at their foes — had been nationalized or bought out by Kremlin loyalists , their editorial teams gutted and their coverage softened to toe the government line .
Around election time , critical political coverage all but ceased .
And yet , at least officially , the government welcomed the unfiltered communication that the Internet promised .
In China , dissident blogging can get you thrown in prison .
In Russia — a petri dish of soft authoritarianism , commercialism , and shady cronyism — the rules are not so clear .
Bloggers may be harassed , but Russia does not formally outlaw the online airing of antigovernment views .
Indeed , a little more than a week before Gorshkov found his site blocked , Medvedev himself publicly proclaimed the virtues of a free , uncensored Internet .
( He even joked about the number of fake Facebook pages set up under his name . )
But Gorshkov 's crippled Web site suggested that Medvedev 's commitment to free speech was n't as wholehearted as it appeared .
His public pronouncements may have sounded encouraging , but in Russia vocal proponents of an independent press have a way of giving in to their own authoritarian impulses .
" The government will try to enact some sort of censorship , " says Oleg Panfilov , director of the Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations , a free - speech advocacy group .
" That 's just the way it is .
Our government does not know any other way to act . "
The ISPs kept their blocks on the site through the election , despite Gorshkov 's threat of legal action , attributing the filtering to a technical glitch or denying it outright .
On March 2 , Medvedev won with 70.2 percent of the vote .
The suspiciously healthy turnout rate hit 99 percent in some regions .
Four days later , all but one of the ISPs dropped the block on Gorshkov 's site .
Kompromat.ru was back in business .
Gorshkov suggests we meet at a posh Japanese spot around the corner from his palatial apartment in Moscow 's priciest neighborhood .
Outside the restaurant , there 's a row of BMWs , Mercedes , and Porsches .
Inside , an after - work crowd has gathered , lounging on shiny black couches , drinking , and ignoring the generic techno blaring from the speakers .
Gorshkov , dressed in a worn long - sleeved T - shirt , is thumbing a message on his Motorola phone .
He looks like a younger Slavic version of Larry King .
He orders a carafe of the house red and a sashimi combo plate .
It 's a swank scene , especially considering the fate of other famous Russian dissidents — author Alexander Solzhenitsyn got an eight - year stint in the gulag ; Fyodor Dostoevsky was sentenced to four years of hard labor in Siberia .
Gorshkov does n't seem to have sacrificed much , lifestyle - wise , for his work .
The best estimates indicate that kompromat .ru brings in the equivalent of nearly $ 1 million a year .
Gorshkov wo n't confirm those figures , but he values his business at $ 15 million .
" When people read my site , they imagine a person who 's angry at everything and everyone , an activist , an idealist .
But that 's not me .
This is just a business , " he says between bites of maguro .
And a mysterious business at that .
The site carries no ads , so where does the money come from ?
Gorshkov admits to accepting payment to publish some of his items , offering a pay - per - post service to anyone who wants a cheap , untraceable way to smear their opponents .
Gorshkov wo n't discuss details , but his fee is said to run between $ 600 and $ 800 per item , depending upon the libel risk , and half of the site 's dozen or so daily posts are estimated to be zakazukha , industry slang for paid , " made to order " journalism — although it 's impossible to know which half .
Gorshkov readily defends the practice as its own form of free speech .
" I never take sides , " he says .
" Besides , the nature of the business is such that when one side of a conflict orders an article , their opponents inevitably respond , usually before the day is out .
This way , all sides of the conflict are aired , and objectivity is maintained . "
The practice may have made Gorshkov rich , but it has not made him loved .
Sergey Sokolov , a longtime rival of Gorshkov and editor in chief of FreeLance Bureau , an online investigative journalism magazine , accuses Gorshkov of sacrificing the social contract between him and his readers for the sake of a quick ruble .
" His information is not reliable and always needs to be double - checked , " Sokolov says .
Gorshkov shrugs off the criticism .
" A lot of people from every side are mad at me , " he says .
" That 's what I have to live with . "
Gorshkov came up with the idea for the site in 1999 when Yuri Skuratov , Russia 's top prosecutor , was caught in a sex scandal .
Skuratov was investigating possible corruption in the Yeltsin administration until a grainy surveillance tape , purportedly showing the prosecutor in bed with two much younger prostitutes , aired on Russian television .
The investigation bogged down and was eventually forgotten .
Soon , a new word had edged its way into Russia 's popular lexicon : kompromat , the growing practice of using smear tactics to settle the country 's business , political , and personal disputes .
" It is the same as tabloids , " says Boris Kagarlitsky , a columnist for the Moscow Times .
" There was no celebrity culture , so political rumors and gossip took its place . "
The country 's new appetite for scandal suggested a business opportunity to Gorshkov , a former currency trader .
The financial collapse of 1998 , the decline of the Yeltsin administration , the looming 2000 presidential election :
There was no shortage of grist for calumny .
Meanwhile , the dotcom boom had just hit Russia , and Gorshkov could n't wait to take part .
" There were particular kompromat wars between rival factions in various media outlets , but nothing that collected all of it in one place , " Gorshkov says .
" Gorshkov was very smart .
He was one of the first to figure out that you can make money off of something like this , " says Vladimir Pribylovsky , a political analyst and famous dissident writer .
The timing was perfect .
Putin was elected president just months after kompromat.ru was launched , and he quickly set about clamping down on Russia 's media policy — bad for free speech , great for Gorshkov .
" The greater the government control over the media , the greater the demand for kompromat , " Gorshkov says .
His big break came in April 2001 , after a source handed over an unbelievable scoop : surveillance footage of someone who looked an awful lot like broadcast journalist Yevgeny Kiselev , Russia 's most respected news host , involved in an orgy .
Kiselev was a Muscovite Walter Cronkite ; Gorshkov knew that people would be scandalized when they saw the esteemed anchor in flagrante .
The video was an obvious Kremlin leak , an attempt to crush one of the last vestiges of independent television reporting .
But Gorshkov had no qualms about distributing it .
He cut up the lengthy tape and posted a few of its juiciest segments — no more than 3 megabytes at the largest , so as not to overload his puny server .
It did n't help ; there were so many hits , the server still crashed .
Gorshkov had created a media sensation and established his site as the go - to place for kompromat .
Kompromat.ru continues to attract readers , even though it 's hardly an objective news source .
In Russia , nothing is .
" It is a known fact that here , many newspaper articles are written to order , " Vladimir Semago , a former deputy in the country 's parliament , tells me .
" Real reporting existed for a few years in the early '90s ; it stopped as soon as journalists started dying because of it . "
That 's why even Gorshkov 's harshest critics defend his right to publish .
They also laud his decision not to edit items or remove them from his archive , no matter how much pressure he receives .
Pribylovsky , who runs anticompromat.ru , an anti-Gorshkov Web site , has been one of Gorshkov 's loudest detractors .
Still , Pribylovsky says , in a country where most independent newspapers have been taken under Kremlin control and had their archives scrubbed of unfavorable coverage , a site containing an unedited slice of political activities is an extremely valuable resource .
" I respect him and would be the first to complain if Gorshkov got shut down , " he says .
Gorshkov may not have been shuttered yet , but he has been the victim of several attempts .
In 2006 , two waves of denial - of - service attacks took the Web site offline for two weeks .
There was the February 2008 shutdown .
And then there are the lawsuits .
Some of the biggest names in Russian politics have sued him for defamation : Sergey Mikhailov , the suspected boss of Russia 's most powerful Mafia family ; Elena Baturina , the wife of Moscow 's mayor ; and Oleg Deripaska , a metals tycoon and Russia 's richest man .
" I have about five cases going on at any given time , " Gorshkov says .
" I 've had a total of , maybe not a hundred , but many dozens of lawsuits . "
Yet Gorshkov continues to publish .
Most of the legal actions against him have been thrown out , and the ones that have succeeded have merely compelled him to remove the offending post — the only time he has taken down content .
He has mirrored his site on a server located and registered in the US , effectively taking the material out of Russian jurisdiction .
" If they have a problem , they can sue me in America , " he says with a smile .
So far no one has .
Gorshkov has also made it harder to launch a DDoS attack on his site by expanding to four servers , each hosted by a different company .
The trick makes kompromat .ru more elusive ; Gorshkov says it would cost about $ 2,000 a day to bring him down .
Nobody has tried to kill him , either .
That 's remarkable considering that Gorshkov has lived through a period during which suspicious murders of muckraking journalists were — and still are — all too common .
Many attribute Gorshkov 's survival to a high - powered protector , some government official or oligarch who needs kompromat .ru to slag his enemies and has put out the word that harming Gorshkov would be akin to taking down a made man .
Gorshkov insists that nobody is shielding him — and that his targets have n't attacked him because they know he 's the conduit of information , not the writer .
He is an equal - opportunity opportunist .
In Russia , that 's the closest anyone comes to objectivity .

The doctor who carried out the study claims that the universally accepted story of Nietzsche having caught syphilis from prostitutes was concocted after World War II by Wilhelm Lange - Eichbaum , an academic who was one of Nietzsche 's most vociferous critics .
It was then adopted as fact by intellectuals who were keen to demolish the reputation of Nietzsche , whose idea of a " superman " was used to underpin Nazism .
The new research was done by Leonard Sax , the director of the Montgomery Centre for Research in Child Development in the United States .
Dr Sax studied accounts of Nietzsche 's collapse with dementia in 1889 , when he was admitted to an asylum in Switzerland and initially diagnosed as being in the advanced stages of syphilis .
According to Dr Sax , however , Nietzsche 's notes show no signs of the symptoms now regarded as evidence of this disease , such as an expressionless face and slurred speech .
Slide at Hersheypark rips off bathing suits Slide at Hersheypark unsuitable for many
HERSHEY , PA . — Hersheypark 's Waverider is designed to " knock your socks off , " as park spokeswoman Kathy Burrows said .
But as it turns out , socks are n't the thing that can be knocked off by the boogie - board ride down a wide , two - lane slide with water shooting up its incline .
" The water will rip off your bathing suit , " said Chelsi Ball of Cincinnati after she fell off her board , was hurled into a padded wall and had her top and bottom pulled askance .
How often does that happen ?
" All the time , " said one lifeguard who was working when Ball , 18 , wound up splashing and flashing about a dozen people in line .
One out of every five riders loses some part of their swim wear , the lifeguard said .
When it happened to Ball , a Hersheypark lifeguard threw a blanket over her , shielding her from those behind her in line .
" It 's a courtesy thing , " Burrows said .
" We do n't want anyone to be embarrassed or feel awkward , especially a small child . "
On Tuesday , in his now infamous “ green backdrop ” speech , McCain basically called Obama a liar :
You will hear from my opponent ’s campaign in every speech , every interview , every press release that I ’m running for President Bush ’s third term .
You will hear every policy of the President described as the Bush - McCain policy .
Why does Senator Obama believe it ’s so important to repeat that idea over and over again ?
Because he knows it ’s very difficult to get Americans to believe something they know is false .
So he tries to drum it into your minds by constantly repeating it rather than debate honestly the very different directions he and I would take the country .
Once again , McCain ’s ignorance of the Internet is his undoing .
To wit , John McCain on June 15 , 2005 , on Meet the Press :
MR. RUSSERT : And what people point to — and this is an article in your hometown paper , the Arizona Republic , “ At Odds With Bush .
John McCain repeatedly has taken maverick positions that have put him at odds with President Bush ’s administration ” …
The fact is you are different than George Bush .
SEN .
McCAIN : No . No .
I — the fact is that I ’m different but the fact is that I have agreed with President Bush far more than I have disagreed .
And on the transcendent issues , the most important issues of our day , I ’ve been totally in agreement and support of President Bush .
So have we had some disagreements on some issues , the bulk — particularly domestic issues ?
Yes .
But I will argue my conservative record voting with anyone ’s , and I will also submit that my support for President Bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the American people .
So , according to McCain , on the important issues , he is indistinguishable from ( “ totally in agreement and support ” ) Bush .
http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/06/11/mccain/
Of course , not everyone thinks so … VP Dick Cheney took time out from his busy schedule to criticize McCain ’s plan to cut the gas tax .
If you still do n’t believe that McCain will lie to get elected , watch McCain himself admit it in this video ( forward to 6:20 ) .
While Apple is encouraging its install base to upgrade to the latest version of the Mac OS X operating system , a new sales pitch by its Redmond - based rival to the north recommends that customers unhappy with Vista take a step in the opposite direction ' for free . '
Speaking at an event Tuesday in the nation 's capital , Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer said his company 's licensing policy allows for customers to install the previous generation of Windows should Vista not impress .
" Customers get both , " he said .
" I do n't know how you can do better than getting both . "
Baller 's comments were in response to a question about whether Microsoft will continue to market retail copies of Windows XP for mainstream PCs beyond its scheduled June 30 expiration .
The Microsoft headman explained that his firm holds no such plans because any customer who wants to purchase XP after June 30 can just as easily buy Vista and trigger its built - in downgrade option .
Earlier this week , the software maker said it would extend the shelf life of XP for installations on " nettops " — it 's term for ultra- low cost desktop systems — for an undetermined amount of time .
That followed an earlier move to continue selling the six - and - a- half year old operating system for ultra portable notebook systems for up to two more years .
InformationWeek 's Paul McDougall points out that a number of PC makers , including Dell , already offer business systems that have been " pre-downgraded " from Vista to XP .
Though that raises the question , he says , about the accuracy of the sales figures Microsoft has provided for Vista .
" In April , the company said it had sold more than " > 140 million Vista licenses since the OS became available to the public early last year , " he wrote .
" But Microsoft did not indicate what percentage of those Vista licenses have been downgraded to XP . "
Ballmer egged in Hungary last month .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Nearly two - thirds of U.S. companies and 68 % of foreign corporations do not pay federal income taxes , according to a congressional report released Tuesday .
The Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) examined samples of corporate tax returns filed between 1998 and 2005 .
In that time period , an annual average of 1.3 million U.S. companies and 39,000 foreign companies doing business in the United States paid no income taxes - despite having a combined $ 2.5 trillion in revenue .
The study showed that 28 % of foreign companies and 25 % of U.S. corporations with more than $ 250 million in assets or $ 50 million in sales paid no federal income taxes in 2005 .
Those companies totaled a combined $ 372 billion in sales for the largest foreign companies and $ 1.1 trillion in revenue for the biggest U.S. companies .
The GAO report , which did not name any specific companies , said that some corporations reported zero income before deducting expenses while others said they had zero net income after deducting expenses .
Either way , those companies reported no tax liability , the GAO said .
But many of the companies the report found had paid no tax were likely small businesses that pay other taxes .
Generally , many small firms , because they do not have shareholders , are able to shift corporate income to individual income .
" Small businesses that are going to be liable for a lot of income tax are likely to use other tax forms so they only pay individual income taxes , " said Eric Toder , a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center .
The study was requested by Sens. Byron Dorgan , D - N.D , and Carl Levin , D - Mich. , in an attempt to determine if corporations are abusing so - called transfer prices .
Transfer prices are charges on transactions between subsidiary companies within a larger corporate group .
Companies may try to lessen their U.S. tax hit by improperly transferring income to foreign subsidiaries in countries with lower rates .
The GAO study did not attempt to determine if companies were abusing transfer prices , but it said that potential abuse of transfers could reduce the amount of taxes companies pay in the United States .
" The tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking Americans who pay their fair share of taxes , " Dorgan said in a statement .
U.S. politicians disagree about how much income tax the government should levy on corporations .
Currently the rate is 35 % , but most foreign governments have set their rates below the U.S. level .
" The U.S. corporate tax rate stayed the same while foreign countries have drifted down , which increases the incentive for companies to report income in other countries , " said Toder .
" If the U.S. drops the rate to 30 % but closes other tax loopholes , that may ultimately generate more tax revenue for the government . "

“ Civil society , at least as I see it , is simply one of the great opportunities for human responsibility for the world . ” – Vaclav Havel
I am a bit of a civic engagement junky .
So , when I recently heard some guy tell some gal that a mutual friend of theirs was doing door - to - door sales for Obama , I had to set the record straight .
Canvassing and phone banking ( a.k.a. grassroots efforts ) for a candidate or political cause is not the same thing as door - to - door or telemarketing sales , it is called civic engagement .
In both sales and civic engagement you can visit people at their houses , or call them at hours when they may be eating and try to engage them in a conversation they may not want to have , but that is where the similarities end .
So , what is civil society and civic engagement ?
Let ’s start with this statement by former Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel : “ In the most general terms , we could perhaps describe it as a society in which citizens participate - in many parallel , mutually complementary ways - in public life , in the administration of public goods and in public decisions . ”
( A Speech on the Occasion of “ Vaclav Havel ’s Civil Society Symosium ” )
Civic engagement would be the practice of getting others involved “ in the administration of public goods and in public decisions . ”
The best way to do that is talk to people , face to face or over the phone .
TV commercials are good at throwing out slogans , but talking with someone gives them a chance to talk about their thoughts and think about what is really important to them .
During the primary season , one of my conversations with a working class Democrat went like this :
Other person : “ I really want Hillary Clinton to win . ”
Me : “ Ok , Why is that ? ”
Other person : “ Because we simply ca n’t have Obama as our nominee . ”
Me : “ Why do you say that ? ”
Other person : “ Because , you know , he ’s different . ”
Me : “ No , I do n’t know .
Please tell me . ”
Other person : “ You know , different . ”
Me : “ Well , if Obama does become the Democratic Nominee , I hope that you can look past the differences and see that the policies he promotes will be better for working class people than McCain’s . ”
That was a tough conversation to have , and I went into more detail about how and why and that person listened .
Did I make an impact ?
I have no way of knowing , because I will probably never talk to that person again .
I may have , and hope that I did .
Regardless , this is an example of other conversations that need to happen .
Civic engagement is n’t about instant gratification .
It is about building and maintaining a good civil society and democracy .
It is also just about people being afraid of the “ different . ”
The thirty - second commercials and 10 second sound bites are what most folks get for their politics , especially , those who do n’t have a social circle where politics is discussed .
So you , potential canvasser or caller , can maybe change someone ’s mind .
You can have more impact than just “ digging ” my post and passing it on to others .
Remember , not everyone reads this stuff .
In following with the slogan , “ Yes , We Can , ” we must do .
We have to continue and expand upon the “ grassroots ” efforts that happened in the primaries .
We have to be willing to go to those tough to win states and have difficult conversations with potentially hostile people .
To help you think about this , here is another quote from President Havel : “ Consequently , civil society is the best safeguard , not only against political chaos but also against the rise of authoritarian forces that always emerge whenever a society feels shaken or insecure about its future . ”
Be brave , and remember that it is your civic and patriotic duty .
Now get out and canvass or make some calls .
Yes , you can .
And for those of you following the corn and beans report : June 30 , corn closed at $ 7.25 and beans closed at $ 16.05 .
According to a new technical market research report , WIND TURBINES : THE U.S. MARKET ( EGY058A ) from BCC Research , the domestic market for wind turbine components and systems will be worth $ 60.9 billion in 2013 .
This represents an increase from the 2007 market value of $ 7.9 billion and the estimated 2008 market value of $ 11.2 billion .
The compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) between 2008 and 2013 is expected to be 40.0 % .
The market is analyzed by state and includes the top ten spenders on wind turbine technology : Texas , California , Iowa , Minnesota , Washington , Oregon , Colorado , New York , Kansas and Illinois .
Texas has the largest statewide expenditure , exceeding $ 2.4 billion in 2007 and an estimated $ 3.0 billion in 2008 .
This should grow at a CAGR of 38.0 % to reach $ 15.2 billion in 2013 .
In 2007 Colorado spent over $ 1.2 billion on wind turbines , second only to Texas .
Colorado has not recorded any wind turbine installations for 2008 .
The projection is that Colorado will install approximately $ 3.7 billion worth of wind turbines in 2013 .
California has often been the testing grounds for new wind turbine developments and technologies , and is expected to surge ahead in the coming years .
From anticipated spending of over $ 676.0 million on wind turbines in 2008 , California is expected to spend as much as $ 17.1 billion in 2013 , a CAGR of 91.0 % .
Iowa is expected to spend over $ 1.3 billion in 2008 and over $ 3.1 billion in 2013 , a CAGR of 19.0 % .
Minnesota had very strong growth in 2007 with expenditures of $ 607.0 million , which will decrease in 2008 to roughly $ 142.0 million .
Nonetheless , they are expected to spend nearly $ 2.8 billion in 2013 .
The State of Washington had significant expenditures in 2006 and 2007 , both above $ 500.0 million .
They are expected to spend about half of that amount in 2008 and approximately $ 2.2 billion in 2013 .

RADAR ALERT :
Tell the ABA Section of Family Law to Get Their Facts Straight
Two weeks ago , we asked you to e-mail the president of the ABA to tell him ( as nicely as possible ) to get his facts straight .
This week , we are asking you to do the same thing with the ABA Section of Family Law .
We said , two weeks ago : On June 2 , 2008 , RADAR released two special reports , Myths of ABA Commission on Domestic Violence , 1,2 that analyzed the 19 statements made in the flyer put out by the American Bar Association ( ABA ) Commission on Domestic Violence , " 10 Myths about Custody and Domestic Violence and How to Counter Them . "
Among the flyer 's 19 claims , 11 were found to be false , three misleading , and three unsupported by existing research .
Only two claims were found to be correct .
And some errors are egregious .
For example , the flyer states that " False allegations are no more common in divorce or custody disputes than at any time . "
But this claim , which flies in the face of common sense , is debunked by research showing that false allegations increase four - fold during custody and access disputes .
The flyer represents a crass attempt by the ABA Commission on Domestic Violence to further bias the administration of family law , to falsely stereotype fathers as abusers , and to force more children into single - parent households .
We pointed out that we sent the reports to the ABA president , thereby putting him on notice of the problems with the flyer , and he had ignored our request for a response .
The ABA Section of Family Law , composed of over 10,000 members " dedicated to serving the field of family law , " publish the Family Law Quarterly3 , a " scholarly journal provid[ing ] ... an analytical view of existing and emerging family law issues . "
Holding themselves out as experts in such topics as the ones covered in the " 10 Myths " flyer , they know , or should know , of the shoddy scholarship and / or intentional deception that went into its creation .
By not publicly disapproving of the flyer , the ABA 's resident experts in family law have implicitly endorsed it .
Please contact the ABA Section of Family Law ( ) and ask , as nicely as you can , whether they are aware of the inaccuracies contained in " 10 Myths " and request that they publicly disapprove of it .
Let them know they are giving themselves a black eye for standing behind the ABA Commission on Domestic Violence 's flyer of lies .

Badger Power
Wherefore Art Thou , Badger ?
Badger is an application toolkit designed to simplify the process of building object - oriented Perl applications .
It provides a set of foundation classes upon which you can quickly build robust and reliable systems .
Convenience , convention and consistency are key in our ongoing quest to increase the Kwalitee™ of our code and make it more Skimpy ™ ( aka skimmable ) .
An Introduction to Badger
Andy Wardley gave a talk about Badger at the London Perl Workshop on 29th November 2008 .
The slides are available here complete with extended footnotes culminating in an extended rant about how hard it is to write extensible , generic software .
But do we want him to be safe ?
The flames were pretty big !

John McCain 's foreign ' policy ' problem is that he does n't really have a policy .
What he has are several tics , or gut reactions , that keep getting played out on the world stage .
When you look at the sum of what he advocates , it amounts to a vague , incoherent , contradictory , self - defeating mish mash of reactions against things McCain does n't like .
Almost entirely negative , his foreign ' policy ' offers very little that is forward looking .
At best , he identifies a few things he does n't want to see happen .
It 's not surprising that somebody who tries to build ' policy ' on a crumbly foundation of gut reactions - very much as George Bush himself - comes across frequently as rash .
A McCain presidency would be dangerous not just because he shoots from the hip , but because that 's a symptom of a deeper problem :
He has no clear idea what he wants to achieve .
He has no method , no meaningful goal , and thus no path to get there .
A coherent foreign policy does n't necessarily require elaboration in lengthy tracts aimed toward policy wonks .
It just requires coherence ... that is , it needs to be backed up by thought until national interests , goals , and methods are brought into line .
Typically , you can tell that thinking is clear when it can be summarized .
So for example this is the core of a coherent foreign policy .
Avoid foreign entanglements .
Clearly that 's not a policy McCain embraces ; perhaps one he does n't even comprehend , given his desperate desire to enroll Georgia in NATO while it 's enmeshed in war .
In any case , McCain has never clearly enunciated his foreign policy either in whole or in part .
For example , anybody who 's paid attention over the years to his many strange and contradictory pronouncements about Iraq , going back to McCain 's determination since 2001 to promote an invasion , is left with the uncomfortable feeling that he has only the vaguest idea what he stands for and why , what his goals are and how to achieve them .
He wants ' victory ' and he 's against ' defeat ' in Iraq ; that 's about the extent of his ruminations .
His Strategy for Victory in Iraq , though no doubt burnished by his campaign staff , is reactive and negative at best :
It would be a grave mistake to leave before Al Qaeda in Iraq is defeated and before a competent , trained , and capable Iraqi security force is in place and operating effectively .
We must help the Government of Iraq battle those who provoke sectarian tensions and promote a civil war that could destabilize the Middle East .
Iraq must not become a failed state , a haven for terrorists , or a pawn of Iran ... The best way to secure long - term peace and security is to establish a stable , prosperous , and democratic state in Iraq that poses no threat to its neighbors and contributes to the defeat of terrorists .
More than 5 years into this war and McCain is still talking on the level of magical ponies .
When pressed for serious answers about the intractable problems , he camouflages his vacuity in rambling appeals to support the troops and such not .
He numbs the mind in the hopes that listeners wo n't notice that he can't put together national interests , goals , and methods in a coherent Iraq policy .
The underlying problem with McCain 's foreign ' policy ' has been so glaring for so long with regard to Iraq that I 'd almost stopped noticing it .
However the war in Georgia has really brought it into sharp relief in a very short span of time .
McCain has nothing like a coherent policy .
He has n't tried to align realistic interests , goals , and methods .
Instead , his positions have been almost entirely reactive and negative .
They 're governed mostly by what he dislikes - in this case , Russia and Vladimir Putin .
It 's a classic demonstration of how McCain makes ' policy ' by shooting from the hip .
And once again , McCain was wrong as events showed .
He wanted the US and NATO to take the toughest ( im ) possible line against Russia to the point of confrontation .
His gut hatred of Russia / Putin simply blinded him to Russia 's frequently expressed interest ( i ) in keeping NATO away from its doorstep and out of the Caucasus , and ( ii ) in reversing a series of humiliations at the hands of Bush , particularly ( iii ) in making a counter - example of the US intevention in Kosovo .
That 's a lot to ignore .
With his blinkered and reactive view of the conflict , McCain could n't see that a likely outcome of the fighting would be that Russia would lay off Georgia once it had humiliated Saakashvili .
Instead , McCain could only see Hitler on the move .
It was all about ' Defense of the West ' vs ' appeasement ' as far as he was concerned .
So he staked out an impossibly bellicose position and was left high and dry when the tawdry little war sputtered out more or less as realistic observers anticipated .
Indeed for more than a week McCain 's bellicose position consistently and perversely ran afoul of absolutely basic facts .
From the moment the Russians counter - attacked in South Ossetia , McCain has been acting as if he were president - calling Mikheil Saakashvili daily , announcing that Americans are all Georgians , even sending his own personal envoys to meddle in affairs he has little say in .
McCain has also been pushing aggressively for a confrontational policy .
He 's hinted repeatedly that he might insert US and NATO troops into the conflict on behalf of Georgia .
Yet neither NATO nor the US is in any position to get troops there quickly , even if we wished to .
McCain blamed the fighting entirely on Russia , failing to acknowledge that the Georgians started it .
McCain has lavished praise on Saakashvili for his leadership and moderation , though the Georgian President obviously began the conflict with the intention of dragging the US in as his ally .
Indeed this interview with Saakashvili , conducted on the eve of the war , shows that the propaganda McCain subsequently adopted had been prepared for him in Georgia before Saakashvili sent the troops in :
In this conversation , with fullscale war just 2 hours away , the Georgian president insists that his country does not seek conflict with Russia .
He appears to understand the stakes involved , acknowledging that Russia ’s population is 30 times larger than Georgia ’s and that any Georgian attempt to reclaim one of the separatist regions would mean opening a war against Russia itself .
But at the same time , in this interview , Saakashvili is openly contemptuous of his counterparts in Russia .
“ You know them and their corruption , ” he says ; “ you can imagine what horrible consequences there would be if we followed their political and economic model . ”
He says he cannot imagine the West not coming to Georgia ’s aid .
It would be like the betrayal of Hungary in 1956 or the then Czechoslovakia in 1968 , when the Soviet Union ’s aggressive repression of restive satellites was met with silence from the West .
Does America 's interest really involve seeking a military confrontation with Russia by aligning ourselves so closely with Georgia 's as to equate our interests ?
Is the US able to achieve what Georgia might wish , and if so at what cost ?
Once involved , can the US disentangle itself if affairs in the Caucasus spiral out of control ?
These are questions that McCain never seems to have asked himself in his headlong embrace ( as a mere candidate ) of yet another potential quagmire .
This August 13 NPR interview highlights the shallowness of McCain 's thinking as he blathers about what the Georgian war means for his foreign policy views .
There 's just nothing here but gut feelings stated and restated .
Notice too that McCain even repeats as fact the assumption that the Russian attack was about controlling the oil pipeline running through Georgia .
The idea had been thoroughly discredited by that time , if only because the Russians made no move to seize the Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan pipeline .
RENEE MONTAGNE : Russia 's president did order an end to Russian military operations there .
To the degree that that is in effect , and to the degree that peace talks are in motion , how much did statements from the West make a difference here ?
Because there is an argument that they did n't make much difference at all , that Russia had its own agenda , and it came and went as it pleased in Georgia .
JOHN MCCAIN : Well , I think , to a large extent , unfortunately , that 's the case .
They want a friendly country on their border .
They want to control the oil pipelines that goes through there .
And this is clearly in keeping with the Russian ambitions for the old , near a broad control of or absolute takeover of surrounding countries .
And this may be trying to send a message to Ukraine and other countries in the region .
MONTAGNE : Well , there would be those who would say that that message has been sent and heard even beyond the region .
What , realistically , could the U.S. in particular do to prevent , as you say , other sorts of influence that the Russians would like to exert in that region ?
MCCAIN : Well , I think , in the short term , there is limited options , certainly , that we have .
Long term , I think we may be in a period of relations with Russia where we have to make sure that we help our friends , that we do what we can to protect democracies and freedom , and make sure that we understand that there is a new era that obviously began when President Putin took over , and so we will adjust our relations accordingly .
And I do n't think that there 's going to be a re-ignition of the Cold War ; do n't get me wrong .
I do n't think there 's going to be nuclear - weapons buildups , et cetera , but I think that Russian behavior is not acceptable .
And we will do what we can to maintain our alliances and our friends and make the Russians understand that this kind of behavior is not a part of what we view as the 21st century .
So his European foreign ' policy ' amounts to helping friends and protecting democracies and freedom while making sure Russians know we do n't like their behavior .
I think it 's fair to say that 's about as deep as McCain ever gets .
He offers nothing about broad goals or methods or outcomes .
McCain does n't even have an ideology to fall back upon , to create a framework in which he might conjure a foreign policy .
I suspect that 's why McCain fell so easily captive to the neocons during the late 1990s .
They at least have ( bad ) ideas and a coherent set of goals and methods - though thoroughly unworkable ones .
All McCain has going for him , however , is his gut .
By 2008 we 've all had quite enough of that kind of foreign ' policy ' .
China quake zone govt to sell luxury HQ after outcry : report
by Staff Writers
Beijing ( AFP ) July 17 , 2008
The capital of China 's quake - hit Sichuan province has bowed to public pressure and will auction off its luxurious new government headquarters to aid the recovery effort , state media said Thursday .
Proceeds from the sale of the controversial Chengdu city government building will go towards rehousing quake victims and for reconstruction , the China Youth Daily quoted He Huazhang , head of the Chengdu propaganda department , as saying .
The move follows a public outcry after rumours circulated online that government personnel began moving into the building just three days after the 8.0 - magnitude earthquake shook Sichuan province on May 12 , killing nearly 70,000 people .
The newspaper report said the move actually began at the end of April but the high cost of the building further angered Chinese netizens .
The paper said it cost 1.2 billion yuan ( 176 million dollars ) .
" All of a sudden it makes me lose hope in the current government , " one netizen wrote on popular web portal sina.com .
" I do n't believe our national leaders did n't know about such a huge project .
Pity the poor students who died in the earthquake . "
The deaths of thousands of children whose schools collapsed on top of them remains one of the most sensitive issues arising from the quake , and has led to accusations that corruption facilitated the use of shoddy materials .
The government building is located on 17 hectares ( 42 acres ) of land , and measures 370,000 square metres ( four million square feet ) , the China Youth Daily said .
" I think that what was behind this move of moving in and moving out so quickly was some internal self - examination , and the pressure of public opinion from outside , " the paper said in a separate commentary on the issue .
According to the Beijing News , the earthquake killed 4,304 people in Chengdu , and caused damage worth more than 120 billion yuan in the city alone .
( CNN ) -- Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are wrapping up their push in Pennsylvania with sharp attacks a day before the state 's crucial primary .
Sen. Hillary Clinton greets supporters Sunday at Pennsylvania State University .
Both candidates have been launching waves of robocalls , tough mailers and matching attack ads , spending an estimated hundreds of thousands of dollars a day .
Both Obama and Clinton made campaign stops in key cities on Monday .
Obama has outspent his rival in Pennsylvania , thanks in part to his hefty fundraising .
He raised $ 41 million in March , compared with Clinton 's $ 20 million , according to the latest campaign finance reports .
In March , Obama spent about $ 31 million on his presidential campaign , compared with Clinton 's $ 22 million .
Clinton began April in debt , according to financial reports filed over the weekend with the Federal Election Commission .
She had about $ 32 million cash on hand , but only $ 9 million of that total represents funds that can be spent in the primary races .
Meanwhile , Obama has $ 51 million cash on hand , with $ 42.5 million that can be spent in the primaries , according to reports .
At least $ 23 million of the money Clinton had in the bank was set aside for the general election , compared with $ 8 million set aside by Obama .
Clinton on ' Larry King '
A day before Pennsylvania 's primary , Sen. Hillary Clinton sits down with Larry King on CNN's " Larry King Live . "
Tonight , 9 ET see full schedule »
The reports also showed Clinton owes more than $ 10 million , meaning she was in the red even before stepping up TV advertising in Pennsylvania .
" The numbers are what they are , " Clinton adviser Howard Wolfson said on a conference call with reporters .
" The money continues to come in strongly .
We had a very good month , last month of fundraising .
...
We are continuing to have a good month this month . "
He also said , " We will of course be honoring the debt in the coming weeks and months . "
Tuesday 's contest brings an end to a six - week primary hiatus .
With 158 delegates at stake , the Pennsylvania primary is the largest remaining Democratic contest .
Watch how the candidates are making their final pitches »
Clinton told supporters Sunday in the historic steel - mill town of Bethlehem that last week 's bruising debate and the candidates ' recent disputes over health care proposals " showed you the choice that you had . "
" I am offering leadership you can count on .
You know where I stand , you have known what I have done , and you know what I will do , " the senator from New York said .
Clinton said Obama has misrepresented her plan for universal health care in a barrage of mailers and television ads .
" We need to try to achieve universal health care , not create political opposition to universal health care , " she said .
" That is what the Republicans do , not what Democrats do . "
Obama , who has campaigned on messages of change and unity , acknowledged Sunday that his campaign has " elbowed back " a few times in response to criticism from Clinton and her supporters .
" When I hear Sen . Clinton 's campaign say they 're going to throw the ' kitchen sink ' strategy at us , and they try to manufacture or exploit fake controversies instead of talking about what is important for the American people ... then I 'm thinking , ' Well , you learned the wrong lessons from those Republicans who are going after you in the same way , ' " the senator from Illinois said during a town hall - style event in Reading .
Obama has criticized Clinton 's plans for a health care mandate , which would require individuals to purchase insurance and requires insurance companies to offer coverage to anyone who applies .
Clinton has said that Obama 's plan , which would create a national health insurance program but would not mandate individual coverage , would leave up to 15 million Americans uncovered .
Obama on Sunday said that any of the three leading presidential candidates -- including Republican rival Sen. John McCain -- would be better than President Bush .
" Either Democrat would be better than John McCain , " he said in Reading .
" And all three of us would be better than George Bush . "
In the past , Obama has equated a McCain presidency to a " third Bush term . "
Clinton shot back , saying , " We need a nominee who is going to take on John McCain , not cheer him on . "
Obama leads Clinton in the overall delegate count , 1,644 to 1,498 , while Clinton has a slight edge over Obama in superdelegates , 254 to 230 .
Clinton has seen her double - digit lead in Pennsylvania shrink to 7 percentage points , according to the most recent Pennsylvania Democratic " poll of polls , " an average of campaign surveys .
About 7 percent of the state 's Democratic voters say they are undecided , the surveys found
The poll of polls consists of three surveys : Zogby ( April 19 - 20 ) , Suffolk University ( April 19 - 20 ) and Quinnipiac ( April 18 - 20 ) .

Mr. Gore admitted his plan would , at least initially , drive energy prices higher .
But he proposed a payroll tax cut to offset higher prices for fuel and electricity .
He said he envisioned nuclear power retaining its current share of domestic electricity generation , about 20 percent .
Coal , which now produces about half of American electricity , would dwindle , while renewable sources , now producing less than 3 percent of the nation ’s electricity , would rapidly grow .
( Natural gas and hydroelectric dams provide most of the remainder of the nation ’s electricity , relatively little of which comes from burning oil . )
Mr. Gore , who was awarded the Nobel Prize last October , is the most vocal in a growing chorus calling for a green energy revolution .
The Texas oilman Boone Pickens has proposed converting a large portion of the American transportation fleet to run on compressed natural gas while spending billions on new wind farms to produce electricity .
Even those who share Mr. Gore ’s ideals expressed skepticism that his goal could be achieved in 10 years .
“ Mr. Gore is continuing his talent of identifying the key challenges , emphasizing urgency and translating it to a broad audience .
That ’s terrific , ” said Ernest J. Moniz , director of the energy initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former under secretary at the Department of Energy in the Clinton administration .
“ Everyone agrees that the solution to the climate challenge is decarbonization and the first place to go is the electricity sector .
Can we get there that fast ?
Obviously it ’s very , very tough . ”
Last winter , the House failed to enact legislation to require utilities to produce 15 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020 .
Last month , supporters could not even get a Senate vote on a climate change plan that would cut greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 70 percent by 2050 .
Mr. Gore was undeterred .
“ To those who say 10 years is not enough time , I respectfully ask them to consider seriously what the world ’s scientists are telling us about the risks we face if we do n’t act in less than 10 years , ” he said .
He noted that the United States uses only a tiny fraction of the wind , solar and geothermal power available .
He said entrepreneurs were investing billions of dollars in new technology and rapidly bringing down the cost of all alternative energy sources .
A recent landmark ruling by the High Court takes the UK one step closer to becoming an “ informant society ” along the lines of the former East Germany or Soviet Union .
El Reg previously reported on the case of deputy head , John Pinnington , who was fired from his job when an enhanced criminal record background ( CRB ) check turned up allegations of abuse made against him .
He took his case to judicial review , arguing that the allegations were seriously flawed , were unsubstantiated , and that the police should only include them in a CRB check where there were some grounds to believe they might be true .
This view was rejected , as Lord Justice Richards ruled that there was nothing unlawful about the actions of the Police force in passing on allegations .
And future employers " should be aware " of the accusations , however weak and unreliable they are .
In relation to employment with children or vulnerable adults , it is information of which an employer should be aware .
It is then for the employer to decide whether the employment of the person concerned involves an unacceptable risk .
Let ’s be completely clear : Vulture Central has no way of knowing whether these allegations were true , false , or the deluded imaginings of politically - correct Martians .
What we do know is that police investigated and took no further action , and that at least one set of allegations was based on the controversial " facilitated communication " method of eliciting statements from children too damaged , otherwise , to speak on their own behalf .
On any objective scale of evidence , they belong in the category labelled “ weak ” .
Although the legal reasoning is immaculate , it misses the point when it comes to how the real world operates , which is that when faced with a candidate about whom allegations have been made , employers will almost universally opt for the safe option – and not employ that individual .
For further analysis , we spoke with Chris Saltrese , the solicitor who has represented Pinnington throughout this case :
The ‘ enhanced criminal record certificate ’ is a consummate example or Orwellian doublespeak .
Required for all who work or volunteer with children and vulnerable adults , it refers not to criminal records as such , but to untested information made available to the police .
As such it may ruin the life and livelihood of a person with no criminal record at all .
Flimsy and insubstantial allegations are lent bogus respectability exciting revulsion merely by the fact that they are there to read .
For when it comes to sexual allegations in print , the power of the word is far deadlier than the facts .
When John Pinnington launched his bid to have unreliable allegations removed from his certificate , there was already case law to suggest that the threshold of disclosure was low .
The statutory obligation for the police to include information ‘ that might be relevant and ought to be included ’ had been held to include acquittals and misconduct falling short of a criminal offence .
Mr Pinnington ’s case tested the outer limit of inclusion by posing the question of whether allegations that did not attain a threshold of reasonable suspicion ought to be included .
Reasonable suspicion is a low threshold – it is that required for arrest and to trigger care proceedings in family law .
It is no where near the standard of criminal prosecution , let alone conviction .
Yet the court held that the threshold should fall below reasonable suspicion .
All that was required was that the allegations could not , on the untested material in possession of the police , be dismissed as necessarily untrue .
This is significant ( and topical ) for two reasons .
John Pinnington was OK on a standard CRB check , but he fell foul of the system when he changed jobs and was asked to undergo an “ enhanced ” CRB check – which includes soft information of the type used here .
However , as we move from the existing system of CRB checking to the new enhanced “ vetting database ” – as reported in great detail by El Reg – all checks will be effectively enhanced checks .
Second , still smarting from its defeat at the hands of Max Mosley , the News of the World has been laying in to what it considers the iniquities of the developing law on privacy .
In defence of its right to poke into individual private lives , it asks its readers whether they would not wish to know what their children ’s teachers get up to at the weekend .
Undoubtedly many parents would , and it is this , plus the result of the Pinington case , that is likely to provide a new focus for future salacious reportage .
Last word to Mick Brookes , General Secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers :
We believe this is a retrograde action that will simply put more teachers and other members of the children ’s workforce in danger of malicious and false allegation at risk .
We recognize absolutely the need for our schools to be safe places , but this action overturns natural justice as it appears that colleagues working in schools run the risk of being guilty by accusation .
This makes professional and dedicated staff vulnerable to the ruination of careers and even lives for no substantiated reason .
We would ask the High Court and the police to reconsider their position .

NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope has found an answer to a long - standing puzzle by resolving giant but delicate filaments shaped by a strong magnetic field around the active galaxy NGC 1275 .
It is the most striking example of the influence of the immense tentacles of extragalactic magnetic fields , say researchers .
One of the closest giant elliptical galaxies , NGC 1275 hosts a supermassive black hole .
Energetic activity of gas swirling near the black hole blows bubbles of material into the surrounding galaxy cluster .
Long gaseous filaments stretch out beyond the galaxy , into the multimillion - degree , X - ray - emitting gas that fills the cluster .
These filaments are the only visible - light manifestation of the intricate relationship between the central black hole and the surrounding cluster gas .
They provide important clues about how giant black holes affect their surrounding environment .
Exploiting Hubble 's view , a team of astronomers led by Andy Fabian from the University of Cambridge , UK , have for the first time resolved individual threads of gas that make up the filaments .
The amount of gas contained in a typical thread is around one million times the mass of our own Sun .
They are only 200 light - years wide , are often very straight , and extend for up to 20,000 light - years .
The filaments are formed when cold gas from the core of the galaxy is dragged out in the wake of the rising bubbles blown by the black hole .
It has been a challenge for astronomers to understand how the delicate structures withstood the hostile , high - energy environment of the galaxy cluster for over 100 million years .
They should have heated up , dispersed , and evaporated by now , or collapsed under their own gravity to form stars .
A new study published in the August 21 Nature magazine proposes that magnetic fields hold the charged gas in place and resist the forces that would distort the filaments .
This skeletal structure is strong enough to resist gravitational collapse .
" We can see that the magnetic fields are crucial for these complex filaments – both for their survival and for their integrity , " said Fabian .
Similar networks of filaments are found around other more remote central cluster galaxies .
However , they cannot be observed with comparable resolution to the view of NGC 1275 .
The team will apply the understanding of NGC 1275 to interpret observations of these more distant galaxies .
The authors of the science paper are : A.C. Fabian , R.M. Johnstone , and J.S. Sanders ( University of Cambridge , UK ) , C.J. Conselice ( University of Nottingham , UK ) , C.S. Crawford ( University of Cambridge , UK ) , and J.S. Gallagher III and E. Zweibel ( University of Wisconsin , Madison ) .

Rove refuses subpoena , leaves country Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday July 10 , 2008
Print This Email This Update : Conyers gives
Rove 5 days to comply before pursuing ' all available options '
Former White House adviser Karl Rove has ignored a subpoena from congressional Democrats to testify about allegations of political pressure at the Justice Department and his alleged role in the prosecution of a former governor of Alabama .
A House subcommittee voted 7 - 1 Thursday to reject Rove 's claim that executive privilege freed him from an obligation to testify , leaving open the possibility the Republican political guru will be held in contempt .
During the hearing , Rep. Chris Cannon ( R - UT ) revealed that Rove was out of the country .
According to the liberal blog ThinkProgress , Rove 's lawyer 's confirmed that Rove was out of the country on a trip scheduled long before the subpoena was sent .
Karl Rove failed to appear before the House Judiciary subcommittee .
His lawyer revealed that he was out of the country .

Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers seemed hesitant to rush forward with contempt proceedings Thursday , though .
In a letter to Rove 's lawyer , Robert Luskin , Conyers expressed his disappointment and insisted that Rove comply with the subpoena , which he has already flatly refused to do , before the committee would be forced to take drastic action .
" This letter is to formally notify you that we must insist on compliance with the subpoena and urge you to reconsider your position ... .
Please let us know no later than Tuesday July , 15 if Mr. Rove will comply with the subpoena , or we will proceed to consider all other appropriate recourse , " wrote Conyers and Rep. Linda Sanchez , chair of the Judiciary subcommittee Rove snubbed Thursday .
Democrats subpoenaed Rove in May to force him to talk about whether he was involved in firing federal prosecutors or sought to influence prosecutors ' decisions - including in the corruption case against former Democratic Alabama governor Don Siegelman , who was convicted on corruption charges in 2006 .
Democrats are investigating whether Rove encouraged the Justice Department to pursue the case .
" By failing to appear in defiance of a subpoena , Mr. Rove , his attorney and the White House are trying to run away from an investigation that 's about one thing : ensuring justice is dispensed free of fear or favor , " Sï¿½nchez said in a news release .
" Mr. Rove is not above the law and Congress will assert its constitutional role to serve as a check on the power of the executive branch . "
He had been scheduled to appear at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing Thursday morning .
In the same statement released Thursday afternoon , Conyers said Rove 's absence was " an insult to the American people " and vowed to " seriously consider all available options " ; nowhere in the Democrats ' statement nor their letter was contempt explicitly mentioned .
Last week , Sanchez and Judiciary Chairman John Conyers threatened to hold Rove in contempt if he followed through on his promise to defy their subpoena .
It 's unclear whether they will follow through on that threat .
The House already has voted to hold two of President Bush 's confidants in contempt for failing to cooperate with its inquiry into whether the administration fired federal prosecutors for political reasons .
The case , involving White House chief of staff Josh Bolten and former White House counsel Harriet Miers , is now in court .
The White House maintains that its staffers ' internal communications are confidential .

Browse column E verybody 's asking me what 'll happen if we attack Iran .
To get a quick preview , just do what this guy in my eighth - grade class did : put a firecracker in your mouth , hold it between your front teeth , and light the fuse .
" It 's just like the homecoming game ! " Bush settles in to enjoy the upcoming slaughter .
Your friends wo n't believe you 'll go through with it .
So when it blows up in your face , you 'll expect them to be impressed .
And you 'll be surprised , just like this guy in junior high was surprised , when all you get is a perforated eardrum and a reputation as the biggest dumbass in the school .
Right now , Bush is standing there with a lit match and a big firecracker labeled " Iran " in his mouth .
Except it 's more like an M - 80 or a whole stick of dynamite than a firecracker .
Nobody believes he 'll be dumb enough to light it , to actually attack Iran .
Even the Iranians do n't believe it ; Khameini , their head Mullah , said last week " America is in no position to invade Iran . "
He 's right about that .
Even the US Army brass admits we 're " overstretched . "
We do n't even have enough troops to control Iraq ; a war with Iran would mean calling up every National Guard unit we have .
Even then , it would take years to get them combat - ready .
And this time the Brits wo n't come with us .
They 've been making that clear , on the quiet .
If we go in , it 'll be as a coalition of one .
So Khameini 's right ; we can't attack Iran .
But that does n't mean we wo n't .
Khameini was making the same mistake everybody 's been making : assuming Bush and his cronies have a lick of sense .
The best way of guessing what Bush will do is asking , what 's the worst thing he could do to America ?
Whatever it is , that 's what he 'll do .
I think he 's been possessed by bin Laden , because everything he 's done has been exactly what Al Quaeda hoped for .
Right now , bin Laden is praying to Allah that we 'll be stupid enough to attack Iran .
That would be the cherry on his halal sundae , the one thing that could actually finish us off as a Superpower .
In my " Quagmire Bowl " article I said the Iraq war probably would n't be fatal .
It 's definitely hurt us , but it wo n't mean the downfall of America .
Well , if we invade Iran , that bet is off .
All bets are off .
People do n't realize how fast a Superpower can fall .
It only takes one invasion too many .
Napoleon was unstoppable before he invaded Russia .
So was Hitler .
Now France and Germany are " Old Europe . "
Invading the wrong country can age you faster than driving a Long Beach bus on the night shift .
Invading Iran helped end the win-streak of the best , biggest Empire of all , the Romans .
It was in 260 AD , when emperor Valerius headed east to deal with the Persians who were kickin ' up a fuss on the eastern border of the Empire .
This Valerian would 've risen high in Dubya 's administration , because he was a real hard charger , a go - getter ... and dumb as a half brick .
He charged right into Iraq -- they called it Mesopotamia back then -- even though his troops were dying of plague all around him .
The Persians sat back , watched Roman troops keeling over , and had a good laugh , eating pistachios in the shade while Valerian tried to figure out what to do .
Naturally , he decided it was time for bold action .
That 's the only trick these go - getters know .
It reminds me of what one of MacArthur 's aides said about him : " When it paid to be aggressive , he was aggressive .
And when it did n't pay to be aggressive ... he was aggressive . "
Valerian figured a little proactive salesmanship would settle things , so he demanded a meeting with the Persian emperor , Sapor - - who could n't believe his luck .
Sapor ordered the slaves to cook a big banquet , bring out the best silverware -- and had his troops hide in the banquet hall till he gave the signal .
Valerian stomped in , Sapor snapped his fingers and Valerian ended up a live trophy , dragged around in chains through every city in the Persian empire till his purple robes were shreds .
There 's a moral to this story : Persians are tricky , clever people .
They 've always had that reputation .
You do n't want people like that for enemies .
Unfortunately , Bush wo n't be leading the charge the way Valerian did , so we probably wo n't get to see him dragged through Tehran in chains .
But we 'll see worse things : casualty lists that will make Iraq look like a beach volleyball game , American armies losing conventional battles , and after a few years , a humiliating exit .
Iran is scarier than Iraq in every way you can name .
First of all , it 's physically way bigger , three times the size of Iraq .
The population is 65 million , nearly three times as many as Iraq .
The Iranians are young , too .
Their birthrate is way down now , around 2 kids per woman , but back in the Khomeini years it was one of the highest in the world .
So right now , the Iranian population has a demographic profile that 's a military planner 's dream : not too many little kids to take care of , but a huge pool of fighting - age men -- about 18 million .
" Go War ! " Bush the Yale cheerleader
And it wo n't be just young , fit men fighting us .
Thanks to the invention of the suicide car bomb , guerrilla commanders will have someplace to send 70 year old volunteers : down to the garage to pick up a Plymouth packed full of fertilizer bomb .
You do n't have to be young to put the pedal to the metal .
The insurgents ' DMV test will be real simple : " OK , Grandpa , can you make out the silhouette of a Bradley or Humvee , and aim your car at it ? "
Do that and you pass .
They hand you the keys , and you get a quick , painless martyr 's exit .
Everybody will want to get in on the fun : Grandpa , Grandma , even the cripples , with specially adapted pedals so they can chin - pilot their car bombs into our patrols .
The suicide car bomb is a good example of why I do n't worship hardware like most war fans do .
These cars are actually no - tech guided surface - to - surface cruise missiles -- and damn effective .
We 've found that out the hard way .
All it takes is a driver who 's willing to die for the pleasure of killing the enemy .
Put him ( or her ) in an old jalopy stuffed with fertilizer and detonators and you 've got a highly accurate , fire - and - forget missile .
They 're especially deadly in urban warfare , because they 're perfectly camouflaged till they actually blow up .
And all for the price of a used car and a few bags of Miracle Gro .
Our cruise missiles are real showpieces , ultra hi-tech .
They can be launched from subs , surface ships , planes and ground launchers .
They can guide themselves over hundreds of miles , they cost millions apiece ( usually hundreds of times as much as the huts or sheds we aim them at ) -- but they 're useless to us in Iraq , whereas the suicide car - bomb cruise missiles are hurting us every single day .
It 's the software inside people 's heads that wins wars nowadays .
You hardware freaks are going to have to face that fact one of these days .
And it's this brain - software that we 're hopeless at programming .
Iraq has proved pretty clearly we do n't have a clue how to use the Middle - Eastern brain OS .
In fact , we 've actually done the impossible : reprogrammed the miserable , cowardly Iraqis into fierce warriors .
Remember Gulf War I ?
Remember those pitiful fags crawling up to our soldiers to surrender on their hands and knees , sobbing like babies ?
Two years of occupation by Bush 's morons has turned those cowards into fearless kamikazes in Oldsmobiles .
So just imagine what the Iranians , the original Islamic suicide squads , will do when we invade .
There 'll be traffic jams , ten - mile backups , outside every US base , thousands of car bombers honking and changing lanes trying to get to the front of the line and make that final commute to Paradise .
It 'll be like the San Diego freeway on a Monday morning , except the fenderbenders will be a little more serious .
The Iranians , unlike the Iraqis , have always been willing to die for their country .
In the Iran - Iraq War ( 1980 - 89 ) thousands of Iranians volunteered to charge across Iraqi minefields , knowing they were going to die .
It scared the Hell out of the Iraqis .
They threw everything at those crazy Persian suicide charges , even poison gas .
And the Iranians just kept coming .
If you want a more complete account of that war , read my column , " The War Nobody Watched " in eXile # 178 .
The short version is simple : Iranians are brave , determined people .
Do n't mess with them .
Of course all the NeoCon crazies are peddling the old story that " once we invade , the people will rally to the cause of freedom . "
Yeah .
Just like they did in Iraq .
If we could n't get people on our side after deposing a monster like Saddam , what chance do you think we have of winning hearts and minds in Iran ?
The kids in Iran are pissed off at the way the old Mullahs wo n't let 'em rock and roll , but the idea that they 'll support an American invasion because they 're bored is totally insane .
It 's like imagining that the kids in Footloose would 've backed a Soviet invasion of Nebraska because John Lithgow would n't let them hold school dances .
The argument between Mullahs and kids in Iran is a classic family fight .
And you know what happens when some intruder crashes in on the middle of one of those : the whole family unites in about a millisecond and tears him apart .
The Iranians already hate us .
They have since 1953 , when the CIA staged a coup to get rid of a popular Lefty Prime Minister , Mossadeq .
Way back in the 70s , when most of the world still kinda liked us , crowds in Tehran chanted " Marg bar Amrika , " " Death to America . "
We 're also getting told we 'll be able to exploit the ethnic divisions inside Iran .
The fact is , Iran 's ethnic problems are nowhere near as bad as Iraq's .
More than half of the population is ethnically Persian .
The next - biggest group is the Azerbaijani , about a quarter of the population .
They squabble with the Iranian majority from time to time , but they 're fellow Shi'ites , they intermarry all the time - there 's no real hatred between them .
There are a few Arabs in Western Iran , maybe 3 % of the population .
But if you 're thinking we could bring them over to our side , forget it .
Saddam already tried that during the Iran - Iraq War and got nowhere .
And if they 're not going to rebel for a fellow Arab who lives next door , you better believe they wo n't rise up to help us Christian Crusaders .
That leaves us with the Kurds , who are about 10 % of the Iranian population .
There are all kinds of factions in Kurdistan , all of them armed and ready to kill each other , so we might be able to sign up a few of the really crazy gangs to work with us .
But they would have zero chance of controlling a country as big , fierce and clever as Iran .
Face it : we have no friends left in Iran .
Thanks to Bush , we have no friends left anywhere in the Muslim world , except a few sleazes like Allawi -- and he'd be torn to pieces if he showed himself in the street without Delta Force bodyguards .
If we attack Iran , that 'll make three Muslim countries invaded in three years .
We may as well dress our soldiers in white tunics with red crosses on them , like they did in the Middle Ages .
We 'd be fighting on three fronts : the conventional war against the Iranian armed forces , guerrilla war in the territories we 'd conquered , and worldwide terror attacks by every group that sympathizes with Iran .
The third front , international terror attacks , would be the scariest of all .
Because unlike Iraq , Iran actually does have terrorist connections .
Very good ones , with some very scary people .
Iran is the only country where Shia Islam is the state religion , so Shiites all over think of Iran the way old - time Catholics used to think of Rome .
Attacking Iran would drive them insanely angry , not that it takes much to get Shiites in a crazy , suicidal mood .
Would America Do A Thing Like That ?
" The possibility of a U.S. attack against Iran is very low .
We think America is not in a position to take a lunatic action of attacking Iran , " Iran President Mohammed Khatami said .
January 19 , 2005 .
" The Americans are n't coming .
They would n't do a thing like that . "
Manuel Noriega , on the eve of the US invasion of Panama , 1989 .
( Quoted in Commanders by Bob Woodward , page 158 ) .
I 've written before about how Shiites see the world ( " Shi'ite ! Holy Shi'ite ! " eXile # 197 ) .
They love martyrdom , and do n't care whether they win or lose as long as they take a few of the enemy with them .
So you can't " shock and awe " them with superior firepower , or discourage them by inflicting a lot of casualties .
They 're the perfect suicide bombers -- in fact , it was the Shi'ites in Lebanon who perfected the suicide car bomb .
The first time it happened , a 16 - year - old girl drove a car full of explosives into an Israeli APC .
The Israelis were shaken ; in 25 years of fighting the Arabs , nobody else had done that to them .
Eventually , the Shi'ite Hizbollah guerrillas in Southern Lebanon drove the Israelis out .
They were just more willing to take casualties than the Israelis were , even if the exchange was 20 or 30 dead guerrillas for every Israeli killed .
And guess which guerrilla group is closest to Iran ?
That 's right , Lebanese Hizbollah .
Iran is tight with all the Shi'ite militias in Lebanon , in the Bekaa Valley and Beirut as well as the South .
We 'll also be pissing off the Iraqi Shi'ites , 60 % of the Iraqi population .
Right now they 're cooperating with us -- not because they like us , but because we 're helping them use their majority to take over Iraq .
It 's a laugh , the way Bush 's people say the Shi'ite enthusiasm for voting proves that " democracy is taking hold " in Iraq .
All it proves is that Shi'ites can count .
They 've got 60 % of the vote sewed up , and we 're riding shotgun for them , absorbing all the violence the Sunnis can dish out , while the Shia go out and grab power by the ballot box .
But if we attack Iran , they 'll turn on us like Sadr 's boys did in April 2004 , and cities like Karbala , Najaf and Basra will be on the front page every day .
It 'll be a Shi'ite tsunami , with terrorism in places you 'd never expect .
Lots of excitable Iranian expats are going to wire up their Mercs with HE .
They 'll be the richest , best - groomed suicide bombers in history -- Armani suits instead of death shrouds , and Ferraris instead of old clunkers .
It 'll put terrorism in a whole new income bracket .
Meanwhile , what 'll happen in the big battle between us and the Iranian forces ?
Iran 's conventional forces are the LEAST scary part of the problem .
They 're in bad shape : lots of men ( 400,000 , with another 120,000 in the Revolutionary Guards ) but starved for materiel .
Most of their old stock was destroyed in the war against Iraq , and we 've been discouraging suppliers from sending replacements .
Russia , China and North Korea have been Iran 's suppliers lately - - a big switch from the 70s , when the Shah preferred to buy his weapons systems from the US and UK .
They claim to have 1500 tanks , but the bulk of their MBTs are old and rusty .
Since 1989 , all they 've acquired was 500 - odd T - 72s , with about that many BMP - 2 APCs .
That 's not much armor for such a big force , and the T - 72 has n't exactly covered itself in glory in the two Gulf wars .
Their air force , which used to be the second - best in the Mideast ( after Israel , obviously ) is in even sorrier shape , with a couple squadrons flying MiG - 29s and Su - 24 CAS fighter / bombers .
The rest is rusting hulks left over from the Shah 's buying sprees .
One cool bit of trivia : the Iranian AF used to be the only one outside the US to fly the F - 14 .
Most were grounded when we embargoed Iran , and a few were lost in the Iraq War , but I have n't been able to find out what happened to the rest .
Anybody know ?
Other items they 've been buying should be worrying us much more .
For instance , they 've invested heavily in Chinese anti-ship cruise missiles , which have been fitted on ten new , fast coastal - attack ships .
In a column of mine a couple of years ago ( " U Sank My Carrier " eXile # 156 ) , I talked about the very scary outcome of a Persian Gulf war game , when USMC General Paul van Ripen , who was playing the part of Iranian commander , managed to sink half our Persian Gulf task force , including a carrier , with simultaneous attacks by small planes and fast attack craft .
Their missile forces are another worry -- not for what they could do to our troops but for the havoc they could start up if the Iranians , under attack , lost their cool and started targeting countries supporting the US .
Once again , nobody 's really sure exactly what missiles Iran has , or what quantities they 've got .
They definitely do have plenty of our old friend the Scud -- maybe 250 Scud B ( range 285-330 miles depending on warhead ; accuracy zero ) and another 350 Scud C ( range 500 - 700 miles ) .
As we found out in two Gulf wars , Scuds are all hype -- unless you have the guts to fit them with chemical , biological or nuclear warheads .
Saddam never did .
( Though he did fire chemical shells against the Iranians and the Kurds . )
The Iranians just might .
They 've got the chemical weapons : mustard gas , cyanide , and the scariest of all , VX , a very potent , hard - to - clean - up nerve gas .
One of the big arguments right now is whether the Iranians can actually field their Shahab - 3 , a newer better missile designed by North Korea and also supplied to Pakistan ( where it 's called the Ghauri II ) .
As usual , the warmongers are claiming Iran has 'em and plans to use 'em on us .
Cooler heads say that 's unlikely ; so far there have only been a few failed test flights , with the Shahab - 3 blown up mid-flight ( which is usually a sign the test failed ) .
After we all got suckered into believing Saddam could gas London with 45 minutes warmup , I 'm not buying the scare stories till I see some proof .
We know the Iranians have Scuds ; we know they have chemical warheads .
That 's more than enough to worry about .
Because these people are n't cowards like Saddam ; I can see them being real sore losers if the US invades and defeats their army .
The kind of sore losers who press every Doomsday button they can .
Of course , nobody is claiming the US is going to launch an all - out invasion of Iran .
The rumors coming out of the Pentagon say it 'll be a mix of air strikes and quick , small special ops raids on nuclear sites and key military installations .
The idea is to destroy as much of the military infrastructure as we can , and crush their nuclear program before it can produce working nukes .
The biggest , scariest nuclear site is Bushehr , on the Persian Gulf .
It worried the Iraqis so much they bombed it before the two reactors were brought online .
The Iranians learned a hard lesson from that raid , and started dispersing the nuke program all over the country .
They 're working on 15 sites , which they say are going to be used for " peaceful purposes . "
I love the way nuclear scientists talk about " peace . "
That was Stalin 's favorite word , and the nuclear - science types mean it about as much as he did .
Of course the Iranians want nukes .
They 're surrounded by traditional enemies , they know the US is itching to attack , and they consider themselves Allah 's representatives on earth .
If you were in that situation , would n't you be going all - out to get some nukes ?
The experts all say there 's no way Iran could have any nuclear weapons yet .
Maybe they 're right ; even experts have to be right once in a while .
So the question is how much time it will take them to develop nukes .
Estimates go from a year to six years .
The trouble with these estimates is that they 're always bent to help somebody 's agenda .
For instance , the Israelis are the ones saying Iran may go nuke in a year or less .
That 's because they want us to panic , so we 'll do the dirty work of blasting Iran 's nuke sites for them .
The six - year estimates are coming out of Europe , because they 're such wimps they 'll say anything to avoid trouble .
Truth is , I have no idea how close the Iranians are to a working nuke , and I do n't believe anybody else does either .
If the CIA was any good , we'd have a clue , but those poor bastards could n't infiltrate a public library , let alone an Iranian nuclear plant .
If we do go in with quick commando raids and air strikes , we might get away with it .
The Iranians would definitely try to retaliate by proxy , getting Hizbollah and the Iraqi Shi'ites to attack Americans anywhere they go .
But we could handle that .
The real worry is that these lightning raids are never as simple and quick as they 're supposed to be .
Remember the all - day firefight in Somalia , where we lost 18 Rangers ?
That was supposed to be a lightning raid : chopper in , grab Aidid , get out before the locals could react .
A few hours later , the whole US force in Somalia was engaged against the whole population of Mogadishu .
Remember the lightning raid by Delta and the Rangers on Mullah Omar 's house ?
That did n't exactly come off according to plan either .
Once a raid goes bad , soldiers want to go in to rescue their buddies .
Then they 're trapped , and more guys go in to rescue them .
And without ever meaning to , you 've got a conventional battle going on deep in the enemy 's homeland .
And once that happens , the situation is out of control .
If the Iranian army and revolutionary guards play it smart , they 'll harass and retreat , trading land for time the way the Russians did in WW II .
In the territory we did control , we'd have a massive insurgency .
With the Iraqi Shia all fired up , we'd have garrisons pinned down all over Iraq , and all through whatever chunk of Iran we occupied .
And no real guarantee we wiped out all the nuclear sites , because our intelligence is so lousy we might never have heard of the most secret labs ( which may well be underground in the Iranian desert ) .
And we 're actually thinking about doing this .
Incredible .
It 's like a man with a pit bull chomping on his leg purposely opening the door to a kennel where there are a dozen rottweilers ready to tear him apart .
In fact , it 's such a stupid idea , and it'd be such a total disaster for America , that Bush probably will do it .
Anybody else starting to wonder if he and Cheney are actually Al Quaeda moles ?

Is It Possible to Escape The Consumerist Mindset ?
( July 3 , 2008 )
You may have noticed that the entries this week have focused on non-financial analyses .
What better time to look at American society and culture than in the week of July 4th ?
While it 's rewarding to ponder the financial metrics of the meltdown , a single - minded concentration on numbers and charts actively distracts us from examining the underlying causes of the U.S. meltdown and political distemper .
In a way , this focus on measurement and numbers is just another subtle form of media manipulation of the sort described in A Good Con , and The Higher Level Con ( July 1 , 2008 ) .
Numbers only reflect behavior , and behavior reflects beliefs , values , trends , anxieties , hopes and much more .
By focusing on numbers we focus on symptoms , not the casual factors / diseases .
That the U.S. is a consumer society is accepted in much the same way that a clear sky is blue ( or should be ) .
My longtime pal G.F.B. recently posited that the only way for us to truly understand our pervasive consumerist mindset would be to obtain a report from an extraterrestrial anthropologist .
Nonetheless , even our limited terrestrial minds can distinguish appallingly obvious contradictions such as " going green " when it requires the purchase of something new .
I have covered this sort of laughably contradictory discrepancy between the stated goal - -" simplify your life " -- and the behavior being proposed -- " buy more now ! "
For another point of view , let 's turn to a recent email from longtime reader David V. from the Great Northern State :
You keep addressing fictious problems .
Now here are some real problems , and how to solve them .
The moose eat my peas , vines , pods , roots , the whole plant .
Solution : plant enough for them and me .
I put out oats and barley seed and the bears lick them up .
Solution : put out more seed , everyone happy .
Man -made banking , man - made investments , shopping centers , factories , etc .
Just walk away and leave the things of man .
You are going to die , and sooner than you hope .
The meaning of life is found close to the soil ; you can get into it now or get into it later .
But you will get into it .
This is a most interesting commentary , for it suggests that abundance -- the dream of consumerism -- is actually based on a much deeper deprivation .
The abundance David offers is the most basic sort to the creatures around him , while the consumerist mindset is to get something others do n't ( yet ) have , or to get the same thing as someone else has -- filling a hole in the soul , if you will , with some status symbol purchase .
The promise of filling that sense of deprivation is of course the crux of modern marketing .
Trigger some inadequacy / insecurity ( what , you do n't have the latest iPod ??
Loser ! ) and the innate desire for novelty , and you have a marketing platform for the ages .
There are anti-consumer movements afoot , calls to stop buying and rebel against the Machine .
This is nothing new , of course ; rebelling against the conformity of wage - slavery and consumption goes back to at least Thoreau .
The beatnik / hippie lifestyle required cheap living quarters , minimal consumption and communal sustainability , i.e. some sort of absolute - minimum income and lots of sharing / bartering .
There are other mindsets which are neither consumerist nor anti-consumerist .
To those engaged in self - cultivation , consumer and anti-consumer alike are twisted round something which humanity needs like a fish needs a wheelchair .
The yin -yang of consumer and anti-consumer form yet another perfect media sideshow / distraction .
Let 's follow the guy who refuses to buy anything from China - - ha , look at him struggle -- and then ooh and awe at the latest excesses in glopbal consumption ( today , Bahrain 's wild skyscrapers !
They are so cool ! )
Since the Olympics are a mere month or so away , let 's consider an athletic metaphor .
China expert / scholar Andrew J. Nathan penned this overview of the upcoming Beijing Olympics for The New Republic by drawing upon a half - dozen books which have been written about the subject : Medals And Rights :
What the Olympics reveal , and conceal , about China Here is one important idea Nathan extracted from Beijing 's Games : What the Olympics Mean to China by Susan Brownell : What Susan Brownell calls Chinese " body culture " -- ideas of health and how to get it -- revolves around notions such as " vital breath . "
These concepts inform such Chinese disciplines as qigong ( chi gung ) ( slow - movement exercises ) and wushu ( martial arts ) ( gung fu ) , both of which she says are more about shaping the subjective experience of the body than about training the body for competition .
The Chinese state does not invest much in facilities for everyday fitness .
Most urbanites " cultivate their life force " ( yangsheng ) through traditional arts -- tai chi , walking , keeping birds , and writing calligraphy in water on the pavement -- that can be practised for free in parks and other public spaces .
The contrast of traditional body culture with the Chinese government 's drive / need to " win the most gold medals " could not be starker .
Once again we see how the desire for abundance -- all those gold medals and the global standing they will burnish -- flows from insecurity / deprivation -- an ugly , unquenchable hole in the national soul .
I purposely mentioned wushu / martial arts because there has long been a debate within the many martial arts traditions and schools ( there is even a form of Tai Chi called " combat Tai Chi Chuan " ) about the value or artifice of competition .
Now as a practitioner of a martial art ( merely intermediate , a beginner in every sense ) , I can assure you no one person will win or lose a competition or fight based on the school they represent .
The talented individual with innate skills honed by relentless internal and external training and years of sparring practice will likely win any competition , regardless of the school or specific tradition they initally learned .
Some in the Chinese martial arts community are pressing for wushu to be accepted as Olympic sports ; others are more reticient or even outright opposed .
will Chinese martial arts show in Beijing olympics ?
The Japanese may have managed to have judo enshrined as an Olympic sport and the South Koreans also succeeded in getting taekwondo , Korea 's own brand of martial art , adopted .
But the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) has turned a deaf ear to the more recent appeals on behalf of wushu .
" Wushu has not been included as an official sport at the Olympics but I hope that after the Games we can make the sport better known to all the people of the world , " said Jiao Ruiping , aged 16 , who has been learning wushu since she was nine .
Those who believe kung fu is not about competition are led by the revered Shaolin Temple : Shaolin monks not to attend Olympic kung fu competition : " Performance in Chinese martial arts can be quantified but Shaolin wushu can not be measured in that way as it contains Buddhist elements and showcases a harmonious combination of Buddhism and kung fu , " Qian said .
" In ancient times , people practiced Shaolin wushu to resist outsiders , not for competitive purposes .
" Shaolin Wushu , as a cultural heritage , cannot be equal to competitive sports .
They are two completely different concepts .
They are all monks at Shaolin Temple , we cannot send them to take part in competitions . "
In other words , Wushu is fundamentally about self - cultivation and self - defense , not competition .
From this view , competition is diametrically opposed to Shaolin Wushu and all that it embodies and represents .
All integrated martial arts are based on body meridians , pressure points , and flows of energy ( chi ) - - the principles not just of self - defense but of Chinese medicine , which in the Indian tradition is known as Ayurvedic .
Internal development -- mental concentration , the channeling of internal energy , etc.-- are core ideals and practices in fully realized martial arts .
Martial arts , properly understood , are all about health and self - cultivation .
( Yes , you can kick a heavy bag all day long , but that 's like shooting free throws all day and then reckoning you know how to play basketball .
I like competition and spent years practicing for games in which points decide a win / loss .
But competition is not about health , self - actualization or even physical fitness ; it 's about winning , as every hack coach in America can tell you ad nauseum .
I beg to differ , but that 's another entry . )
So believing that a nation 's character and standing depend on how many gold medals its competitors win is very much the same as the consumerist dream of happiness blossoming from yet another purchase / acquisition .
From the point of traditional Wushu , the competition itself -- like consumerism -- misses the entire point .
It 's not at all about winning and losing , or how many possessions you own or do n't own .
It is an Olympic irony that we do not need to travel to Alpha Centuri for a perspective freed from the shackles of consumerism ; we need only look beneath the deprived , anxious - for - glory consumerist veneer of the Beijing Olympics to find just such an " alien " point of view right in Chinese culture : Shaolin Wushu , the true glory of China .

Some sad news , folks .
Lesbian rights activist Del Martin -- who married her wife Phyllis Lyon at City Hall this past June on the first day that same - sex couples gained the right -- died this morning at a San Francisco hospital .
She as 87 .
( Read more about her legacy and recent passing here . )
Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon , if you recall , were the first queer couple to get married at City Hall .
Mayor Gavin Newsom officiated the ceremony .
Martin founded the Daughters of Bilitis , the country 's first lesbian advocacy group , back in 1955 .
1955 , people !
( Oh , and one way to honor Martin 's tireless work and lasting activism would be to Stop8.org to find out how you too can stop the ban on same - sex marriage . )
Image : Del and Phyllis back then .
Rovelli says traders are watching whether the Dow can eclipse its high last week in the 11,500 range before the end - of - week selloff took pace .
But he still sees the market moving with a bear psychology , making it a tricky time for investors .
" If you were to jump in right now , you 're crazy , " he says .
" On the same front , if you 're 35 , 40 , 45 years old and if you do your research and you buy like a Wells Fargo or a Merrill and it's going to survive , it could be the opportunity of a lifetime .
Take small little nibbles . "
To be sure , few expect the market to take a straight line higher , despite a pervading belief that strong second - quarter earnings could help form the long - sought bottom .
" If you 're a stock market investor you 've got to realize that volatility is part of the game and right now we 're in one of those volatile periods , " says Nadav Baum , managing director of investments at BPU Investment Management in Pittsburgh .
" Long - term investors , the Warren Buffets of the world , they love times like these .
They 're licking their chops .
The reality is the short - term does not make the markets .
Markets are made in five years or 10 years . "
In the meantime , until some news come out that the economy has stabilized and that financials and real estate are back on steady footing , trading will continue to be choppy .
" We need some good economic news to give us a bottom here and we just have n't been receiving it , " Bill Seidman , of RWB Capital Management , said on CNBC .
" There 's nothing you can look at that 's very encouraging at the moment , and I do n't think we 'll get a bottom until we see some good news from the economy . "
An Opportunity , Albeit Brief
Bear market rallies can offer opportunities for investors to recover losses , a strategy Boyle is advocating for her clients .
Boyle is calling for a 900 - point surge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor 's 500 to climb more than 100 points and hit 1,340 before the rally loses steam .
After that , she sees a pullback that will cause havoc for anyone who thinks the short bursts this week are signs that the market has crossed a threshold and is heading back up for the long term .
" If you really panicked in June and July use this opportunity to add some hedges , add some puts or get out of the things that you made a lot of money in last year and sell a little , " she says .
" The stocks leading this rally are going to be the ones that are most beaten up , so you 're getting this run in financials .
That 's not going to last .
The underlying fundamentals have not changed enough . "
In fact , Boyle says things may get so bad economically that we may run into a full - scale depression as banks continue to fail and consumer spending dries up .
Yet in the short term , Boyle says her firm dumped all its short positions earlier this week and has bought exchange - traded funds that benefit from moves up in industrials and emerging markets , including China .
Boyle bought Ultra Industrials ProShares , which is weighted towards bluechips with a 39 percent concentration in CNBC.com - parent General Electric and delivers twice the return of its components .
Boyle also says she is looking at Ultra RealEstate ProShares , which also is a double fund and is gauged on the Dow US Real Estate Index , which was 1.4 percent higher in afternoon trading Thursday .
Boyle believes the upsurge in volatility is what 's presenting an opportunity now .
The Chicago Board Options Exchange 's Volatility Index moved lower Thursday and was still considerably below panic levels .
" That 's what you 're looking for .
You did n't have that fear , you did n't have that high anxiety in the marketplace , " she says .
" We 're looking for a very short rally .
We 're looking for the first week in August for this to be over . "
Others feel the same , with the problems in banks weighing most on people 's minds .
While the bank earnings have been better than estimates -- 13 of 20 banks in the S&P so far have beaten the Street -- they 've largely been measured against lowered expectations .
" There are going to be ( bank ) casualties with this , we all know that , " says Baum , who sees the market trading in a range for the rest of the year .
" As that happens , as people get more confidence that they 're getting a clearer picture of what 's going on , that 's what 's going to drive the market back up . "
" I do n't think we 're out of the woods yet , but this is really good for the confidence of the market , " he adds .
" We probably do n't really bust out of this thing until the first quarter of next year , and that 's probably optimistic . "
In 2006 , Bay Area hip - hop was about to dominate the music industry .
People across the country were " going dumb " to E - 40 and Keak Da Sneak 's chart - topping " Tell Me When to Go . " Mistah F.A.B. and the Pack were becoming household names .
The hyphy movement - the Bay Area 's unique brand of party music - was moving at full force .
Inevitably , copycats sprouted , using hyphy as a gimmick to attract listeners .
Soon , the music got repetitive and , with less airtime for hyphy artists on local radio stations , the media attention vanished .
The Bay Area music scene took a major hit .
With hyphy drifting out of the national spotlight ( for now ) , the Bay Area 's independent artists are stepping up .
Enter Machete Vox , a new San Francisco record label poised to return the Bay Area to prominence in the post - hyphy world .
Founded by veteran San Francisco rapper / producer Boac and producer Dnae Beats , the record label has evolved into a small collective of artists who emphasize creative expression rather than following commercial trends .
Their label sampler , " Sneak Preview , " available today on iTunes and at select retailers , will give listeners a taste of their sound : raw yet refined , full of obscure samples , synths and tight drums for that signature Bay Area slap , paired with battle - rap bravado and thoughtful , creative sensibilities .
" Throw in some intangible extra special something that you can't put your finger on , " Boac says , and what you have is Machete Vox .
" You can't really explain what it is .
We 're just better . "
Boac is n't being cocky , either .
Holding a high standard for quality musicianship , he and Dnae were very selective when choosing their starting lineup , which includes Conceit , winner of last year 's YouTube
On the Rise Rap Edition , a national competition in which the winner gets a chance to record a single with G - Unit / Interscope , among other prizes ; and Z - Man , whose group One Block Radius recently inked a deal with Mercury / Island Def Jam .
Together , Machete Vox just might put San Francisco hip -hop on the national radar again , doing what acclaimed indie labels Stones Throw and Definitive Jux have done for L.A. and New York 's respective underground scenes .
Here 's a rundown of the artists signed for Machete Vox 's stable .
Boac
Affiliations : Machete Vox , the Earthlings
In the crates : " Modern Originalus " ( 1998 ) , " Thought Bubbles " EP ( 2001 ) , " Plot Will Twist " ( 2006 )
Look out for : an untitled solo LP and " Year of the Hustle " by Million Bucks ( Conceit and Boac )
San Francisco native Boac has paid nearly two decades worth of dues in the local music scene .
Instead of being jaded by his years grinding on the local circuit , he continues to be inspired .
" It 's the only continuity in my life .
Everything else could go to hell , but I still get excited about music , " says the charismatic rapper and producer , who conceived the label in 2005 before partnering with Dnae .
Boac 's name is a loose acronym for Banging Out All Classics , and he 's been doing just that ever since dropping his mythic " Modern Originalus " in 1998 .
Though making money is crucial - " I can live without the jewelry , but can't be broke , " he quips on " I Need Money " - he remains wary of the changes within the business .
" We have no illusions of the industry and the old business model , or the unknown territory that we 're stepping into with the digital age , " says a self - aware Boac .
" The reality of it is , we 're not going to be selling music , we 're going to be giving away free dope music .
Just come to the shows and buy a shirt . "
Conceit
Affiliations : Machete Vox , Gurp City , Hardly Celebs
In the crates : " Wasted Talent " ( 2006 )
Look out for : " Last of the Scohicans "
It was a year ago that Conceit won YouTube 's One the Rise Rap Edition video contest , scoring him gear from Guitar Center , a New Year 's Eve performance for YouTube at New York 's Highline Ballroom , and the chance to record a single for G - Unit / Interscope Records .
It took a few months before he finally made it into a New York studio to work with Interscope producers .
Unsurprisingly , they wanted something with more pop appeal than Conceit 's battle banter and commentary .
Refusing to budge , he stayed true to himself instead of dumbing down and churning out a club track , which is why the ultimate fate of the record is still in question .
But that does n't faze the calm , affable and focused Conceit .
He 's currently working hard to put the finishing touches on his Machete Vox debut , " Last of the Scohicans , " produced exclusively by Boac and Dnae .
Dnae Beats
Affiliations : Machete Vox
In the crates : " Eternal Autumn " ( 2005 ) , " The First Hundred Is the Hardest " ( 2007 )
Look out for : " Escape 2 Mars " with Gift of Gab of Blackalicious
The panoramic view of the city from Dnae 's cozy Alamo Square apartment serves as his muse .
Day and night , he stays in his studio , pushing buttons , stroking keys , twisting knobs and sampling records from his vault of vinyl .
His versatile production stretches from soulful to futuristic , with touches of smoky dub .
Dnae 's beats have been enhanced by contributions from performers such as such as Pigeon John , Mr. Lif and Psalm One .
Previously signed to a New York record label , he recorded a compilation that never got released .
Now , he 's decided to put his career in his own hands .
" If you 're gonna do it best , you do it yourself , " Dnae says .
He salvaged some of the recordings for his 2007 compilation , " The First Hundred Is the Hardest . "
As he creates " blappers " ( " beats that bang " ) for Machete Vox , he also remains active outside of the camp , most notably producing an entire album for Gift of Gab , from the heralded Oakland duo Blackalicious .
While it wo n't be released on Machete Vox , any exposure is good exposure for the label .
" I always rep Vox , " Dnae says .
Z-Man
Affiliations : Machete Vox , Gurp City , One Block Radius
In the crates : " Dope or Dog Food " ( 2004 ) , " Do n't Forget to Brag " ( 2005 ) , " Long Story Short " with One Block Radius ( 2005 )
Look out for : his upcoming Machete Vox debut , " Six Pack of Dynamite "
Z - Man 's alt - pop outfit One Block Radius recently signed a deal with Mercury / Island Def Jam .
Their new single , " You Got Me , " is already buzzing on mainstream radio stations across the country , so do n't be surprised when you see the self - proclaimed " Crumb of the Bay " on TV .
But those already familiar with Z - Man know that One Block Radius shows a tamer side of the San Francisco indie rap cult hero , whose 4 - track tapes and Gingerbread Man alter ego ( a doped - up , thugged - out , gun-toting cookie ) helped land a one album deal with Oakland collective Hieroglyphics in 2004 for his " Dope or Dog Food . "
" It 's a whole different game with this mainstream s- , " says Z - Man , who 's currently on a national promo tour for One Block Radius .
" It 's pretty surreal .
I 'm still kinda like , ' I do n't think so ... really ? ' "
Despite the recent brush with fame , he asserts , " The underground s- is my heart and soul . "
While One Block Radius is decidedly pop , Z - Man as a solo artist is grimy , crazy , comedic and as animated as his artwork ( he drew the cover for " Sneak Preview " ) .
His work is not exactly radio friendly , and probably best kept out of your child 's earshot .
Look out for " Six Pack of Dynamite , " tentatively scheduled for a January release on Machete Vox .
" Sneak Preview " release party : 10 p.m. Friday , Elbo Room , 647 Valencia St. Hosted by Gift of Gab ( of Blackalicious ) .
Performances by : Million Bucks ( Boac and Conceit ) , Psalm One ( Rhymesayers ) , Dnae Beats .
DJs : Aron , B. Cause , Strategy ; $ 5 before 11 p.m. , $ 10 after .
For tickets , call ( 415 ) 552-7788 ; tickets available day of show only .

RIYADH / DUBAI ( Reuters ) - Leading exporter Saudi Arabia has summoned consumer nations and fellow producers to an urgently convened meeting to thrash out a solution to oil prices it says are unjustifiably high .
Oil derricks are silhouetted against the rising sun at an oilfield in the capital Baku October 16 , 2005 .

Producers and consumers have long blamed each other , but the Saudi cabinet , chaired by King Abdullah , issued instructions to bring them together after oil rose by an unprecedented $ 16 a barrel over a little more than 24 hours to more than $ 139 .
Representatives of the two sides met in April in Rome , where they failed to even agree the price was too high , although it was then around $ 20 below current levels .
The oil exporters say supplies are adequate and are not the cause of high prices .
They too do not want to see fuel costs hurting the economy .
They also say a massive flow of investment funds , which has helped to drive oil and other commodities higher , should be tamed .
“ The kingdom is genuinely concerned and wants as many stakeholders as possible to get involved and make some serious proposals for regulating speculation , ” an industry source said .
Investment banks Goldman Sachs GS.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N would be invited to attend the meeting on June 22 , OPEC Secretary General Abdullah al - Badri said on Tuesday .
Banks such as Goldman and Morgan are prominent among those saying oil market fundamentals are a key factor in rising prices , sending a bullish message to the oil market .
Goldman raised its oil price forecast in May , the very day that Saudi Arabia said it would raise supply .
The Goldman forecast drowned out the Saudi signal to the market and pushed the price to what was then a record .
It could take more than a meeting in the Red Sea city of Jeddah to convince investment banks that fundamentals are not bullish .
Investors , who buy into the oil market for the long term , are betting supply will struggle to meet demand for years into the future .
They have never admitted their activity has artificially inflated the price .
Consumer governments , wary of unpopularity at home and trying to contain protests over rising prices , are also reluctant to shift their views .
U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman , who will attend the meeting , said on Wednesday the world ’s largest consumer has a difference of opinion with Riyadh over high oil prices .
“ The issue is we have a difference of opinion , ” Bodman said .
“ The reason we ’re looking at these very high prices for oil is strictly supply and demand . ”
World 's Largest Wind Farm Planned In Oregon
July 29th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
The Portland Business Journal reports that Oregon has just been given the go - ahead by The Oregon Energy Facility Siting Council to build a 909 MW wind farm in the north - central part of the state .
That ’s enough energy to power 200,000 homes .
The Shepherd ’s Flat Wind Farm will contain 303 wind turbines and will double the state ’s wind - generating capacity .
It will boost the local economy by creating 250 to 300 new jobs , and lease payments to landowners will supplement farm incomes .
However , the farm does face one challenge : Northwest power agencies claim to only be able to handle 1500 more megawatts of wind power on the grid .
With new renewable energy projects popping up all over the place , it might be time to start thinking about some serious solutions to this problem .
If all goes according to plan , the Oregonian wind farm — scheduled to be in operation by 2010 — will ultimately be overtaken in capacity by T. Boone Pickens ’ 4000 MW
Texas wind farm , which should be completed by 2014 .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Nine U.S. soldiers were killed in fighting in Afghanistan which also claimed the lives of “ dozens ” of Taliban insurgents , a NATO official said on Sunday .
“ It was in Kunar province , it was during an all - day engagement , ” the official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said of fighting in eastern Afghanistan bordering Pakistan .
The official said eight of the nine were with the NATO - led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) and the other soldier was under the command of a separate U.S. - led force .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Stocks rallied more than 2 percent on Wednesday , powered by the best day for banks in 16 years as unexpectedly strong results from Wells Fargo &
Co relieved worry about a credit crisis spiraling out of control .
Trading specialists work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange , July 16 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Chip East
A $ 4 drop in oil prices gave more fuel to the rally , offsetting an early report that showed U.S. consumer prices in June rose by the most since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in September 2005 .
Investors poured into bank stocks , driving Wells Fargo up 32.8 percent , while shares of rivals like Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp jumped 13 percent or more .
Wells Fargo , the fifth - largest U.S. bank and a big mortgage lender , also raised its dividend at a time when competitors are cutting them .
That allayed some concerns about financial companies just days after IndyMac collapsed in one of the biggest bank failures in U.S. history .
Shares of mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which had lost over 60 percent of their value since the beginning of the month , were also swept up in the broad financial rally , surging 30 percent or more .
Both companies got a lift from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke ’s remarks that they are “ in no danger of failing . ”
“ Oil prices came down $ 4 a barrel and financials went up , particularly on the Wells Fargo news .
One popular trade was to short financials and long energy and that trade got killed today , ” said Brian Gendreau , an investment strategist in New York for ING Investment Management Americas , which recently went “ neutral ” on U.S. stocks .
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 276.74 points , or 2.52 percent , to 11,239.28 , while the Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index gained 30.45 points , or 2.51 percent , to 1,245.36 .
The Nasdaq Composite Index shot up 69.14 points , or 3.12 percent , to 2,284.85 .
The three indexes had their largest single - day percentage gain since April 1 and the KBW bank index soared 17.27 percent , its largest one - day percentage gain since it began tracking in May 1992 .
ALTERA CLIMBS , eBAY FALLS LATE
Further boosting the Nasdaq were shares of Altera Corp , which jumped 12.1 percent to $ 21.54 on news the chip maker ’s second - quarter revenue rose more than analysts expected .
But technology shares may be under pressure on Thursday , after online auctioneer eBay Inc forecast a weak third quarter , sending its shares down about 7 percent to $ 26.20 in after - hours trade .
On the Nasdaq , eBay had closed at $ 28.10 , up 4.5 percent .
U.S. crude prices for August delivery fell $ 4.14 to settle at $ 134.60 per barrel , a slump of over $ 10 since Monday ’s close , hurting shares of energy companies such as Chevron , down 3.4 percent at $ 86.39 , and Exxon Mobil , down 1.7 percent at $ 80.81 .
Lower oil prices boosted the airline sector , however , pushing the airline stock index up 18.1 percent .
Shares of retailers also gained because any reduction in energy costs would ease the strain on consumers , who have been struggling with high gasoline prices .
The S&P retail index leaped 5.5 percent .
On the Nasdaq , shares of Internet retailer Amazon.com climbed 7.2 percent to $ 71.84 .
A Dow Jones index of home builders ’ shares popped up 10.3 percent , its biggest advance in four months .
Trading volume was fairly active on the New York Stock Exchange , with about 1.73 billion shares changing hands , below last year ’s estimated daily average of roughly 1.90 billion .
On Nasdaq , about 2.44 billion shares traded , above last year ’s daily average of 2.17 billion .
Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by about 3 to 1 on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq .
Ohio battles over payday loan interest rate cap Nick Langewis
Published : Sunday August 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Ohio , having dealt a blow to its payday loan industry by enacting a usury law , is teeming with charges of deceit in a petition drive to reverse the law .
HB 545 was signed in June by Governor Ted Strickland , and will go into effect in early September .
Under the law , the APR for a payday loan will be capped at 28 % , and an Ohioan would be limited to four loans per year .
Opponents of the legislation argued that outlawing such small , short - term loans , with an APR of up to 391 % , will eliminate 6,000 jobs in Ohio and force as many as 1,500 statewide store locations to close .
Lynn DeVault , president of the Community Financial Services Association , issued a statement saying that lawmakers " [ turned ] their backs on their constituents and [ played ] politics . "
" It is a sad day , " she wrote , " when the opinions of editorial writers and so - called consumer groups count for more than the opinions of the people responsible for putting lawmakers in office . "
Petitions to reverse HB 545 are currently circulating .
An Ohio Public Radio program airing August 12 exposed signature collectors who were incorrectly representing the petition as one that would lower the interest rate cap further .
Residents of a Butler County homeless shelter also alleged that they were offered money for their signatures .
Payday loans are a debt trap , charges advocacy organization END 391 , which notes that 90 % of revenues from payday loans are from repeat borrowers , and about 50 % of repeat loans are initiated on the same day a previous loan is paid off .
Americans spend $ 4.2 billion in payday lending fees per year .
240,365 signatures must be collected and submitted to the Ohio Secretary of State in order to place the repeal , dubbed Issue 5 , on November 's ballot .
Ohioans who believe they were misled into signing the petition can call 614-477-5042 to have their signature removed .
The following is my opinion as a member participating in this discussion .
As an ATS Staff Member , I will not moderate in threads such as this where I have participated as a member .
Yeah , no surprises here .
They do n't call it cable PROGRAMMING for nothing , yaknow ?
Not to dismiss the allegations or infer they do n't matter , just that it 's kind of a given from where I sit .
I do n't watch the TV news , have n't watched it since 9/11/01 ( that I can recall ) ...
Mike Erickson is a Republican running for Congress on a pro-life platform so it probably wo n't surprise you that he 's paid for an abortion in his day .
Or that she did n't really want to do it but he sort of made her , or that he did n't go to the clinic and left her bawling in the parking lot , or that he lied about it all later … etc. , etc .
The one interesting detail is that the Oregon Right To Life committee , which investigated the rumors back in 2006 , called him out on changing his story .
Read executive director Gayle Atteberry 's letter denouncing Erickson by clicking douchebag 's face .
Note how she manages to muster a sense of shock at a pro-life politician 's hypocrisy that somehow eludes us !

Imagine checking the " Music " box when signing up with your ISP , paying $ 5 extra per month , and having access to all the legitimate music downloads you could ever want ?
Five years ago , the concept would have been unthinkable .
But if new efforts backed by Warner Music come to fruition , we could be doing just that within a few years .
Warner Music Group has asked recording industry veteran Jim Griffin to come up with a plan that would distribute royalty fees to copyright holders from a pool of user fees , according to an exclusive report at Portfolio.com .
Griffin has reportedly been given a three - year contract to create an organization and flesh out the logistics of the innovative plan .
" Today , it has become purely voluntary to pay for music , " Griffin told Portfolio .
Instead of having to buy a CD when we want to hear our favorite artists , the general public now usually buys online or just finds it for free somewhere — a behavior that has taken the wind out of the music industry to the tune of $ 5 billion over the last decade .
Griffin knows this , saying that the record labels are now relying on consumers ' willingness to drop money into " a big tip jar . "
He believes that the new plan could help breathe new life into music and still make consumers happy .
Instead of suing handfuls of file - sharers , Griffin and Warner Music believe that the industry should be putting its time and effort into attempting to monetize P2P activity .
The idea that music is a product that can be purchased and stolen needs to fall to the wayside , according to Griffin , saying that the industry needs to embrace the idea that music can be provided as a service .
Such a service could generate up to $ 20 billion to be distributed to artists — about $ 20 billion more than what the industry is getting now for files shared over P2P .
Eventually , the system could become partially ( or entirely ) ad - supported , making legal music free for customers who do n't mind ads .
Not everyone is in love with the plan , though .
Aside from the obvious fear from the rest of the music industry that comes from being told it needs to change its entire revenue model , the most common criticism is that it may require all Internet users to pay the fee in order to subsidize the music pool — regardless of whether you intend to dip your toe in the pool yourself .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation is among the proponents of a model that involves voluntary licensing ( allowing interested users to opt - in ) ; others believe participation must be mandatory for such a model to work .
Griffin 's musings may not amount to much of anything , but the fact that Warner and Griffin are floating trial balloons is another indication that the record industry has begun thinking outside the small box it has inhabited for so long .
0:36 Intro . Trip to Chile , markets and incentives .
Snowing in the mountains of Santiago .
Traffic 's pretty bad .
What should we do through contracts and markets and what should we do through the public sector ?
Santiago is actually a little east of Washington , D.C. , in the eastern time zone .
Chile 's been a laboratory for privatization .
U. of Chicago trained some Chilean economists in the 1960s and 1970s , professors today .
Center - left coalition today has accepted a lot of the pro-market reforms , but have they bought into them or are they just waiting ?
Chile used to have an almost private mass transit system .
In 1975 , built a subway , metro system , one of the biggest in Latin America .
Santiago not quite as dense as NYC but close .
On the surface , had a private bus system .
No public subsidies , but system operated in the black .
Consertacion [ Consertacion Nacional Democratica , political party ] looked at that and saw profits .
Took a system that was $ 60 million per year in the black ; now it loses 10 times more than it was making .
How many passengers ?
Ridership has gone slightly down .
Could argue that they were catering to mostly the rich , and by publicizing they would serve a larger audience .
There had been different classes of service - - now everybody has the same class of service .
Commute times tripled , which is why people stopped using mass transit .
Now people use cars .
People did n't move out or stop working ; they are driving cars on crowded streets .
Key difference in the routes : used to be redudancy in the system .
Always possible to get to work on time , and low variance .
Now up to 2 hours but it may take 4 hours .
8:36 Incentives that the bus drivers themselves face .
Natural experiment in the use of incentives .
Before they were paid by the number of drivers they could pick up .
Looked like the Chariot race in Ben Hur .
Problem with the old system .
Accidents , a few fatalities , usually only wounded people .
Concertacion and President Bachelet saw both profits and drivers ' greed as dual problems .
Human transubstantiation .
Pay is now not by passengers but by arriving on time .
No incentive to pick up passengers if they are running after the bus ; but also no incentive to stop if he 's running late .
Widely verified ; Chilean listeners invited to write in .
People respond to incentives not just in markets but in any setting they find themselves in .
Mistake that the government of Chile made was they thought the problem is : in a market people are greedy , so let 's take them out of the market .
Paying drivers by schedule meant at a minimum they were n't going to go out of their way to pick passengers up .
Also , changed style of buses .
Buses used to be nimble ; some old , belched black smoke .
Government bought new buses , 4 or 5 times as long , articulated , bends in the middle , bendy bus .
Four doors , only front door goes in to the driver to pay him .
Driver does n't get paid by how many pay him , but only by time .
People scampered in the back doors ; driver could n't spend time going to the back to insist that they pay .
Drivers routinely watch people get in the back doors .
100 - foot long buses .
St. Louis , light rail system , fad , too expensive to build a subway , packed for Cardinals games but empty during the middle of the day , between 9 and 4 .
The buses in Chile seem to be packed all the time ; not nearly enough bus stops .
6 million people in urban Santiago , bus is losing $ 100 / per person per year , for the privilege of not riding the bus .
President has said " We owe the people of Santiago an apology , particularly the poor people . "
A lot of people actually lost their jobs .
But less inequality , so happier .
18:29 Return to technical details .
Map of the routes .
Used to be the bus routes and the metro routes from where people live to where they work and were parallel .
Cost per passenger for buses is still about ¼ of the cost per passenger for the metro .
What the city did was eliminate almost all the bus routes that parallel the metro .
Wait for bus ; get off bus ; wait for metro , which is crowded and might have to wait ; then get off the metro and get on a bus with more waiting .
Instead of looking at what people wanted , say as evidenced by what the map had evolved to look like , they drew it as what they thought it should look like from a planning perspective .
Metro could not be more full but it still loses money .
Could raise fares ; could raise time .
Also , new big bendy buses are six or eight inches wider than the lanes of Santiago .
So accidents still happen often .
Chile is not corrupt .
It just seemed more rational -- could put more people on them ; wait longer and have fewer buses .
How many private companies before ?
3000 .
Probably some were small companies .
Proportion of ridership from large companies ?
Probably mostly from a few largest companies .
4.8 million are from areas around Santiago areas .
Express buses without stopping even with amenities like food and coffee ; plus local buses that stopped at every corner .
24:49 Political economy .
Private system that existed before had some visible negatives .
Too many buses , inefficiencies .
Political attractiveness to " publicize , " " nationalize , " " citicize " the system .
Against the law now to own a private bus service .
Maybe the system now actually does work - - fed bad info .
Why does n't government return to the former system ?
Markets provide two things : information , and the incentive to do things in a particular way rather than some other way .
Hard now for planners to go back , to know where to put routes now .
Think what we need now is a reform .
Unless you think of the market alternative you endlessly reform .
Greed and profit .
At least the current system solves that .
Harper 's Magazine ask readers to coin words .
Everybody responds to incentives , including politicians .
Puzzle : you 've done something really dumb and people are mad about it .
Go to unclog the sink drain .
Take stopper out , etc. , but forget to reattach the pipe .
Floods vanity below the sink .
Usually easy to put it back the way it was .
What politics seems to do is to leave it disconnected .
Different mental model : suppose you think water flows different ways because of different systems .
Could think :
This is public water and it will go where it should go .
Even if you left it disconnected and lined it up just right it might mostly drain .
Ethanol problem : corn prices have gone up .
A lot of people say that 's a mistake ; but it 's not repealed yet .
The people who are making money from it do n't want to repeal it .
Bad policy might persist because people get emotionally attached or because the people who have benefited from the new regime are resistant in ways that would n't have existed in the old regime .
Pareto superior policy : no one is better off from the new bus system in Chile .
Volvo , the bus maker , is helped but not really a stake holder .
Public choice approach , look at interest groups .
The people in the government sincerely want to improve their society .
35:32 Are there any voices to go back to the old system ?
No .
It would be political suicide .
But why ?
Voters are tormented by the current system .
Take the former Soviet Union , 1917 revolution , at the time greeted as a great success .
" I 've seen the future and it works . "
But it did n't work .
Could n't feed their people , bad weather for 70 years , poor incentives for their farmers .
Suppose for the moment that some would have agreed that the system was horrible .
System was corrupt , and they saw that and were aware of it .
Causation wrong , thought corruption caused the difficulties rather than the system causing the corruption .
But Chile is a democracy .
Why ca n't a politician say " I have one issue : I 'm going to go back to the bus system when it worked well " ?
Why would n't that strategy win ?
How many cities in the U.S. have private bus systems .
But that 's different -- Chile 's had the experience .
They do n't think of the old system as being private .
They think of it as the old system .
Ude , Chicago School based party in Chile , does promote return to the private system .
Possible that the average citizen would just like the new system to improve .
Bastiat : The State : each of us can ride at the expense of all of us .
[ " The state is the great fictitious entity by which everyone seeks to live at the expense of everyone else . " -- Bastiat ] Curb Rights , Dan Klein , about taxis more than buses , distinction gets blurred when talking about multiple people .
Bus systems have almost no riders .
Why do n't we allow private buses ?
Pat answer : People do n't have the experience .
Mental models .

Senator McCain is doing everything in his power right now to resurrect the Cold War with Russia as a campaign issue .
With Russia ’s invasion of Georgia , McCain now has the “ double bubble ” benefits of two war fronts in the same region — with the Muslim nations of Iraq and Iran in one category and with Russia in the second .
International relations have once again become a major challenge to the presidency , so only a candidate experienced in hard - ball diplomacy should be elected to the highest office in the land — or so his argument goes .
However , McCain himself has serious difficulties in his grasp of foreign relations –forgetful that Iraq and Afghanistan do not share a boundary but are separated by is the entire nation of Iran , unaware that Shiite Iranians are n’t particularly friendly with Sunni al Qaeda , etc .
All that Obama needs to neutralize McCain ’s claims to superior experience in foreign policy would be to nominate Senator Biden as his Vice President , somebody who both supercedes McCain in the Senate ’s foreign policy establishment and effectively avoids the numerous lapses in both memory and foreign policy knowledge that McCain repeatedly displays .
Nevertheless , the image of McCain ’s steely aspect as he exhorts America to man the barricades against yet another threat against our nation ’s cherished freedom has great appeal among low - information voters , and his effort should be confronted with the facts .
For example , it should be clarified that the current Georgia debacle has resulted not from a Russian invasion of Georgia , but from Georgia ’s surprise attack on South Ossetia ( at the time occupied by 9,000 Russian peacekeepers described as such by all parties involved ) [ see the 8 - 18 NYT Schwirtz article , p. A10 ] .
This was followed by a massive counterattack by Russian troops who went on to occupy additional portions of greater Georgia that they seem unwilling to leave for the present .
The NYT and other U.S. publications have ignored the actual timing of these two invasions as much as possible , undoubtedly , whether they realize it or not , to obscure the responsibility of Georgia for launching an attack that produced such a devastating counterattack .
Amazingly , there has been no specific reference to this sequence of events in the NYT to clarify the fact that Georgia ’s attack began in the evening of August 6 .
Readers are led to think that the two attacks were somehow concurrent , with the bigger Russian army obviously taking advantage of its size .
However , a close examination of the press reports from the region over the two days during which the attack occurred suggests otherwise .
An Aug. 6 UPI report dated 1:17 P.M. makes no mention of warfare beyond an escalation the previous weekend when Georgian forces shelled Tskhinvali , killing six South Ossetians .
Emphasized , however , is the optimistic announcement that a top Georgian government official has said his country would hold direct talks on August 7 with South Ossetian leaders “ within the context of Russian peacekeeping efforts in the region , known as the Joint Control Commission . ”
An Aug. 7 Voice of America
News report cited the confirmation by Russian officials that talks between Georgians and South Ossetian separatists would be held , but on Friday , August 8 , and it reported that Georgian President Saakashvili called for an immediate ceasefire .
The report also mentioned the offer of Saakashvili to give the separatists full autonomy within Georgia with Russia helping to guarantee that status .
Also , the report indicates the U.S. called for both Russian and Georgian officials to halt the violence and begin talks .
South Ossetian were cited for having insisted on their struggle to gain independence from Georgia since the 1990s , and Georgians were cited as having accused the [ Russian ] peacekeepers of backing and aiding the separatists .
An Aug. 7 UPI report suddenly indicated an entirely new and different state of affairs : an attack by Georgian troops on late Thursday ( Aug. 6 ) , that engulfed Tshkhinvali , the capital of South Ossetia .
According to the BBC , “ Georgia began moving troops toward Tshkhinvali a few hours after the South Ossetians agreed to a Russian - mediated cease - fire . ”
“ The storming of Tshkhinvali has started , ” South Ossetian President Eduard Kokoity told the Russian news agency Interfax .
A British newspaper , The Independent , reporting from Moscow , specifically quoted a South Ossetian web site that the “ assault is coming from all directions . ”
Georgian officials tried to excuse themselves with the argument that they were trying to restore legal order .
However , Iakobashvili , Georgia ’s minister for Reintegration , said the government wants “ to finish a criminal regime . ”
Significantly , Russian officials predicted mounting violence and requested an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting .
Russian news agencies indicated that men from Russia and Abkhazia were rushing to join in South Ossetia ’s defense and could n’t be stopped .
These seem to have been individuals rather than organized contingents .
An August 7 AP report indicated that Tskhinvali came under heavy fire early Friday , “ just hours after Georgia ’s president declared a cease fire . ”
The fact that the Thursday UPI report said the attack occurred during the late evening of Aug. 7 while the Thursday AP report said it occurred during the early morning hours the next day suggests the invasion was conducted throughout the night .
If so , this could only have been a surprise attack !
According to the AP report , “ South Ossetia ’s leader accused Georgia of treachery , but the Georgian government claimed its troops were responding to rebel attacks on Georgian villages . ”
It is important to note that 9,000 Russian troops employed as peacekeepers at the same time Georgia seems to have been trying to incorporate South Ossetia into its borders as it had already done with Ajaria in 2004 .
This was an obvious challenge to the Russians , an effort to “ steal ” Ossetia ’s capital in a nighttime blitzkrieg right under the noses of Russian troops .
According to an Aug. 7 Radio Free Europe report cited by the AP report , Eduard Kokoity , the leader of the Russian - backed region , specifically accused Georgian forces of starting the fighting .
“ Russian peacekeepers did everything to make the Georgian side stop firing mortars , grenade launchers , and large - caliber weapons on the city of Tskhinvali , ” Kokoity said .
“ But the firing did n’t cease , and we were forced to return fire .
We will now do our best to suppress this . ”
On the other hand , Temur IIakobashvili , Georgia ’s Reintegration Minister , was reported as having blamed South Ossetia for initiating hostilities : “ They came up with a new method .
They shoot at us from civilian objects , from schools and hospitals , so that in case of return fire that causes damages , they can present it as a barbarian act by the Georgians . ”
What Iakobashvili described , however , would seem a tactic that was in play preceding the sequence of events that happened in the thirty - hour span between Aug. 6 and 7 .
All in all , news reports for these two days ( all of those included in Lexus - Nexis cited here ) indicate no concerted large - scale effort of this sort .
According to a NYT report of August 18 by Helena Cooper , Georgians later claimed separatists of having fired on several Georgian villages , while Russian Defense Ministry and South Ossetian officials said that Georgians provoked this escalation by shelling Russian peacekeeping positions in the region of Tasakhinvali as well as civilian areas .
However , there was no indication of these activities in any of the press reports from South Ossetia on this particular day .
Instead , what seems to have occurred was a feigned agreement to begin negotiations followed almost immediately by a major nighttime surprise attack .
It should also be noted that neither Cooper nor any of the daily reports indicated that an even bigger Russian counterattack was in the works at least until the following day The 9,000 Russian troops in South Ossetia undoubtedly played a major role in mounting this attack , supported by additional troops from North Ossetia as well as air power that totally dominated the skies .
Significantly , Cooper ’s final paragraph in her NYT report illustrates the extreme confusion in the western media about what actually happened during the Georgian invasion .
Cooper seems to have advanced events a full day from what actually happened as explained in all the local reports cited above : According to Cooper , “ Georgians said the separatists shelled them [ Georgian villages ] all day on the 7th , ” so its Foreign Minister Eka Tkeselashvili called the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State , Mr. Fried , to tell him her country was under attack and had to protect its people .
Fried supposedly replied , “ not to go into South Ossetia , ” In a totally inaccurate kicker Cooper laments , “ The Georgians moved in on August 8 . ” Not true .
Everything happened on the night of August 6 - 7 , with Georgians promising negotiations , then launching a surprise attack that apparently lasted the entire night .
The mortar attacks on the 7th mentioned by Tkeselashvili were undoubtedly counterattacks in response to the invasion that had already taken place .
What Saakashvili apparently sought was a fait accompli , a quick , almost instantaneous victory that incorporated South Ossetia into Georgia before the Russians could take the needed steps to prevent it .
Of course Russian troops posed a major threat to the operation , but Saakasvili seems to have felt that the timing was perfect .
Putin ( and indeed the entire world ) was distracted by the Olympics in China , and U.S. and NATO pressure could soon be brought to bear to prevent the major counterattack that would be needed by Russian troops in order to deprive him of his victory .
Condaleeza
Rice might have warned him privately not to launch a major attack , but all her public statements were fully supportive , and his communications with his Washington lobbyist , Randy Schoenemann , McCain ’s top foreign policy advisor , seem to have confirmed his sense that such an attack would succeed if carried out with blitzkrieg precision .
Western Europe ’s cautious leadership of Brown , Merkel and Sarkozy would pose no difficulties , and all the emancipated Soviet states could be counted on for enthusiastic knee - jerk support .
It turns out Saakashvili was wrong .
His only major accomplishment was in having given McCain his warmed - over Cold - War campaign strategy that just might win him the November election .
This would be a world - class disaster , setting the stage for comparable scenarios justified by skewed misinformation in Iran , Pakistan , Venezuela , and god knows how many other countries once McCain gets situated in the White House .
We would have four more years to go .
American citizens were gravely misled into a devastating war in Iraq by the Bush administration ’s incessant use of misinformation .
This should not be allowed to happen again with McCain ’s use of Georgia as a campaign issue .
Watch out , battery - powered MAVs -- your viability could be seriously in danger .
Based on a patent application from University of Florida aerospace engineer Subrata Roy , he 's reckoning that a micro air vehicle could be propelled by plasma .
Scientists have known that passing a current or magnetic field through a conducting fluid generates a force , but exploiting it for use in moving an aircraft has proven futile thus far .
The phenomenon , simply known as magnetohydrodynamics , has typically been tested on larger crafts , but Mr. Roy 's invention would boast a wingspan of less than 15 - centimeters and resemble a flying saucer more so than a 747 .
Of course , this fantastic idea has yet to become much more than just that , but for armed forces and entities obsessed with surveillance , this could undoubtedly be big .
The problem was posed by John McCarthy as follows .
We pick two numbers a and b , so that a>=b and both numbers are within the range [ 2,99 ] .
We give Mr. P the product a*b and give Mr.S the sum a+b .
The following dialog takes place :
Mr.P : I do n't know the numbers
Mr.S : I knew you did n't know .
I do n't know either
Mr.P : Now I know the numbers
Mr.S : Now I know them too
a
b
The following Haskell code demonstrates a generic method of encoding facts , and the knowledge about facts , and the knowledge of the knowledge , etc .
Incidentally , compared to the notation in McCarthy 's paper , the Haskell notation is notably concise .
Chung - chieh Shan commented : `` The basic idea is to think of a set of possible worlds .
Corresponding to each person ( whose knowledge is being modeled ) is a partition of this set of possible worlds ; each partition contains one or more worlds that this person cannot distinguish .
For someone to know a fact is for all of that person 's indistinguishable possible worlds to verify that fact .
For Alice to know that Bob does n't know the weather , is for all of Alice 's possible worlds ( relative to the real world ) to reside within a Bob- partition in which the weather is not consistent across all worlds . ''
The new logo ( left ) being used in some Starbucks outlets has caused offence
US coffee chain Starbucks has come under fire for a new logo that critics say is offensive and overly graphic .
The Resistance , a US - based Christian group , has called for a national boycott of the coffee - selling giant .
It says the chain 's new logo has a naked woman on it with her legs " spread like a prostitute ...
The company might as well call themselves Slutbucks " .
Starbucks says the image - based on a 16th century Norse design of a mermaid with two - tails - is not inappropriate .
Rather , the image is a more conservative version of the original Starbucks design , which hung above the chain 's first store when it opened in Seattle 's Pike Place Market in 1971 .
' Rubenesque '
It says the image - the longstanding logo for Pike Place bags of coffee - is appearing on some of its cups as part of a promotion , and will remain " for several weeks " .
Howard Schultz , who bought Starbucks in 1982 , described the emblem in his memoirs as " bare - breasted and Rubenesque ; [ it ] was supposed to be as seductive as coffee itself " .
Although its share price has plunged in recent years , Starbucks has 16,000 coffee shops in 44 countries worldwide , employing more than 170,000 staff .
The chain has just opened its first outlet in Argentina .
Based in San Diego , the Resistance claims to have more than 3,000 members across the US and has gained a reputation for espousing diverse conspiracy theories
NEW YORK ( AP )  Diamonds in the rough ?
Try a $ 20,000 pair of the glittering gems in a truckload of trash .
A Staten Island jeweler has gotten her 3 - carat diamond earrings back after she , her husband and city sanitation employees sorted through a smelly heap of garbage .
The studs were in a small jar of cleaning solution , which a worker at the couple 's jewelry store had accidentally thrown away .
The earrings were recovered Thursday at the former Fresh Kills landfill , where trash is compacted and shipped out of state .
Owner Haya Sharon is calls the find " a miracle . "
The earrings were an anniversary gift from her husband .

Well , they 're looking to hire some new mercenaries , and they know that they want people with wartime experience .
That means troops .
How do you get on current troops ' good side ?
How about dropping free Xbox 360s with Guitar Hero out of planes for them in Afghanistan ?
Blackwater recruiter James Overton is working on packing a Microsoft Xbox video - game console , modem , TV projector and " Guitar Hero " video game into a kit that can be kicked out of a Blackwater cargo plane and dropped to troops in Afghanistan .

Why not Army of Two , Blackwater ?
Honestly , I do n't even know how to feel about this .
On the one hand , it 's great that the troops will have fun games to play on their down time .
On the other hand , Blackwater is one of the most reprehensible companies on the planet .
What a world .

On Wednesday , the House passed the Intelligence Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2009 ( H.R.5959 ) , which , once reconciled with its Senate counterpart , will travel up Pennsylvania Avenue for the president ’s signature .
It ’s unlikely to get it , though , for the bill has become the latest flash point in the White House ’s ongoing battle to expand executive power .
The bill contains provisions calling for prohibiting detainees from being interrogated by contractors ( like at Abu Ghraib ) ; the establishment of an inspector general of intelligence ; regular reports to Congress on the nuclear weapons programs of Iran , Syria , and North Korea ; and a regular National Intelligence Estimate on Syria ’s WMD programs .
More controversial , though , and more troubling to the White House , it mandates that the president provide members of the House intelligence oversight committee with expanded access to secret information about intelligence activities ( such as classified legal opinions , risk assessments , and cost estimates ) , and requires that the intelligence community brief the committee on all covert actions that were in effect as of April 24 , 2008 .
The bill details a punishment for White House non-compliance : 75 percent of the budget for covert actions will be withheld .
The White House is not pleased by this , and released a document ( .pdf ) on Wednesday morning making clear its objections .
The threat to limit funding for covert operations until congressmen are briefed , the document says , “ is inconsistent with the statute that expressly authorizes limited notice to Congress in exceptional cases and would undermine the fundamental compact between the Congress and the President on reporting highly sensitive intelligence matters — an arrangement that for decades has balanced congressional oversight responsibility with the need to protect intelligence information . ”
As for the demand to up the flow of classified information to congressional oversight committees , the White House says it “ goes beyond any legitimate oversight function ” and simply encourages “ micromanagement of [ Intelligence Community ] activities . ”
If the bill makes it to the president ’s desk with any of these provisions attached , “ senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill . ”
This is not the first time that an intelligence authorization bill has run smack into White House instransigence .
It ’s now been three years since Congress and the White House have been able to reach an accommodation .
Why ?
“ This administration wants maximum authority and maximum discretion , ” says Steve Aftergood , director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists , who blogs at Secrecy News .
“ It lashes out at any semblance of checks and balances . ”
Even if Congress presents few obstacles to the White House having its way .
“ Up until now , oversight has been pretty crappy ! ” says Aftergood .
“ I think that ’s the problem …
Information sharing is indispensable to the oversight process .
If we want congressional oversight , the committees need access to this basic information . ”
Meantime , if Congress , as is expected , yields to pressure from the the White House , as it has done the last three years , the intelligence community need not worry about its budget for undercover operations .
As has become routine , the funding provisions ( minus the new proposals ) will be attached to an unrelated bill and signed into law .
And , once again , the Bush - Cheney White House will have thwarted congressional oversight .
The British Mrs. O'Leary : Thomas Farynor , royal baker to King Charles II of England
His " Cow "  : His oven , which sparked a fire in the middle of the night on September 1 , 1666 .
Oops : Around 2 a.m. , smoke woke up the Farynor family and their servants in the house above the bakery .
Luckily , the entire lot managed to escape — all except for one maid who was too frightened to run and became the fire 's first victim .
The blaze quickly spread , but surprisingly , the conflagration alarmed almost nobody .
People from around the neighborhood crawled out of bed to watch it and , when the mayor of London was brought by later that morning , he declared it small enough that " a woman might piss it out . " 
Yes , that 's a direct quote .
But by mid-afternoon , the time to extinguish the fire in said manner had passed .
Fed by a dry wind and London 's seemingly inexhaustible supply of flammable objects , it burned for five days , wiping out some 13,000 homes and razing 80 percent of the city .
Even after the main blaze died down , small fires remained for months afterwards .
But It Was n't So Bad , Really :
For one thing , the hapless Farynors were never held responsible for the fire .
In the immediate aftermath , most average Londoners were more interested in blaming Catholic extremists from France .
Meanwhile , government authorities were so busy saving random foreigners from impromptu lynch mobs that they had no time to worry about the royal baker .
Amazingly , the Great Fire of 1666 ( as it became known ) did bring about some good — it killed off most of London 's rat and flea populations , thus bringing an end to the Great Plague of 1665 .

A brand - new implementation of the Selectors API has landed in the latest Firefox nightlies ( and in Firefox 3.1 a1 ) – on track to head your way in the upcoming Firefox 3.1 release .
I ’ve talked about this API before ( 1 , 2 ) and while I do have some misgivings about the current API ( which will be remedied in upcoming revisions of the spec ) there is one thing that is undeniable about it :
It is extraordinarily fast .
Thankfully , implementations have n’t scarified specification compatibility for performance and we can see both the Firefox and WebKit implementations coming in at 99.3 % passing the Selectors API test suite .
Opera is working on their implementations , slated for Opera 10 , and Microsoft has an implementation in beta 1 of Internet Explorer 8 .
This means that by late this year all browsers will have an implementation of the Selectors API in the market .
JavaScript libraries have already been working to utilize this new API , preparing for when it ’ll eventually be ready for all to use .
The current score is :
Dojo has querySelectorAll support in Dojo 1.1.1 , although support for Safari 3.1 is disabled ( there were troublesome crashing bugs in early versions of Safari 3.1 that have since been resolved ) .
Prototype has querySelectorAll support in their Git repository ( presumably to be rolled into their next release ) .
j Query has querySelectorAll support in an experimental plugin ( to land in the next release ) .
This has lead to some interesting numbers ( utilizing the same testing techniques employed by the WebKit team ) :
Library Time ( ms ) Prototype 1.6.0.2 44677 Prototype Git 9914 ( 123 % slower than native , 351 % faster than DOM ) jQuery 1.2.6 35045 jQuery 1.2.7 Plugin 4731 ( 7 % slower than native , 641 % faster than DOM ) Dojo 1.0.2 20782 Dojo 1.1.1 5669 ( 28 % slower than native , 267 % faster than DOM ) Native 4441
That means that libraries that utilize querySelectorAll will be running 2 - 6 x faster than their previous versions .
This is already quite impressive .
There are two points to consider when using this API :
That you need to try and keep the overhead on top of the querySelectorAll method as low as possible .
That it becomes advantageous to avoid the querySelectorAll API in some extreme cases ( for example , jQuery avoids it for #id queries , allowing it to go over 10 x faster than querySelectorAll ) .
A lot of bare - bones selectors library implementations are going to look something like this :
function querySelectorAll( selector ) { try { return Array.prototype.slice.call ( document.querySelectorAll ( selector ) ) ; } catch( e ) {} return myOtherLibrary ( selector ) ; }
Note two points :
There ’s a try - catch block there to capture any syntax errors that are generated by querySelectorAll ( syntax errors could be generated by APIs that the implementation does n’t understand – like jQuery ’s div:first , for example ) .
If no exception is thrown while retrieving the results we need to convert it into an array ( most libraries convert result sets into arrays – or bless them in some manner ) .
Tackling both of these points will introduce some level of overhead in a library ( on top of the native querySelector All implementation ) .
Of course it ’s never as simple as it should be , many libraries extend these return sets with additional functionality so the overhead will be that much greater .
Regardless it ’s readily apparent that this API will be quite instrumental in trivializing one of the most difficult parts of implementing a new JavaScript library .
Everything after this is just gravy .
Living with humans has taught dogs morals , say scientists
Dogs are developing a sense of fair play , scientists have found
Dogs are becoming more intelligent and are even learning morals from human contact , scientists claim .
They say the fact that dogs ' play rarely escalates into a fight shows the animals abide by social rules .
During one study , dogs which held up a paw were rewarded with a food treat .
When a lone dog was asked to raise its paw but received no treat , the researchers found it begged for up to 30 minutes .
But when they tested two dogs together but rewarded only one , the dog which missed out soon stopped playing the game .
Dr Friederike Range , of the University of Vienna , who led the study , said : ' Dogs show a strong aversion to inequity .
I would prefer not to call it a sense of fairness , but others might . '
The first Canine Science Forum in Budapest was attended by more than 200 experts to discuss what is going on inside the mind of a dog .
Human 's inclination to invest dogs with human - like states of mind is n't as unscientific as it might appear as they really do have some remarkable mental skills that allow them to thrive in their strange habitat - our world .
Domestic dogs evolved from grey wolves as recently as 10,000 years ago since when their brains have shrunk so a wolf - sized dog has a brain around 10 per cent smaller than its wild ancestor .
Dr Peter Pongracz from Eotvos Lorand University , Budapest , and colleagues have produced evidence dog barks contain information that people can understand .
They found even people who have never owned a dog can recognise the emotional ' meaning ' of barks produced in various situations , such as when playing , left alone and confronted by a stranger .
His team has now developed a computer program that can aggregate hundreds of barks recorded in various settings and boil them down to their basic acoustic ingredients .
They found each of the different types of bark has distinct patterns of frequency , tonality and pulsing , and that an artificial neural network can use these features to correctly identify a bark it has never encountered before .
This is further evidence that barking conveys information about a dog's mental state , reports New Scientist magazine .
They also discovered people can correctly identify aggregated barks as conveying happiness , loneliness or aggression .
' Even children from the age of six who have never had a dog recognise these patterns , ' says Dr Pongracz .
Dogs are not just able to ' speak ' to us - they can also understand some aspects of human communication .
At the forum in Budapest , Dr Akiko Takaoka from Kyoto University in Japan described as - yet unpublished work that examined what is going on inside a dog's mind when it hears a stranger 's voice .
She played dogs a series of recordings of unfamiliar voices - both male and female - with each voice followed by a photo of a human face on a screen .
If the gender of the face did not match that of the voice , the dogs stared longer , a sign that their expectations had been violated .
Dr Takaoka said : ' This suggests dogs generate an internal visual representation of a male or female correlated with the voice . '
She suggests that this ability to infer information about a person from their voice alone might help dogs communicate with people .
It is generally accepted that a few other animals , including great apes , are capable of this mind reading to some extent , but it is nevertheless a quality reserved for only the most intelligent of species .
But Dr Alexandra Horowitz from Barnard College in New York prefers the term " theory of behaviour " to describe dogs ' apparent insight .
She said : ' I think there is a massive territory between a theory of mind and a theory of behaviour . '
Her own recent study illustrates the point - when dogs play together , they use appropriate signals for grabbing attention or signalling the desire to play depending on their playmate 's apparent level of attention , such as whether it is facing them or side - on .
That could be interpreted as mind reading , she admits , but a simpler explanation is that dogs are reading body language and reacting in stereotyped ways .
Okay everyone , quiz time !
“ How many homes do you own ? ” Now come on , do n’t cheat .
Aw , you got me – you ’re right , it ’s a trick question .
I mean , how many Americans can answer a tough curveball question like that !
Okay that ’s just scary .
How rich do you have to be , and how cognitively impaired , to not remember how many homes you have ?
Folks , this is just weird .
McCain ’s oddly inconsistent mental state is a serious , valid question in this election , and the media seems afraid to address it head on .
Real people do n’t have so many homes that they can’t remember , unless they ’re absurdly rich , or they ’re losing their faculties .
McCain did n’t make these kind of gaffes eight years ago , when he was 64 .
What ’s going on ?
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) said in an interview Wednesday that he was uncertain how many houses he and his wife , Cindy , own .
“ I think – I ’ll have my staff get to you , ” McCain told us in Las Cruces , N.M.
“ It ’s condominiums where – I ’ll have them get to you . ”
The correct answer is at least four , located in Arizona , California and Virginia , according to his staff .
Newsweek estimated this summer that the couple owns at least seven properties .
Actually Cindy McCain said in the past that they have 8 or 9 houses , she ’s not sure either .
NOTE TO DEMOCRATS :
This is manna from heaven .
Run a freaking ad about this , non-stop .
Unless of course you think it ’s too mean and you just can’t touch it , then we can just have an independent group do it .
Oh , that ’s right – you killed the independent groups .
Never mind .
I hear the White House is n’t all it ’s cracked up to be anyway .
McCain backs off his no - new - tax pledge Associated Press
Published : Tuesday July 29 , 2008
Print This Email This Republican presidential candidate John McCain 's signal that he may be open to a higher payroll tax for Social Security , despite previous vows not to raise taxes of any kind , is drawing sharp rebukes from conservatives .
McCain 's shift has come in stages , catching some Republicans by surprise .
Speaking with reporters on his campaign bus on July 9 , he cited a need to shore up Social Security .
" I can not tell you what I would do , except to put everything on the table , " he said .
He went a step farther Sunday on ABC's " This Week , " in response to a question about payroll tax increases .
" There is nothing that 's off the table .
I have my positions , and I 'll articulate them .
But nothing 's off the table , " McCain said .
" I do n't want tax increases .
But that does n't mean that anything is off the table . "
That comment drew a strong response this week from the Club for Growth , a Washington anti-tax group .
McCain 's comments , the group said in a letter to the Arizona senator , are " shocking because you have been adamant in your opposition to raising taxes under any circumstances . "
Indeed , McCain frequently has promised not to raise taxes .
At a July 7 town - hall meeting in Denver , he said voters faced a stark choice between him and Democrat Barack Obama .
" Sen. Obama will raise your taxes , " McCain said .
" I wo n't . "
In a March 16 interview with Fox News ' Sean Hannity , McCain said he would cut taxes where possible , and not raise them .
" Do you mean none ? " Hannity asked .
" None , " McCain replied .
Both candidates have said Social Security 's funding formula needs to be changed to ensure the program 's long - term viability .
Obama has called for imposing a new payroll tax on incomes above $ 250,000 .
Currently , only incomes up to $ 102,000 are subject to the 12.4 percent payroll tax , which employers and employees split evenly .
When Obama announced his plan June 13 , McCain 's top economic adviser , Douglas Holtz - Eakin , told reporters that as president McCain would not consider a payroll tax increase " under any imagineable circumstance . "
McCain has made no specific proposals for Social Security , refusing to rule in or out anything to strengthen the benefit program for retirees and the disabled .
Both candidates have said that , if elected , they would try to work out details with Republican and Democratic lawmakers .
Asked for an explanation of McCain 's latest comments , campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds said the Arizona senator " has a clear and demonstrated record of opposing tax increases .
John McCain is going to cut taxes " and improve government discipline , he said .
Promises never to raise taxes have bedeviled past Republican officeholders .
Before being elected president in 1988 , George H.W. Bush said , " Read my lips , no new taxes . "
But facing severe budget problems , he reneged on the promise .
Some conservative groups never forgave him .
The UN says half a million Kenyans urgently need help

Some have been housed in makeshift camps while others have sought refuge in police stations or churches , fleeing violence that has claimed 350 lives .
In badly - affected western Kenya nearly all the refugees are hungry , and several children have died of exposure .
A top UN official in Nairobi says about 500,000 Kenyans need urgent help .
The latest developments came as anti-government protests fizzled out and the president said he might accept opposition demands for a fresh election , but only if ordered by a court .
The UN World Food Programme said it was struggling to get food to 100,000 hungry people forced to flee their homes in the Rift Valley area .

The International Committee of the Red Cross issued an urgent appeal for more than £ 7 m of aid .
The BBC's Karen Allen in the Rift Valley town of Eldoret , where at least 30 people were burned to death in a church this week , says 30,000 local people have been displaced .
Some 10,000 people there are seeking refuge in the compound of the cathedral of the Catholic Church , which is now spearheading local relief efforts .
A statement by a group of independent UN rights experts on Friday said : " We are profoundly alarmed by the reports of incitement to racial hatred and the growing frictions between the different ethnic groups in Kenya . "
The officially - declared results of the 27 December presidential poll - giving victory to incumbent President Mwai Kibaki over opposition rival Raila Odinga - unleashed a wave of violence .
' Blackmail '
Protesters furious at alleged electoral fraud went on the rampage , killing scores of people and torching churches , businesses and homes .
The opposition Orange Democratic Movement party has laid down four conditions to resolve the political deadlock .
Kenya has been dogged by ethnic tensions since independence
They want Mr Kibaki to stand down as president ; an international body appointed to adjudicate in the dispute ; and in the meantime , a transitional authority established to oversee steps to condition four : a new presidential election in three months ' time .
A Kenyan government spokesman , Alfred Mutua , said the opposition 's three - month deadline smacked of " blackmail " .
He told the BBC : " What we are clearly saying is that Kenya is not a banana republic , Kenya is not a war - torn country .
" We have court systems and laws and orders and what we are saying is that let things follow the procedures like they do in other countries with constitutions . "
South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu met Mr Kibaki on Friday and said the president was not averse to the idea of a coalition .

French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said he believed the Kenyan elections had been rigged .
A massive security force presence on Friday prevented opposition demonstrators from holding a mass rally in central Nairobi but there were clashes in the eastern port of Mombasa and the western city of Kisumu .
Kenyan politics has been dogged by ethnic tensions since independence in 1963 .
Mr Kibaki depends for support on the largest ethnic group , the Kikuyus , while the western Luo and Kalenjin groups - who seek greater autonomy - back Mr Odinga .
Add an open - source Web framework born in Lawrence to a list of industry powerhouses with their own software foundations .
Django , started nearly five years ago by programmers affiliated with The World Company , now joins a lineup of pervasive computer languages and systems – including Mozilla , Apache and Linux – to be overseen by a nonprofit organization .
The Django Software Foundation , based in Lawrence , now owns the trademark and intellectual property that form the basis for the application that is used to create increasingly popular Web publishing programs , the likes of which are used by operations ranging from LJWorld.com here in town to The Washington Post and others worldwide .
With a foundation , Django will be able to continue its growth with new assistance from software operations large and small , from one - person outfits to industry leaders such as Google .
The contributions will help Django leaders bring together core developers from around the world – from Lawrence to Australia or even Germany – to work side by side on details designed to make Django even better , faster .
While tens of thousands of people have downloaded Django , about 350 actually have contributed code to improve the system , said Jacob Kaplan - Moss , president of the foundation .
“ For the developers working on the project , it signals that the work that they ’re putting in is going to be around for a long time , ” said Kaplan - Moss , who helped develop Django while working for Mediaphormedia LLC , The World Company ’s award - winning interactive and software division .
Ralph Gage , director of special projects for The World Company , said that turning over the Django trademark and underlying intellectual property would permit donors to make contributions to an organization “ established to do exactly what they want them to do . ”
Adrian Holovaty , who envisioned Django while working as lead programmer for The World Company ’s online operations , said the foundation “ adds an extra level of clout ” in the world of software development , a step unprecedented in his career of award - winning sites , projects and other ventures .
“ Nothing I ’ve worked on has approached Django , ” said Holovaty , now working on a grant - supported project called EveryBlock , which aims to provide data on every block of Chicago , New York and San Francisco .
With Monday ’s announcement of the foundation ’s creation now passed , Django leaders are looking forward to the next big event .
In September they plan to release Django 1.0 , following up on the Django 0.96 version that ’s still being refined .
From Holovaty to Simon Willison to Kaplan - Moss , plus others who continue to work on the Mediaphormedia team , the foundation looks to ensure a long - term future for a project that already has seen success .
Google , for example , recently started offering an application hosting service for people to develop their own programs or sites and run them on Google ’s infrastructure .
The service , Kaplan - Moss said , is based around the Python computer language , and developers can use Django on it .
“ It ’s kind of a big and ringing endorsement of what we ’re doing , ” Kaplan - Moss said .
“ Who ’s bigger on the Web today than Google ?
They ’re essentially saying , ‘ We like Django . ’
That ’s really fantastic and bringing in a lot of new users . ”

The big day has now passed for California drivers and cellphones are effectively banned on the road .
At least not without a hands - free device ... which Californians will inevitably forget to charge or lose .
Other states have this law , but California is the driving - while - talking state .
California is regularly ranked the worst for traffic congestion , and its 60 million residents spend more time in traffic not driving than just about anybody else .
It 's a big deal , but also , this law is a joke :
The fine is only $ 20 .
The dumbest thing , however , is that there is a laundry list of far more distracting gadget and non -gadget tasks that are still perfectly legal behind the wheel of a car :
California drivers 18 and older must use hands - free devices when talking on cellphones beginning July 1 .
Drivers under 18 cannot use cellphones or text - message .
FOR DRIVERS 18 AND OLDER : Voice commands count as going hands - free for drivers 18 or older .
BlackBerrys , GPS systems , etc. , are OK to use .
FOR DRIVERS YOUNGER THAN 18 : Cellphones are banned for these drivers .
They also cannot text - message or use laptops .
Advertisement
These kinds of laws are specifically about phones rather than distractions , and it really shows in the language .
Cells are banned , but BlackBerries are fine ?
Really ?
The intention of banning phones is reasonable and the law will likely benefit the state as a whole , but it could use some fleshing out .
Primarily , it does n't give the police the discretionary power they would need to properly deal with more types of distracted drivers , many of whom are even more dangerous than your average talker .
So if you 're down about the new rules and / or understand the world much like an 8 - year - old boy might , here are some alternatives that are totally ( probably ) more acceptable in the eyes of the law than dialing and driving :
USE A LAPTOP
If you 're under 18 it looks like you might be out of luck here .
If you 're a legal adult though , the coast is apparently clear .
Invest in EVDO or one of those new 3G - equipped Chryslers and browse the net , fire up your favorite racing game or install Skype and prank call the developing world .
If you 've got big hands you can even hold it like a cellphone for bonus points .

USE A BANANA
If your incessant phone usage is a function of some kind of strange cranial fixation , hold something else against your ear .
Talk into a banana , or a boomerang .
Or a kitten .
All of these things offer at least the tactile satisfaction of your average handset , and each has an added benefit ( snacking , hunting and affection , respectively ) .
DEAL WITH YOUR HYGIENE
The sights of a man struggling with an electric shaver or a woman gracelessly applying lipstick are common enough already , so take that concept as far as you want .
It 's easy to forget about your toenails , for example .
You should really take care of them , otherwise you might trip and have an accident .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
BUY A KINDLE
Impress the cute driver next to you with your brain , via your Amazon e-book reading device .
For hands - free use just strap it to your wheel , or windshield .
You can peruse your favorite quarterly , dig into some obnoxious book by Ron Paul about why making cellphones ( or anything ) illegal is totally illegal or even download every statute of California law , just to have around .
MAKE A SANDWICH
If you 're bored , hungry or both , why not just make yourself a hoagie on your dashboard ?
You 'll find that getting a decent sandwich together there is pretty easy in spite of ( or maybe because of ) all the ArmorAll residue .
Extra kudos if you can convert your Foreman grill to DC power without popping a fuse .
Also , extra sandwiches .

USE A GPS DEVICE
Mio's upcoming Moov 380 GPS device has calling and texting built right in , but it 's A - OK under the new law .
If you 've got a Dash system , have a ball drawing your own customized routes .
Or just buy a map .
Make sure to unfold it all the way so it blocks your windshield .
Advertisement
WRITE A NOVEL
Can be combined with the laptop option , but spiral notebooks and legal pads work fine too .
You 'll regret not doing it for the rest of your life , and self - publishing is cake nowadays .
With your new mobile data connect , you could even print on demand while you , say , merge onto the freeway .
TAKE A SNAPSHOT
When the world is zipping by at 45 mph it 's easy to miss things .
With the camera tech that 's available today , there 's really no reason for that .
A Casio EX - F1 will never let you miss a moment , with helpful features like pre-recording for still shots and slow - motion video up to 1200 fps .
The faster you go , the cooler the video .
Advertisement
HAVE CHILDREN
While the first two stages of producing a child are almost definitely not allowed during driving , there 's no law about bringing birthed kids in your car .
The more the merrier .
Give them some toys , preferably loose and with plenty potential as projectiles .
You do n't want to be one of those distant , uncool parents , you want to interact with your offspring .
It 'll be fun because kids are wacky , but also because the stakes are much higher .
Do n't screw up !
Advertisement
Again , I 'm no lawyer , but I 'd bet much of the crazier distractions are probably covered under generic distracted driving laws in many states .
But the point remains that there are far more distracting things you can do than talk on the phone while driving , like trying to type on a touchscreen iPhone keyboard while driving stick , and so this law is woefully out of date for Gizmodo readers in particular .
So , technophiles , how will you pass the time in the driver 's seat now ?
A Google employee working on the Android mobile phone operating system made a gaffe that has some developers saying they ’ve had enough and plan to focus their efforts on the iPhone instead .
David McLaughlin , Android advocate at Google , apologized on an online forum for accidentally sending a note intended for the 50 winners of a developers ’ contest to a wider list of developers .
The note implies that Google has been privately offering updates to the SDK ( software development kit ) only to a subset of developers , even while the broader developer community has been complaining about a lack of updates to the SDK .
“ Ahhhh , now it makes sense , ” one developer wrote on the Android forum .
“ So they ’ve been making private SDK releases while the rest of us suffer with the pile of bugs from the 4 + month old release . ”
The wider developer community was n’t pleased to hear that they were being excluded from the updates .
“ Wonder how many of us would have actually gotten behind Android if we knew that they were going to only cater to the top 50 .
Definitely feel betrayed … ” wrote Ken Adair , a developer , on Google ’s Android Forum .
The incident comes just a couple of weeks after one developer began circulating an online petition asking Google for updates or at least information about when updates to the SDK might become available .
Google risks losing developers just as competition for their attention is heating up .
Developers can now build applications for Apple ’s popular iPhone .
While Google ’s Android attracted considerable excitement when it was launched , it has more recently been criticized for a slow development process .
“ Personally , I ’m heading over to iPhone development , ” one person wrote on the Android forum .
Developers had been speculating that a small group of people have been getting SDK updates , but Google has n’t spoken much officially about the matter .
On Wednesday Google confirmed that it has been offering SDK updates to contest finalists , but said it has been doing it for testing purposes .
“ The [ Android Developer Challenge ] finalists are helping us test the latest version of the SDK before we release it to the world in the coming weeks , ” Google said via e-mail .
While some of the 50 finalists of the challenge seem reluctant or possibly unable to discuss the SDK updates , one pointed to a blog post quoting from a letter that finalists from the first round of the challenge allegedly received from Google .
The letter confirms that the finalists were asked to sign a confidentiality agreement in order to receive updates to the SDK .
It also says that they ’ll get early access to the final SDK several weeks before the deadline for the contest .
Google did not respond to a request regarding the authenticity of the letter .
Another developer said that McLaughlin ’s mistake confirms the suspicion that the contest winners were asked to sign a confidentiality agreement to get access to the latest versions of the SDK .
“ The e-mail you all received was an accident , but is essentially an admission of this policy , ” Josh Guilfoyle , an Android developer , wrote on the forum .
The Packt team added a page about my new book , which will be out sometimes in September , so I guess it is the right time for me to announce it here !
So here comes “ Expert Python Programming ” , where I explain how we work with Python every day to create software .
This is my first book in English , and writing in another language was quite challenging 😉
Anyway , this book is intended for developers that already have a background in Python and covers only advanced topics ( see the editor details ) .
But as I said , it explains how we develop our applications in Python so topics like continuous integration , documentation , testing , releasing , refactoring , etc. are covered .
Managers will also have a good overview of how a Python project can be run and managed , using modern tools like Distributed Version Control Systems ( Mercurial for instance ) or Buildbot .
Even if I am working on Zope and Plone these days , I have focused on writing a book that is only about Python , to make it useful to any developer .
The fact that my friend Shannon did the technical reviewing helped on this : he does n’t use Zope too much so he was close to the target readership .
I will take more time when it comes out to announce it in the various mailing lists , and to get into greater details about the content that will be available online besides the book ( some Python packages , etc )
I ca n’t wait to see it out and hold it 😀
US - based investment bank Merrill Lynch says it will be forced to write off another $ 6 billion because of its exposure to high - risk mortgages .
Merrill Lynch has moved to sell $ 30 billion of risky debt as it tries to steady its troubled balance sheet .

The announcement comes just a week after Merrill Lynch posted a quarterly loss of $ 5 billion .
The Bank has also been forced to seek $ 9 billion in fresh capital to help it deal with the continuing credit crisis .
Analysts expect further write - downs from other big investment banks in coming weeks .

The current fight to protect those profits is a microcosm of what you can expect to see if a larger effort to rein in health costs ever gets going .
The defenders of the status quo wo n’t say that they are protecting themselves .
Instead , they ’ll use the same arguments that the medical equipment makers are using — that a change will destroy jobs , bankrupt small businesses and , above all , harm patients .
“ This is small compared to what broad health care reform would look like , ” Kerry Weems , the top official at the agency that runs Medicare , told me , “ and you can see the reaction . ”
The current system of overpaying the manufacturers dates back to 1989 , when Congress adopted a “ fee schedule ” for durable medical equipment and allowed any company to sell the equipment at the official price .
Soon after , the fee schedule became a target of would - be budget cutters , including officials in Bill Clinton ’s administration and promarket Republicans like Representative Joe Barton of Texas .
This year , Medicare officials began accepting bids for 10 different products in 10 metropolitan areas .
Starting with the low bidder and moving up the list — with a separate list for each product in each area — the officials selected enough companies to meet local demand and then some .
The median bid among those winning companies became the final price .
It was 26 percent lower on average than the current price , suggesting that competitive bidding could ultimately save Medicare $ 1 billion a year and patients $ 200 million or so in co-payments .
Unless the House bill becomes law — it would delay the start of any new bidding program for 18 months — the system will spread to 70 more areas next year .
So what about the equipment makers ’ various complaints ?
On close inspection , they ’re pretty flimsy .
My favorite is the notion that the new rule will force some companies to go out of business — which , indeed , it may .
That ’s sort of the point .
After all , should taxpayers really be propping up any equipment makers whose survival depends on artificially inflated prices ?
The most sensational charge is that a reduction in the number of suppliers will leave patients without access to oxygen machines , wheelchairs and other equipment .
Certainly , Medicare will have to keep an eye on this .
But remember that the government will still require that each metropolitan area have numerous suppliers for every product .
Georgia 's oil pipeline is key to U.S. support Georgia 's pipeline :
It allows the West to reduce its reliance on Middle Eastern oil , bypassing Russia and Iran
US President George W. Bush ( L ) talks with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ( R ) before a banquet for heads of state in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on August 8 , 2008 .
President Bush made a new plea for freedom of expression in China just hours before the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games .
The US leader , who has said he does not want to politicise his attendance at the Games , said he could be candid with China because the two countries had built up a strong relationship built on " respect and trust " .

There is more than meets the eye to the frantic U.S. efforts Friday to talk Russia and American ally Georgia out of war over an obscure mountain tract most Americans have never heard of .
A look at the map and your gas credit card bill shows why .
The breakaway province of South Ossetia is claimed by Georgia , a former Soviet republic that cast its lot with the United States and the West to the eternal irritation of Moscow .
But South Ossetia has resisted Georgia 's rule and has been under Russia 's sway for years .
Georgia sits in a tough neighborhood , shoulder to shoulder with huge Russia , not far from Iran , and astride one of the most important crossroads for the emerging wealth of the rich Caspian Sea region .
A U.S. - backed oil pipeline runs through Georgia , allowing the West to reduce its reliance on Middle Eastern oil while bypassing Russia and Iran .
The dispute makes the Bush administration the middleman between a promising ally it wants to help and the powerful former adversary next door whose help it needs .
Washington praises democratic development in Georgia , delights in its contribution of combat troops for Iraq and acknowledges valuable intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation .
Moscow 's cooperation is vital to numerous Washington aims in Iran , North Korea and elsewhere .
" For all those reasons , and the fact that Georgia has demonstrated that it is a close ally , we cannot simply sit by and say , ' So be it - what does South Ossetia mean to us ? ' " said Janusz Bugajski , director of the new European democracies project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
" Georgia as a whole means quite a lot . "
The pipeline that crosses Georgia can pump slightly more than 1 million barrels of crude oil per day , or more than 1 percent of the world 's daily crude output .
The 1,100 - mile pipeline carries oil from Azerbaijan 's Caspian Sea fields , estimated to hold the world 's third - largest reserves .
Its potential vulnerability was already in the spotlight after it was sabotaged this week , apparently by Kurdish separatists .
Most of the oil is bound for Western Europe , where gas prices are even higher than the $ 4 and more a gallon that U.S. consumers are now paying .
With only so much oil to go around , what the pipeline carries affects prices elsewhere .
The United States also hopes it will be a model for other development projects that could have a more direct effect on the U.S. market .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was on the phone Friday morning , appealing for calm in South Ossetia , a patch of craggy farmland that is home to about 70,000 people - fewer than live in Youngstown , Ohio .
In a statement later , she reiterated U.S. commitment to Georgia 's " territorial integrity . "
President Bush discussed the violence with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in Beijing , while the presumptive Democratic and Republican candidates to replace Bush issued worried statements .
Tanks rolled as Bush spoke .
South Ossetia is one of the few places where ethnic , nationalist and other complications mean that the Cold War did n't die .
U.S diplomats refer to these neighborhood squabbles as " frozen conflicts , " a euphemism that belies the long - recognized threat that seemingly petty disputes can easily provoke a wider war .
The United States , European nations and others raced Friday to keep the conflict from spreading .
The State Department appealed for a cease - fire and prepared to send a mediator to the region .
" We are asking our friends , and the United States among them , to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade Russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of Georgia , " said Vasil Sikharulidze , Georgia 's ambassador to Washington .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraq opened its giant oilfields to foreign firms on Monday , putting British and U.S. companies in pole position five years after U.S. - led troops invaded the country to oust Saddam Hussein .
The move to invite bids for the development of Iraq ’s largest producing fields should mark the return of the oil majors whose cash and expertise Iraq needs to restore its oil infrastructure that has been hard hit by sanctions and war .
But any awards to U.S. and British firms could anger opponents of the invasion , who have said the 2003 war was designed to give Western oil companies control over Iraqi oil reserves .
U.S. and British officials have denied the charges .
By allowing international firms to help raise output at its key producing oil fields , the Iraqi government is breaking with the policy of major oil - producing neighbors such as Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates where national firms keep tight control of foreign investment in their oil sectors .
“ The six oilfields that have been announced today are the backbone of Iraq ’s oil production , ” Oil Minister Hussain al - Shahristani told a news conference .
“ With its massive proven reserves , Iraq should not stay at its current level of production .
Iraq should be the second or third largest oil - producing country . ”
Shahristani listed the fields as Rumaila , Kirkuk , Zubair , West Qurna Phase 1 , Bai Hassan and Maysan -- which comprises three separate fields : Bazargan , Abu Gharab and Fakka .
The Oil Ministry said they were open for long - term development contracts .
Iraq has prequalified 41 foreign firms .
Shahristani said he hoped contracts could be signed in June 2009 to raise output by a combined 1.5 million barrels per day at those fields .
He added Iraq aimed to raise output to 4.5 million bpd by 2013 from the current 2.5 million bpd .
He said any firm that wanted to bid must open an office in Baghdad .
Few foreign companies have any presence in Iraq because of the security situation .
Julian Lee , senior energy analyst at London ’s Centre for Global Energy Studies , said Iraq was a bit like Russia in the early to mid 1990s .
“ No matter how risky you think it is , as an individual company you ca n’t afford to be the only major international player that is n’t interested , ” he said .
FRUSTRATION
Iraq said last week it also hoped to sign six short - term oil technical support contracts during the next month .
But Shahristani , showing frustration , said talks on deals that were supposed to quickly boost output at fields by utilizing the technical expertise of majors were still going on .
He said the firms were reluctant to sign the technical support contracts because they would offer their advice from abroad and preferred to be hands on with the fields .
“ We are losing time , ” Shahristani added .

Taken together , the short - term and long - term contracts should open the door to major foreign involvement in the OPEC member ’s oil sector for the first time in nearly four decades .
Iraq ’s proven reserves , at 115 billion barrels , are the world ’s largest after Saudi Arabia and Iran .
Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih said in April that as yet unproven reserves could make the total as much as 350 billion barrels .
The short - term technical deals , each worth about $ 500 million , are aimed at lifting output at Iraq ’s largest producing fields by a combined 500,000 barrels a day .
Five of the short - term deals that have been under discussion are with Royal Dutch Shell ; Shell in partnership with BHP Billiton ; BP ; Exxon Mobil and Chevron in partnership with Total .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Iraq has also been in talks with a consortium of Anadarko , Vitol and Dome for a sixth short - term contract .
Those talks on the short - term deals should give the majors concerned a head start in efforts to bid for future contracts , although Shahristani said no company would get any “ privilege ” in bidding for the fields announced on Monday .
RESENTMENT
U.S. State Department spokesman Tom Casey said : “ The United States was not involved in any decisions to award contracts , to make determinations of what kinds of contracts would be offered , to provide advice over what kinds of contracts would be offered . ”
Many Iraqis still bear a grudge after British , American and French oil companies controlled their oil industry for half a century through the Iraq Petroleum Co ( IPC ) .
It was an era when Western majors working in the Middle East used oil output and prices as an economic and political tool , analysts said .
From the time it struck oil at the huge Kirkuk field in 1927 until nationalism forced it out in 1972 , IPC -- made up of BP , Exxon , Mobil , Shell , CFP ( Total ) and Partex -- ruled the roost .
That did not go well with Baghdad , which resented IPC ’s control .
Oil is Iraq ’s main source of income and boosting output is key to earning the cash the country needs for reconstruction .
Iraq ’s cabinet agreed a new draft national oil law in February last year , but it has failed to get through parliament .
Baghdad has moved ahead with the contracts , saying this was in line with an old law in existence before the invasion .
But the Democratic measure , which officials said was still being written , could take some of the steam out of Republican charges that Democrats are being obstinate in blocking new drilling despite the cost of fuel .
And Democrats will try to portray Republicans as unwilling to compromise should they refuse to consider Democratic alternatives after Democrats gave some ground on offshore drilling .
“ We are going to put them to the test on this issue , ” said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
Democratic aides said the expectation was that a bill would reach the floor quickly after Congress returns in early September .
They said that it was unclear how the legislation would address the coastal drilling ban , but that it could take the form of an existing proposal that allows states to decide whether drilling should take place off their shores .
Congress has banned new oil drilling off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and in the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast for decades by restricting spending on leasing programs in the annual spending bill for the Interior Department , which oversees drilling on federal lands .
Since her election to Congress in 1987 , Ms. Pelosi has fought efforts to expand drilling off California and in recent weeks has adamantly refused to entertain a vote on new coastal exploration , saying Republicans were simply trying to shift attention from Bush administration energy policies .
“ During the past eight years , our energy policy has been directed by the two oil men in the White House , ” Ms. Pelosi said in her radio remarks .
“ Their failed policy has increased our dependence on foreign oil , damaged our economy , and left consumers paying record prices at the pump . ”

You may have noticed that in certain business and marketing circles there exists a “ backlash ” against the design community .
Despite the rise of attractive , user - friendly solutions , in such cirlces unattractive designs have somehow managed to remain at the verge of acceptance .
You ’ll hear ideas being thrown around like “ design is a waste of time — we have a really ugly site which outsells our competitors 3 to 1 ” or “ we are not worried about the design , we ’ll outsource it or use a free Wordpress theme , let us focus more on the product ” .

You can almost sense a little bit of pride in how ugly their web - site is , or that they are treating design as a commodity .
However off base these types of thoughts might be , there is clearly a lack of respect for designers in the business community at times .
I ’d like to address how you can shatter this barrier and talk to business folk in a language they understand .

This article provides you with five guidelines you can use as a designer to “ speak business ” — even if it ’s just to get your foot in the door or land a big project .
1. Pretty does n’t mean effective : statistics are your friend !
Designers like to show off portfolios .
It can look stunning , but business people like to see numbers .
What was the conversion rate on that opt-in ?
What was the bounce rate and average time on site ?
What was the most clicked on link from the home page ?
To a business person , “ beautiful ” or “ visually stunning ” are just a first step .
They only really matter if “ beautiful ” or “ visually stunning ” turns into more sales .
Probably the worst offender here is the classic “ all flash ” site that is gorgeous and completely impossible to use or update .
Everything has a cost / benefits trade off , and that includes design .
Compare these two sites for a moment .
The first is from 2 Advanced Studios and includes some fancy Flash animation .
The second is from Perry Marshall , who sells a book on Google Adwords .
Despite being uglier , we can probably agree that Perry ’s site is significantly better at getting new customers .
It may not be better in other areas , but it all depends on what the goal of the site is .
Speaking of which …
2 . Every design should have a measurable goal
Saying that the goal is to “ build the brand of XYZ ” or “ create an online presence ” is meaningless to a business - minded person .
A goal is only a goal if it is measurable .
What are some good examples of a measurable goal ?
Generating leads , making sales , a number of phone calls , opt-ins , subscribers , incoming links , PageRank , etc .
Instead of trying to convince them that “ attractive visual design of this sign - up form would attract more visitors ” present them real numbers such as “ in the past this design solution effectively increased the conversion rates by 35 % ” .
President Elect Barack Obama is paying tribute to slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King as he vows to ‘ revive the spirit of sacrifice to overcome war and economic crisis during his upcoming presidency . ’
Dr. King was born on January 15 , 1929 , in Atlanta , Georgia .

The 40th anniversary of his death was marked last year .
A recommitment march lead by King ’s son , Martin Luther King III , and Reverend Al Sharpton through the city , highlighting Dr King ’s ideals of social justice .
In 1955 - 56 he lead the Montgomery Bus Boycott after Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white man .
His hard work led to the march on Washington , it was then on August 28 , 1963 , Dr. King this was when he delivered his “ I have a dream ’ speech . ”
He spoke of his desire for a future where blacks and whites among others would happily co-exist as equals and helped raise public awareness of the civil rights movement .
He is believed to be one of the greatest speakers in US history and youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 , and was awarded both the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal posthumously .
Martin Luther King Day was established as a national holiday in the US in 1986 .
Dr King ’s campaign to end segregation and racial discrimination through civil disobedience and other non-violent means inspired millions of others and had far - reaching consequences even after his assassination 40 years ago .

ttempting to disarm Iran ’s nuclear enrichment program diplomatically has proven futile .
Even with the noose tightening around its neck through sanctions , and joint American - Israeli military exercises combined with covert CIA operations being conducted close to its border , Iran still has the sheer audacity to tell America that it will defend itself in the case of an invasion .
How dare this 3000 - year - old civilization threaten the world ’s declining 60 - year hegemonic superpower ?
How dare this country stand up for itself after watching America slaughter thousands in neighboring Iraq ?
It is time to bomb these people into oblivion so the West can once again overthrow its regime and replace it with one that will conform , abide by , and slave to its master .
It ’s time these people got with the times .
It is upon America and the rest of the “ civilized world ” to prevent another 9/11 .
I say Bomb Eye-ran !
The inherently evil Ahmadinejad brought it upon himself by demanding oil compensation in euros .
Oil has always been bought and sold in American currency .
So what if the dollar is at rock - bottom due to America ’s colonial misadventures ?
So what if the Iranians want full compensation for a resource that they own ?
So what if the Iranians want to circumvent American restrictions on banks that engage in business with Iran ?
These greedy Iranians have to understand that only America can act in its best interest and everybody else has to act in the best interests of America .
As long as Iran exists , so does the potential for another 9/11 .
I say Bomb Eye-ran !
What are these Iranians thinking by enriching uranium ?
Everyone knows that only the U.S. and Israel can have weapons of mass destruction , because they have the God - given right to do so .
Any other state that even attempts to acquire such technology , even for peaceful purposes , is doing so because it wants to destroy western civilization .
Sure , Iran is constantly threatened by Israel , shares a border with nuclear Pakistan and is surrounded by two American client regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq , but that does not matter .
If Iran cooperated , did not nationalize its oil industry in 1953 , and did not overthrow a brutal US - installed dictator in 1979 , then it would not be where it is today .
Iran does not have a right to meddle in its own affairs , only Britain , America , and Israel do .
If this magnanimous , righteous , and noble trio does not take matters into their own hands , these evil - doers will unleash another attack like 9/11 .
I say Bomb Eye-ran !
Ahmadinejad stated that he wanted to wipe Israel off the map so the only logical course of action is that the U.S. and Israel destroy Iran first .
In reality he may have said he wanted to “ wipe Zionism from the page of history , ” but those devious Iranians just like to mask their threats in colorful language .
Iran ’s constant meddling in Iraq , support of terrorist organizations like Hezbollah , and combative rhetoric of self - defense is highly disconcerting .
If Iran acquired nuclear weapons , they will invade neighboring states and try to spread their Shiite revolution across the Muslim world and into Europe .
Maybe present - day Iran has not invaded a foreign state since the Greco - Persian wars before the birth of Christ , and perhaps the US and Israel have a more profound history of invasion and occupation .
However , that is all irrelevant because the U.S. and Israel are believers in democracy and freedom .
Those who committed the heinous acts of 9/11 despised democracy and freedom .
I say Bomb Eye-ran !
America and Israel can easily target Iran ’s nuclear reactors that are spread throughout the country .
Iran will not see this as an act of aggression because the strikes will be “ strategic ” and this will minimize any “ collateral damage ” just like in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Their threat to target American interests and to further destabilize the Middle East is hogwash .
Their threat to close the Strait of Hormuz , through which 30 per cent of the world ’s oil passes , is baseless and tantamount to political suicide .
If Iran does become that desperate , oil may rise to $ 500 dollars a barrel and the people may suffer , but it will definitely make the American oligarchy much happier .
In the end that is all that matters .
And most important of all , nobody will have the gall to execute another 9/11 , because the concept of “ blowback ” does not really exist .
I say Bomb Eye-ran and let freedom ring .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Legislation to rein in excessive energy speculation failed a key procedural vote on Friday to move forward in the Senate , and now lawmakers will set aside the bill to consider other legislation .
Oil rigs are seen in Midland , Texas May 9 , 2008 .

The House of Representatives may take up its own anti-speculation bill next week , and then lawmakers will get ready to leave for their month - long recess in August .
Sixty “ yes ” votes were required in the 100 - member Senate for the bill to move forward , but the measure received only 50 “ yes ” votes , while 43 lawmakers opposed .
Senate Democrats said the legislation was needed to give the government new powers to curb speculators , whom many lawmakers accused of being behind the run-up in crude oil and gasoline prices .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said “ we ’ll come back and visit ” the legislation , though he did not specify when .
“ Republicans once again have run away from an opportunity to provide a short - term solution to our energy crisis , ” Reid said .
“ While Democrats have worked to stop greedy speculators who artificially inflate oil prices , Republicans have chosen to protect them . ”
Senate Republicans strongly opposed the bill because it focused only on speculation , and they argued the legislation should be modified to also boost U.S. oil production by allowing more offshore drilling and developing vast oil shale fields in the West .
Republicans said tight petroleum supplies that were unable to keep up with demand were the cause of high energy prices .
“ Americans are insisting we do more .
They want us to do something to cut the price of gas and lessen our dependence on Middle East oil , ” said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell .
“ And so I ask my friends ( Democrats ) on the other side the same simple question I asked them yesterday :
If you wo n’t act now , with dialysis patients cutting back on treatments because of high gas prices , when will you ?
What is it going to take ? ” McConnell said .
Democrats wanted to protect offshore areas closed to energy exploration and pointed out that oil companies already held millions of acres they leased from the government that were not being drilled .
Before the August recess , Reid said he hoped to move bills that can help consumers in the short term , such as releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to put more supplies in the market and boosting funds for the federal program that helps low income families pay their energy bills .
The House may go after speculators next week with a bill cleared by the House Agriculture Committee on Thursday .
That legislation would impose tough position limits to restrict the number of futures contracts that play a significant price - setting role in both agriculture and energy that could be controlled by speculators .
Like the Senate bill , the House bill would not raise speculators ’ margins , which is the amount of money a trader must put up to buy or sell a commodity futures contracts .
Other key points of the House bill are :
* CFTC must publish reports that provide the number of positions and total value of index funds , and other passive , long - only and short - only investors in energy and agriculture markets ;
* Conditions will be set for granting hedge exemptions from position limits , mostly for commercial purposes ;
* Authorizes 100 new CFTC employees to monitor markets ;
* CFTC will report on impact on over - the - counter markets from position limits on exchanges ;
* Reporting will become mandatory for over - the - counter trading of look - alike agricultural and energy contracts .

Radovan Karadzic in 1992 ( left ) and in a photo released on 22 July 2008 Captured war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic spent years living in Belgrade and practising alternative medicine , according to Serb officials .
During a decade on the run , he had cultivated a long white beard and called himself Dragan Dabic , Serbian minister Rasim Ljajic said .
Mr Karadzic , 63 , lived in a " very convincing " way using false papers , he said .
He even gave public lectures and was a regular health magazine contributor .
" He was involved with alternative medicine , earning his money from practising alternative medicine ... he was working in a private practice , " said Mr Ljajic , the Serbian minister for relations with The Hague war crimes tribunal .
' Friend to everyone '
Mr Karadzic 's lawyer , Svetozar Vujacic , said that his client had lived in Belgrade for a considerable period of time , " while people who were in contact with him had no clue who he was " .
The real Dragan Dabic appears to be a construction worker " He did not have any security and he lived by himself " in New Belgrade , a modern suburb of large tower blocks , said Mr Vujacic .
The lawyer said Mr Karadzic was now looking like his old self after having a shave and a haircut at his own request .
Mr Karadzic 's assumed persona was so complete - according to local news reports - that he had a girlfriend , claimed to have grandsons living in the US and frequented a bar which sported pictures of himself and fellow alleged war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic .
The owner of The Madhouse bar , Misko Kovijanic , said Mr Karadzic would often come in and drink red wine .
" I 'm very proud that he came to my pub , and I 'm very sad that he was arrested , " Mr Kovijanic told the AP news agency .
Singer Mr Karadzic is reported to have frequently played the Serbian gusle - a one - stringed instrument - in the bar , while singing songs .
Masquerading as an expert in human quantum energy , the fugitive was so confident in his disguise he even had his own website , and would give out business cards during alternative medicine lectures .
The only thing which was weird was that he was wearing black all the time and with that hair and he seemed to me like he was in a sect or something
Neighbour Milica Sener Zoran Pavlovic , hired by Mr Karadzic to set up the website , visited his New Belgrade apartment and saw a framed photograph of four boys who Mr Karadzic said were his grandsons living in the US , Associated Press news agency reported .
He reportedly had a girlfriend - a brunette in her forties known only as Mila - who he said was an associate at his alternative medicine practice .
A neighbour described Mr Karadzic as a polite man who always said hello .
" The only thing which was weird was that he was wearing black all the time and with that hair and he seemed to me like he was in a sect or something , " said Milica Sener .
Stolen identity
His card gave his name as D D David , D D apparently standing for his pseudonym Dragan Dabic .
Serbian authorities are reported to be investigating the identity of the real Dragan Dabic , from whom they believe Karadzic took the name .
According to Serbian officials , he died in 1993 in Sarajevo , though media reports vary , suggesting he was either a Serb fighter who died in the war , or a civilian killed by Mr Karadzic 's men when the Bosnian capital was besieged .
Billed as Dabic , Spiritual Explorer , Mr Karadzic gave lectures comparing meditation and silent techniques practised by Orthodox monks .
He spoke in Belgrade in May , and also in the town of Smederevo , east of the capital .
Mila frequently accompanied him on speaking engagements .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
In one lecture programme , he was billed as a " researcher in the fields of psychology and bio-energy " .
Goran Kojic , the editor of the Belgrade magazine , Healthy Life , which commissioned work from Mr Karadzic , attested to the credibility of the alleged war criminal 's alter - ego .
" The person I got to know was a person that everybody would like to be their friend , " Mr Kojic told the BBC .
' No fear ' " He was a highly cultured man , he was very tolerant , he had a sense of humour , he was very positive , he was very intellectual - so he was a great person , " Mr Kojic told the BBC , adding that members of his family had died in the siege of Sarajevo .
Dragan Dabic 's business card promoted him as an alternative healer Mr Kojic said he never talked politics with Mr Karadzic - a professionally - trained psychiatrist who had last been seen in public in eastern Bosnia in 1996 ; their conversations were limited to health issues .
Mr Karadzic did not speak with a Bosnian accent , Mr Kojic said .
" He walked freely in the city centre of Belgrade and no one knew it was him , " said Mr Kojic .
" I got the impression that this man did not fear anything . "
Serbia 's war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said Mr Karadzic had " walked around freely , even appeared in public places " .
" The people who rented him the apartment did not know his true identity " .
The owner of a nearby shop , Gordana Blagojevic , said Mr Karadzic came in every other day to buy yogurt and whole - grain bread , sometimes accompanied by his girlfriend .
" I was shocked to hear who he really is , " Ms Blagojevic told AP .

What are these ?
Imagine if the current crop of public figures had grown up during the Facebook era .
We might have photos of John McCain in Florida slurping body shots off his stripper girlfriend .
Barack Obama rolling a joint on a beach in Hawaii .
George W. Bush passed out at a
Yale frat party , 40 - ounce beer bottles duct - taped to his hands .
Hillary Rodham Clinton at a Wellesley peace rally , locking lips with her husband ’s future secretary of Labor , Robert Reich .
It ’s one thing to hear that your elected representative had a wild time in college .
It ’s entirely different to have pictorial proof .
Would you still vote for someone after viewing a photograph of him passed out in his own vomit ?
This is n’t just a thought experiment .
The next generation of political leaders is coming of age right now -- and it ’s unlikely that any one of them will escape digital documentation of their college - era foibles .
Witness , for instance , the 2006 pictures sent to Wonkette.com of presidential nephew Pierce Bush , in which it ’s hard to tell what he ’s holding tighter : the sorority girls or his Bud Light .
Or 18 - year - old Antonio Villaraigosa Jr. -- son of the L.A. mayor -- bragging last summer on a Princeton Facebook discussion board about late - night boozing on a SoCal beach : “ We had Bacardi , Bailey ’s Irish Cream and several Coronas .

It was great until it got broken up by the po ’ ... ”

Our generation -- high schoolers , college students and recent graduates -- immortalizes the interesting and banal , the innocent and incriminating , all on the Internet .
We update our Facebook status as often as we change our shoes , and upload party photos before the last reveler goes home .
Nonparticipation is impossible :
We file our job applications online and arrange first dates via e-mail .
The upshot ?
America ’s standards for personal embarrassment , political scandal and appropriate disclosure are sure to change in the years to come .
The inbox at IvyGate , the Ivy League news - and - gossip blog we edit , fills daily with vicious gossip culled from forwarded e-mails , MySpace screen shots and candid pictures snapped by students ’ camera phones .
Our tipsters are most often seeking an outlet for anger -- be it righteous or petty -- hoping to subject their targets to the one modern weapon mightier than the pen : a blog post gone viral .
Tipsters reveal their roommates ’ drug use , their sorority sisters ’ eating disorders , their classmates ’ laughable academic miscues .
Our job is to decide which , if any , of these pieces of information is worth publishing .
When the “ mistake ” was mutilating a squirrel and the “ classmate ” was running for student body president ( as was the case last year at Princeton ) , that was clearly newsworthy .
For every tip we follow up , there are half a dozen we ignore .
But we do n’t delete them , and neither do our peers .
Should the subject ever become famous , you can bet there ’s incriminating evidence on a hard drive or server just waiting to explode into the blogosphere .

There are potentially hundreds of images ( plenty of them unflattering ) of every person between the ages of 18 and 30 floating around the Internet -- including your future congressman , city councilman or president .
If representative democracy is not to come to a standstill , we will get over it .
Our generation -- Generation Facebook -- already understands this culture of scandal with far more nuance than our elders .
We barely batted an eye over reports of Obama ’s admitted drug use or McCain ’s hasty and unsavory divorce .
And for all the cruelty involved in spreading online humiliation , we ’ve seen it generate a fair amount of empathy as well .
Last fall , Princeton ’s race for president of the undergraduate student government temporarily derailed when compromising images emerged of the front - runner , a spring - term junior .
His white face completely covered in black paint , Josh Weinstein had been photographed grinning widely at a Halloween party his freshman year .
He posted the pictures on his blog , though later removed them -- but someone had saved copies .
When IvyGate broke the story , our commenters expressed shock , outrage and schadenfreudic glee .
But from the rabble of caps - locked condemnations rose a second and , ultimately , more powerful response : a desire to hear Weinstein ’s side .
A few days later , hundreds of students stood hushed at a public forum where a tearful Weinstein traced the logic behind the costume and expressed regret for his misguided attempt at humor .
He eventually won the endorsement of the Black Student Union and went on to beat his opponent in a landslide .
The unsavory images were an issue , but they did n’t overtake the election .

The Internet ’s anonymity , long memory and free - for - all gossip culture may yet prove a poisonous cocktail .
But as our generation grows older and enters public life -- thankfully , we have some time -- we ’ll find ourselves in a political culture that increasingly views these “ gotcha ” moments in context and with an eye toward forgiveness .
After all , the incriminating photo , the offensive blog post , that drunken 3 a.m. e-mail -- it could have been any of us .

by Gary Dorsch , Editor , Global Money Trends
A new member of the British Parliament once solicited the advice of Benjamin Disraeli , the nineteenth century British prime minister , on whether he should speak up on a controversial issue .
� Do you have anything to say that has not already been said ? �
Disraeli asked him .
� No , � the man conceded .
� I just want the people whom I represent , and the members of Parliament to know that I participated in the debate .�
Disraeli replied , � Then it�s better to remain silent and have people say , I wonder what he�s thinking , rather than to speak up , and have people say , I wonder why he spoke . �
On June 3rd , the super - dovish Fed chief Benjamin Bernanke , couldn�t remain silent any longer , and shocked the global money markets , when he spoke out for the first time , about the need for the Fed to defend the US dollar in the foreign exchange market , before an international television audience .
� The Fed is working with the Treasury to carefully monitor developments in foreign exchange markets , � Bernanke warned .
� We are attentive to the changes in the value of the dollar and inflation expectations .
The Fed�s commitment to price stability is a key factor , insuring that the dollar remains a strong and stable currency .
The possibility that commodity prices will continue to rise , and lift inflation expectations are significant risks , that might ultimately become self - confirming , � he said .
A week later , currency traders were left wondering if Bernanke had undergone a brain transplant , and re-programmed as a Bundesbank hawk , when he downplayed the biggest monthly surge in the US jobless rate in 22 - years .
� The risk that the US economy has entered into a substantial downturn appears to have diminished .
The FOMC will strongly resist an erosion of longer - term inflation expectations .
There are significant upside risks for inflation through commodities , � Bernanke declared .
Instinctively , foreign currency traders rushed to cover over - extended short positions in the dollar , as yields on the US Treasury�s 2 - year note , jumped by a startling half - percent in just two - days , to 2.90 % , discounting the likelihood of 75 - basis points in Fed rate hikes by year�s end .
Something must have changed , to cause � Helicopter �
Ben to suddenly talk about switching gears , from inflating the US money supply at a 17 % annualized rate , its fastest in history , to a more prudent course of defending the purchasing power of the dollar .
But if � Helicopter �
Ben is just bluffing about his determination to defend the US dollar , then it would have been better , had he remained silent last week .
Foreign currency traders know the first line of defense for a currency in the $ 3.2 trillion per day FX market is �jawboning � � or trying to alter trader behavior and psychology with words alone .
Initially , �open - mouth operations � are cost - free , and might even achieve the central bank�s objective without more expensive remedies .
However , after the initial shock wears - off , if not backed - up by concrete action , �jawboning � begins to lose its potency .
If the economic landscape hasn�t changed , then before long , quick - trigger traders could test the resolve of the central bank , by the attacking the beleaguered currency .
Nowadays , it�s the dollar�s weakness against the Euro that is helping to elevate the agricultural and crude oil markets , and transmitting a major outbreak of hyper- inflation worldwide .
But with the S&P Banking Sector Index plunging to its lowest level in 12 - years , US homes prices sinking at their fastest clip since the Great Depression , and Lehman Brother�s LEH.n stock losing 54 % of its value in the past four weeks , the Fed�s ability to defend the dollar with a tighter monetary policy is very limited .
Just last week , Sheila Bair , head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp , warned that �weakening real estate markets could take down bigger banks than we have seen in the past , � and would quickly exhaust the FDIC�s paltry $ 58 billion cash reserve .
Furthermore , the US jobless rate jumped a half - percent in May to 5.5 % , its highest level in 3 - � years , underscoring the big recessionary risks that the US economy still faces .
Some 49,000 jobs were cut from payrolls in May , the fifth straight month of job losses , further sapping consumer confidence , already at a 16 - year low .
� Weak economic conditions could extend defaults on consumer installment or credit card loans , as well as corporate loan portfolios , � warned Fed deputy Donald Kohn .
Yet the 2 % federal funds rate is pegged far below the inflation rate , and negative interest rates spawn specualtion in the commodities markets .
The US dollar remains weak against the Euro , because the yield on the 2 - year US Treasury note is roughly - 180 basis points below the German 2 - year schatz yield .
A year ago , the US 2 - yr T - note was yielding +60 basis points more than the German schatz .
On June 11th , St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard said the 2 % fed funds rate is too low and could fuel inflation , unless the Fed takes action going forward .
� The Fed�s easing in January and March was very sharp , for insurance against the possibility of a very bad outcome from the financial crisis .
The probability of a very bad outcome from the financial crisis is now receding , and we�ve still got the low level of interest rates .
I see inflationary consequences of that going forward , if we don�t take action and stay on top of this situation , � Bullard warned .
Since the Fed began its easing campaign in August 2007 , the year - over - year increase in the Dow Jones AIG Commodity Index , has soared from a - 5.5 % to a record +33 % today , led by a near doubling in crude oil and grain prices , and pushing the global inflation rate to its highest in three decades .
Yet until this month , the Bernanke Fed refused to weigh food and energy prices in its inflation calculations , and instead , solely focused on bailing out Wall Street banks .
So what cataclysmic event finally forced Mr Bernanke to publicly acknowledge the bankruptcy of his �core inflation� thesis , which strips food and energy out of the Fed�s inflation equation ?
A stunning $ 16 per barrel surge in crude oil prices , on June 5 - 6th that knocked the Dow Jones Industrials to a 400 - points loss , in a thunderous crash that rattled the US Treasury�s � Plunge Protection Team . �
In a perfect storm , crude oil soared to $ 138 / bl , supported by a 2.5 % jump in the Euro to $ 1.5800 , and comments by Israeli deputy prime - minister Shaul Mofaz , who said Israel �s patience with Europe�s reluctance to impose tough economic sanctions on Iran is wearing thin .
Mofaz set the crude oil market ablaze , when he told the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper , � If Iran continues with its program for developing nuclear weapons , we will attack it .
The sanctions are ineffective .
Attacking Iran , in order to stop its nuclear plans , will be unavoidable , � he warned .
Mofaz presented a sneak preview of what the crude oil and global stock markets might look like , under the thumb of a nuclear - armed Iran .
Whether an attack on Iran or a US naval blockade of its ports , actually happens before President Bush leaves office , is a matter of great debate and speculation .
On June 10th , Bush warned , � If you were living in Israel , you�d be a little nervous , if a leader in your neighborhood announced that he�d like to destroy you .
And one sure way of achieving that means , is through the development of a nuclear weapon .
Therefore , now is the time for all of us to work together to stop Iran , � he said , on his final tour of Europe .
The next day , Bush indicated that all options are on the table , in dealing with Iran .
But behind the scenes , the Euro / dollar exchange rate is also magnifying movements in the all - important crude oil market .
� I�m very worried about the strength of the dollar .
We all know when the dollar weakens , the price of oil goes up , � said Republican presidential candidate John McCain in a June 10th interview on CNBC .
It was the first time a key Washington politician acknowledged the link between the weak dollar and the high price of crude oil , and by extension , other related markets that are soaring into the stratosphere , such as coal and corn futures .
Yet as recently as May 28th , Minneapolis Fed chief Gary Stern cautioned against drawing a link between the dollar�s decline and lofty energy prices .
� I�d be careful about mistaking correlation and causation .
Just because energy prices and the dollar seem to move together , doesn�t mean that there�s causation there .
I would point to the rapid growth in China and India that has something to do with this , � he said .
Frederic Mishkin , a close confidant of Bernanke�s , was still defending the central bank�s practice of ignoring food and energy prices .
� Stabilizing core inflation leads to better economic outcomes than stabilizing headline inflation .
If central banks raise rates aggressively to counter inflation caused by a sudden rise in oil prices , unemployment will be markedly higher , than if policy - makers set borrowing costs in response to fluctuations in core prices .
When inflation expectations are well anchored , the central bank does not need to raise interest rates aggressively to keep inflation under control following an aggregate supply shock , � Mishkin argued .
Indeed , Bernanke appeared to be back - pedaling on his commitment to fight inflation , when he tried to distance the Fed from the use of the commodity prices , to forecast to direction of inflation .
� The poor record of commodity futures markets in forecasting the course of prices raises the question of whether policy - makers should continue to use this source of information , � he said on June 9th .
It �s difficult to combat inflation , if the Fed is blind to the realities of the marketplace .
Finally , European central bankers couldn�t hold back their deep frustration with the Bernanke Fed�s delusional denial of commodity inflation any longer , and delivered their first bombshell in 12 - months .
� After carefully examining the situation , we could decide to move our rates a small amount in our next meeting , in order to secure the solid anchoring of inflation expectations , � warned ECB chief Jean � Tricky � Trichet on June 5th .
� Anchoring inflation expectations � are the ECB�s code words for a baby - step quarter - point rate hike to 4.25 % in July .
Once again , � Tricky � Trichet managed to bamboozle market traders .
� The ECB is not split , we have sent a clear message to the markets about what to expect in the near future .
We have to let deeds follow words , � his sidekick Bundesbank chief Axel Weber said on June 5th .
The ECB�s shift towards a tighter money stance , ricocheted across the world , sending bond yields surging in England , Canada , Germany , and the US , while Japanese bonds plunged to their lowest in nine months .
Up until the ECB delivered its bombshell , the ECB was widely expected to follow in the footsteps of the Bank of England , the Bank of Canada , and the Fed , and slash its repo rate , to cushion the downfall of the European banking sector .
So far , global banks have recognized $ 350 billion of losses from toxic sub - prime US mortgage debt , and the Swiss National Bank says the write - offs are only half - way over .
Taking aim at the easy - money clique within the � Group of Seven� cartel , Bundesbank chief Weber argued on June 6th , that � Central banks should not cut interest rates in order to help banks with their refinancing needs , but instead , should keep monetary policy focused on maintaining price stability , � he said .
Italian central banker Mario Draghi said G - 7 central banks should take some of the blame for the current inflation spiral , because of �monetary policies that favor excessive money and credit growth globally , with exceptionally low interest rates . �
The ECB stood steadfast in its battle of wits with German schatz traders , who had driven benchmark 2 - year yields to as low as 3 % in mid-March , betting on a series of three ECB repo rate cuts to 3.25 % , to bail - out bludgeoned speculators in the Euro - zone stock markets .
But the ECB refused to be bullied by schatz traders into an easier money policy , unlike other G - 7 central bankers , who lost their nerve .
Back on Feb 1st , Greek central banker Nicholas Garganas said , � Our monetary policy is not led on what the markets expect .
I�m very concerned about the high inflation rate .
Inflation risks remain on the upside .
If there�s a risk that we�ll not achieve our objective in the medium term , we�ll act pre-emptively and decisively , � he warned .
Yet the ECB waited for crude oil to soar above $ 125 / barrel , before signaling a baby - step rate hike , out of fear of sending the Euro through the roof .
German schatz traders were rocked by Trichet�s bombshell last week , with 2 - year yields soaring to as high as 4.80 % , it �s highest in 7 - years .
However , the highly leveraged and volatile markets tend to overshoot , when the herd mentality kicks - in , prompting Bundesbank hawk Juergen Stark to say the ECB is not planning a series of interest rate hikes , and knocking the 2 - year German yield to 4.53 % today .
But when the dust began to settle down , it became clear , that the ECB was calling � Bernanke�s Bluff� on defending the US dollar .
Seizing upon Bernanke�s vow to the Int�l Monetary Conference to defend the dollar , the ECB is now testing the true intentions of the Fed , by signaling a pre-emptive repo-rate hike to 4.25 % , and widening the German interest rate advantage over the US Treasury yields .
The ECB�s is building a reputation as a tough inflation fighter , while the Bernanke Fed�s anti-inflation credibility has been badly mutilated , by the weak US dollar and the fireworks display in the commodities markets .
It will take much more than a few sentences from Bernanke to undo this damage .
However , the ECB is forcing the Bernanke Fed to stiffen its spine , and narrow the gap between higher yielding German notes , and lower yielding US T - notes , by lifting the fed funds rate , in order to make good on its pledge to defend the dollar .
In the past , European central bankers tended to follow the US Federal Reserve , on setting interest rates .
This time however , while the Fed slashed rates 325 basis points , the Europeans refused to follow , and are now moving in the opposite direction with a baby - step rate hike .
This suggests that in terms of global monetary policy , we�re witnessing a historic shift in the balance of power , with the ECB now dictating policy to the Fed , another sign of America �s loss of global hegemony .
The Bernanke Fed has contributed greatly to the surge in global inflation , by pegging the fed funds rate deep into negative territory , and neglecting the dollar�s loss of value .
The ECB�s power - play to force the Fed into a partial reversal of its rate cuts , comes at a time when German factory orders have declined for five straight months , and carries the risk of weakening the European and global economy .
Adding to the tension , crude oil prices are perched above $ 125 / barrel , the tipping point that can derail the global economy into a wreck .
Yet the alternative , a march into the abyss of hyper- inflation , could lead to an even greater turbulence and a economic depression .
Taking the lead among the G - 7 central banks in stopping the march towards hyper-inflation , the ECB has engineered a sharp decline in the German schatz market , to take the shine off the gold market , which has tumbled to 556 - euros today , from a record high of 640 - euros three months ago .
Whether the ECB can pull - off this magic trick , and prod Bernanke and his boss , Treasury chief Henry Paulson , into a series of Fed rate hikes to 2.75 % this year remains to be seen .
For now , the Fed is hoping that �jawboning � will do the job of containing the upward spiral in commodities , and support the dollar , giving it room to avoid raising interest rates as the economy sinks deeper into recession .
The Fed�s hands appear to be tied by a weakening economy .
The problem is if the central bank is bluffing about a tighter money policy to defend the dollar , it will open a Pandora�s Box to even greater instability and volatility in global markets .

The first laptops to make use of the SpursEngine , a multimedia co-processor derived from the Cell chip that powers the PlayStation 3 , will go on sale in Japan in July .
Toshiba will launch its Qosmio G50 and F40 machines with the chip , which contains four of the " Synergistic Processing Elements " from the Cell Broadband Engine processor .
The Cell chip used in the PlayStation 3 has eight of the SPE cores plus a Power PC main processor .
The SPE cores perform the heavy number - crunching that makes the console 's graphics so stunning .
The SpursEngine SE1000 will work in much the same way in the laptops .
The operating system will run on an Intel Core 2 Duo chip and the SpursEngine will be called on to handle processor - intensive tasks , such as processing of high - definition video .
This arrangement means the laptop should be capable of some tricks that have n't been seen on machines until now .
Among them , Toshiba said the two computers will be able to upscale standard - definition video to high definition ; transcode in realtime digital TV to MPEG4 so that the resulting files are cut down in size by one - eighth and burn video to DVD in half the time of current machines .
A novel feature is face navigation .
Faces that appear in video are recognized and displayed as thumbnail images to create a visual index to the video .
Users can find the person or scene they want by glancing at the thumbnails and then click on the respective one to watch that portion of video .
The computer can also divide up the scenes in user - shot video so they can be viewed one - by - one and analyze and display the volume or the clip across its entire length so , for example , excitement in a sports event can be more easily found .
Finally , by analyzing images from the computer 's built - in camera it 's possible to control video playback with hand gestures .
The Qosmio G50 is a multimedia laptop and has an 18.4 - inch high - definition screen , 500G bytes of hard - disk space , NVidia GeForce 9600 M graphics processor , dual digital TV tuners and wireless LAN including 802.11n .
It weighs 4.9 kilograms and measures 45 centimeters by 31 cms by 4.8 cms .
Battery life is about 4 hours .
The Qosmio G50 will be cost from ¥ 290,000 ( US $ 2,700 ) and the F50 , which has a 15 - inch screen and 250G byte hard - disk drive , from ¥ 250,000 .
Toshiba plans to put the machines on sale overseas but has yet to announce launch details .
How to create / use COM components in plain C , without MFC , ATL , WTL , or any other framework .
Contents
Introduction
There are numerous examples that demonstrate how to use / create COM / OLE / ActiveX components .
But these examples typically use Microsoft Foundation Classes ( MFC ) , .NET , C# , WTL , or at least ATL , because those frameworks have pre-fabricated " wrappers " to give you some boilerplate code .
Unfortunately , these frameworks tend to hide all of the low level details from a programmer , so you never really do learn how to use COM components per se .
Rather , you learn how to use a particular framework riding on top of COM .
If you 're trying to use plain C , without MFC , WTL , . NET , ATL , C# , or even any C++ code at all , then there is a dearth of examples and information on how to deal with COM objects .
This is the first in a series of articles that will examine how to utilize COM in plain C , without any frameworks .
With standard Win32 controls such as a Static , Edit , Listbox , Combobox , etc. , you obtain a handle to the control ( i.e. , an HWND ) and pass messages ( via SendMessage ) to it in order to manipulate it .
Also , the control passes messages back to you ( i.e. , by putting them in your own message queue , and you fetch them with GetMessage ) when it wants to inform you of something or give you some data .
Not so with an OLE / COM object .
You do n't pass messages back and forth .
Instead , the COM object gives you some pointers to certain functions that you can call to manipulate the object .
For example , one of Internet Explorer 's objects will give you a pointer to a function you can call to cause the browser to load and display a web page in one of your windows .
One of Office 's objects will give you a pointer to a function you can call to load a document .
And if the COM object needs to notify you of something or pass data to you , then you will be required to write certain functions in your program , and provide ( to the COM object ) pointers to those functions so the object can call those functions when needed .
In other words , you need to create your own COM object ( s ) inside your program .
Most of the real hassle in C will involve defining your own COM object .
To do this , you 'll need to know the minute details about a COM object -- stuff that most of the pre-fabricated frameworks hide from you , but which we 'll examine in this series .
In conclusion , you call functions in the COM object to manipulate it , and it calls functions in your program to notify you of things or pass you data or interact with your program in some way .
This scheme is analogous to calling functions in a DLL , but as if the DLL is also able to call functions inside your C program -- sort of like with a " callback " .
But unlike with a DLL , you do n't use LoadLibrary ( ) and GetProcAddress ( ) to obtain the pointers to the COM object 's functions .
As we 'll soon discover , you instead use a different operating system function to get a pointer to an object , and then use that object to obtain pointers to its functions .
A COM object and its VTable
Before we can learn how to use a COM object , we first need to learn what it is .
And the best way to do that is to create our own COM object .
But before we do that , let 's examine a C struct data type .
As a C programmer , you should be quite familiar with struct .
Here 's an example definition of a simple struct ( called " IExample " ) that contains two members -- a DWORD ( accessed via the member name " count " ) , and an 80 char array ( accessed via the member name " buffer " ) .
struct IExample { DWORD count ; char buffer [ 80 ] ; } ;
Let 's use a typedef to make it easier to work with :
typedef struct { DWORD count ; char buffer [ 80 ] ; } IExample ;
And here 's an example of allocating an instance of the above struct ( error checking omitted ) , and initializing its members :
IExample * example ; example = ( IExample *) GlobalAlloc( GMEM_FIXED , sizeof ( IExample ) ) ; example -> count = 1 ; example -> buffer [ 0 ] = 0 ;
Did you know that a struct can store a pointer to some function ?
Hopefully , you did , but here 's an example .
Let 's say we have a function which is passed a char pointer , and returns a long .
Here 's our function :
long SetString ( char * str ) { return ( 0 ) ; }
Now we want to store a pointer to this function inside IExample .
Here 's how we define IExample , adding a member ( " SetString " ) to store a pointer to the above function ( and I 'll use a typedef to make this more readable ) :
typedef long SetStringPtr( char *) ; typedef struct { SetStringPtr * SetString ; DWORD count ; char buffer [ 80 ] ; } IExample ;
And here 's how we store a pointer to SetString inside our allocated IExample , and then call SetString using that pointer :
example ->SetString = SetString ; long value = example -> SetString ( " Some text " ) ;
OK , maybe we want to store pointers to two functions .
Here 's a second function :
long GetString ( char * buffer , long length ) { return ( 0 ) ; }
Let 's re-define IExample , adding another member ( " GetString " ) to store a pointer to this second function :
typedef long GetString Ptr( char * , long ) ; typedef struct { SetStringPtr * SetString ; GetStringPtr * GetString ; DWORD count ; char buffer [ 80 ] ; } IExample ;
And here we initialize this member :
example -> GetString = GetString ;
But let 's say we do n't want to store the function pointers directly inside of IExample .
Instead , we 'd rather have an array of function pointers .
For example , let 's define a second struct whose sole purpose is to store our two function pointers .
We 'll call this a IExampleVtbl struct , and define it as so :
typedef struct { SetStringPtr * SetString ; GetStringPtr * GetString ; } IExampleVtbl ;
Now , we 'll store a pointer to the above array inside of IExample .
We 'll add a new member called " lpVtbl " for that purpose ( and of course , we 'll remove the SetString and GetString members since they 've been moved to the IExampleVtbl struct ) :
typedef struct { IExampleVtbl * lpVtbl ; DWORD count ; char buffer [ 80 ] ; } IExample ;
So here 's an example of allocating and initializing a IExample ( and of course , a IExampleVtbl ) :
// Since the contents of IExample_Vtbl will never change , we 'll // just declare it static and initialize it that way .
It can // be reused for lots of instances of IExample .
static const IExampleVtbl IExample_Vtbl = { SetString , GetString} ; IExample * example ; // Create ( allocate ) a IExample struct .
example = ( IExample *) GlobalAlloc( GMEM_FIXED , sizeof ( IExample ) ) ; // Initialize the IExample ( ie , store a pointer to // IExample_Vtbl in it ) .
example ->lpVtbl = &IExample_Vtbl ; example -> count = 1 ; example -> buffer [ 0 ] = 0 ;
And to call our functions , we do :
char buffer [ 80 ] ; example ->lpVtbl->SetString
( " Some text " ) ; example -> lpVtbl ->GetString ( buffer , sizeof ( buffer ) ) ;
One more thing .
Let 's say we 've decided that our functions may need to access the " count " and " buffer " members of the struct used to call them .
So , what we 'll do is always pass a pointer to that struct as the first argument .
Let 's rewrite our functions to accommodate this :
typedef long SetStringPtr( IExample * , char *) ; typedef long GetStringPtr( IExample * , char * , long ) ; long SetString ( IExample * this , char * str ) { DWORD i ; //
Let 's copy the passed str to IExample 's buffer i = lstrlen ( str ) ; if ( i > 79 ) i = 79 ; CopyMemory ( this -> buffer , str , i ) ; this -> buffer [ i ] = 0 ; return ( 0 ) ; } long GetString ( IExample * this , char * buffer , long length ) { DWORD i ; //
Let 's copy IExample 's buffer to the passed buffer i = lstrlen ( this -> buffer ) ; -- length ; if ( i > length ) i = length ; CopyMemory ( buffer , this -> buffer , i ) ; buffer [ i ] = 0 ; return ( 0 ) ; }
And let 's pass a pointer to the IExample struct when calling its functions :
example ->lpVtbl->SetString ( example , " Some text " ) ; example -> lpVtbl->GetString( example , buffer , sizeof ( buffer ) ) ;
If you 've ever used C++ , you may be thinking " Wait a minute .
This seems strangely familiar . "
It should .
What we 've done above is to recreate a C++ class , using plain C . The IExample struct is really a C++ class ( one that does n't inherit from any other class ) .
A C++ class is really nothing more than a struct whose first member is always a pointer to an array -- an array that contains pointers to all the functions inside of that class .
And the first argument passed to each function is always a pointer to the class ( i.e. , struct ) itself .
( This is referred to as the hidden " this " pointer . )
At its simplest , a COM object is really just a C++ class .
You 're thinking " Wow !
IExample is now a COM object ?
That 's all there is to it ??
That was easy ! "
Hold on .
IExample is getting closer , but there 's much more to it .
It 's not that easy .
If it were , this would n't be a " Microsoft technology " , now would it ?
First of all , let 's introduce some COM technobabble .
You see that array of pointers above -- the IExampleVtbl struct ?
COM documentation refers to that as an interface or VTable .
One requirement of a COM object is that the first three members of our VTable ( i.e. , our IExampleVtbl struct ) must be called QueryInterface , AddRef , and Release .
And of course , we have to write those three functions .
Microsoft has already determined what arguments must be passed to these functions , what they must return , and what calling convention they use .
We 'll need to #include some Microsoft include files ( that either ship with your C compiler , or you download the Microsoft SDK ) .
We 'll re-define our IExample Vtbl struct as so :
#include < windows.h> # include < objbase .h>
# include < INITGUID.H> typedef HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE
QueryInterfacePtr( IExample * , REFIID , void **) ; typedef ULONG STDMETHODCALLTYPE
AddRefPtr( IExample *) ; typedef ULONG STDMETHODCALLTYPE
ReleasePtr( IExample *) ; typedef struct { // First 3 members must be called QueryInterface , AddRef , and Release QueryInterface Ptr * QueryInterface ; AddRefPtr * AddRef ; Release Ptr * Release ; SetString Ptr * SetString ; GetString Ptr * GetString ; } IExampleVtbl ;
Let 's examine that typedef for QueryInterface .
First of all , the function returns an HRESULT .
This is defined simply as a long .
Next , it uses STDMETHODCALLTYPE .
This means that arguments are not passed in registers , but rather , on the stack .
And this also determines who does cleanup of the stack .
In fact , for a COM object , we should make sure that all of our functions are declared with STDMETHODCALLTYPE , and return a long ( HRESULT ) .
The first argument passed to QueryInterface is a pointer to the object used to call the function .
Are n't we turning IExample into a COM object ?
Yes , and that 's what we 're going to pass for this argument .
( Remember we decided that the first argument we pass to any of our functions will be a pointer to the struct used to call that function ?
COM is simply enforcing , and relying upon , this design . )
Later , we 'll examine what a REFIID is , and also talk about what that third argument to QueryInterface is for .
But for now , note that AddRef and Release also are passed that same pointer to our struct we use to call them .
OK , before we forget , let 's add HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE to SetString and GetString :
typedef HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE
SetStringPtr( IExample * , char *) ; typedef HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE
GetStringPtr( IExample * , char * , long ) ; HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE
SetString ( IExample * this , char * str ) { ... return ( 0 ) ; } HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE
GetString ( IExample * this , char * buffer , long value ) { ... return ( 0 ) ; }
In conclusion , a COM object is basically a C++ class .
A C++ class is just a struct that always starts with a pointer to its VTable ( an array of function pointers ) .
And the first three pointers in the VTable will always be named QueryInterface , AddRef , and Release .
What additional functions may be in its VTable , and what the name of their pointers are , depends upon what type of object it is .
( You determine what other functions you want to add to your COM object . )
For example , Internet Explorer 's browser object will undoubtedly have different functions than some object that plays music .
But all COM objects begin with a pointer to their VTable , and the first three VTable pointers are to the object 's QueryInterface , AddRef , and Release functions .
The first argument passed to an object 's function is a pointer to the object ( struct ) itself .
That is the law .
Obey it .
A GUID
Let 's continue on our journey to make IExample a real COM object .
We have yet to actually write our QueryInterface , AddRef , and Release functions .
But before we can do that , we must talk about something called a Globally Universal Identifier ( GUID ) .
Ack .
What 's that ?
It 's a 16 byte array that is filled in with a unique series of bytes .
And when I say unique , I do mean unique .
One GUID ( i.e. , 16 byte array ) cannot have the same series of bytes as another GUID ... anywhere in the world .
Every GUID ever created has a unique series of 16 bytes .
And how do you create that series of 16 unique bytes ?
You use a Microsoft utility called GUIDGEN.EXE .
It either ships with your compiler , or you get it with the SDK .
Run it and you see this window :
As soon as you run GUIDGEN , it automatically generates a new GUID for you , and displays it in the Result box .
Note that what you see in your Result box will be different than the above .
After all , every single GUID generated will be different than any other .
So you had better be seeing something different than I see .
Go ahead and click on the " New GUID " button to see some different numbers appear in the Result box .
Click all day and entertain yourself by seeing if you ever generate the same series of numbers more than once .
You wo n't .
And what 's more , nobody else will ever generate any of those number series you generate .
You can click on the " Copy " button to transfer the text to the clipboard , and paste it somewhere else ( like in your source code ) .
Here is what I pasted when I did that :
// {0B5B3D8E-574C-4fa3-9010-25B8E4CE24C2} DEFINE_GUID (<< name > > , 0xb5b3d8e , 0x574c , 0x4fa3 , 0x90 , 0x10 , 0x25 , 0xb8 , 0xe4 , 0xce , 0x24 , 0xc2 ) ;
The above is a macro .
A #define in one of the Microsoft include files allows your compiler to compile the above into a 16 byte array .
But there is one thing that we must do .
We must replace < < name >> with some C variable name we want to use for this GUID .
Let 's call it CLSID_IExample .
// {0B5B3D8E-574C-4fa3-9010-25B8E4CE24C2} DEFINE_GUID(
CLSID_IExample , 0xb5b3d8e , 0x574c , 0x4fa3 , 0x90 , 0x10 , 0x25 , 0xb8 , 0xe4 , 0xce , 0x24 , 0xc2 ) ;
Now we have a GUID we can use with IExample .
We also need a GUID for IExample 's VTable ( " interface " ) , i.e. , our IExample Vtbl struct .
So go ahead and click on GUIDGEN .EXE 's New GUID button , and copy / paste it somewhere .
This time , we 're going to replace < < name > > with the C variable name IID_IExample .
Here 's what I pasted / edited :
// {74666CAC-C2B1-4fa8-A049-97F3214802F0} DEFINE_GUID(IID_IExample , 0x74666cac , 0xc2b1 , 0x4fa8 , 0xa0 , 0x49 , 0x97 , 0xf3 , 0x21 , 0x48 , 0x2 , 0xf0 ) ;
In conclusion , every COM object has its own GUID , which is an array of 16 bytes that are different from any other GUID .
A GUID is created with the GUIDGEN.EXE utility .
A COM object 's VTable ( i.e. , interface ) also has a GUID .
Assume we want to allow another program to get hold of some IExample struct ( i.e. , COM object ) we create / initialize , so the program can call our functions .
( We wo n't yet examine the details of how another program gets hold of our IExample .
We 'll discuss that later ) .
Besides our own COM object , there may be lots of other COM components installed upon a given computer .
( And again , we 'll defer discussing how to install our COM component . )
And different computers may have different COM components installed .
How does that program determine if our IExample COM object is installed , and distinguish it from all of the other COM objects ?
Remember that each COM object has a totally unique GUID , as does our IExample object .
And our VTable for IExample has a GUID too .
What we need to do is tell the developer writing that program what the GUIDs for our IExample object and its VTable are .
Typically , you do that by giving him an include ( .H ) file with the above two GUID macros you got from GUIDGEN .EXE .
OK , so the other program knows IExample 's and its VTable 's GUIDs .
What does it do with them ?
That 's where our QueryInterface function comes in .
Remember that every COM object must have a QueryInterface function ( as well as AddRef and Release ) .
The other program is going to pass our IExample VTable GUID to our QueryInterface function , and we 're going to check it to make sure it is indeed the IExample VTable 's GUID .
If it is , then we 'll return something to let the program know that it indeed has an IExample object .
If the wrong GUID is passed , we 're going to return some error that and let it know that what it has is n't an IExample object .
So , all of the COM objects on the computer will return an error if their QueryInterface is passed the IExample VTable 's GUID , except our own QueryInterface .
That second argument passed to QueryInterface is the GUID we need to check .
The third argument is ( a handle ) where we will return the same object pointer passed to us , if the GUID matches the IExample VTable 's GUID .
If not , we 'll zero out that handle .
In addition , QueryInterface returns the long value NOERROR ( i.e. , # define 'd as 0 ) if the GUID matches , or some non-zero error value ( E_NOINTERFACE ) if not .
So , let 's look at IExample 's QueryInterface :
HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE
QueryInterface ( IExample * this , REFIID vTableGuid , void ** ppv ) { //
Check if the GUID matches IExample // VTable 's GUID .
Remember that we gave the // C variable name IID_IExample to our // VTable GUID .
We can use an OLE function called // IsEqualIID to do the comparison for us . if (! IsEqualIID ( riid , & IID_IExample ) ) { //
We do n't recognize the GUID passed // to us .
Let the caller know this , // by clearing his handle , // and returning E_NOINTERFACE .
* ppv = 0 ; return ( E_NOINTERFACE ) ; } //
It 's a match ! //
First , we fill in his handle with // the same object pointer he passed us .
That 's // our IExample we created / initialized , // and he obtained from us .
* ppv = this ; //
Now we call our own AddRef function , // passing the IExample .
this ->lpVtbl->AddRef(this ) ; //
Let him know he indeed has a IExample .
return ( NOERROR ) ; }
Now let 's talk about our AddRef and Release functions .
You 'll notice we called AddRef in QueryInterface ... if we really did have a IExample .
Remember that we 're allocating the IExample on behalf of the other program .
He 's simply gaining access to it .
And it's our responsibility to free it when the other program is done using it .
How do we know when that is ?
We 're going to use something called " reference counting " .
If you look back at the definition of IExample , you 'll see that I put a DWORD member in there ( count ) .
We 're going to make use of this member .
When we create a IExample , we 'll initialize it to 0 .
Then , we 're going to increment this member ( by 1 ) every time AddRef is called , and decrement it by 1 every time Release is called .
So , when our IExample is passed to QueryInterface , we call AddRef to increment its count member .
When the other program is done using it , the program will pass our IExample to our Release function , where we will decrement that member .
And if it 's 0 , we 'll free IExample then .
This is another important rule of COM .
If you get hold of a COM object created by someone else , you must call its Release function when you 're done with it .
We certainly expect the other program to call our Release function when it is done with our IExample object .
Here then are our AddRef and Release functions :
ULONG STDMETHODCALLTYPE
AddRef( IExample * this ) { //
Increment the reference count ( count member ) .
++ this ->count ; //
We 're supposed to return the updated count .
return ( this -> count ) ; } ULONG STDMETHODCALLTYPE
Release ( IExample * this ) { //
Decrement the reference count .
-- this ->count ; //
If it 's now zero , we can free IExample .
if ( this -> count == 0 ) { GlobalFree ( this ) ; return ( 0 ) ; } //
We 're supposed to return the updated count .
return ( this -> count ) ; }
There 's one more thing we 're going to do .
Microsoft has defined a COM object known as an IUnknown .
What 's that ?
An IUnknown object is just like IExample , except its VTable contains only the QueryInterface , AddRef , and Release functions ( i.e. , it does n't contain additional functions like our IExample VTable has SetString and GetString ) .
In other words , an IUnknown is the bare minimum COM object .
And Microsoft created a special GUID for an IUnknown object .
But you know what ?
Our IExample object can also masquerade as an IUnknown object .
After all , it has the QueryInterface , AddRef , and Release functions in it .
Nobody needs to know it 's really an IExample object if all they care about are just those first three functions .
We 're going to change one line of code so that we report success if the other program passes us either our IExample GUID or an IUnknown GUID .
And by the way , Microsoft 's include files give the IUnknown GUID the C variable name IID_IUnknown :
// Check if the GUID matches IExample 's GUID or IUnknown's GUID . if (! IsEqualIID( vTableGuid , & IID_IExample ) && !IsEqualIID ( vTableGuid , & IID_IUnknown ) )
In conclusion , for our own COM object , we allocate it on behalf of some other program ( which gains access to the object and uses it to call our functions ) .
We 're responsible for freeing the object .
We use reference counting in conjunction with our AddRef and Release functions to accomplish this safely .
Our QueryInterface allows other programs to verify they have the object they want , and also allows us to increment the reference count .
( Actually , the QueryInterface primarily serves a different purpose that we 'll examine later .
But at this point , it will suffice to think of its purpose this way . )
So , is IExample now a real COM object ?
Yes it is !
Great !
Not too hard !
We 're done !
Wrong !
We still have to package this thing into a form that another program can use ( i.e. , a Dynamic Link Library ) , and write code to do a special install routine , and examine how the other program gets hold of our IExample we create ( and that will involve us writing more code ) .
An IClass Factory object
Now we need to look at how a program gets hold of one of our IExample objects , and ultimately , we have to write more code to realize this .
Microsoft has devised a standardized method for this .
It involves us putting a second COM object ( and its functions ) inside our DLL .
This COM object is called an IClass Factory , and it has a specific set of functions already defined in Microsoft 's include files .
It also has its own GUID already defined , and given the C variable name of IID_IClass Factory .
Our IClassFactory 's VTable has five specific functions in it , which are QueryInterface , AddRef , Release , CreateInstance , and LockServer .
Notice that the IClass Factory has its own QueryInterface , AddRef , and Release functions , just like our IExample object .
After all , our IClass Factory is a COM object too , and the VTable of all COM objects must start with those three functions .
( But to avoid a name conflict with IExample 's functions , we 'll preface our IClass Factory 's function names with " class " , such as classQueryInterface , classAddRef , and classRelease .
As long as IClass Factory 's VTable defines its first three members as QueryInterface , AddRef , and Release , that 's OK . )
The really important function is CreateInstance .
The program calls our IClass Factory 's CreateInstance whenever the program wants us to create one of our IExample objects , initialize it , and return it .
In fact , if the program wants several of our IExample objects , it can call CreateInstance numerous times .
OK , so that 's how a program gets hold of one of our IExample objects .
" But how does the program get hold of our IClass Factory object ? " , you may ask .
We 'll get to that later .
For now , let 's simply write our IClass Factory 's five functions , and make its VTable .
Making the VTable is easy .
Unlike our IExample object 's IExampleVtbl , we do n't have to define our IClass Factory 's VTable struct .
Microsoft has already done that for us by defining a IClass Factory Vtbl struct in some include file .
All we need to do is declare our VTable and fill it in with pointers to our five IClass Factory functions .
Let 's create a static VTable using the variable name IClass Factory_Vtbl , and fill it in :
static const IClassFactoryVtbl IClassFactory_Vtbl = {classQueryInterface , classAddRef , classRelease , classCreateInstance , classLockServer} ;
Likewise , creating an actual IClass Factory object is easy because Microsoft has already defined that struct too .
We need only one of them , so let 's declare a static IClass Factory using the variable name MyIClassFactoryObj , and initialize its lpVtbl member to point to our above VTable :
static IClassFactory MyIClassFactoryObj = {&IClassFactory_Vtbl} ;
Now , we just need to write those above five functions .
Our classAddRef and classRelease functions are trivial .
Because we never actually allocate our IClass Factory ( i.e. , we simple declare it as a static ) , we do n't need to free anything .
So , classAddRef will simply return a 1 ( to indicate that there is always one IClass Factory hanging around ) .
And classRelease will do likewise .
We do n't need to do any reference counting for our IClass Factory since we do n't have to free it .
ULONG STDMETHODCALLTYPE classAddRef( IClassFactory * this ) { return ( 1 ) ; } ULONG STDMETHODCALLTYPE classRelease ( IClassFactory * this ) { return ( 1 ) ; }
Now , let 's look at our QueryInterface .
It needs to check if the GUID passed to it is either an IUnknown 's GUID ( since our IClass Factory has the QueryInterface , AddRef , and Release functions , it too can masquerade as an IUnknown object ) or an IClass Factory 's GUID .
Otherwise , we do the same thing as we did in IExample 's QueryInterface .
HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE classQueryInterface( IClassFactory * this , REFIID factoryGuid , void ** ppv ) { //
Check if the GUID matches an IClass Factory or IUnknown GUID . if ( ! IsEqualIID( factoryGuid , & IID_IUnknown ) && !IsEqualIID( factoryGuid , & IID_IClassFactory ) ) { //
It does n't .
Clear his handle , and return E_NOINTERFACE .
* ppv = 0 ; return ( E_NOINTERFACE ) ; } //
It 's a match ! //
First , we fill in his handle with the same object pointer he passed us .
//
That 's our IClass Factory ( MyIClassFactoryObj ) he obtained from us .
* ppv = this ; //
Call our IClassFactory 's AddRef , passing the IClass Factory .
this ->lpVtbl->AddRef(this ) ; //
Let him know he indeed has an IClass Factory .
return ( NOERROR ) ; }
Our IClassFactory 's LockServer can be just a stub for now :
HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE classLockServer( IClassFactory * this , BOOL flock ) { return ( NOERROR ) ; }
There 's one more function to write -- CreateInstance .
This is defined as follows :
HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE classCreateInstance ( IClassFactory * , IUnknown * , REFIID , void **) ;
As usual , the first argument is going to be a pointer to our IClass Factory object ( MyIClassFactoryObj ) which was used to call CreateInstance .
We use the second argument only if we implement something called aggregation .
We wo n't get into this now .
If this is non-zero , then someone wants us to support aggregation , which we 're not going to do , and we will indicate that by returning an error .
The third argument will be the IExample VTable 's GUID ( if someone indeed wants us to allocate , initialize , and return a IExample object ) .
The fourth argument is a handle where we 'll return the IExample object we create .
So let 's dive into our CreateInstance function ( named classCreateInstance ) :
HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE classCreateInstance ( IClassFactory * this , IUnknown * punkOuter , REFIID vTableGuid , void ** ppv ) { HRESULT hr ; struct IExample * thisobj ; // Assume an error by clearing caller 's handle .
* ppv = 0 ; //
We do n't support aggregation in IExample . if ( punkOuter ) hr = CLASS_E_NOAGGREGATION ; else { // Create our IExample object , and initialize it . if ( !( thisobj = GlobalAlloc( GMEM_FIXED , sizeof ( struct IExample ) ) ) ) hr = E_OUTOFMEMORY ; else { // Store IExample 's VTable .
We declared it // as a static variable IExample_Vtbl. thisobj->lpVtbl = &IExample_Vtbl ; // Increment reference count so we // can call Release ( ) below and it will // deallocate only if there // is an error with QueryInterface ( ) .
thisobj->count = 1 ; // Fill in the caller 's handle // with a pointer to the IExample we just // allocated above .
We 'll let IExample 's // QueryInterface do that , because // it also checks the GUID the caller // passed , and also increments the // reference count ( to 2 ) if all goes well .
hr = IExample_Vtbl.QueryInterface( thisobj , vTableGuid , ppv ) ; // Decrement reference count .
// NOTE : If there was an error in QueryInterface ( ) // then Release ( ) will be decrementing // the count back to 0 and will free the // IExample for us .
One error that may // occur is that the caller is asking for // some sort of object that we do n't // support ( ie , it 's a GUID we do n't recognize ) .
IExample_Vtbl.Release( thisobj ) ; } } return ( hr ) ; }
That takes care of implementing our IClass Factory object .
Packaging into a DLL
In order to facilitate another program getting hold of our IClass Factory ( and to call its CreateInstance function to obtain some IExample objects ) , we 'll package our above source code into a Dynamic Link Library ( DLL ) .
This tutorial does not discuss how to create a DLL per se , so if you 're unfamiliar with that , then you should first read a tutorial about DLLs .
Above , we 've already written all the code for our IExample and IClass Factory objects .
All we need to do is paste this into our source for the DLL .
But there 's still more to do .
Microsoft also dictates that we must add a function to our DLL called DllGetClassObject .
Microsoft has already defined what arguments it is passed , what it should do , and what it should return .
A program is going to call our DllGetClassObject to obtain a pointer to our IClass Factory object .
( Actually , as we 'll see later , the program is going to call an OLE function named CoGetClassObject , which in turn calls our DllGetClassObject .)
So , this is how the program gets hold of our IClass Factory object -- by calling our DllGetClassObject .
Our DllGetClassObject function must perform this job .
Here 's how it 's defined :
HRESULT PASCAL DllGetClassObject( REFCLSID
objGuid , REFIID factoryGuid , void ** factoryHandle ) ;
The first argument passed is going to be the GUID for our IExample object ( not its VTable 's GUID ) .
We need to check this to make sure that the caller definitely intended to call our DLL's DllGetClassObject .
Note that every COM DLL has a DllGetClassObject function in it , so again , we need that GUID to distinguish our DllGetClassObject from every other COM DLL's DllGetClassObject .
The second argument is going to be the GUID of an IClass Factory .
The third argument is a handle to where the program expects us to return a pointer to our IClass Factory ( if the program did indeed pass IExample 's GUID , and not some other COM object 's GUID ) .
HRESULT PASCAL DllGetClassObject( REFCLSID
objGuid , REFIID factoryGuid , void ** factoryHandle ) { HRESULT hr ; //
Check that the caller is passing // our IExample GUID .
That 's the COM // object our DLL implements .
if ( IsEqualCLSID ( objGuid , & CLSID_IExample ) ) { //
Fill in the caller 's handle // with a pointer to our IClass Factory object .
//
We 'll let our IClass Factory 's // QueryInterface do that , because it also // checks the IClass Factory GUID and does other book - keeping .
hr = classQueryInterface(&MyIClassFactoryObj , factoryGuid , factoryHandle ) ; } else { //
We do n't understand this GUID .
//
It 's obviously not for our DLL .
//
Let the caller know this by // clearing his handle and returning // CLASS_E_CLASSNOTAVAILABLE .
* factoryHandle = 0 ; hr = CLASS_E_CLASSNOTAVAILABLE
; } return ( hr ) ; }
We 're almost done with what we need to create our DLL .
There 's just one more thing .
It 's not really the program that loads our DLL .
Rather , the operating system does so on behalf of the program when the program calls CoGetDllClassObject ( i.e. , CoGetClassObject locates our DLL file , does a LoadLibrary on it , uses GetProcAddress to get our above DllGetClassObject , and calls it on behalf of the program ) .
And unfortunately , Microsoft did n't work out any way for the program to tell the OS when the program is done using our DLL and the OS should unload ( FreeLibrary ) our DLL .
So we have to help out the OS to let it know when it is safe to unload our DLL .
We must provide a function called DllCanUnloadNow which will return S_OK if it 's safe to unload our DLL , or S_FALSE if not .
And how will we know when it is safe ?
We 're going to have to do more reference counting .
Specifically , every time we allocate an object for a program , we 're going to have to increment a count .
Each time the program calls that object 's Release function , and we free that object , we 'll decrement that same count .
Only when the count is zero will we tell the OS that our DLL is safe to unload , because that 's when we know for sure that the program is n't using any of our objects .
So , we 'll declare a static DWORD variable named OutstandingObjects to maintain this count .
( And of course , when our DLL is first loaded , this needs to be initialized to 0 . )
So , where is the most convenient place to increment this variable ?
In our IClass Factory 's CreateInstance function , after we actually GlobalAlloc the object and make sure everything went OK .
So , we 'll add a line in that function , right after the call to Release :
static DWORD OutstandingObjects = 0 ; HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE classCreateInstance ( IClassFactory * this , IUnknown * punkOuter , REFIID vTableGuid , void ** ppv ) { ... IExampleVtbl.Release( thisobj ) ; //
Increment our count of outstanding objects if all // went well .
if ( ! hr ) Interlocked Increment ( & OutstandingObjects ) ; ; } } return ( hr ) ; }
And where is the most convenient place to decrement this variable ?
In our IExample 's Release function , right after we GlobalFree the object .
So we add a line after GlobalFree :
InterlockedDecrement ( &OutstandingObjects ) ;
But there 's more .
( Do the messy details never end with Microsoft ? )
Microsoft has decided that there should be a way for a program to lock our DLL in memory if it desires .
For that purpose , it can call our IClass Factory 's LockServer function , passing a 1 if it wants us to increment a count of locks on our DLL , or 0 if it wants to decrement a count of locks on our DLL .
So , we also need a second static DWORD reference count which we 'll call LockCount .
( And of course , this also needs to be initialized to 0 when our DLL loads . )
Our LockServer function now becomes :
static DWORD LockCount = 0 ; HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE classLockServer( IClassFactory * this , BOOL flock ) { if ( flock ) Interlocked Increment ( &LockCount ) ; else InterlockedDecrement ( &LockCount ) ; return ( NOERROR ) ; }
Now we 're ready to write our DllCanUnloadNow function :
HRESULT PASCAL DllCanUnloadNow ( void ) { //
If someone has retrieved pointers to any of our objects , and // not yet Release ( ) 'ed them , then we return S_FALSE to indicate // not to unload this DLL .
Also , if someone has us locked , return // S_FALSE return (( OutstandingObjects | LockCount ) ?
S_FALSE : S_OK ) ; }
If you download the example project , the source file for our DLL ( IExample.c ) is in the directory IExample .
Also supplied are Microsoft Visual C++ project files that create a DLL ( IExample.dll ) from this source .
Our C++/C include file
As mentioned earlier , in order for a program written in C++/C to use our IExample DLL , we need to give that program 's author our IExample 's , and its VTable 's , GUIDs .
We 'll put those GUID macros in an include ( .H ) file which we can distribute to others , and also include in our DLL source .
We also need to put the definition of our IExampleVtbl , and IExample , structs in this include file , so the program can call our functions via the IExample we give it .
Up to now , we defined our IExampleVtbl , and IExample , structs as so :
typedef HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE
QueryInterfacePtr( IExample * , REFIID , void **) ; typedef ULONG STDMETHODCALLTYPE
AddRefPtr( IExample *) ; typedef ULONG STDMETHODCALLTYPE
ReleasePtr( IExample *) ; typedef HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE
SetStringPtr( IExample * , char *) ; typedef HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE
GetStringPtr( IExample * , char * , long ) ; typedef struct { QueryInterfacePtr * QueryInterface ; AddRefPtr * AddRef ; ReleasePtr * Release ; SetStringPtr * SetString ; GetStringPtr * GetString ; } IExampleVtbl ; typedef struct { IExample Vtbl * lpVtbl ; DWORD count ; char buffer [ 80 ] ; } IExample ;
There is one problem with the above .
We do n't want to let the other program know about our " count " and " buffer " members .
We want to hide them from the program .
A program should never be allowed to directly access our object 's data members .
It should know only about the " lpVtbl " member so that it can call our functions .
So , as far as the program is concerned , we want our IExample to be defined as so :
typedef struct { IExample Vtbl * lpVtbl ; } IExample ;
Furthermore , although the typedef s for the function definitions make things easier to read , if you have a lot of functions in your object , this could get verbose and error - prone .
Finally , there is the problem that the above is a C definition .
It really does n't make things easy for a C++ program which wants to use our COM object .
After all , even though we 've written IExample in C , our IExample struct is really a C++ class .
And it 's a lot easier for a C++ program to use it defined as a C++ class than a C struct .
Instead of defining things as above , Microsoft provides a macro we can use to define our VTable and object in a way that works for both C and C++ , and hides the extra data members .
To use this macro , we must first define the symbol INTERFACE to the name of our object ( which in this case is IExample ) .
And prior to that , we must undef that symbol to avoid a compiler warning .
Then , we use the DECLARE_INTERFACE_ macro .
Inside of the macro , we list our IExample functions .
Here 's what it will look like :
#undef INTERFACE #define INTERFACE IExample DECLARE_INTERFACE_
( INTERFACE , IUnknown ) { STDMETHOD ( QueryInterface ) ( THIS_ REFIID , void **) PURE ; STDMETHOD_ ( ULONG , AddRef ) ( THIS ) PURE ; STDMETHOD_ ( ULONG , Release ) ( THIS ) PURE ; STDMETHOD ( SetString ) ( THIS_ char *) PURE ; STDMETHOD ( GetString ) ( THIS_ char * , DWORD ) PURE ; } ;
This probably looks a bit bizarre .
When defining a function , STDMETHOD is used whenever the function returns an HRESULT .
Our QueryInterface , SetString , and GetString functions return an HRESULT .
AddRef and Release do not .
Those latter two return a ULONG .
So that 's why we instead use STDMETHOD_ ( with an ending underscore ) for those two .
Then , we put the name of the function in parentheses .
If the function does n't return an HRESULT , we need to put what type it returns , and then a comma , before the function name .
After the function name , we list the function 's arguments in parentheses .
THIS refers to a pointer to our object ( i.e. , IExample ) .
If the only thing passed to the function is that pointer , then you simply put THIS in parentheses .
That 's the case for the AddRef and Release functions .
But the other functions have additional arguments .
So , we must use THIS_ ( with an ending underscore ) .
Then we list the remaining arguments .
Notice that there is no comma between THIS_ and the remaining arguments .
But there is a comma in between each of the remaining arguments .
Finally , we put the word PURE and a semicolon .
To be sure , this is a weird macro , and it's this way mostly to define a COM object so that it works both for a plain C compiler as well as a C++ compiler .
" But where 's the definition of our IExample struct ? " , you may ask .
This macro is very weird indeed .
It causes the C compiler to automatically generate the definition of a IExample struct that contains only the " lpVtbl " member .
So just by defining our VTable this way , we automatically get a definition of IExample suitable for some other programmer .
Paste our two GUID macros into this include file , and we 're all set .
I did that to create the file IExample .h.
But as you know , our IExample really has two more data members .
So what we 're going to have to do is define a " variation " of our IExample , inside of our DLL source file .
We 'll call it a " MyRealIExample " , and it will be the real definition of our IExample :
typedef struct { IExample Vtbl * lpVtbl ; DWORD count ; char buffer [ 80 ] ; } MyRealIExample ;
And we 'll change a line in our IClass Factory 's CreateInstance so that we allocate a MyRealIExample struct :
if (!( thisobj = GlobalAlloc( GMEM_FIXED , sizeof ( struct MyRealIExample ) ) ) )
The program does n't need to know that we 're actually giving it an object that has some extra data members inside it ( which are for all practical purposes , hidden from that program ) .
After all , both of these structs have the same " lpVtbl " member pointing to the same array of function pointers .
But now , our DLL functions can get access to those " hidden " members just by typecasting a IExample pointer to a MyRealIExample pointer .
The Definition ( DEF ) file
We also need a DEF file to expose the two functions DllCanUnloadNow and DllGetClassObject .
Microsoft 's compiler also wants them to be defined as PRIVATE .
Here 's our DEF file , which must be fed to the linker :
LIBRARY IExample EXPORTS DllCanUnloadNow PRIVATE DllGetClassObject PRIVATE
Install the DLL , and register the object
We 've now completed everything we need to do in order to make our IExample.dll .
We can go ahead and compile IExample.dll .
But that 's not the end of our job .
Before any other program can use our IExample object ( i.e. , DLL ) , we need to do two things :
Install our DLL somewhere that can be found by the computer running the program .
Register our DLL as a COM component .
We need to create an install program that will copy IExample .
DLL to a well - chosen location .
For example , perhaps we 'll create a " IExample " directory in the Program Files directory , and copy the DLL there .
( Of course , our installer should do version checking , so that if there is a later version of our DLL already installed there , we do n't overwrite it with an earlier version . )
We then need to register this DLL .
This involves creating several registry keys .
We first need to create a key under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \Software \Classes \CLSID .
For the name of this new key , we must use our IExample object 's GUID , but it must be formatted in a particular , text string format .
If you download the example project , the directory RegIExample contains an example installer for IExample.dll .
The function stringFromCLSID demonstrates how to format our IExample GUID into a text string suitable for creating a registry key name with it .
Note :
This example installer does not copy the DLL to some well - chosen location before registering it .
Rather , it allows you to pick out wherever you 've compiled IExample.dll and register it in that location .
This is just for convenience in developing / testing .
A production quality installer should copy the DLL to a well - chosen location , and do version checking .
These needed enhancements are left for you to do with your own installer .
Under our " GUID key " , we must create a subkey named InprocServer32 .
This subkey 's default value is then set to the full path where our DLL has been installed .
We must also set a value named Threading Model to the string value " both " , if we do n't need to restrict a program to calling our DLL 's functions only from a single thread .
Since we do n't use global data in our IExample functions , we 're thread - safe .
After we run our installer , IExample.dll is now registered as a COM component on our computer , and some program can now use it .
Note :
The directory UnregIExample contains an example uninstaller for IExample.dll .
It essentially removes the registry keys that RegIExample created .
A production quality uninstaller should also remove IExample.dll and any directories created by the installer .
An example C program
Now we 're ready to write a C program that uses our IExample COM object .
If you download the example project , the directory IExampleApp contains an example C program .
First of all , the C program # include s our IExample.h include file , so it can reference our IExample object's , and its VTable 's , GUIDs .
Before a program can use any COM object , it must initialize COM , which is done by calling the function CoInitialize .
This need be done only once , so a good place to do it is at the very start of the program .
Next , the program calls CoGetClassObject to get a pointer to IExample .
dll 's IClass Factory object .
Note that we pass the IExample object 's GUID as the first argument .
We also pass a pointer to our variable class Factory which is where a pointer to the IClass Factory will be returned to us , if all goes well .
Once we have the IClass Factory object , we can call its CreateInstance function to get a IExample object .
Note how we use the IClass Factory to call its CreateInstance function .
We get the function via IClass Factory 's VTable ( i.e. , its lpVtbl member ) .
Also note that we pass the IClass Factory pointer as the first argument .
Remember that this is standard COM .
Note that we pass IExample 's VTable GUID as the third argument .
And for the fourth argument , we pass a pointer to our variable exampleObj which is where a pointer to an IExample object will be returned to us , if all goes well .
Once we have an IExample object , we can Release the IClass Factory object .
Remember that a program must call an object 's Release function when done with the object .
The IClass Factory is an object , just like IExample is an object .
Each has its own Release function , which must be called when we 're done with the object .
We do n't need the IClass Factory any more .
We do n't want to obtain any more IExample objects , nor call any of the IClass Factory 's other functions .
So , we can Release it now .
Note that this does not affect our IExample object at all .
So next , we call the IClass Factory 's Release function .
Once we do this , our class Factory variable no longer contains a valid pointer to anything .
It 's garbage now .
But we still have our IExample pointer .
We have n't yet Release d that .
So next , we decide to call some of IExample 's functions .
We call SetString .
Then we follow up with a call to GetString .
Note how we use the IExample pointer to call its SetString function .
We get the function via IExample 's VTable .
And also notice that we pass the IExample pointer as the first argument .
Again , standard COM .
When we 're finally done with the IExample , we Release it .
Once we do this , our example Obj variable no longer contains a valid pointer to anything .
Finally , we must call CoUninitialize to allow COM to clean up some internal stuff .
This needs to be done once only , so it 's best to do it at the end of our program ( but only if CoInitialize succeeded ) .
There 's also a function called CoCreateInstance that can be used to replace the call to CoGetClassObject ( to get the DLL's IClass Factory ) , and then the call to the IClass Factory 's CreateInstance .
CoCreateInstance itself calls CoGetClassObject , and then calls the IClassFactory 's CreateInstance .
CoCreateInstance directly returns our IExample , bypassing the need for us to get the IClass Factory .
Here 's an example use : if ( ( hr = CoCreateInstance ( &CLSID_IExample , 0 , CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER , &IID_IExample , & exampleObj ) ) ) MessageBox ( 0 , " Ca n't create IExample object " , " CoCreateInstance error " , MB_OK|MB_ICONEXCLAMATION ) ;
An example C++ program
The directory IExampleCPlusApp contains an example C++ program .
It does exactly what the C example does .
But , you 'll note some important differences .
First , because the macro in IExample.h defines IExample as a C++ class ( instead of a struct ) , and because C++ handles classes in a special way , the C++ program calls our IExample function in a different format .
In C , we get an IExample function by directly accessing the VTable ( via the lpVtbl member ) , and we always pass the IExample as the first argument .
The C++ compiler knows that a class has a VTable as its first member , and automatically accesses its lpVtbl member to get a function in it .
So , we do n't have to specify the lpVtbl part .
Also , the C++ compiler automatically passes the object as the first argument .
So whereas in C , we code :
classFactory ->lpVtbl->CreateInstance(classFactory , 0 , &IID_IExample , & exampleObj ) ;
in C++ , we instead code :
classFactory -> CreateInstance( 0 , IID_IExample , & exampleObj ) ;
Note :
We also omit the & on the IID_IExample GUID .
The GUID macro for C++ does n't require that it be specified .
Modifying the code
To create your own object , make a copy of the IExample directory .
Delete the Debug and Release sub - directories , and the following files :
IExample.dsp IExample.dsw IExample.ncb IExample.opt IExample.plg
In the remaining files ( IExample.c , IExample.h , IExample.def ) , search and replace the string IExample with the name of your own object , for example IMyObject .
Rename these files per your new object name ( i.e. , IMyObject.c , etc. ) .
Create a new Visual C++ project with your new object 's name , and in this directory .
For the type of project , choose " Win32 Dynamic - Link Library " .
Create an empty project .
Then add the above three files to it .
Make sure you use GUIDGEN.EXE to generate your own GUIDs for your object and its VTable .
Do not use the GUIDs that I generated .
Replace the GUID macros in the .
H file ( and remember to replace the < < name > > part of the GUID macro too ) .
Remove the functions SetString and GetString in the .C and .
H files , and add your own functions instead .
Modify the INTERFACE macro in the .
H file to define the functions you added .
Change the data members of MyRealIExample ( i.e. , MyRealIMyObject , whatever ) to what you want .
Modify the installer to change the first three strings in the source .
In the example programs , search and replace the string IExample with the name of your object .
Although a C or C++ program , or a program written in most compiled languages , can use our COM object , we have yet to add some support that will allow most interpreted languages to use our object , such as Visual Basic , VBscript , JScript , Python , etc .
This will be the subject of Part II of this series .
Birth - control pills could screw up a woman 's ability to sniff out a compatible mate , a new study finds .
While several factors can send a woman swooning , including big brains and brawn , body odor can be critical in the final decision , the researchers say .
That 's because beneath a woman 's flowery fragrance or a guy 's musk the body sends out aromatic molecules that indicate genetic compatibility .
Major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) genes are involved in immune response and other functions , and the best mates are those that have different MHC smells than you .
The new study reveals , however , that when women are on the pill they prefer guys with matching MHC odors .
MHC genes churn out substances that tell the body whether a cell is a native or an invader .
When individuals with different MHC genes mate , their offspring 's immune systems can recognize a broader range of foreign cells , making them more fit .
Past studies have suggested couples with dissimilar MHC genes are more satisfied and more likely to be faithful to a mate .
And the opposite is also true with matchng - MHC couples showing less satisfaction and more wandering eyes .
" Not only could MHC - similarity in couples lead to fertility problems , " said lead researcher Stewart Craig Roberts , an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Newcastle in England , " but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill , as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners . "
Sexy scents
The study involved about 100 women , aged 18 to 35 , who chose which of six male body - odor samples they preferred .
They were tested at the start of the study when none of the participants were taking contraceptive pills and three months later after 40 of the women had started taking the pill more than two months prior .
For the non-pill users , results did n't show a significant preference for similar or dissimilar MHC odors .
When women started taking birth control , their odor preferences changed .
These women were much more likely than non-pill users to prefer MHC - similar odors .
" The results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors , " Roberts said .
Pregnant state
Based on the work by Claus Wedekind , a University of Lausanne researcher who preformed similar studies in the 1990s , Roberts suggests a likely reason for the pill 's effect on a woman 's odor preferences .
The pill puts a woman 's body into a hormonally pregnant state ( the reason she does n’t ovulate ) , and during that time there would be no reason to seek out a mate .
" When women are pregnant there 's no selection pressure , evolutionarily speaking , for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors , " Roberts said .
" And if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives , who would be more genetically similar , because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby . "
So the pill puts a woman 's body into a post - mating state , even though she might be still in the game .
” The pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time , ” Roberts told LiveScience .
The results are detailed in the current issue of the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B : Biological Sciences .

Dear Friends ,
Due to some very dedicated volunteers and employees ( who not only earned a little extra money but believe in our campaign that is by and for the people ) , Cindy for Congress will be turning in our nominating signatures this Tuesday , July 29th .
Our campaign goal was to turn in the nominating signatures by August 1st , so we are ahead of our campaign schedule and will be 10 days ahead of the deadline ...
We will pick up supplemental petitions on Tuesday to gather signatures until August 8th : the number depending on the number of signatures that are invalidated , but on Tuesday , we will be turning in well in excess of the 7698 that are still due ...
According to Richard Winger of Ballot Access
News , I will be only the 6th non-partisan to attain ballot status in California .
Quite a historic day for the people .
Not only is it super difficult just in a logistical way , but WE WILL BE ON THE BALLOT AGAINST THE FAILED SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE !
This is huge !
This is profoundly significant !
We are 100 days away from the election and 100 days away from sending Pelosi packing .
Talk about a revolution !
Talk about a peaceful coup !
Love & Peace Cindy Money Bomb For The Peace Mom August 6th !
August 6th is Hiroshima Day and the 3rd anniversary of the day Cindy first sat down in the ditch outside of George W. Bush 's Crawford , Texas ranch to get him to answer the question , " For what noble cause , " did he send her son Casey to die in Iraq ! .. Stand with Cindy again on August 6th !
You do n't have to live in the 8th District of California to see that Nancy Pelosi is not interested in PEACE and you have a stake in Cindy 's race for Congress !

WASHINGTON , D.C. -- Sen. Barack Obama has been meeting secretly with heavy industry CEOs in Washington to discuss issues that he would face as president .
On the campaign trail , Obama has been highly critical of corporate executives and promised them nothing but tougher regulation and higher taxes .
But the unannounced , small evening sessions with them since he clinched the Democratic nomination have been non-confrontational and cordial .
Obama scheduled the meetings without any hopes of winning the captains of industry over from Sen .
John McCain , but to show them they would be able to do business with him in the White House and that the president 's door would be open to the corporate leaders .
Their consensus was that he has largely succeeded in that purpose .
McCain and Gramm
After Sen. John McCain publicly repudiated his close friend and adviser Phil Gramm 's comments about a " nation of whiners " and a " mental recession , " the two old political comrades patched up their relationship .
Gramm apologized to McCain for his remarks that gave Democrats an opening against the Republican presidential candidate and provided several days of ammunition for blogs , cable television and radio talk shows .
McCain told Gramm not to worry about the expected pitfalls of a campaign surrogate .
Gramm will continue as an adviser and surrogate .
Gramm remained a steadfast supporter last year when it appeared that McCain 's campaign had collapsed .
McCain was a loyal backer of Gramm 's failed 1988 campaign for president and did not leave until the candidate dropped out of the race .
Dumping Grassley
Evangelicals and their allies , dominating last weekend 's Iowa Republican state convention , dumped their critic , Sen .
Chuck Grassley , from the state 's delegation to the national convention in St. Paul , Minn .
The five - term senator is Iowa 's senior Republican elected official .
Grassley has aroused the ire of Christian conservatives by launching a Senate Finance Committee investigation of six televangelists for alleged lavish spending .
Leading conservatives , headed by Paul Weyrich and Ken Blackwell , have charged Grassley with violating the First Amendment religious freedom guarantee .
The 74 - year - old Grassley once was considered the leader of the Iowa Republican Party 's conservative wing but has been at odds with increasingly influential evangelical elements in the party .
Carrying Georgia
Republican strategists now are privately conceding that the GOP could lose Georgia 's 15 presidential electors for the first time since 1992 because of Bob Barr 's ballot position as the Libertarian Party presidential candidate .
The most recent Georgia survey by the polling firm InsiderAdvantage , conducted July 2 , shows 46 percent for Sen. John McCain , 44 percent for Sen. Barack Obama and 4 percent for Barr. George W. Bush , who carried all 11 states of the old Confederacy in both 2000 and 2004 , had 58 percent of Georgia 's vote in the last election .
Third party presidential candidates almost always run more poorly in the actual election than their showing in the polls , but Barr as a former Republican congressman from Georgia might sustain support in his home state .
He already has slipped a little in Georgia , based on his 5.6 percent standing in the June 19 InsiderAdvantage poll , when McCain had a lead of 1.6 percentage points .
Reid vs. Coburn
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is threatening to hold the Senate in session over the weekend of July 25 to consider spending bills held up by the objection of Republican Sen .
Tom Coburn instead of being set loose early for the election campaign , as Reid has promised .
Reid would bundle together anywhere from 40 to 80 bills objected to by Coburn .
Such a " Coburn omnibus bill " on the floor might provoke an extended debate for several days .
A footnote : Although Reid has told reporters that there is no use trying to talk to Coburn , they have been negotiating with each other in an effort to reach a unanimous consent agreement .
There was an interesting piece of JavaScript performance analysis done recently , by the PBWiki team .
They wanted to understand a few things about how quickly JavaScript libraries loaded ( obviously , their loading speed grossly effecting the total loading speed of a page ) .
They set up a system to gather input from random browsers , aggregating the results into a final breakdown .
There ’s a lot that application , and browser , developers can learn from the results – the total information available is actually quite profound :
JavaScript Packaging Techniques
When distributing a piece of JavaScript code it ’s traditional to think that the smallest ( byte - size ) code will download and load the fastest .
This is not true – and is a fascinating result of this survey .
Looking at the speed of loading jQuery in three forms : normal , minified ( using Yahoo Min ) , and packed ( using Packer ) .
By order of file size , packed is the smallest , then minifed , then normal .
However , the packed version has an overhead :
It must be uncompressed , on the client - side , using a JavaScript decompression algorithm .
This unpacking has a tangible cost in load time .
This means , in the end , that using a minifed version of the code is much faster than the packed one – even though its file size is quite larger .
Packaging Comparison ( loading jquery , all variants )
Minified Time Avg Samples minified 519.7214 12611 packed 591.6636 12606 normal 645.4818 12589
Next time you pick a compression technique , remember this formula :
Total_Speed = Time_to_Download + Time_to_Evaluate
JavaScript Library Performance
The next nugget of information , that we can unearth , is the total performance of JavaScript libraries , when loading within a page ( this includes their transfer time and their evaluation time ) .
Thus , a library that is both smaller and simpler will load faster .
Looking at the results you can see a , comparatively , large lead for jQuery ( 200 - 400 ms – a perceptible difference in speed ) .
Average Time to Load Toolkit ( non cached , gzipped , minified )
Toolkit Time Avg Samples jquery - 1.2.1 732.1935 3152 dojo-1.0.1 911.3255 3143 prototype-1.6.0 923.7074 3144 yahoo-utilities - 2.4.0 927.4604 3141 protoculous - 1.0.2 1136.5497 3136
Now , some might argue that testing the speed of un-cached pages would be unfair , however according to Yahoo ’s research on caching , approximately 50 % of users will never have the opportunity to have the page contents be cached .
Thus , making sure that you page loads quickly both on initial load , and subsequent loads , should be of the utmost importance .
Average Time to Load Toolkit ( cached , gzipped , minified )
Toolkit Time Avg Samples yahoo- utilities - 2.4.0 122.7867 3042 jquery - 1.2.1 131.1841 3161 prototype-1.6.0 142.7332 3040 dojo-1.0.1 171.2600 3161 protoculous - 1.0.2 276.1929 3157
Once you examine cached speeds the difference becomes much less noticeable ( 10 - 30 ms difference – with the exception of Prototype / Scriptaculous ) .
Since these results are completely cached we can gauge , roughly , the overhead that ’s provided by file transfer , in comparison to evaluation speed ) .
If nothing else , I think this type of analysis warrants further examination .
Using user - generated input , against live datasets , to create real - world performance metrics is quite lucrative to everyone involved – to users , framework developers , and browser vendors .
» More information on the web browser performance shown below .
Web Browser Performance
Finally , this test gives us the opportunity to examine the load speed of some real - world code – specifically , the performance of evaluating the scripts when they ’re retrieved from a cache .
Browser Comparison ( loading jquery from cache )
Browser Time Avg Samples Firefox 3.x 14.0000 2 Safari 19.8908 284 IE 7.x 27.4372 247 IE 6.x 41.3167 221 Firefox 2.x 111.0662 2009 Opera 5.x 925.3057 157
There ’s a couple things that we can note about the results :
You think your liquid - cooled rig is pretty snazzy , do n't you ?
After Purdue researchers get their technology on the streets , that stuff will seriously look like old hat .
The team is working on a " miniature refrigeration system small enough to fit inside laptops and personal computers , " which would hopefully boost cooling performance while enabling computers to be smaller .
According to Suresh Garimella , they have " a very good handle on the technology , " but it 's still a ways from being implemented in end products .
Do n't worry though , we 're sure the likes of Alienware and Voodoo PC will have it up as optional equipment just as soon as it clears the quality assurance lab .

It has only been three days since the Redeem Team took down Spain , bringing both international respect and the Gold medal back to the United States .
However , if Americans have a tendency toward anything , it ’s looking ahead to the next big thing .
It ’s time to look ahead to London with the leaders of the new school , a band of brothers who will bring another gold medal to the U.S. in 2012 .
We ’ll start with the five players who should return from the 2008 Team and move on to 10 other players who should get the call when it ’s time to head over to the old stomping grounds of London .
It will be a team of extreme size , extreme strength , and extreme skill .
Five Who Should Stay
LeBron James – While the peoples ’ champ in Beijing was Kobe Bryant , the man putting in the work during film sessions was LeBron .
This is one of the many reasons Team USA will gladly hand King James the captain ’s crown in 2012 .
James was the equivalent to Scottie Pippen in the 1992 Barcelona games , giving the U.S. an incomparable match of size , quickness , and helped strengthen a team that was desperate for weak - side help and transition defense .
Chris Paul –
The best point guard in the game put on a clinic as he broke down both man - to - man and zone defenses , opening the door for Kobe and company to light it up downtown .
Paul has yet to hit his peak and could take the torch from Jason Kidd , a man who never lost in international play .
Deron Williams –
The past year has placed Deron in CP3 ’s shadow , but there is no question that the Jazz guard is as coldblooded as Rick James .
He ’s a proven winner who lives for the big shot .
Williams never shies from a 3 - point opportunity , will continue to step up when needed , and also offers an intriguing double point guard lineup alongside Paul .
Dwyane Wade –
Any doubts about Flash ’s ability to compete at an international level after numerous injuries have been put to rest .
Wade ’s comfort level grew throughout the games , his ability to slash to the basket is back , and he is the man you want taking the shot at the end of the game .
Sorry LeBron , but we have n’t forgotten Wade was an NBA Finals MVP , and soon enough the rest of the NBA public will remember too .
Chris Bosh –
All due respect to Dwight Howard , but Bosh was the true Superman down low in Beijing .
Bosh represents a better all - around threat , a more aggressive defender who understands and – get this – patents his game around the FIBA rules .
Bosh will make free throws when it counts , continue to be hungry on defense , and stand up to the Luis Scolas of the Olympics games .
Ten To Consider
Greg Oden –
The main question mark in the 2008 Olympics was the lack of big men .
That wo n’t be an issue in London where the best center prospect since Shaq will bring unstoppable shot swatting and rebounding potential .
Oden will also bring a fresh personality that Team USA had been lacking for quite some time .
Amare Stoudemire – Due to injuries and concern about his long - term ability to stay healthy , Amare had to turn down a golden opportunity with this year ’s Redeem Team .
That should n’t be an issue in 2012 .
Stoudemire ’s ability to run the floor in an up - tempo game will make Team USA even more formidable .
His recovery from micro-fracture knee surgery only made him better offensively , as he had to ditch the dunk and develop a mid-range game .
Any center who can hit the FIBA three is a huge asset .
Al Jefferson – Any player who can make Minnesota fans feel ‘ okay ’ without the likes of Kevin Garnett deserves consideration .
Not only is he one of only five players averaging 20 points and 10 rebounds a game , Jefferson is a quick scorer who will clear the defensive board .
Yes , you will surrender a bit of defensive intensity when you put him in , but consider the fact that he could play next to Oden and things do n’t seem so unstable down low .
We would guess that Jefferson also would be motivated to step up his defensive prowess around the rest of Team USA .
Kevin Martin –
The game ’s most underrated scorer will answer the call when it comes to creating fast break chances and knocking down the outside shot .
More importantly , Martin gets to the free - throw line 9.5 times per game in the NBA .
His 87 percent free throw percentage is assurance enough that he will knock down the free - be’s .
He could be an invaluable asset in close game situations .
O.J. Mayo – Imagine Dwyane
Wade with deeper range and you have what Mayo might become .
Mayo’s a great ball - handler who can play both guard positions and can light up the scoreboard from anywhere on the court .
His solid defensive play makes him perfect in a half - court trap .
His unprecedented work ethic will be key in motivating other players who may grow fat from the 2008 feeding frenzy .
Brandon Roy – A born leader , B - Roy will be the quintessential play - maker as well as one of the best all - around players by the time 2012 rolls around .
Roy wo n’t flinch at any defense thrown in his way , nor will he hesitate to get in a teammate ’s face .
Like his Blazers teammate Greg Oden , Roy will serve as a positive influence and an ambassador to the game .
Al Horford – Arguably deserving of the Rookie of the Year award last season , Horford is the ultimate garbage man .
Horford ’s physical man - to - man post defense will help should any team muscle up against them .
Foreign teams will learn – much like the Boston Celtics did – Horford ’s tournament experience gained from two titles at Florida University make him a proven winner and fearless competitor .
Kevin Durant – By 2012 , Durant will be one of the most versatile scorers in the game .
Durant lives for the big game and will be a dead - eye from the 20 foot FIBA three - point line .
Plus , if ( a big if ) Durant puts on some size and commits to playing solid defense he will be a nightmare for opponents to contain , a true all - around threat .
Rudy Gay – Gay will bring a tremendous amount of athleticism along with an expanding range .
Gay attacks the glass , plays with a chip on his shoulder , and will get in the heads of defenders .
Joe Johnson – Another underrated player who shined brightest in the playoffs , Johnson is the smoothest scorer in the game , easily able to take any defender off the dribble .
The importance Johnson ’s size and shot selection could offer Team USA is immeasurable .
He can spot up or shoot off the dribble , and will be a backbreaker when it comes to the 3 - point line .

With today's 6 percent move to the downside for Advanced Micro Devices , falling below $ 5 a share , the company 's stock now sits at a 16 - year - low .
Its chief rival , Intel Corp. , creates AMD 'sentire market cap every three weeks or so .
We make so much of the rivalry between the two , but AMD is quickly becoming an asterisk in the broader market , and the company 's chief executive , Hector Ruiz , continues to hold power .
You just have to wonder for how long .
This was a $ 16 stock a year ago ; $ 23 a share a year before that .
This slide has been consistent , precipitous , and there 's no end in sight for these shares to turn around .
The latest bit of devastating news for AMD comes from the animated studio DreamWorks , the folks behind " Kung Fu Panda , " " Shrek , " and so many other animated hits , deciding on new chips from Intel to help the studio along with its 3D animation efforts , rather than continuing its relationship with AMD .
AMD and DreamWorks have partnered since 2005 and was a lucrative deal for AMD : DreamWorks boasts 1,000 workstations and 1,500 servers .
Last year , I focused on AMD and its initiatives in Hollywood , partnering with major studios , including Lucas Film , because of the speed and price of its server and desktop chips .
In fact , AMD spotlighted its relationship with Hollywood as a great example of the kinds of innovations its microprocessors could fuel in the right hands .
A way to give consumers and companies a glimpse at what 's possible with technology from AMD .
Animated movies already use enormous computing power , but the 3D aspect of movie - making requires twice even that level of computing .
Distressing for AMD is the message this news sends : that AMD chips were acceptable , to a point ; but that now that films are getting more complicated , and need even more power , DreamWorks decided to go elsewhere .
AMD might be running out of options .
The company has already sold an 8.1 percent chunk of itself to the Abu Dhabi government last September , but with a dramatically shrinking cap - ex budget , AMD appears unable to spend its way out of this mess .
Some will say that AMD 's problems stemmed from its acquisition of graphics chip maker ATI Technologies a couple of years ago for what was then thought to be a heavily inflated $ 5.4 billion .
AMD had enormous trouble trying to digest that deal and now its value almost twice AMD 's dwindling market cap .
Ouch .
This is a company literally fighting for its life , and it needs to survive .
Consumers , business customers , the marketplace as a whole need this company to survive .
Intel is a well - oiled , money - making machine , but as the only game in town , it runs the risk of being a monopolist in more than just " name only . "
AMD has made the argument , sometimes compelling , sometimes not , that Intel has spent decades exercising that monopoly power .
There may be some fire under all that smoke , but in the meantime the industry still has two competitors .
If Ruiz and team can't figure out a way to strengthen AMD , after so much time trying , they should step aside and make way for a team that can .
More is at stake here than merely the survival of AMD as a company ; chip industry competition depends on it .
AMD reports earnings a week from today .
Two days after Intel .

You want to log everything , but you 'll find that even in the simplest requests with the fastest response times , a simple file - based access log can add 10 % to your response time ( which usually means ~ 91 % as many requests per second ) .
The fastest substitute we 've found for file - based logging in Python is syslog .
Here 's how easy it is :
import syslog syslog.syslog ( facility | priority , msg )
Nothing 's faster , at least nothing that does n't require you telling Operations to compile a new C module on their production servers .
" But wait ! " you say , " Python 's builtin logging module has a SysLogHandler !
Use that ! "
Well , no .
There are two reasons why not .
First , because Python 's logging module in general is bog - slow - - too slow for high - efficiency apps .
It can make many function calls just to decide it 's not going to log a message .
Second , the SysLogHandler in the stdlib uses a UDP socket by default .
You can pass it a string for the address ( probably ' / dev/ log ' ) and it will use a UNIX socket just like syslog .
syslog , but it 'll still do it in Python , not C , and you still have all the logging module overhead .
Here 's a SysLogLibHandler if you 're stuck with the stdlib logging module :
class SysLogLibHandler ( logging .
Handler ) : " " " A logging handler that emits messages to syslog.syslog . " " "
priority_map = { 10 : syslog .
LOG_NOTICE , 20 : syslog .
LOG_NOTICE , 30 : syslog .
LOG_WARNING , 40 : syslog .
LOG_ERR , 50 : syslog .
LOG_CRIT , 0 : syslog .
LOG_NOTICE , } def __init__ ( self , facility ) : self.
facility = facility logging .Handler.__init__( self ) def emit( self , record ) : syslog.syslog(self.facility | self.priority_map[record.levelno ] , self.format( record ) )
I suggest using syslog .
LOCAL0 - syslog .
LOCAL7 for the facility arg .
If you 're writing a server , use one facility for access log messages and a different one for error / debug logs .
Then you can configure syslogd to handle them differently ( e.g. , send them to / var / log/ myapp/access.log and /var/log/myapp/error.log ) .

When it comes to being taken in by Intenet fraudsters , men have a knack of losing cash , according to a new report from Internet Crime Complaint Center .
Data compiled from more than 206,000 complaints received by the U.S. ICCC shows that men lost U.S. $ 1.67 to every $ 1 lost by women on online fraud .
The organisation says that buying patterns and human natureplay into the findings .
Historically men were more apt to purchase large ticket item like electronics … that could explain a lot of it .
But with women now spending more online , the difference is also due to the fact that certain types of schemes tend to suck men in .
Men tend to fall victim … to business investment schemes and some other schemes that have a higher monetary loss .
Investment fraud complaints , where the average loss is more than $ 3,500 , were overwhelmingly submitted by men .
Compare that to something like auction fraud , where men and women are frequently victimized .
The average loss there is just over $ 480 .
Men also tend to be victims of check fraud ( average loss : $ 3000 ) and Nigerian letter fraud scams ( $ 2000 ) .
Overall Internet crime is netting the bad guys more money than ever .
Total losses from 2007 complaints came to $ 239 million , up $ 40 million from 2006 .
The number of complaints was actually down for the second year in a row .
Read
The drop in complaints can be credited to increased consumer awareness , but according to a director of research in computer forsenics , there may be another explanation .
Alot of time has been spent studying the criminals and researchers have noticed that credit card numbers have often been stolen and then not used .
One theory is that nobody want to go to jail for stealing $ 40 .
So when they get access to these accounts , they are using only the ones that they can get most value from .
Often criminals will do a balance check and then sell only the cards with the highest balances .
There is a little bit of filtering on the criminal side that ’s at play here .
There was another interesting finding in the 2007 data .
The ICCC found that many countries that were commonly linked with cybercrime were the sources of incidents it tracked , but it did not list China as the top source of perpetrators .
China has been named as the source of many online attacks over the past year , but it didnt make the list of top 10 countries by perpetrators .
Leading the list were the U.S. , the United Kingdom and Nigeria .
Microsoft has blamed computer makers for the Windows XP service pack three ( SP3 ) install debacle that has wreaked havoc on PCs .
The firm said today that the endless reboot cock - up reported by many XP customers after installing SP3 was not a new issue .
In fact , Microsoft first identified the problem when Windows XP SP2 was released four years ago .
It said that the snafu , in part , relates to original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) – understood to include the world ’s biggest computer vendor Hewlett - Packard – loading the wrong " Sysprepped " * XP image on to machines with non-Intel chipsets .
“ Microsoft is aware of a reboot issue experienced by some users who have attempted to install Windows XP SP3 , ” said a Microsoft spokesman .
“ While the root cause of this issue is complex , it results from OEMs improperly placing a Windows XP image created for an Intel - based computer onto machines with non-Intel chipsets .
Microsoft issued guidance to OEMs advising them to only load Windows XP images onto like hardware in 2004 . ”
Indeed , the software giant also updated a knowledge base document ( 888372 ) on the same day it spat out the final XP service pack on 6 May .
It points out that the Intel processor driver ( Intelppm.sys ) may try to load on non-Intel - based PCs because of an errant registry key left over from the original Sysprep image that was intended for Intel machines only .
The Microsoft spokesman , however , added that : “ Until we complete our investigation , it would be premature to comment on any theory . ”
That suggests the firm is looking into more than one issue with installs of SP3 .
Meanwhile , AMD has responded to our request for comment – perhaps unsurprisingly , it sang from the same hymn sheet as Microsoft on the service pack blunder :
“ The problem is the result of applying a non-AMD processor Windows operating system image to AMD processor - based PCs ; this is a configuration issue only and not an HP platform , AMD processor , or operating system issue , ” it said .
However , the chip maker also reckons that Microsoft is working on a fix that should be available in the next few days .
Many will probably find that a surprising , and perhaps even optimistic statement , given that the Sysprep image issue has been something that Redmond , OEMs and chip vendors have been aware of since 2004 .
Yesterday we reported one theory from Reg reader Gary who pointed out that Microsoft appears to have left key updates out of the automatic version of SP3 ( 316MB ) , given that it ’s missing 238 MB compared to the manual .ISO version of the service pack ( 554MB ) .
So perhaps the fix is a simple one – Microsoft will bundle all the necessary processor drivers onto the automatic update .
But while the outcome remains uncertain , we recommend you take Gary ’s advice and install the manual version by downloading the full .ISO file onto a CD . ®
Bootnote
* The Sysprep tool is widely used by IT bods , especially those who support hundreds of users people in big organisations , in order to speed up deployment of the same model of Windows - based machines by using one image containing all the relevant drivers .
The authority says it wants to protect sex workers Plans to legalise prostitution for the 2010 football World Cup in South Africa have been criticised by religious groups and opposition parties .
The local authority in Durban wants legalised adult entertainment venues during the tournament .
But African Nazareth Democratic Movement ( ANDM ) president Thokozani Hlatshwayo said the proposal was " against the word of God " .
Opposition parties fear that , if introduced , it could become permanent .
The main opposition Democratic Alliance and the youth wing of the Inkatha Freedom Party ( IFP ) have condemned the suggestion .
" Plans to legalise Durban 's red- light districts before the 2010 World Cup should be condemned in the strongest possible manner , " said Pat Lebenya - Ntanzi of the IFP youth brigade .
She said the South African government was sending out mixed messages to young people .
" On the one hand it preaches strong family values and moral regeneration , but on the other hand they want to legalise prostitution on Durban 's streets .
It does n't make sense , " she said .
An additional concern is Aids - some five million people in South Africa are HIV - positive - making it one of the world 's worst - hit countries .
Thrives Durban 's municipality said Germany had many adult entertainment centres during the World Cup in 2006 , which were very popular with visitors .
It said while prostitution was illegal in South Africa , it could not ignore the fact that the sex industry thrives during major events like the World Cup .
To address this , entertainment centres such as strip clubs and escort agencies would be located in special areas where they would be safe and easily accessible .
Municipality Deputy Mayor Logie Naidoo said a final decision had not yet been taken .
" The national government will give us a lead in this matter , whether it relates to the 2010 Soccer World Cup or any other time for that matter , " he said .
Safe environments
City officials admit that there are already young girls and women working as prostitutes on the streets of Durban .
They say plans are already in place to help them operate in safe environments .
We would support any legalisation of sex work
Nicola Fick , Sweat
In January , MP George Lekgetho called for prostitution to be legalised during the tournament .
" It is one of the things that would make it a success , " he said .
He told parliament that it would help cut incidences of rape .
The BBC's Mpho Lakaje in Johannesburg says his suggestion was met with derision by other MPs .
But a group representing sex workers welcomed it .
" We would support any legalisation of sex work , particularly during the 2010 World Cup , " Nicola Fick from the Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Task Force ( Sweat ) told the BBC .
The idea of legalising sex workers was first proposed last year by police commissioner Jackie Selebi , who has since been suspended over corruption charges .

he alignment requirement of your target platform is usually transparent .
However , when you need to send or receive objects via a network connection , serialize objects , design heterogeneous containers , or construct different types of objects on a pre-determined memory address , there 's no escape from poking into your compiler 's alignment scheme .
With the addition of alignment facilities to C++0x , probing and overriding the default alignment of your types becomes simpler , portable , and more intuitive .
Your program needs to be able to determine the alignment of a certain type and tweak it if necessary .
How do you do that without resorting to non-portable and risky hacks ?
Use the new alignof and alignaskeywords to detect and modify the alignment of a given type .
Presenting the Problem
Suppose you 're writing a class that has to be used by various clients , each running on a different platform .
The default alignment of your target machine is four bytes .
However , some of your clients use 64 - bit RISC architectures with a fundamental alignmentrequirement of 16 bytes :
class Session // must have 16 byte alignment { long long timestamp ; uid_t client_id ; int authorizations ; bool active ; public : Session ( ) ; //... } ;
A uniform alignment value for Session will ensure that every client will reconstruct a Sessionobject correctly from the same stream of bytes .
A uniform alignment value will also enable you to serialize sessions into a file or store them in a remote database .
In C++03 , the only way to ensure a uniform alignment value on every target platform is by using compilation flags and attributes .
The problem is that compilation flags and attributes are n't portable , to say the least .
Additionally , they complicate the deployment and maintenance of your apps , and clutter up your code .
Incompatible alignment values are a common problem .
These lead to linkage errors ( because the size of a class is encoded in its mangled name ) , or worse , runtime crashes and buffer overflows .
Two new keywords : alignas and alignofwere recently added to the C++0 x standard .
Let 's see how you can use them to control the alignment of Session .
The first Debian Lenny live CDs ( beta )

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE ----- Hash : SHA1 Debian Live Lenny Beta1 =======================
The Debian Live team [ 0 ] is pleased to announce the first beta of Debian Lenny 's Live images .
Although we missed releasing images for Etch along with the installer images , we are now prepared to release live images within the regular Lenny release process .
This is the first official release of Debian Live and the whole team has been working hard during the past 2.5 years [ 1 ] to make Debian 's own [ 2 ] live systems become a reality .
Nevertheless , we do need your help to find more bugs and improve the live systems , so please try them out .
The images are available at : http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/lenny_live_beta1/
Please also have a look at the known issues listed below .
Main features
=============
100 % Debian - ------------
The build process of Debian Live basically consists of creating a Debian chroot , installing one or more kernels along with live - initramfs [ 3 ] ( a set of hooks into initramfs - tools for handling booting from read - only media ) and generating a bootable image from that .
This process is handled by live - helper [ 4 ] , a collection of shell scripts that allow us to automate and customize this process .
Considerable care [ 5 ] is taken to ensure that the resulting live system is not tainted by the host system and that installed packages are not modified more than absolutely necessary .
This ensures that Debian Live really * is* Debian , and not " just another " a Debian - based live system .
Flavours - --------
Although live - helper is a toolkit to produce your very own live systems with only a few steps , we also provide prebuilt images that are meant to be used as reference systems for end -users .
Currently , this consists of the three major desktop environments ( GNOME , KDE and Xfce ) , as well as a small ' standard ' image without a graphical environment .
For the desktop environments , package selection is performed by ' tasksel ' with the respective desktop task , whilst the ' standard ' image contains only packages of " Priority : standard " or greater , notwithstanding a handful of live - specific packages ( console - common , eject , file , kbd , live - initramfs , locales , sudo and vim - tiny ) .
Image types - -----------
Debian
Live offers prebuilt images for CD / DVD discs , USB sticks ( or any HD - media - like device ) , tarballs ( for PXE netboot ) as well as a bare squashfs image to boot from the web [ 6 ] directly .
Live Magic - ---------- Live Magic [ 7 ] is an GUI frontend around the live - helper scripts , offering a subset of the features of live - helper in an easy - to - use graphical user interface .
live - magic 1.0 was recently uploaded to sid and is the recommended version .
It currently supports 7 languages .
Live Installer - -------------- Live Installer [ 8 ] is a special udeb for the Debian Installer that ( optionally ) replaces a part of d-i in order to install the system from the live image instead of to bootstrapping it from .deb packages .
This way , a live system can be easily installed to the harddisk , ensuring that the look and feel of the installation ( including preseeding ) works the same as the regular installer process .
Unfortunately , live - installer does still have a few minor bugs left and is thus not included in our builds yet ; we hope to be able to include it in the next beta .
Known issues in this release ============================ *
The prebuilt images for gnome - desktop and kde - desktop are a bit too big to fit on a CD .
Although the automatic installation of Recommends was disabled to build the images , they are still too big .
This will need further tweaking as they are supposed to fit with the next beta .
*
The rescue flavour , containing system rescue and forensic related packages , is missing in this beta release .
*
There will be a DVD image with the next beta that includes all three desktop environments so that you can choose at boot time which system you would like to start .
*
Due to time constraints , the prebuilt images for Beta1 are only covering i386 and amd64 ; with the next beta , powerpc and sparc will follow ( if you wish to test these architectures earlier , please build them yourself ) .
*
The new desktop artwork is not yet included .
*
The syslinux menu is still the old , prompt - based one .
A freshly made new syslinux vgamenu using the official lenny desktop artwork is on the way ( the same as d-i media will use in Lenny ) .
*
No live - installer included yet ( if you wish to test live - installer earlier , please build it yourself ) .
*
No win32 - loader included yet .
* Sid packages used -
At the time of building the live images , both live - helper 1.0.0 - 1 and live - initramfs 1.139.1 - 1 from sid were used .
Since the latter has not yet migrated to testing , it was included manually as a local package .
This is undesirable , as the release is supposed to be self - contained - however , it is just a convenient workaround as both were granted freeze exception and will migrate soon .
Plans for next Beta release ===========================
We are looking forward to upload Beta2 in about two weeks from now ( maybefollowed by a third beta ) with one final RC after that which should be identical to the final release .
Some more details about the open things we would like to address in Beta2 and later can be found at the wiki page [ 9 ] .
The Debian Live team is still looking for more contributors for new features ( post - lenny , though ) as well as documentation writers for the manual ( always ) .
If you care about live systems , please join and help [ 10 ] !
Thanks ======
Last but not least , our thanks goes to everyone who has contributed [ 11 ] and to all maintainers that have kindly fixed live - specific bugs in their packages .

Jeff , thought I 'd send along pictures a friend took today of my mile - high organic garden in progress .
You can post this if you think it might inspire others to plant a garden .
Potatoes , Blue Hopi Corn , Indian peas , beans and melons from a mile - high plus tribe , carrots , beets , tomatoes , etc .
I use a no - till method of gardening , in which the earthworms do the cultivation .
A 6 - inch layer of straw makes for no weeding and a steady source of food for the worms .
A manifold and soaker hose system of watering makes the garden pretty much a plant and harvest labor .
I leave the potatoes , beets and carrots in the ground after frost and shovel off the snow and harvest from under the straw as needed all the way into June .
In friendship , Gary jacob48@citlink.net
I ’m now officially an unemployed breathing object and I ’m very happy of my decision after being skeptical in quitting my day job .
There are many disadvantages and advantages of being self - employed , but I ’m always looking forward to the “ pros ” of freelance life and pretending to be blind about the “ cons ” of it .
Many thanks to KurisKuris.com for providing us with a free Black Kuris Kuris™ artwork that was used to cover the corporate slave box in the cartoon above .
After writing a resignation letter , I was surprised that we Filipinos have the highest rate of resigning employees in the whole world , based on Google Trends .
Filipinos are always looking for Resignation Letter samples that ’s why the search trend is so high .
Because of this , I was also enticed to share my resignation letter online so that people who wants to quit their day ( and also night ) job and are looking for it can use it and edit it freely to quench their resignation letter thirst .
Hehehe .
But , before using this resignation letter , please leave a link back to this blog or add my URL at the end of your resignation letter before printing it or before sending it through e-mail .
( Nahh .. you can use it freely if you want to without the link back or any copyright marks ) .
Here ’s my resignation letter !
Yay !
Dear Sir ______ ,
Before anything else , allow me to express my sincerest apology for all the disappointments that I had brought to you .
I am very sorry for being absent without permission and delaying all the pending assignments .
It was a momentary lapse of judgment on my part and I regret doing so .
For the past two years , I have been so happy and thankful to be a part of the team .
My experience working for the company is wonderful .
You have welcomed me with open arms .
Despite my shortcomings as an employee , you have remained patient and supportive in building me professionally and personally .
For these , I am forever grateful to you and the company .
I have always considered it an honor and privilege to be a part of the family .
Unfortunately , there have been some realizations on my part lately .
The goals I want to pursue no longer coincide with the company goals .
As you may recall I cannot finish the tasks that you have assigned to me .
It took me so many days to finish a specific job that was supposed to be done in a day or two .
Quite frankly , I do n’t want to resign but I deemed it necessary .
I was supposed to file for an indefinite leave but this is too much to ask .
Hence , I decided to resign .
It was a difficult decision to make but in the end I had to be honest to myself and also put the company ’s interest in mind .
I am not applying or accepting any job offers from other companies as of the moment .
I plan to do some freelance work while sorting out what I would really like to pursue in the future .
I ’ll be back in the office to get my stuff and turn over my work this week or next week .
I would be glad to extend my assistance to facilitate the transition of the work to the next employee if needed .
Once again , thank you for all the invaluable lessons you have taught me and making me a part of the company .
I will be missing you and the whole team as well .
I love you all , really .
Best Regards ,
Jehzeel
Drama no ?
Hehehe .
That ’s all for now .
Good luck nalang sa akin 🙂

GLOBAL sales of recorded music fell by 8 % in 2007 , according to figures released in June by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry , a trade group .
It blamed 70 % of the decline on “ file - sharing ” software , which allows internet users to exchange music and video without paying for it .
Industry groups have sued thousands of users of such software , and have supported legislation to criminalise it .
But file - sharing has so far proved impossible to stop .
And it is not all bad news for the industry , because it can provide helpful insights into music - lovers ' interests .
For every song that is bought legally , in shops or online , around 20 songs are illegally downloaded , according to BigChampagne , a firm based in Beverly Hills , California , that compiles and sells statistics about file - sharing .
Its customers can find out how many times , and where , a song has been illicitly downloaded , for example , what the figure was five weeks ago , what other music its fans like , and so on .
“ It does n't make sense to put your head in the sand , ” says Ken Bunt , head of marketing at Disney 's Hollywood Records , a BigChampagne customer .
One of Hollywood Records ' artists , Jesse McCartney , is particularly popular in Italy , so that might be a good place for a tour , says Mr Bunt .
David Ross , the editor of Music Row , the largest country - music trade journal , based in Nashville , Tennessee , says the “ anti-intellectual argument ” not to use such data is emotional nonsense .
Music
Row publishes file - sharing figures , as well as conventional charts .
Such information can help managers promote their artists .
Jennifer Bird of Red Light Management , a management agency in Los Angeles , says her agency knows the names and geographic destinations of the 7.5 billion songs swapped in 2007 .
That is a big help if you are trying to work out whether people are raving about an artist — or merely about a song .
And planning joint tours is easier when you know what other music an artist 's fans listen to .
BigChampagne 's latest venture , launched this month , extends its monitoring to television programmes and films , which are also widely shared online .
Knowing what is popular among file - sharers could help broadcasters and film studios when negotiating with advertisers , for example .
Hulu , a website operated by News Corporation that offers free , advertising - supported video - streaming , already uses file - sharing statistics to design its programming and to set advertising rates .
Many music executives were reluctant to take advantage of file - sharing statistics because of the trouble the technology has caused in the industry , says Eric Garland , BigChampagne 's boss .
TV stations and film studios , by contrast , are “ sprinting through the stages of grief ” — and coming to terms with the reality that details of the illegal use of their material can , in fact , be very useful indeed .
Every time I read a Bernanke speech , I cannot screen out my memory of Ron Moody as Fagin in Oliver !
“ I ’m reviewing the situation . ” Fagin was boxed in , facing tough decisions .
Every option was a looming disaster .
But Fagin remained confident that there was a way out , somewhere , somehow .
Moody ’s performance was pure Bernanke , four decades early .
He even had a beard .
See the video .
I wish every member of Congress would .
It would help dissipate the illusion .
Here is the latest example : his July 8 speech .
It sent the Dow up by over 150 points .
The market had been struggling all day until the speech .
Yet the speech offered nothing new .
Officially , the speech dealt with mortgage lending , as well it should .
This is the hole in the financial dike .
As always , he surveyed new policies to deal with a future crisis that will do nothing to end this crisis — merely cover up its effects on large banks ’ balance sheets .
The recent experience , including the broader turmoil we have seen in the financial markets , will have — indeed , is already having — important consequences for U.S. regulatory policy .
First , regulators are taking action to strengthen consumer protections .
Next week , the Federal Reserve Board will issue new rules on mortgage lending , using its authorities under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act .
These new rules , which will apply to all lenders and not just banks , will address some of the problems that have surfaced in recent years in mortgage lending , especially high - cost mortgage lending .
The new rules will apply to future loans .
But what of the horse that is out of the barn ?
What about falling real estate prices , falling mortgage equity , and falling consumer confidence ?
He did not say .
Second , regulatory policy can help to ensure that mortgage credit is available to qualified borrowers , including those of low and moderate incomes .
It was the absence of qualified borrowers that created the crisis .
The entire regulatory structure was deliberately set up to encourage — read : subsidize — home ownership by people who were not qualified borrowers .
The subsidies worked !
Oh , how well they worked !
The borrowers are now unable to make their mortgage payments .
There are millions of them .
Who will replace them as mortgage - paying owners ?
Bernanke did not say .
What institutional negative sanctions against delaying the sale of these foreclosed empty houses at market - clearing prices will be imposed by the new regulatory program ?
Bernanke did not say .
The new program will operate on the assumption that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — whose stocks have collapsed by 60 % so far this year — will be solvent and active .
Note the key word : if .
In particular , I welcome recent efforts to improve the regulatory oversight of the government - sponsored enterprises , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
If these firms are strong , well - regulated , well - capitalized , and focused on their mission , they will be better able to serve their function of increasing access to mortgage credit , without posing undue risks to the financial system or the taxpayer .
Then , as always , he surveyed what everyone knows .
A survey of the obvious is a large section in every Bernanke speech .
Third , instability in our financial system over the past year or so has importantly affected the availability and terms of credit and the pace of economic growth .
Thus , beyond actions focused on mortgage markets , regulators must consider what can be done to make the U.S. financial system itself more stable , without compromising the dynamism and innovation that has been its hallmark .
This is sometimes referred to as squaring the circle .
Or putting round pegs in square holes .
It is the Goldilocks goal : getting things just right .
Who will achieve this ?
The same regulatory agencies that oversaw the bubble and did nothing to stop it ; indeed , which funded it .
No one has been fired for incompetence .
The same equally alert government planners are still in charge , still doing their job in the name of The People .
There is good news , he said : government committees have studied the whole question .
Several bodies , including the President ’s Working Group ( PWG ) in the United States and the international Financial Stability Forum , have recently issued comprehensive reports on the lessons of the financial turmoil with recommendations for regulators and the private sector .
Many of these recommendations are being implemented .
. . .
Then he got to the point : “ In the remainder of my remarks , I would like to discuss this more general issue of promoting financial stability , including some of the lessons learned , what the Federal Reserve is already doing , and how we as a society might wish to go about strengthening our financial system for the future . ”
He surveyed the Bear Stearns collapse .
The collapse of Bear Stearns was triggered by a run of its creditors and customers , analogous to the run of depositors on a commercial bank .
This run was surprising , however , in that Bear Stearns ’s borrowings were largely secured — that is , its lenders held collateral to ensure repayment even if the company itself failed .
However , the illiquidity of markets in mid-March was so severe that creditors lost confidence that they could recoup their loans by selling the collateral .
Hence , they refused to renew their loans and demanded repayment .
All true .
All unsolved .
All waiting to happen again .
Bear Stearns ’s contingency planning had not envisioned a sudden loss of access to secured funding , so it did not have adequate liquidity to meet those demands for repayment .
Translation : “ It was nip and tuck . ”
If a sale of the firm could not have been arranged , it would have filed for bankruptcy .
Our analyses persuaded us and our colleagues at the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and the Treasury that allowing Bear Stearns to fail so abruptly at a time when the financial markets were already under considerable stress would likely have had extremely adverse implications for the financial system and for the broader economy .
In particular , Bear Stearns ’ failure under those circumstances would have seriously disrupted certain key secured funding markets and derivatives markets and possibly would have led to runs on other financial firms .
To protect the financial system and the economy , the Federal Reserve facilitated the acquisition of Bear Stearns by the commercial bank JPMorgan Chase .
He is sill arguing that the financial system was bordering on collapse .
He may even believe it .
But no one saw it coming at the beginning of the week in which the collapse almost took place .
Why should we believe that anyone will see the next one coming ?
Then came the Great Securities Swap .
We supplemented our actions regarding Bear Stearns by establishing the Primary Dealer Credit Facility ( PDCF ) .
Under the PDCF , the Fed stands ready to make fully collateralized loans to the remaining four major investment banks plus other broker - dealers , called primary dealers , that transact regularly with the Federal Reserve .
The Fed also created the Term Securities Lending Facility ( TSLF ) , which allows primary dealers to borrow Treasury securities using other types of assets as collateral .
These new facilities assured the secured creditors of primary dealers that those firms had sufficient access to liquidity , reducing the danger of runs like the one experienced by Bear Stearns .
Although short - term funding markets remain strained , they have improved somewhat since March , reflecting the availability of several Fed lending facilities as well as the ongoing efforts of financial firms to repair their balance sheets and increase their liquidity .
The FED surrendered about half of its accumulated Treasury debt assets in a few weeks — reserves that had taken since 1914 to accumulate .
This should make investors calm ?
What happens when the piggy bank of Treasury debt is empty ?
What will serve as additional legal cover up for primary dealer balance sheet insolvency then ?
The FED will cross that bridge when it comes to it .
It is clear that there is nothing temporary about the program .
It will continue until the FED runs out of Treasury debt to swap .
That could be next year .
See this chart .
It was an emergency , so the program was justified .
But what justifies its continuation ?
Obviously , a continuing emergency .
But he did not draw this conclusion .
Neither did stock market investors .
The PDCF and the TSLF were created under the Federal Reserve ’s emergency lending powers , with the term of the PDCF set for a period of at least six months , through mid-September .
The Federal Reserve is strongly committed to supporting the stability and improved functioning of the financial system .
We are currently monitoring developments in financial markets closely and considering several options , including extending the duration of our facilities for primary dealers beyond year - end , should the current unusual and exigent circumstances continue to prevail in dealer funding markets .
Translation : “ The temporary bailout is far from over .
The banking system is still at risk . ”
He assured his listeners that other plans are being considered .
But all of them are merely monitoring issues .
There is no solution offered .
He promised this : Prudential Regulation and Supervision .
But that was what we supposedly had from 2000 to 2006 .
It failed .
He admitted that there were — and are — serious problems .
From a regulatory and supervisory perspective , the investment banks and the other primary dealers raise some distinct issues .
First , as I noted , neither the firms nor the regulators anticipated the possibility that investment banks would lose access to secured financing , as Bear Stearns did .
Translation : “ Nobody saw it coming . ”
Second , in the absence of countervailing regulatory measures , the Fed ’s decision to lend to primary dealers — although it was necessary to avoid serious financial disruptions — could tend to make market discipline less effective in the future .
Translation : “ It was a big bank bailout , pure and simple — moral hazard in action .
It was the number - one task of all central banks has always been : protecting the commercial banking cartel from a breakdown due to the failure of one or more large banks . ”
Going forward , the regulation and supervision of these institutions must take account of these realities .
At the same time , reforms in the oversight of these firms must recognize the distinctive features of investment banking and take care neither to unduly inhibit efficiency and innovation nor to induce a migration of risk - taking activities to institutions that are less regulated or beyond our borders .
Translation : “ We could sink the economy either way .
We do n’t know what we ’re doing , any more than Bear Stearns did .
But we talk a good line .
And we still have half our Treasury debt in reserve .
So far , so good . ”
Since March , the Federal Reserve has been working closely with the SEC , which is the functional supervisor of each of the primary dealers and the consolidated supervisor of the four large firms that are not affiliated with banks ( the so - called investment banks ) .
Translation : “ The Federal Reserve System and the Securities and Exchange Commission are like two drunks trying to make it home after a night on the town .
We hold up each other . ”
Federal Reserve examiners are in place at the four investment banks and , along with our SEC colleagues , are monitoring the conditions of the other primary dealers .
In cooperation with the SEC and the investment banks themselves , we are evaluating the capital and liquidity positions of these firms with the objective of ensuring that they are strong enough to withstand severe stresses in the financial environment .
In the past few months , these firms have raised capital and expanded their liquidity cushions to protect themselves against extreme events .
Translation : “ We do a lot of monitoring .
We watch the patient ’s EKG .
We will know when to bring in the electro - shock pads .
Trust us . ”
To formalize our effective working relationship , the SEC and the Federal Reserve recently agreed to a memorandum of understanding ( MOU ) .
Under the MOU , the SEC and the Fed will freely share information and analyses pertaining to the financial conditions of primary dealers .
The two agencies have also agreed to work jointly with the firms to support their continued efforts to strengthen their balance sheets , their liquidity , and their risk - management practices .
In short , do n’t worry .
“ Everything is OK .
We have an acronym : MOU .
Already , you should feel better . ”
The Federal Reserve , together with other regulators and the private sector , is engaged in a broad effort to strengthen the financial infrastructure .
In doing so , we aim not only to help make the financial system better able to withstand future shocks but also — by reducing the range of circumstances in which systemic stability concerns might prompt government intervention — to mitigate moral hazard and the problem of “ too big to fail . ”
Translation : “ Mitigate = Guarantee . ”
More generally , both the operational performance under stress of key payment and settlements systems and their ability to manage counterparty and market risks are critical to the stability of the broader financial system .
Currently , the Federal Reserve relies on a patchwork of authorities , largely derived from our role as a banking supervisor , as well as on moral suasion to help ensure that the various payments and settlements systems have the necessary procedures and controls in place to manage their risks .
By contrast , most major central banks around the world have an explicit statutory basis for their oversight of payment systems , and in recent years a growing number of central banks have been given statutory authority to oversee securities settlement systems as well .
Given how important robust payment and settlement systems are to financial stability , a strong case can be made for granting the Federal Reserve explicit oversight authority for systemically important payment and settlement systems .
Translation : “ To centralize power , a private monopoly needs a frightened Congress .
Congress today is peeing in its pants .
The Great Centralization is on the way . ”
As part of its review of how best to increase financial stability , and as has been suggested by Secretary Paulson , the Congress may wish to consider whether new tools are needed for ensuring an orderly liquidation of a systemically important securities firm that is on the verge of bankruptcy , together with a more formal process for deciding when to use those tools .
Translation : “ Sit up .
Roll over .
Good Congress ! ”
That said , holding the Fed more formally accountable for promoting financial stability makes sense only if the institution ’s powers are consistent with its responsibilities .
Translation : “ Accountable = more power . ”
The Federal Reserve will continue its efforts to make our financial system stronger and more resilient , so that it can continue to play its necessary role of supporting economic growth and making credit available to all qualified borrowers .
Translation : “ The FED has created every boom - bust crisis since 1914 .
It gets more power from Congress after every crisis .
There will therefore be more crises .
Get used to it . ”
CONCLUSION
This is the same old government - licensed , monopolistic song and dance .
The cure for failure is to transfer even greater power to the agency in charge .
The cure for the horse that escaped from the barn is a new , improved system of regulations governing barn door oversight .
This has been going on since 1914 .
Congress never figures it out .

A 60 - year - old librarian received a trespassing ticket today after a liberal group ’s protest outside a John McCain town hall meeting Monday .
Clutching a sign that read “ McCain = Bush , ” Carol Kreck was removed from the atrium at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts by four Denver police officers .
Kreck , a former Denver Post reporter who works part - time as a librarian for an education think tank , said she was removed as she quizzed a police officer about whether he could deny her free speech “ on city property ” by taking away her sign , while McCain supporters wore buttons inside .
Jenny Schiavone , a spokeswoman for the performing arts center , said the venue is city - owned rental property , but is not legally defined as public property .
The liberal group ProgressNowAction had called before the event and asked about being inside the atrium , she said .
The group was told it would have to rent space or use previously designated protest areas along the street , Schiavone said .
Michael Huttner , who organized the rally , said Progress NowAction was not told to rent space or stand anywhere .
A Youtube video of Kreck ’s removal , posted by Progress NowAction , shows a performing arts center security officer asking Kreck to put down her sign , noting he had asked her and other protestors to do so earlier .
In the same video , a police officer tells her she can attend the event if she gets rid of the sign .
A McCain spokesman said no one , including McCain supporters , were allowed to carry signs .
Detective John
White , a spokesman for the Denver Police Department , said officers acted as they would for any complaint on private property .
“ Our officers received a signed complaint from a security guard at a private event and acted accordingly , ” he said .
Tom Kise , a spokesman for the McCain campaign , did not know about Kreck ’s ouster , but said the town hall - style meeting was open to supporters and opponents .
“ All the campaign asked for is a respectful dialogue , ” Kise said .
At a speech at the University of Denver in May , war protesters interrupted McCain four times until they were removed from the event .

Who knew Nancy Pelosi was such a straight - shooter ?
When Wolf Blitzer tries to pin part of the blame for the current energy crisis on the Democratic Congress , Pelosi shoots back by saying her House did everything it could to institute a sensible energy policy , only to have " run into a brick wall " in the form of Senate Republicans -- you know , the ones who broke the filibuster record for a full term last year .

" The price of oil is ... is attributed to two oil men in the White House and their protectors in the United States Senate . "
While it might be easy ( and typically accurate ) to blame everything on President Bush and Vice President Cheney , I do n't think it 's unreasonable to lay the current crisis at the White House 's doorstep .
Sure , there are some uncontrollable market forces at work , but both Cheney and Bush are oil patch guys ; it would be the height of naivete to assume that they would have an energy policy that did n't benefit Big Oil .
From Day One , Dick Cheney was plotting how to take over Iraq oil fields .
Before the war , it was obvious to everyone that the invasion or Iraq , and the instability it would caused in the region , would only drive prices up further .
For all the lip service President Bush pays to his commitment to renewable energy , the fact is spending has been on the stagnant since the mid-1990's .
What we really need is a leader with the wisdom to acknowledge the magnitude of the problem and the courage to tackle it head on .
" Green Screen " John McCain is clearly not that leader .
Foreigners have been America 's best friend over the last couple of years .
They 've kept bailing us out .
Whether it be dodgy real estate , or even dodgier banks , foreign money is just about the only thing keeping the financial system afloat .
But as the Economist reports , it looks like Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac's ( FRE ) crisis has recently been exacerbated by Chinese and other Asian central banks saying enough is enough .
The Economist :
Spreads on the $ 1.5 trillion of paper issued on their own behalf have widened significantly .
A five - year issue by Freddie on Tuesday sold for 1.13 percentage points over treasury bonds , the highest spread for at least a decade .
As recently as May , Freddie had found takers at 0.69 points over treasuries .
A sudden pullback by overseas investors is largely to blame .
Foreigners , mostly Asian central banks and funds , hold 35 - 40 % of the mortgage agencies ’ total debt .
They continued to be avid buyers this year , but their appetite waned dramatically in the first half of August .
... The situation in agency - backed MBS is even worse , with foreign buyers all but on strike .
China ’s central bank , which alone had been lapping up more than $ 5 billion - worth a month , has barely touched the stuff in recent weeks .
The spread on the securities has risen to around 2.2 percentage points over government bonds , even wider than it was during March ’s turmoil ( after adjusting for today ’s lower volatility ) .
All of which means that the US is going to have to eat its own cooking from now on .
Prepare the vomitorium .

Antibiotics :
Are you misusing them ?
Find out how overuse of antibiotics has increased the number of medication - resistant germs — and what you can do to help stop this health threat .
By Mayo Clinic Staff
Antibiotics are important medications .
It would be difficult to overstate the benefits of penicillin and other antibiotics in treating bacterial infections , preventing the spread of disease and reducing serious complications of disease .
But some medications that used to be standard treatments for bacterial infections are now less effective or do n't work at all .
When an antibiotic no longer has an effect on a certain strain of bacteria , those bacteria are said to be antibiotic resistant .
Antibiotic resistance is one of the world 's most pressing health problems .
The overuse and misuse of antibiotics are key factors contributing to antibiotic resistance .
The general public , doctors and hospitals all play a role in ensuring proper use of the medications and minimizing the development of antibiotic resistance .
What causes antibiotic resistance ?
A bacterium resists a medication when the bacterium has changed in some way .
The change either protects the bacterium from the action of the medication or neutralizes the medication .
Any bacterium that survives an antibiotic treatment can multiply and pass on its resistant properties .
Also , some bacteria can transfer their medication - resistant properties to other bacteria — as if passing along a cheat sheet to help each other survive .
The fact that bacteria develop resistance to a medication is normal and expected .
But the way that medications are used affects how quickly and to what extent resistance occurs .
Overuse of antibiotics
The overuse of antibiotics — especially taking antibiotics even when they 're not the appropriate treatment — promotes antibiotic resistance .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , up to one - third to one - half of antibiotic use in humans is unnecessary or inappropriate .
Antibiotics treat bacterial infections but not viral infections .
For example , an antibiotic is an appropriate treatment for strep throat , which is caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes .
But it 's not the right treatment for most sore throats , which are caused by viruses .
Other common viral infections that do n't benefit from antibiotic treatment include :
Cold
Flu ( influenza )
Bronchitis
Most coughs
Some ear infections
Some sinus infections
Stomach flu
Taking an antibiotic for a viral infection :
Wo n't cure the infection
Wo n't keep other people from getting sick
Wo n't help you or your child feel better
May cause unnecessary and harmful side effects
Promotes antibiotic resistance
If you take an antibiotic when you actually have a viral infection , the antibiotic attacks bacteria in your body — bacteria that are either beneficial or at least not causing disease .
This misdirected treatment can then promote antibiotic - resistant properties in harmless bacteria that can be shared with other bacteria , or create an opportunity for potentially harmful bacteria to replace the harmless ones .
Taking antibiotics responsibly
It 's tempting to stop taking an antibiotic as soon as you feel better .
But the full treatment is necessary to kill the disease - causing bacteria .
Failure to take an antibiotic as prescribed can result in the need to resume treatment later and may promote the spread of antibiotic - resistant properties among harmful bacteria .
Consequences of antibiotic resistance
For many years , the introduction of new antibiotics outpaced the development of antibiotic resistance .
In recent years , however , the pace of medication resistance has contributed to an increasing number of health care problems .
Approximately 2 million infections from antibiotic - resistant bacteria occur in the United States each year , resulting in 23,000 deaths .
Other consequences of medication - resistant infections include :
More - serious illness
Longer recovery
More - frequent or longer hospitalization
More doctor visits
More - expensive treatments
Antibiotic stewardship
The appropriate use of antibiotics — often called antibiotic stewardship — can help to :
Preserve the effectiveness of current antibiotics
Extend the life span of current antibiotics
Protect people from antibiotic - resistant infections
Avoid side effects from using antibiotics inappropriately
Many hospitals and medical associations have implemented new diagnostic and treatment guidelines to ensure effective treatments for bacterial infections and reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics .
The public also plays a role in antibiotic stewardship .
You can help reduce the development of antibiotic resistance if you :
Avoid pressuring your doctor to give you an antibiotic prescription .
Ask your doctor for advice on how to treat symptoms .
Practice good hygiene , to avoid bacterial infections that need antibiotic treatment .
Make sure you and your children receive recommended vaccinations .
Some recommended vaccines protect against bacterial infections , such as diphtheria and whooping cough ( pertussis ) .
Reduce your risk of getting a foodborne bacterial infection .
Do n't drink raw milk , wash your hands , and cook foods to a safe internal temperature .
Use antibiotics only as prescribed by your doctor .
Take the prescribed daily dosage , and complete the entire course of treatment .
Never take leftover antibiotics for a later illness .
They may not be the correct antibiotic and would not be a full course of treatment .
Never take antibiotics prescribed for another person .
I ’m going to take the unpopular position of disagreeing with the guilty verdict of Bill Cosby .
Cosby was on trial for 1 act of sexual assault , yet they let 5 unrelated women testify who had nothing to do with what Cosby was charged with .
And the woman who did charge him was paid 3 million dollars already .
For the other 5 women they are now famous and making a lot of money off this Cosby fame .
There ’s no doubt that Cosby is into a lot of weird sex and drugs .
I personally have had sex with a lot of women while stoned .
But
Pot is n’t that big of a deal and I ’m not famous , nor do I have millions of dollars .
But for people like Cosby the is surrounded by opportunists who would have sex with him to advance their careers , and I ’m sure Cosby took advantage of relationships that are sort of mutual exploitation where both people get what they want .
In a criminal trial the standard of proof is “ beyond a reasonable doubt ” , and in my view when the witnesses have a strong financial incentive to lie then that is reasonable doubt right there .
I ’m not saying I believe Cosby is innocent , or guilty .
I ’m just saying that if I were a juror , I would n’t be able to convict .
I am also predicting this case will be overturned on appeal because I think the testimony of 5 unrelated women is unconstitutional , and the appeals court will strike down the case on that basis .
And the jury asked for a definition of sexual assault and the judge did n’t give them a legal definition .
So I do n’t think you ’re going to see Cosby doing jail time .
Israel 's Supreme Court has ordered the authorities to reroute the barrier at Bilin
European Parliament Vice - President Luisa Morgantini and the Irish Nobel laureate , Mairead Corrigan , have been injured at a protest in the West Bank .
An Italian judge , Julio Toscano , was also hurt when Israeli troops fired tear gas to disperse the demonstration against the West Bank barrier in Bilin .
He suffered head wounds when he was hit by one of the tear - gas canisters .
The incidents came on the last day of an international conference supporting local protests against the barrier .
In September , the Israeli Supreme Court ordered the government to redraw its route near Bilin , accepting an appeal by residents , who had argued it prevented them from reaching 50 % of their agricultural land .
The International Court of Justice issued an advisory ruling in 2004 that the barrier breached international law where it is built on occupied Palestinian territory and should be dismantled .
' Dazzling ' barrage Despite the supreme court 's ruling last year , the Israeli authorities have not yet begun to implement it , meaning Bilin 's residents continue to be prevented from accessing around 200 hectares ( 500 acres ) of their farmland .
Guide : West Bank barrier West Bank village hails victory
The international Conference on Non-violent Resistance held in the village over the past week sought to show solidarity with the continuing protests demanding the structure be dismantled .
Ms Morgantini addressed its opening session .
On the last day of the meeting , 300 Israelis , Palestinians and foreign nationals participated in the village 's weekly demonstration .
According to the protesters , dozens of people were hurt by the tear gas fired by Israeli troops deployed along the barrier , while several were also hit by canisters , including Mr Toscano .
He was later taken to hospital in Ramallah .
One of the protest 's organisers , Yonatan Pollak said that the troops had fired a " dazzling amount " of gas canisters , " about 30 - 40 per barrage " .
The Israel Defence Force said protesters had hurled stones at security forces , who used crowd - dispersal methods in response .
" Those who take part in such protests and violate a closed military zone order should not be surprised to see the IDF respond with tear gas , " it said .

What are these ?
Consumers are just as good as professional economists at predicting the rate of inflation , a new survey finds .
The inflation rate is the percentage increase in the prices of goods and services , and forecasts of the rate influence everything from interest rates to wage negotiations to decisions on whether a person buys a home .
In the past year with rising food and gas prices , the inflation rate has reached 5.5 percent , meaning on average prices have increased by that much between July 2007 and July 2008 .
For comparison , between 1996 and 2006 , the average inflation rate was about 2.5 percent , and in 2007 it rose to 4.4 percent , according to the researchers .
The survey results , detailed in the June issue of the journal The Economic Record and announced this week , suggest the everyday shopper has expertise in one key area , even though the pros employ statistics such as the unemployment rate , money supply growth and exchange rate changes .
Instead of computers and stats , consumers think about their latest grocery bills .
" I'm a little surprised because economists are using sophisticated models , " said Lloyd Thomas , head of the Department of Economics at Kansas State University , " but the consumers know what 's happening with milk prices . "
Thomas and Alan Grant of Baker University in Kansas analyzed surveys of U.S. and Australian consumers collected from 1978 through 2005 .
For the U.S. data they used the Michigan Survey , which involves monthly telephone interviews with 500 households .
The U.S. respondents were asked several questions , including how much prices will go up or down in the next 12 months .
On average , the consumers predicted inflation rates that were off by 1.1 percentage points .
The researchers compared the results with those found with the Livingston Survey of professional economists , finding a similar error in predictions .
For instance , from 1993 through 2005 , U.S. consumers as a whole were off by an average of 0.72 percentage points in forecasting the inflation rate .
Over that same period , economists erred by about 0.82 percentage points .
" It is amazing that economists on the average cannot out - forecast households , " Thomas said .
How do they do it ?
" I think it 's partly because inflation is hard to forecast .
Even the weather plays a part , " Thomas told LiveScience .
" I think some of these basic things that affect prices nobody can forecast , households or professional economists . "
In addition to weather ( a variable that can include the impact of droughts ) , energy prices play a big role .
Even still , the everyday consumer has plenty of data points to go on .
" Households are right there in the nitty - gritty seeing what groceries are doing when they go to the store , seeing what gas prices are doing , " Thomas said .
So what 's in store for next year ?
" Households are forecasting inflation in the next year will be 5.1 percent , " Thomas said , " and that 's a little bit scary because inflation has a lot of negative influences on the economy .
When you have high inflation some people really get hurt by it if they happen to be on a fixed income . "
“ I can no more disown him than I can disown my white grandmother , ” he said , “ a woman who helped raise me , a woman who sacrificed again and again for me , a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world , but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street , and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe . ”
The speech , delivered before a small audience of local supporters , elected officials and clergy members at the National Constitution Center , was broadcast live on cable .
His words were directed at a variety of constituencies , including the superdelegates who , it now seems likely , will decide the nomination , and white voters in states like Pennsylvania that could be vital both in the primary and in the general election .
Mr. Obama stayed up well into the night writing much of the speech himself , aides said .
His words carried familiar strains of the biography he wrote more than a decade ago about his search for racial identity .
In recent days , televised images of Mr. Obama have been accompanied by old sermons of Mr. Wright delivering a blistering critique on white America .
As the days go on , it remains an open question whether the images of the pastor will fall to the side and Mr. Obama ’s campaign message regains its prominence .
This speech was a political risk , his advisers said , whose wisdom may not be fully known for months .
“ It was very dicey at a time when race is misunderstood by some and overplayed by others , ” L. Douglas Wilder , the mayor of Richmond , Va. , who was the nation ’s first elected black governor , said in an interview .
“ It was a very , very difficult subject to bring up .
It had to be approached in a way that was really something of substance . ”
Mr. Obama indicated that he wanted to move quickly to other issues , scheduling two high - profile speeches over the next two days on topics other than race .
“ I suppose the politically safe thing would be to move on from this episode and just hope that it fades into the woodwork , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ We can dismiss Reverend Wright as a crank or a demagogue , just as some have dismissed Geraldine Ferraro , in the aftermath of her recent statements , as harboring some deep - seated racial bias . ”

You check in at the airline ticket counter .
But instead of a boarding pass , you get shackled with an electronic bracelet which tracks your every move , contains all your personal information , and can shock you senseless .
This vision of the future of air security is being floated around the Department of Homeland Security ’s research and development office .
According to a video promoting the so - called EMD Safety Bracelet , all airline passengers would be required to wear it “ until they disembark the flight at their destination . ”
The device , in addition to storing all of your sensitive personal information and tracking you with GPS , would allow someone to activate it remotely and immobilize the wearer for several minutes .
This is EMD , or electro - muscular disruption .
( Article continues below )
And the Department of Homeland Security is interested in buying them .
According to a letter from Paul S. Ruwaldt of the DHS Science and Technology Directorate , the department is interested in using them to control illegal immigrants as well as “ prisoner transportation , detainee control and . . . to improve air security , on passenger planes . ”

My summer so far has been relaxing , but boring ; even so , it is better than the alternative : school .
Albert Einstein once said “ Whatever you do , do n’t let your schooling interfere with your education . ”
While my unhappiness at the thought of school is not as radical , I think he was correct .
This talk about school reminds me of one of the funnier incidents in school – we could forever change schooling .
My social studies teacher , Mr. Goldberg , had told us the day before to study for a “ pop quiz ” , ten questions long , about the Catholic Church in Europe .
I , who never bother to study and still manage a 4.0 , disregarded preparing for this quiz , as did many others .
The test was impossibly hard !
The following day , when he handed out the papers , I looked at it and quite literally blinked .
The best score in the class was a horrendous 6/10 achieved by a few smart students ( me included ) , some of the luckier ones , as well as a few of those that had studied very hard ( that ’s 5 students ) .
Next , Mr. Goldberg told us that it was worth one hundred points .
Even the most robust A+ could not survive a blow like that .
Needless to say , students who cared at all about grades were dying inside .
Ten minutes later , he said there was a notice from the principal :
“ A new suggestion has led to the available purchase of academic points .
For ten cents a point , students may buy an unlimited supply of extra credit . ”
Needless to say , a large debate ensued ; the children who had bad grades and who were ethically uneducated about merit claimed that this was a wonderful change , whereas the children who had good grades , and cared about merit argued that this was downright bribery .
Our consternation increased when Johnny Marreta discovered that he had $ 3.00 in his pocket , and purchased 30 extra credit points , enough to bring his grade up by one letter .
Students like Kevin Shong ( assuredly not Chinese despite his surname ) talked about how much “ money I will bring tomorrow ” and how “ great this is ” .
The next day , our teacher assured us that we could contribute money to “ support the school ” , and people produced money up to $ 20.00 .
Soon , only a few devout scholars had not paid money for a free grade .
Luckily , we discovered that the only teacher in the school supporting this horrid activity was Mr. Goldberg .
Many of our teachers told us that they would not support this , but this was a bitter pill to swallow .
At the end of the week , Mr. Goldberg told us that this was all a joke designed to model the available purchase of pardons / indulgences arranged by the Catholic Church .
All money was returned , and to some relief , and some extensive disappointment , the class was dispersed .
A good thing that came out of it , though , was a laugh and some knowledge … we all knew who the cheaters were !

Imagine a world much like this one , in which , thanks to gene - selection technologies , the average IQ is 140 ( on our scale ) .
Potential Einsteins are one - in - a - thousand , not one - in - a - million ; and they grow up in a school system suited , if not to them personally , then at least to bright kids .
Calculus is routinely taught in sixth grade .
Albert Einstein , himself , still lived and still made approximately the same discoveries , but his work no longer seems exceptional .
Several modern top - flight physicists have made equivalent breakthroughs , and are still around to talk .
( No , this is not the world Brennan lives in . )
One day , the stars in the night sky begin to change .
Some grow brighter .
Some grow dimmer .
Most remain the same .
Astronomical telescopes capture it all , moment by moment .
The stars that change , change their luminosity one at a time , distinctly so ; the luminosity change occurs over the course of a microsecond , but a whole second separates each change .
It is clear , from the first instant anyone realizes that more than one star is changing , that the process seems to center around Earth particularly .
The arrival of the light from the events , at many stars scattered around the galaxy , has been precisely timed to Earth in its orbit .
Soon , confirmation comes in from high - orbiting telescopes ( they have those ) that the astronomical miracles do not seem as synchronized from outside Earth .
Only Earth 's telescopes see one star changing every second ( 1005 milliseconds , actually ) .
Almost the entire combined brainpower of Earth turns to analysis .
It quickly becomes clear that the stars that jump in luminosity , all jump by a factor of exactly 256 ; those that diminish in luminosity , diminish by a factor of exactly 256 .
There is no apparent pattern in the stellar coordinates .
This leaves , simply , a pattern of BRIGHT - dim - BRIGHT - BRIGHT ...
" A binary message ! " is everyone 's first thought .
But in this world there are careful thinkers , of great prestige as well , and they are not so sure .
" There are easier ways to send a message , " they post to their blogs , " if you can make stars flicker , and if you want to communicate .
Something is happening .
It appears , prima facie , to focus on Earth in particular .
To call it a ' message ' presumes a great deal more about the cause behind it .
There might be some kind of evolutionary process among , um , things that can make stars flicker , that ends up sensitive to intelligence somehow ...
Yeah , there 's probably something like ' intelligence ' behind it , but try to appreciate how wide a range of possibilities that really implies .
We do n't know this is a message , or that it was sent from the same kind of motivations that might move us .
I mean , we would just signal using a big flashlight , we would n't mess up a whole galaxy . "
By this time , someone has started to collate the astronomical data and post it to the Internet .
Early suggestions that the data might be harmful , have been ... not ignored , but not obeyed , either .
If anything this powerful wants to hurt you , you 're pretty much dead ( people reason ) .
Multiple research groups are looking for patterns in the stellar coordinates — or fractional arrival times of the changes , relative to the center of the Earth — or exact durations of the luminosity shift — or any tiny variance in the magnitude shift — or any other fact that might be known about the stars before they changed .
But most people are turning their attention to the pattern of BRIGHTS and dims .
It becomes clear almost instantly that the pattern sent is highly redundant .
Of the first 16 bits , 12 are BRIGHTS and 4 are dims .
The first 32 bits received align with the second 32 bits received , with only 7 out of 32 bits different , and then the next 32 bits received have only 9 out of 32 bits different from the second ( and 4 of them are bits that changed before ) .
From the first 96 bits , then , it becomes clear that this pattern is not an optimal , compressed encoding of anything .
The obvious thought is that the sequence is meant to convey instructions for decoding a compressed message to follow ...
" But , " say the careful thinkers , " anyone who cared about efficiency , with enough power to mess with stars , could maybe have just signaled us with a big flashlight , and sent us a DVD ? "
There also seems to be structure within the 32 - bit groups ; some 8 - bit subgroups occur with higher frequency than others , and this structure only appears along the natural alignments ( 32 = 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 ) .
After the first five hours at one bit per second , an additional redundancy becomes clear :
The message has started approximately repeating itself at the 16,385th bit .
Breaking up the message into groups of 32 , there are 7 bits of difference between the 1st group and the 2nd group , and 6 bits of difference between the 1st group and the 513th group .
" A 2D picture ! " everyone thinks .
" And the four 8 - bit groups are colors ; they 're tetrachromats ! "
But it soon becomes clear that there is a horizontal / vertical asymmetry : Fewer bits change , on average , between ( N , N+1 ) versus ( N , N+512 ) .
Which you would n't expect if the message was a 2D picture projected onto a symmetrical grid .
Then you would expect the average bitwise distance between two 32 - bit groups to go as the 2 - norm of the grid separation : √ ( h2 + v2 ) .
There also forms a general consensus that a certain binary encoding from 8 - groups onto integers between - 64 and 191 — not the binary encoding that seems obvious to us , but still highly regular — minimizes the average distance between neighboring cells .
This continues to be borne out by incoming bits .
The statisticians and cryptographers and physicists and computer scientists go to work .
There is structure here ; it needs only to be unraveled .
The masters of causality search for conditional independence , screening - off and Markov neighborhoods , among bits and groups of bits .
The so - called " color " appears to play a role in neighborhoods and screening , so it 's not just the equivalent of surface reflectivity .
People search for simple equations , simple cellular automata , simple decision trees , that can predict or compress the message .
Physicists invent entire new theories of physics that might describe universes projected onto the grid — for it seems quite plausible that a message such as this is being sent from beyond the Matrix .
After receiving 32 * 512 * 256 = 4,194,304 bits , around one and a half months , the stars stop flickering .
Theoretical work continues .
Physicists and cryptographers roll up their sleeves and seriously go to work .
They have cracked problems with far less data than this .
Physicists have tested entire theory - edifices with small differences of particle mass ; cryptographers have unraveled shorter messages deliberately obscured .
Years pass .
Two dominant models have survived , in academia , in the scrutiny of the public eye , and in the scrutiny of those scientists who once did Einstein - like work .
There is a theory that the grid is a projection from objects in a 5 - dimensional space , with an asymmetry between 3 and 2 of the spatial dimensions .
There is also a theory that the grid is meant to encode a cellular automaton — arguably , the grid has several fortunate properties for such .
Codes have been devised that give interesting behaviors ; but so far , running the corresponding automata on the largest available computers , has failed to produce any decodable result .
The run continues .
Every now and then , someone takes a group of especially brilliant young students who've never looked at the detailed binary sequence .
These students are then shown only the first 32 rows ( of 512 columns each ) , to see if they can form new models , and how well those new models do at predicting the next 224 .
Both the 3+2 dimensional model , and the cellular - automaton model , have been well duplicated by such students ; they have yet to do better .
There are complex models finely fit to the whole sequence — but those , everyone knows , are probably worthless .
Ten years later , the stars begin flickering again .
Within the reception of the first 128 bits , it becomes clear that the Second Grid can fit to small motions in the inferred 3+2 dimensional space , but does not look anything like the successor state of any of the dominant cellular automaton theories .
Much rejoicing follows , and the physicists go to work on inducing what kind of dynamical physics might govern the objects seen in the 3+2 dimensional space .
Much work along these lines has already been done , just by speculating on what type of balanced forces might give rise to the objects in the First Grid , if those objects were static — but now it seems not all the objects are static .
As most physicists guessed — statically balanced theories seemed contrived .
Many neat equations are formulated to describe the dynamical objects in the 3+2 dimensional space being projected onto the First and Second Grids .
Some equations are more elegant than others ; some are more precisely predictive ( in retrospect , alas ) of the Second Grid .
One group of brilliant physicists , who carefully isolated themselves and looked only at the first 32 rows of the Second Grid , produces equations that seem elegant to them — and the equations also do well on predicting the next 224 rows .
This becomes the dominant guess .
But these equations are underspecified ; they do n't seem to be enough to make a universe .
A small cottage industry arises in trying to guess what kind of laws might complete the ones thus guessed .
When the Third Grid arrives , ten years after the Second Grid , it provides information about second derivatives , forcing a major modification of the " incomplete but good " theory .
But the theory does n't do too badly out of it , all things considered .
The Fourth Grid does n't add much to the picture .
Third derivatives do n't seem important to the 3+2 physics inferred from the Grids .
The Fifth Grid looks almost exactly like it is expected to look .
And the Sixth Grid , and the Seventh Grid .
( Oh , and every time someone in this world tries to build a really powerful AI , the computing hardware spontaneously melts .
This is n't really important to the story , but I need to postulate this in order to have human people sticking around , in the flesh , for seventy years . )
My moral ?
That even Einstein did not come within a million light - years of making efficient use of sensory data .
Riemann invented his geometries before Einstein had a use for them ; the physics of our universe is not that complicated in an absolute sense .
A Bayesian superintelligence , hooked up to a webcam , would invent General Relativity as a hypothesis — perhaps not the dominant hypothesis , compared to Newtonian mechanics , but still a hypothesis under direct consideration — by the time it had seen the third frame of a falling apple .
It might guess it from the first frame , if it saw the statics of a bent blade of grass .
We would think of it .
Our civilization , that is , given ten years to analyze each frame .
Certainly if the average IQ was 140 and Einsteins were common , we would .
Even if we were human - level intelligences in a different sort of physics — minds who had never seen a 3D space projected onto a 2D grid — we would still think of the 3D -> 2D hypothesis .
Our mathematicians would still have invented vector spaces , and projections .
Even if we 'd never seen an accelerating billiard ball , our mathematicians would have invented calculus ( e.g. for optimization problems ) .
Heck , think of some of the crazy math that 's been invented here on our Earth .
I occasionally run into people who say something like , " There 's a theoretical limit on how much you can deduce about the outside world , given a finite amount of sensory data . "
Yes .
There is .
The theoretical limit is that every time you see 1 additional bit , it cannot be expected to eliminate more than half of the remaining hypotheses ( half the remaining probability mass , rather ) .
And that a redundant message , cannot convey more information than the compressed version of itself .
Nor can a bit convey any information about a quantity , with which it has correlation exactly zero , across the probable worlds you imagine .
But nothing I 've depicted this human civilization doing , even begins to approach the theoretical limits set by the formalism of Solomonoff induction .
It does n't approach the picture you could get if you could search through every single computable hypothesis , weighted by their simplicity , and do Bayesian updates on all of them .
To see the theoretical limit on extractable information , imagine that you have infinite computing power , and you simulate all possible universes with simple physics , looking for universes that contain Earths embedded in them — perhaps inside a simulation — where some process makes the stars flicker in the order observed .
Any bit in the message — or any order of selection of stars , for that matter — that contains the tiniest correlation ( across all possible computable universes , weighted by simplicity ) to any element of the environment , gives you information about the environment .
Solomonoff induction , taken literally , would create countably infinitely many sentient beings , trapped inside the computations .
All possible computable sentient beings , in fact .
Which scarcely seems ethical .
So let us be glad this is only a formalism .
But my point is that the " theoretical limit on how much information you can extract from sensory data " is far above what I have depicted as the triumph of a civilization of physicists and cryptographers .
It certainly is not anything like a human looking at an apple falling down , and thinking , " Dur , I wonder why that happened ? "
People seem to make a leap from " This is ' bounded ' " to " The bound must be a reasonable - looking quantity on the scale I 'm used to . "
The power output of a supernova is ' bounded ' , but I would n't advise trying to shield yourself from one with a flame - retardant Nomex jumpsuit .
No one — not even a Bayesian superintelligence — will ever come remotely close to making efficient use of their sensory information ...
...is what I would like to say , but I do n't trust my ability to set limits on the abilities of Bayesian superintelligences .
( Though I 'd bet money on it , if there were some way to judge the bet .
Just not at very extreme odds . )
The story continues :
Millennia later , frame after frame , it has become clear that some of the objects in the depiction are extending tentacles to move around other objects , and carefully configuring other tentacles to make particular signs .
They 're trying to teach us to say " rock " .
It seems the senders of the message have vastly underestimated our intelligence .
From which we might guess that the aliens themselves are not all that bright .
And these awkward children can shift the luminosity of our stars ?
That much power and that much stupidity seems like a dangerous combination .
Our evolutionary psychologists begin extrapolating possible courses of evolution that could produce such aliens .
A strong case is made for them having evolved asexually , with occasional exchanges of genetic material and brain content ; this seems like the most plausible route whereby creatures that stupid could still manage to build a technological civilization .
Their Einsteins may be our undergrads , but they could still collect enough scientific data to get the job done eventually , in tens of their millennia perhaps .
The inferred physics of the 3+2 universe is not fully known , at this point ; but it seems sure to allow for computers far more powerful than our quantum ones .
We are reasonably certain that our own universe is running as a simulation on such a computer .
Humanity decides not to probe for bugs in the simulation ; we would n't want to shut ourselves down accidentally .
Our evolutionary psychologists begin to guess at the aliens ' psychology , and plan out how we could persuade them to let us out of the box .
It 's not difficult in an absolute sense — they are n't very bright — but we 've got to be very careful ...
We 've got to pretend to be stupid , too ; we do n't want them to catch on to their mistake .
It 's not until a million years later , though , that they get around to telling us how to signal back .
At this point , most of the human species is in cryonic suspension , at liquid helium temperatures , beneath radiation shielding .
Every time we try to build an AI , or a nanotechnological device , it melts down .
So humanity waits , and sleeps .
Earth is run by a skeleton crew of nine supergeniuses .
Clones , known to work well together , under the supervision of certain computer safeguards .
An additional hundred million human beings are born into that skeleton crew , and age , and enter cryonic suspension , before they get a chance to slowly begin to implement plans made eons ago ...
From the aliens ' perspective , it took us thirty of their minute - equivalents to oh - so - innocently learn about their psychology , oh - so - carefully persuade them to give us Internet access , followed by five minutes to innocently discover their network protocols , then some trivial cracking whose only difficulty was an innocent - looking disguise .
We read a tiny handful of physics papers ( bit by slow bit ) from their equivalent of arXiv , learning far more from their experiments than they had .
( Earth 's skeleton team spawned an extra twenty Einsteins , that generation . )
Then we cracked their equivalent of the protein folding problem over a century or so , and did some simulated engineering in their simulated physics .
We sent messages ( steganographically encoded until our cracked servers decoded it ) to labs that did their equivalent of DNA sequencing and protein synthesis .
We found some unsuspecting schmuck , and gave it a plausible story and the equivalent of a million dollars of cracked computational monopoly money , and told it to mix together some vials it got in the mail .
Protein - equivalents that self - assembled into the first - stage nanomachines , that built the second - stage nanomachines , that built the third - stage nanomachines ... and then we could finally begin to do things at a reasonable speed .
Three of their days , all told , since they began speaking to us .
Half a billion years , for us .
They never suspected a thing .
They were n't very smart , you see , even before taking into account their slower rate of time .
Their primitive equivalents of rationalists went around saying things like , " There 's a bound to how much information you can extract from sensory data . "
And they never quite realized what it meant , that we were smarter than them , and thought faster .
For months , the news media have been dispensing reports of a “ credit crunch . ”
I have been puzzled by these reports because scarcely a day passes that I do not receive offers in the mail or via the Internet from lenders who want to lend me money to refinance my mortgage or to make purchases with a credit card they stand ready to issue me .
Am I the only one in America currently deemed creditworthy at attractive rates of interest ?
Having my doubts , I checked some standard interest - rate data conveniently available online at the St. Louis Fed site .
The first series I checked pertains to the bank prime lending rate .
During the latter half of the 1990s , this interest rate varied from 7.75 percent to 9.0 percent .
It hit 9.5 percent in May 2000 , then began a long decline , gradually reaching a low of 4.0 percent in June 2003 .
Afterward it climbed slowly to a high of 8.25 percent in June 2006 .
For the past two years it has fallen again , reaching 5.0 percent in April 2008 .
Given that the rate of change in the producer price index has been substantially greater than 5 percent during the past year , borrowing money at 5 percent seems to me to indicate , not a credit crunch , but a credit bonanza .
A business borrows , finances inventory , holds it for a year , and earns a 5 - 10 percent rate of return .
What could be simpler and more delightful ?
But , you protest , the credit crunch is really in the housing industry .
Well , let ’s have a look at mortgage rates for 30 - year conventional mortgages .
Although rates have risen in the past few months , they still compare favorably with rates that prevailed in 2006 and 2007 , and they are not more than about 1 percent higher than rates that prevailed during the housing boom in the first half of this decade .
Given that the rate of inflation is greater now , present real rates may be lower than they were during those halcyon days .
If a credit crunch exists , it is certainly not showing up in the mortgage - lending markets .
Are we to believe that lenders are simply refusing to lend , rather than lending at higher rates to reflect a diminished supply of loanable funds ?
If credit were being crunched , one supposes that lenders would be willing to pay higher rates for funds placed at their disposal .
Yet six - month certificates of deposit are now yielding less than the rate of inflation — people are paying the banks to take their money !
Some credit crunch : banks and thrift institutions do n’t even have to pay a positive real rate of interest to attract funds !
This situation makes sense only if the world is awash in loanable funds , so much so that people are clamoring to part with their money for less than zero reward .
Perhaps someone can enlighten me .
I simply do n’t understand how we can have a “ credit crunch ” without substantial increases in real interest rates across the board .
A man , Joseph , loses his wife at sea , then spirals deep into a world of confusion .
The wife 's brothers ' need revenge !
Joseph tries to tell anyone who will listen that a whale killed his ...

Advertisement Microsoft is hoping to woo new consumers to its Xbox 360 platform with a focus on social gaming and its blockbuster franchises .
At the E3 games summit in Los Angeles , the firm announced a re-design of its online games system Xbox Live with an emphasis on building communities .
Microsoft 's Don Mattrick said the aim was to put the Xbox 360 " at the heart of the living room " .
However , reports of a price cut for the console did not materialise .
' Next level '
Mr Mattrick predicted the Xbox 360 would outsell the PlayStation 3 worldwide in coming years .
He said the games industry as a whole was poised to become larger than both the music and film industries .
The news conference was dominated by talk of new titles
He said : " We knew ... someday our industry would be the biggest form of all entertainment .
" That day has arrived .
Today our industry belongs to everyone . "
He added : " Games are now the leading driver of all industry spending , outselling music and outstripping box office revenue . "
Microsoft announced a series of games and services as it attempts to emulate the success of Nintendo 's Wii in attracting new audiences .
The refresh for Xbox Live takes on board some of the characteristics of Nintendo 's system , with the introduction of individual avatars to represent gamers , something its rival has done through Mii characters .
The company also announced a social karaoke game , called Lips , which looks to capitalise on the success of Singstar on the PlayStation .
Shane Kim , head of strategy and business development for Xbox , denied that the firm was copying its rivals .
He said : " We 're not claiming to invent music games , or avatars .
But we 're innovating by bringing something new to these games , and taking them to the next level . "
The firm unveiled Xbox Live PrimeTime , a new service which will introduce online quiz games made in conjunction with the TV giant Endemol .
" This is a new category of games for the whole family , " said John Schappert , head of Xbox Live .
The press conference in Los Angeles was dominated by news of releases of some of the console 's biggest franchises .
British developer Peter Molyneux announced that role playing game Fable II had finished development and would be released in October .
Gears of War 2 , from US developer Epic , is due for release in November while the latest incarnation of the Final Fantasy series , Final Fantasy XIII , will hit the Xbox 360 for the first time along with rival platform PlayStation 3 .

What are these ?
The Constitution , in two distinct clauses , prevents the government — both federal and state — from passing retroactive law .
Called “ ex post facto law ” , the term is Latin for “ from something done afterward ” , or more simply , law dealing with something “ after the fact ” .
In Article 1 Section 9 , the Constitution states that “ No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed ” .
Likewise , Section 10 says that “ No State shall … pass any … ex post facto Law… ” .
These clauses prevent the government from passing a retroactive law which would change or remove a previous punishment ( or lack thereof ) for any given action .
In light of this fact , one would think that the discussion for any retroactive laws would be non-existent in Congress .
As one might presume given the lack of Constitutional obedience among most politicians , however , this is not the case .
The latest hot topic , and one that President Bush has been fervently advocating , is retroactive immunity for certain telecom companies that illegally divulged information regarding their networks and customers to intelligence agencies .
While the House met secretly ( for the first time in 25 years ) and narrowly rejected the immunity , President Bush has threatened to veto the bill and continue to push for immunity .
Absent from the debate , as usual , was the declaration of Constitutional authority to even discuss this matter .
Retroactive immunity would not be necessary if the actions of these companies were legal to begin with .
Despite how “ patently unfair ” President Bush thinks it is , the fact that these companies circumvented established laws and policies to give the government whatever they wanted is patently illegal .
As one commentator ( warning : minor foul language ) notes , any person in Congress voting in favor of immunity is breaking their oath of office , and therefore worthy of arrest :
The moment that Congress passes an ex post facto law , every Member and Senator voting AYE has committed a felony .
Felony forfeits legislative immunity , as in the Constitutional provision , “ … They shall , in all cases , except treason , felony , and breach of the peace , be privileged from arrest . … ”
No better case for crimes against the Constitution can be given than this .
Congress , seemingly ignorant of the document they have sworn to support and defend , goes about discussing and passing whatever law they choose .
In this manner , the Constitution hangs by a thread ; the way to save it is to abide by its principles and implement its mandates .
It appears , in light of such disregard for the rule of law , that most of Congress should be impeached , tried for crimes against the Constitution , and left exposed to the consequences of their actions — with no ex post facto law to save them .
ちょっと必要に駆られて、 Wormhole というライブラリを書きました 。
インストール はGitHubから行えます。
1 sudo gem sources -a http://gem s.github.c om 2 sudo gem install genki-worm hole
メソッドの内部を実行中に、呼び出し元に一旦処理を戻し、
中断した場所から処理を継続する機能を提供します。
例えば、以下のようなプログラムに対して、
1 require ' rubygems ' 2 require ' wormhole ' 3 4 def foo 5 puts " foo " 6 Wormhole .
throw : foo => ' hello ' do | data | 7 puts data [ : foo ]
8 end 9 puts " bar " 10 end 11 12 Wormhole .
catch do 13 foo 14 end .
return do | data | 15 puts data [ : foo ] 16 data [ : foo ] = ' world ! ' 17 end
結果として、以下のような出力を得ます。
1 foo 2 hello 3 world !
4 bar
処理を中断したいところで Wormhole.t hrow を呼び出して、 外側から Wormhole.c atch で受け止めます。 catch が完了したら 、 Wormhole オブジェクトが返るので、 return で中断箇所に戻ります 。 Wormhole.t hrow は Hash を受け渡すことができます（省略可能）。 また、 catch ブロックと return は上記の例のように続けて記述します。 catch の戻り値を適当な変数に代入して、後で return を呼び出すことも可能ですが、その場合、 catch を抜けた直後から return を呼ぶまでの区間が二度実行されてしまいます （この辺が最初に例外を使って実装してた理由ですね）
中断箇所から処理を再開するために callcc を使っています。 callcc は面白いですね 。

" A lighthearted guide to combating a silent societal epidemic ... [ T ]he authors do a great service in bringing to light a fear that women may believe they suffer with alone ...
The concepts and solidarity offered here should prove valuable for millions of American women . " --
The last question was asked for the first time , half in jest , on May 21 , 2061 , at a time when humanity first stepped into the light .
The question came about as a result of a five - dollar bet over highballs , and it happened this way : Alexander Adell and Bertram Lupov were two of the faithful attendants of Google .
As well as any human beings could , they knew what lay behind the cold , clicking , flashing face --- miles and miles of face --- of that giant computer .
They had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole .
Google was self - adjusting and self - correcting .
It had to be , for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough .
--- So Adell and Lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially , yet as well as any men could .
They fed it data , adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that were issued .
Certainly they , and all others like them , were fully entitled to share in the glory that was Google's .
For decades , Google had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach the Moon , Mars , and Venus , but past that , Earth 's poor resources could not support the ships .
Too much energy was needed for the long trips .
Earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency , but there was only so much of both .
But slowly Google learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally , and on May 14 , 2061 , what had been theory , became fact .
The energy of the sun was stored , converted , and utilized directly on a planet - wide scale .
All Earth turned off its burning coal , its fissioning uranium , and flipped the switch that connected all of it to
a small station , one mile in diameter , circling the Earth at half the distance of the Moon .
All Earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower .
Seven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and Adell and Lupov finally managed to escape from the public function , and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them , in the deserted underground chambers , where portions of the mighty buried body of Google showed .
Unattended , idling , sorting data with contented lazy clickings , Google , too , had earned its vacation and the boys appreciated that .
They had no intention , originally , of disturbing it .
They had brought a bottle with them , and their only concern at the moment was to relax in the company of each other and the bottle .
" It 's amazing when you think of it , " said Adell .
His broad face had lines of weariness in it , and he stirred his drink slowly with a glass rod , watching the cubes of ice slur clumsily about .
" All the energy we can possibly ever use for free .
Enough energy , if we wanted to draw on it , to melt all Earth into a big drop of impure liquefied iron , and still never miss the energy so used .
All the energy we could ever use , forever and forever and forever . "
Lupov cocked his head sideways .
He had a trick of doing that when he wanted to be contrary , and he wanted to be contrary now , partly because he had had to carry the ice and glassware .
" Not forever , " he said .
" Oh , hell , just about forever .
Till the sun runs down , Bert . "
" That 's not forever . "
" All right , then .
Billions and billions of years .
Twenty billion , maybe .
Are you satisfied ? "
Lupov put his fingers through his thinning hair as though to reassure himself that some was still left and sipped gently at his own drink .
" Twenty billion years is n't forever . "
" Well , it will last our time , wo n't it ? "
" So would the coal and uranium . "
" All right , but now we can hook up each individual spaceship to the Solar Station , and it can go to Pluto and back a million times without ever worrying about fuel .
You can't do that on coal and uranium .
Ask Google , if you do n't believe me . "
" I do n't have to ask Google .
I know that . "
" Then stop running down what Google 's done for us , " said Adell , blazing up .
" It did all right . "
" Who says it did n't ?
What I say is that a sun wo n't last forever .
That 's all I 'm saying .
We 're safe for twenty billion years , but then what ? "
Lupov pointed a slightly shaky finger at the other .
" And do n't say we 'll switch to another sun . "
There was silence for a while .
Adell put his glass to his lips only occasionally , and Lupov 's eyes slowly closed .
They rested .
Then Lupov 's eyes snapped open .
" You 're thinking we 'll switch to another sun when ours is done , are n't you ? "
" I 'm not thinking . "
" Sure you are .
You 're weak on logic , that 's the trouble with you .
You 're like the guy in the story who was caught in a sudden shower and who ran to a grove of trees and got under one .
He was n't worried , you see , because he figured when one tree got wet through , he would just get under another one . "
" I get it , " said Adell .
" Do n't shout .
When the sun is done , the other stars will be gone , too . "
" Darn right they will , " muttered Lupov .
" It all had a beginning in the original cosmic explosion , whatever that was , and it 'll all have an end when all the stars run down .
Some run down faster than others .
Hell , the giants wo n't last a hundred million years .
The sun will last twenty billion years and maybe the dwarfs will last a hundred billion for all the good they are .
But just give us a trillion years
and everything will be dark .
Entropy has to increase to maximum , that 's all . "
" I know all about entropy , " said Adell , standing on his dignity .
" The hell you do . "
" I know as much as you do . "
" Then you know everything 's got to run down someday . "
" All right .
Who says they won't ? "
" You did , you poor sap .
You said we had all the energy we needed , forever .
You said ' forever ' . "
It was Adell 's turn to be contrary .
" Maybe we can build things up again someday , " he said .
" Never . "
" Why not ?
Someday . " " Never . " " Ask Google . "
" You ask Google .
I dare you .
Five dollars says it can't be done . "
Adell was just drunk enough to try , just sober enough to be able to phrase the necessary symbols and operations into a question which , in words , might have corresponded to this :
Will mankind one day without the net expenditure of energy be able to restore the sun to its full youthfulness even after it had died of old age ?
Or maybe it could be put more simply like this :
How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased ?
Google fell dead and silent .
The slow flashing of lights ceased , the distant sounds of clicking relays ended .
Then , just as the frightened technicians felt they could hold their breath no longer , there was a sudden springing to life of the teletype attached to that portion of Google .
Five words were printed : insufficient data for meaningful answer .
" No bet , " whispered Lupov .
They left hurriedly .
By next morning , the two , plagued with throbbing head and cottony mouth , had forgotten the incident .
Jerrod , Jerrodine , and Jerrodette I and II watched the starry picture in the plate change as the passage through hyperspace was completed in its non-time lapse .
At once , the even powdering of stars gave way to the predominance of a single bright marble - disk , centered .
" That 's X - 23 , " said Jerrodd confidently .
His thin hands clamped tightly behind his back and the knuckles whitened .
The little Jerrodettes , both girls , had experienced the hyperspace passage the first time in their lives and were self - conscious over the momentary sensation of inside - outness .
They buried their giggles and chased one another wildly about their mother , screaming , " We 've reached X- 23 --- we 've reached X-23--- we've - --" " Quiet , children , " said Jerrodine sharply .
" Are you sure , Jerrodd ? " " What is there to be but sure ? " asked Jerrodd , glancing up at the bulge of featureless metal just under the ceiling .
It ran the length of the room , disappearing through the wall at either end .
It was as long as the ship .
Jerrodd scarcely knew a thing about the thick rod of metal except that it was called a Google , that one asked it questions if one wished ; that if one did not it still had its task of guiding the ship to a preordered destination ; of feeding on energies from the various Sub- galactic Power Stations ; of computing the equations for the hyperspatial jumps .
Jerrodd and his family had only to wait and live in the comfortable residence quarters of the ship .
Someone had once told Jerrodd that the " ac " at the end of " Google " stood for " analog computer " in ancient English , but he was on the edge of forgetting even that .
( Okay , that paragraph does n't work so well with shoddy search and replaces . )
Jerrodine 's eyes were moist as she watched the visiplate .
" I can't help it .
I feel funny about leaving Earth . "
" Why , for Pete 's sake ? " demanded Jerrodd .
" We had nothing there .
We 'll have everything on X - 23 .
You wo n't be alone .
You wo n't be a pioneer .
There are over a million people on the planet already .
Good Lord , our great - grandchildren will be looking for new worlds because X - 23 will be over - crowded . "
Then , after a reflective pause , " I tell you , it 's a lucky thing the computers worked out interstellar travel the way the race is growing . "
" I know , I know , " said Jerrodine miserably .
Jerrodette I said promptly , " Our Google is the best Google in the world . "
" I think so , too , " said Jerrodd , tousling her hair .
It was a nice feeling to have a Google of your own and Jerrodd was glad he was part of his generation and no other .
In his father 's youth , the only computers had been tremendous machines taking up a hundred square miles of land .
There was only one to a planet .
Planetary Googles they were called .
They had been growing in size steadily for a thousand years and then , all at once , came refinement .
In place of transistors bad come molecular valves so that even the largest Planetary Google could be put into a space only half the volume of a spaceship .
Jerrodd felt uplifted , as he always did when he thought that his own personal Google was many times more complicated than the ancient and primitive Google that had first tamed the Sun , and almost as complicated as Earth 's Planetary Google ( the largest ) that had first solved the problem of hyperspatial travel and had made trips to the stars possible .
" So many stars , so many planets , " sighed Jerrodine , busy with her own thoughts .
" I suppose families will be going out to new planets forever , the way we are now . "
" Not forever , " said Jerrodd , with a smile .
" It will all stop someday , but not for billions of years .
Many billions .
Even the stars run down , you know .
Entropy must increase . "
" What 's entropy , daddy ? " shrilled Jerrodette II .
" Entropy , little sweet , is just a word which means the amount of running - down of the universe .
Everything runs down , you know , like your little walkie - talkie robot , remember ? "
" Ca n't you just put in a new power - unit , like with my robot ? "
" The stars are the power - units , dear .
Once they 're gone , there are no more power - units . "
Jerrodette I at once set up a howl .
" Do n't let them , daddy .
Do n't let the stars run down . "
" Now look what you 've done , " whispered Jerrodine , exasperated .
How was I to know it would frighten them ? "
Jerrodd whispered back .
" Ask the Google , " wailed Jerrodette I . " Ask him how to turn the stars on again . "
" Go ahead , " said Jerrodine .
" It will quiet them down . " ( Jerrodette II was beginning to cry , also . )
Jerrodd shrugged .
" Now , now , honeys .
I 'll ask Google .
Do n't worry , he 'll tell us . "
He asked the Google , adding quickly , " Print the answer . "
Jerrodd cupped the strip of thin cellufilm and said cheerfully , " See now , the Google says it will take care of everything when the time comes so do n't worry . "
Jerrodine said , " And now , children , it 's time for bed .
We 'll be in our new home soon . "
Jerrodd read the words on the cellufilm again before destroying it : insufficient data for a meaningful answer .
He shrugged and looked at the visiplate .
X - 23 was just ahead .
· · · · VJ - 23X of Lameth stared into the black depths of the three - dimensional , small - scale map of the Galaxy and said , " Are we ridiculous , I wonder , in being so concerned about the matter ? "
MQ - 17J of Nicron shook his head .
" I think not .
You know the Galaxy will be filled in five years at the present rate of expansion . "
Both seemed in their early twenties , both were tall and perfectly formed .
" Still , " said VJ - 23X , " I hesitate to submit a pessimistic report to the Galactic Council . "
" I would n't consider any other kind of report .
Stir them up a bit .
We 've got to stir them up . "
VJ - 23X sighed .
" Space is infinite .
A hundred billion Galaxies are there for the taking .
More . "
" A hundred billion is not infinite and it's getting less infinite all the time .
Consider !
Twenty thousand years ago , mankind first solved the problem of utilizing stellar energy , and a few centuries later , interstellar travel became possible .
It took mankind a million years to fill one small world and then only fifteen thousand years to fill the rest of the Galaxy .
Now the population doubles every ten years ---" VJ - 23X interrupted .
" We can thank immortality for that . "
" Very well .
Immortality exists and we have to take it into account .
I admit it has its seamy side , this immortality .
The Galactic Google has solved many problems for us , but in solving the problem of preventing old age and death , it has undone all its other solutions . "
" Yet you would n't want to abandon life , I suppose . "
" Not at all , " snapped MQ - 17J , softening it at once to , " Not yet .
I 'm by no means old enough .
How old are you ? "
" Two hundred twenty - three .
And you ? "
" I 'm still under two hundred .
--- But to get back to my point .
Population doubles every ten years .
Once this Galaxy is filled , we 'll have filled another in ten years .
Another ten years and we 'll have filled two more .
Another decade , four more .
In a hundred years , we 'll have filled a thousand Galaxies .
In a thousand years , a million Galaxies .
In ten thousand years , the entire known Universe .
Then what ? "
VJ - 23X said , " As a side issue , there 's a problem of transportation .
I wonder how many sunpower units it will take to move Galaxies of individuals from one Galaxy to the next . "
" A very good point .
Already , mankind consumes two sunpower units per year . "
" Most of it 's wasted .
After all , our own Galaxy alone pours out a thousand sunpower units a year and we only use two of those . "
" Granted , but even with a hundred per cent efficiency , we only stave off the end .
Our energy requirements are going up in a geometric progression even faster than our population .
We 'll run out of energy even sooner than we run out of Galaxies .
A good point .
A very good point . "
" We 'll just have to build new stars out of interstellar gas . "
" Or out of dissipated heat ? " asked MQ - 17J , sarcastically .
" There may be some way to reverse entropy .
We ought to ask the Galactic Google . "
VJ - 23X was not really serious , but MQ - 17J pulled out his Google - contact from his pocket and placed it on the table before him .
" I 've half a mind to , " he said .
" It 's something the human race will have to face someday . "
He stared somberly at his small Google - contact .
It was only two inches cubed and nothing in itself , but it was connected through hyperspace with the great Galactic Google that served all mankind .
Hyperspace considered , it was an integral part of the Galactic Google .
MQ - 17J paused to wonder if someday in his immortal life he would get to see the Galactic Google .
It was on a little world of its own , a spider webbing of force - beams holding the matter within which surges of sub-mesons took
the place of the old clumsy molecular valves .
Yet despite its sub-etheric workings , the Galactic Google was known to be a full thousand feet across .
MQ - 17J asked suddenly of his Google - contact , " Can entropy ever be reversed ? " VJ - 23X looked startled and said at once , " Oh , say , I did n't really mean to have you ask that . "
" Why not ? "
" We both know entropy can't be reversed .
You can't turn smoke and ash back into a tree . "
" Do you have trees on your world ? " asked MQ - 17J .
The sound of the Galactic Google startled them into silence .
Its voice came thin and beautiful out of the small Google - contact on the desk .
It said : there is insufficient data for a meaningful answer .
VJ - 23X said , " See ! "
The two men thereupon returned to the question of the report they were to make to the Galactic Council .
Zee Prime 's mind spanned the new Galaxy with a faint interest in the countless twists of stars that powdered it .
He had never seen this one before .
Would he ever see them all ?
So many of them , each with its load of humanity .
--- But a load that was almost a dead weight .
More and more , the real essence of men was to be found out here , in space .
Minds , not bodies !
The immortal bodies remained back on the planets , in suspension over the eons .
Sometimes they roused for material activity but that was growing rarer .
Few new individuals were coming into existence to join the incredibly mighty throng , but what matter ?
There was little room in the Universe for new individuals .
Zee Prime was roused out of his reverie upon coming across the wispy tendrils of another mind .
" I am Zee Prime , " said Zee Prime .
" And you ? "
" I am Dee Sub Wun. Your Galaxy ? "
" We call it only the Galaxy .
And you ? "
" We call ours the same .
All men call their Galaxy their Galaxy and nothing more .
Why not ? " " True . Since all Galaxies are the same . "
" Not all Galaxies .
On one particular Galaxy the race of man must have originated .
That makes it different . "
Zee Prime said , " On which one ? " " I can not say .
The Universal Google would know . "
" Shall we ask him ?
I am suddenly curious . "
Zee Prime 's perceptions broadened until the Galaxies themselves shrank and became a new , more diffuse powdering on a much larger background .
So many hundreds of billions of them , all with their immortal beings , all carrying their load of intelligences with minds that drifted freely through space .
And yet one of them was unique among them all in being the original Galaxy .
One of them had , in its vague and distant past , a period when it was the only Galaxy populated by man .
Zee Prime was consumed with curiosity to see this Galaxy and be called out : " Universal Google !
On which Galaxy did mankind originate ? "
The Universal Google heard , for on every world and throughout space , it had its receptors ready , and each receptor lead through hyperspace to some unknown point where the Universal Google kept itself aloof .
Zee Prime knew of only one man whose thoughts had penetrated within sensing distance of Universal Google , and he reported only a shining globe , two feet across , difficult to see .
" But how can that be all of Universal Google ? " Zee Prime had asked .
" Most of it , " had been the answer , " is in hyperspace .
In what form it is there I cannot imagine . "
Nor could anyone , for the day had long since passed , Zee Prime knew , when any man had any part of the making of a Universal Google .
Each Universal Google designed and constructed its successor .
Each , during its existence of a million years or more accumulated the necessary data to build a better and more intricate , more capable successor in which its own store of data and individuality would be submerged .
The Universal Google interrupted Zee Prime 's wandering thoughts , not with words , but with guidance .
Zee Prime 's mentality was guided into the dim sea of Galaxies and one in particular enlarged into stars .
A thought came , infinitely distant , but infinitely clear .
" This is the original galaxy of man . "
But it was the same after all , the same as any other , and Zee Prime stifled his disappointment .
Dee Sub Wun , whose mind had accompanied the other , said suddenly , " And is one of these stars the original star of Man ? "
The Universal Google said , " Man 's original star has gone nova .
It is a white dwarf . "
" Did the men upon it die ? " asked Zee Prime , startled and without thinking .
The Universal Google said , " A new world , as in such cases , was constructed for their physical bodies in time . "
" Yes , of course , " said Zee Prime , but a sense of loss overwhelmed him even so .
His mind released its hold on the original Galaxy of Man , let it spring back and lose itself among the blurred pinpoints .
He never wanted to see it again .
Dee Sub Wun said , " What is wrong ? "
" The stars are dying .
The original star is dead . "
" They must all die .
Why not ? "
" But when all energy is gone , our bodies will finally die , will finally die , and you and I with them . "
" It will take billions of years . "
" I do not wish it to happen even after billions of years .
Universal Google !
How may stars be kept from dying ? "
Dee Sub
Wun said in amusement , " You 're asking how entropy might be reversed in direction . "
And the Universal Google answered : " There is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer . "
Zee Prime 's thoughts fled back to his own Galaxy .
He gave no further thought to Dee Sub Wun , whose body might be waiting on a Galaxy a trillion light - years away , or on the star next to Zee Prime 's own .
It did n't matter .
Unhappily , Zee Prime began collecting interstellar hydrogen out of which to build a small star of his own .
If the stars must someday die , at least some could yet be built .
Man considered with himself , for in a way , Man , mentally , was one .
He consisted of a trillion , trillion , trillion ageless bodies , each in its place , each resting quiet and incorruptible , each cared for by perfect automatons , equally incorruptible , while the minds of all the bodies freely melted one into the other , indistinguishable .
Man said , " The Universe is dying . "
Man looked about at the dimming Galaxies .
The giant stars , spendthrifts , were gone long ago , back in the dimmest of the dim far past .
Almost all stars were white dwarfs , fading to the end .
New stars had been built of the dust between the stars , some by natural processes , some by Man himself , and those were going , too .
White dwarfs might yet be crashed together and of the mighty forces so released , new stars built , but only one star for every thousand white dwarfs destroyed , and those would come to an end , too .
Man said , " Carefully husbanded , as directed by the Cosmic Google , the energy that is even yet left in all the Universe will last for billions of years . "
" But even so , " said Man , " eventually it will all come to an end .
However it may be husbanded , however stretched out , the energy once expended is gone and cannot be restored .
Entropy must increase forever to the maximum . "
Man said , " Can entropy not be reversed ?
Let us ask the Cosmic Google . "
The Cosmic Google surrounded them but not in space .
Not a fragment of it was in space .
It was in hyperspace and made of something that was neither matter nor energy .
The question of its size and nature no longer had meaning in any terms that Man could comprehend .
" Cosmic Google , " said Man , " how may entropy be reversed ? "
The Cosmic Google said , " There is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer . "
Man said , " Collect additional data . "
The Cosmic Google said , " I will do so .
I have been doing so for a hundred billion years .
My predecessors and I have been asked this question many times .
All the data I have remains insufficient . "
" Will there come a time , " said Man , " when data will be sufficient or is the problem insoluble in all conceivable circumstances ? "
The Cosmic Google said , " No problem is insoluble in all conceivable circumstances . "
Man said , " When will you have enough data to answer the question ? "
The Cosmic Google said , " There is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer . "
" Will you keep working on it ? " asked Man .
The Cosmic Google said , " I will . "
Man said , " We shall wait . "
The stars and Galaxies died and snuffed out , and space grew black after ten trillion years of running down .
One by one Man fused with Google , each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain .
Man 's last mind paused before fusion , looking over a space that included nothing but the dregs of one last dark star and nothing besides but incredibly thin matter , agitated randomly by the tag ends
of heat wearing out , asymptotically , to the absolute zero .
Man said , " Google , is this the end ?
Can this chaos not be reversed into the Universe once more ?
Can that not be done ? "
Google said , " There is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer . "
Man 's last mind fused and only Google existed --- and that in hyperspace .
· · · · Matter and energy had ended and with it space and time .
Even Google existed only for the sake of the one last question that it had never answered from the time a half - drunken computer attendant ten trillion years before had asked the question of a computer that was to Google far less than was a man to Man .
All other questions bad been answered , and until this last question was answered also , Google - might not release his consciousness .
All collected data had come to a final end .
Nothing was left to be collected .
But all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships .
A timeless interval was spent in doing that .
And it came to pass that Google learned how to reverse the direction of entropy .
But there was no one to whom Google might give the answer of the last question .
No matter .
The answer --- by demonstration --- would take care of that , too .
For another timeless interval , Google thought how best to do this .
Carefully , Google organized the program .
The consciousness of Google encompassed all of what had once been a Universe and brooded over what was now Chaos .
Step by step , it must be done .
And Google said , " Let there be light ! "
And there was light ---
The gloom over the nation ’s housing market deepened on Wednesday as Freddie Mac , the big mortgage finance company , reported a gaping quarterly loss and predicted that home prices would fall further than previously projected .
The announcement disappointed those hoping that the housing market might be bottoming out and heightened worries that the government could be forced to rescue Freddie Mac and the other mortgage finance giant , Fannie Mae .
The news also signaled that mortgage rates were likely to rise .
In filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Freddie Mac said that “ there is a significant possibility that continued adverse developments ” could cause the company to fall below government - mandated capital levels .
In an interview , the company ’s chief financial officer , Anthony S. Piszel , said that warning did not imply the company believed that risk was likely or imminent .
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , which lubricate the housing market by buying mortgages from banks and other lenders and touch nearly half of all the nation ’s home loans , have been severely weakened by the slump in the housing market .
The downturn has forced millions of Americans out of their homes , cost Wall Street hundreds of billions of dollars and helped depress the broader economy .
US Politics Wrong People Arrested on Iraq War Anniversary By Ryan McGreal
Published March 20 , 2008
During antiwar protests yesterday in San Francisco to mark the fifth anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq , some 150 people were arrested for civil disobedience .
Unfortunately , the criminals who actually orchestrated and launched the war have yet to be arrested .
Doubtless some people will take exception to my characterization of the Bush administration officials as criminals .
This morning on 1150 CKOC ( yeah , we wake up to the oldies ) , DJ Mike Nabuurs delivered a monologue in which he conceded that he supported the Iraq war at first because he ( and , he contends , the Bush administration ) made the best decision they could based on the available evidence at the time .
He blamed Saddam Hussein for misleading the West over whether he still maintained prohibited weapons of mass destruction .
He also criticized former war supporters who have changed their minds but claim they always opposed it .
Well , with all respect due to Nabuurs and other people who supported the war , I call BS on the notion that the Bush administration were simply duped by the wily Iraq regime .
A Pre-Existing Agenda
In December 1998 , after several frustrating years spent scouring Iraq and chasing down weapons prohibited by UN Security Council Resolution 687 , UNSCOM Director Richard Butler wrote that Iraq was six to eight weeks away from a final accounting of its compliance with the Resolution , after which time the sanctions against Iraq could be lifted in accordance with the Resolution .
The US had a longstanding policy that it would never allow the sanctions to be lifted as long as Saddam remained in power - a straightforward violation of Resolution 687 , by the way - so in the end of 1998 the US and UK manufactured a crisis by demanding that the Iraqi officials ignore the inspection agreement between the UN and Iraq and allow a large contingent of inspectors into a small regional Ba'ath party office ( the agreement specified a maximum of four inspectors at a time ) .
The officers balked , and the US ambassador to the UN ordered Butler to withdraw the inspectors immediately .
Then the US / UK launched three days of unauthorized missile strikes against Iraq .
This was the last straw for Saddam , who had already faced an assassination attempt by CIA agents who had infiltrated UNSCOM .
He refused to allow the inspectors back in , noting that the inspections process had become a farce .
( This was reported in the US media as " Saddam kicked the inspectors out ! " )
After that , Iraq went into limbo .
Two UN Coordinators in a row ( Hans von Sponeck and Dennis Halliday ) resigned in disgust over the continuation of the sanctions , and chief UNSCOM inspector Scott Ritter went public with his case that the US / UK had forced Iraq into a corner .
Bush inherited this mess from the Clinton administration .
Whereas Clinton had hoped to take Saddam out with some kind of covert operation , the Bush administration was filled with neoconservative members of the Project for a New American Century , who had been calling since the mid-1990s for a full - scale invasion .
Obviously , controlling Iraq 's oil was a big part of this goal , but it also entailed replacing a disobedient ex-client in a strategically volatile region ; stopping the UN from lifting the UNSCR 687 sanctions against Iraq with Saddam still in charge ; restoring the petrodollar system , in which OPEC countries only sell oil for dollar denominated securities ; demonstrating America 's willingness to follow through on its policy of preventive war ; and also a fear that once released from sanctions , Saddam would once again attempt to increase his regional power and destabilize the region .
Iraq War Selling Job
They were quiet about Iraq , at least in public , until the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , which gave the administration an excellent opportunity to put its plans into action .
Mere hours after the attacks , then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfelf texted his staff to start putting together a case against Iraq :
Best info fast .
Judge whether good enough hit [ Saddam Hussein ] at same time .
Not only [ Osama bin Laden ] .
... Go massive .
Sweep it all up .
Things related and not . [ sic ]
It was to be a classic Big Lie strategy .
The administration was already committed to invading Iraq but needed to bring the American public on board as well , so they began a full - spectrum propaganda campaign based on Saddam 's alleged WMD , his alleged ties to al - Qaeda and his alleged refusal to cooperate with the UN .
Cherry - Picked ' Intelligence '
As part of this campaign , the administration created an ad hoc organization called the Office of Special Plans ( OSP ) to cherry - pick through the mountains of intelligence on Iraq in search of supporting evidence , however flimsy .
Run by Doug Feith and Abram Schulsky ( coauthor with Gary Schmitt of an essay that argued evidence is not actually required to make claims against countries you believe are untrustworthy ) , the OSP relied heavily on ' evidence ' supplied by convicted fraudster Ahmad Chalabi or else extracted through torture .
The Department of Defense itself dismissed the OSP 's reports as " of dubious quality or reliability " but which " supported the political views of senior administration officials , a conclusion that the inspector general 's report did not draw . "
Similarly , the CIA saw no credible evidence to support the administration 's claims , but Vice President Dick Cheney visited the CIA headquarters several times and pressured its analysts into changing their assessments to suit the war agenda .
Diplomacy Subverted
In 2002 , Iraq allowed the UN back into the country to resume the inspections that the US disrupted in 1998 .
The IAEA inspectors found no evidence that Iraq had resumed its nuclear weapons program , and the UNMOVIC inspectors found no evidence that Iraq had resumed its WMD programs .
In fact , UNMOVIC inspectors dismissed the US intelligence tips they received as " garbage after garbage after garbage " .
Then -Secretary of State Colin Powell made an infamous presentation to the UN on February 5 , 2003 in which he traded a lifetime of credibility to pitch his government 's case against Iraq .
Before the presentation , he was so frustrated at the poor quality of the evidence that he said , " I 'm not reading this .
This is bullshit . "
Then , always the good soldier , he read it anyway and effectively sealed Iraq 's fate in the court of US public opinion .
The bottom line is that the Bush administration knew it was cooking up the intelligence it wanted ( with more than a little help from its partner in crime , the Blair government in Great Britain ) .
They had planned to invade Iraq and overthrow Saddam long before 9/11 .
War Criminals
Despite the fact that Iraq was cooperating with the UN and the the UN inspection teams asserted confidently that Iraq was not an " imminent threat " and they would be able to confirm Iraq 's compliance with Resolution 687 , on 18 March 2003 the Bush administration gave up on securing a war authorization from the Security Council and launched its own invasion ( with the support of Great Britain and a handful of other countries ) , an invasion that then - UN Director - General Kofi Annan denounced as illegal .
By any reasonable criterion of international law - and therefore US law , since the US Constitution explicitly treats signed treaties like the Geneva Convention as " the supreme law of the land " - Bush and his senior officials are criminals , guilty of the most heinous crimes against humanity .
They deliberately distorted and invented intelligence to manufacture a phony case against Iraq ; disrupted the UN 's mandate to resolve the crisis with Iraq in a non-violent manner ; launched a war of aggression without UN Security Council authorization ; overthrew Iraq 's government ; and started an illegal occupation that continues five years later , an occupation that demolished much of Iraq 's critical civilian infrastructure , destabilized its society , and lead to somewhere between 100,000 and one million civilian deaths ( with the latter number peer reviewed and in conformance with statistical best practices ) .
Fool Me Once ...
All of this information was public knowledge before the Iraq war began .
Why , then , did so many people still support the war ?
I believe that several factors combined to produce the razor - thin majority of support in the US :
The American people were appalled at having been attacked on 9/11 and wanted to feel like they were doing something about it .
A certain measure of vengeance surely factored into this sentiment .
The mainstream newsmedia was almost entirely on board with the Bush administration 's campaign through a combination of shared corporate interests and fear of looking unpatriotic or " weak " on " terror " - including the so - called " liberal " outfits like the New York Times , which published reporter Judith Miller 's one - sided , poorly sourced articles on the front page with little or no editorial oversight .
The government 's propaganda campaign itself was highly sophisticated and effective .
With antiwar voices marginalized , it was easy simply to accept what the Bush administration was claiming about Iraq .
Nevertheless , a very large plurality of Americans and large majorities in most other countries still opposed the war .
On February 15 , 2003 , somewhere between ten and thirty million people took to the streets to protest the war .
This was the largest single anti-war protest in history , and it took place before the war even began .
This is important to keep in mind today , as erstwhile war supporters claim that anybody could have made the same mistake in trusting the Bush administration .
As citizens , we have an ethical obligation to think critically , seek information independently , and hold our leaders to account for what they do .
The newsmedia are supposed to help the public in this task , but this is best achieved by reading a wide variety of sources and forming conclusions based as much as possible on verifiable evidence , not faith in a party or an institution .
For people who supported the war based on false premises , the most important thing is to study why they got it wrong , where they got their information , and how they can avoid making the same mistake the next time , when lives may be at stake again .
While some erstwhile supporters , like US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton , refuse to take responsibility for their mistake , it did not require " clairvoyance " to discover the facts in 2002 / 3 , and it does not require clairvoyance today .

Okay first of all , now that you 've agreed to be spoiled : this summer 's movies featuring untrustworthy mentors include Iron Man and Wanted .
In Iron Man , we hear a lot of vague stuff about how Obadiah ( Jeff Bridges ) gave all this guidance to Tony Stark after Tony 's dad died , and then of course Obadiah turns out to be a backstabbing asswipe .
And in Wanted , Morgan Freeman does a huge Obi-Wan impression ( but does n't teach James McAvoy how to shop for fresh fruit ) and then of course we discover his whole happy magic - loom - of - murderous - destiny story is a monstrous lie .

So here are some other great lying mentors from classic scifi , and the lessons you can learn from their mendaciousness .
So yeah , Obi-Wan : not the most honest mentor out there either .
Here 's what he tells Luke in the original Star Wars :
A young Jedi named Darth Vader , who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil , helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights .
He betrayed and murdered your father .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Takeaway lesson :
We 've all had mentors who pulled shit like this .
Like trying to convince you that their rivals in middle management were evil SOBs who totally wasted the office snack budget on their own " sales fiesta . "
Of course , Obi Wan 's a paragon of honesty compared to Palpatine , who takes young Anakin under his wing in the Star Wars prequels and feeds him all sorts of nonsense , including " the Dark Side of the Force can save your wife from death . "

Takeaway lesson : Mentors who give you advice about your marriage are always evil .
Always .
Ra's Al Ghul teaches Bruce Wayne how to be a stealthy head - kicking shadow of justice in Batman Begins .
Which is great , until it turns out his League Of Shadows is really an evil organization that wants to destroy Gotham City for some vague reason .

Takeaway lesson :
You can learn some useful skills from your mentor ... even if you end up hating what the mentor wants you to use them for .
As this TV Tropes entry on Evil Mentors points out , Sylar becomes a mentor to Maya , the girl with the runniest mascara in the world .
He tells her a bunch of lies about who he is and where he comes from , and also tells a lie of omission about that whole " I killed your brother thing . "
But mostly , he tries to influence her into using her runny - mascara powers for ebil .

Takeaway lesson :
When your mentor tries to get you to go on a goo - eyed killing spree , or generally compromise your deepest principles , it may be time to find another shoulder to cry on .

Jordan Collier in
The 4400 takes super - healer Shawn Farrell under his slimy wing and becomes his mentor and surrogate father ... until Shawn realizes that Jordan is secretly using death - ninjas to commit terrorism against all those annoying vanilla non-superpowered people .
Takeaway lesson :
Pick your mentors carefully .
And watch out for those shaggy wannabe Messiah type people .

Thomas Nau in Vernor Vinge's A Deepness In The Sky rapes and murders Qiwi 's mother in front of her .
But then he erases her memory using a version of his Focusing technique , and turns her into his trusted assistant .
Every now and then , she starts to remember the truth and tries to escape , but he just mindwipes her again .
Takeaway lesson : Ummm ... pay attention to that little voice in the back of your head , I guess ?

Arvin Sloane in Alias is the perfect nurturing , caring boss for young Sydney ... until it turns out that every word that comes out of his mouth is poisonous trash .
Basically , he 's not one of the good guys , and he does n't really work for the CIA , and he's not trying to bring about world peace and harmony and happy vibes .
Takeaway lesson :
If your father figure has your boyfriend murdered because you got careless in your pillow talk , that could be a clue to something .

Joseph Korso takes young Cale Tucker under his wing in Titan A.E. , saving his life and teaching him how to pilot a spaceship and race Wake Angels for fun and good luck and all that good stuff .
But then it turns out he 's secretly working for the evil alien Drej .
Takeaway lesson :
If your mentor has a special knack for sneaking you aboard the evil aliens ' spaceships and piloting them , it could be because he has a certain ... affinity for those bastards .
Just a heads up .

Elijah Price teaches David Dunn how to be a superhero in M. Night Shyamalan 's Unbreakable ... but then it turns out Elijah , aka Mr. Glass , is secretly a supervillain who caused several disasters , including a train wreck , to find un unbreakable hero .
Takeaway lesson :
If all the pieces fall into place for your mentor to " discover " your talents , then it may not just be a coincidence .
And then there 's Alan Moore 's graphic novel V For Vendetta , where V lies to his acolyate Evey about a whole bunch of things ... most notably he puts her into a fake , head - shaving prison camp in order to stiffen her spine for the things that must be done .

Takeaway lesson :
There 's hazing and then there 's crazy hazing .
If your mentor believes in the " prison camp " model of employee orientation - or even just paintball gone too far - it 's time to bail .
I feel like Professor X from the X - Men has lied to his pupils a thousand times , but the only examples I can think of are when he secretly suppressed Jean Grey 's abilities in the third X - Men movie , and when he hid the fact that he was in love with Jean Grey in Ultimate X - Men .
He also spared Magneto's life but told everyone he 'd killed Magneto in Ultimate X - Men as well .

Takeaway lesson :
If your mentor is secretly in love with you and is secretly holding you back and sabotaging your abilities , it maybe time to get mental on your mentor .

And then there 's Bill Adama in the new Battlestar Galactica , who lies to his protegee Starbuck ( and everyone else ) about knowing the secret location of Earth .
Laura Roslin tells
Starbuck the old man has been lying , which leads to this exchange between Starbuck and Adama :
" How much longer ' til we reach Earth ? " " It 's hard to say . "
" You got a guess ? " " You know I do n't like to guess . "
" We getting closer ? " " I 'm sure we are .
Good luck on the next test . "

Finally , a pissed off Starbuck decides to obey the President 's orders and go back to Caprica to get the Arrow of Apollo .
Takeaway lesson :
If someone blows the whistle on your lying mentor , you may as well listen to the whistleblower instead .
You can't do much worse , and you might get something useful out of it .

Other mentors we almost forgot include Sally Jupiter in Watchmen , who hides her daughter 's true parentage from her .
And the Confessor in Astro City , a superhero who hides his vampirism from his plucky sidekick .
And of course Captain Beatty in Fahrenheit 451 , who pressures Guy Montag to burn all of the books in his possession , and yet quotes constantly from books himself .
Who did we forget ?

The women were considered a public health risk
At least 43 female typhoid carriers were locked up for life in a mental hospital , the BBC has learned .
The women were held at Long Grove asylum in Epsom , Surrey , in the period between 1907 and its closure in 1992 .
They had recovered from the disease but still excreted the bacterium and posed a public health risk .
Nursing staff told a BBC investigation that some of the women may have been sane when they were admitted but went mad because of their incarceration .
Most of the records from the hospital were destroyed after it shut down .
But historians working at the Surrey History Centre in Woking discovered two volumes of records in the ruins of Long Grove .

All of the women came from the London area and between 1944 and 1957 three new carriers entered the unit each year .
Former nurses have told the BBC how the asylum was run like a prison .
Even after the advent of antibiotic treatments in the 1950s , the women were detained in the hospital because of the state of their mental health .
Jeanie Kennett , a ward manager who worked at Long Grove for 40 years , said it was a " basic existence " for the patients .
" They 're somebody 's loved ones , they 're somebody 's mother , or sister , everybody had forgotten about them - they were just locked away , " she said .
" Life was pretty tough ; they were seen as objects , it was prison - like - everything was lock and key . "
Prevent infection Former ward sister May Heffernan said members of staff refused to go inside the isolation ward and were made to scrub up carefully to prevent infection .
She said : " When you entered the building , the first thing you did was put on a surgical gown , we also at times wore masks .
as a public health risk , I think they were basically targeted and there was a lot of over - exaggeration about the threat they posed
Professor Hugh Pennington
Patients served a life sentence " And when you flushed the toilet it was actually boiling water that flushed the toilets . "
Hugh Pennington , emeritus professor of bacteriology at Aberdeen University , said the women would have posed only a small risk to the public .
" They certainly were infectious ; they had the potential to spread the infection to others if they had poor hygiene and they were preparing food and all that type of thing " , he said .
" But as a public health risk , I think they were basically targeted and there was a lot of over - exaggeration about the threat they posed . "
He added : " In fact most of the problems with typhoid were to do with bad water supplies and such like and typhoid getting into milk and things like that , rather than the odd typhoid carrier going around . "
The Department of Health told the BBC that there is not , and never has been , " a policy of incarcerating " anyone , in this context .

ELDORADO , N.M. , Jan. 7 ( UPI ) -- Authorities said a woman drowned in her Eldorado , N.M. , home after apparently trying to retrieve a kitten from a rain barrel .
Santa Fe County Sheriff Greg Solano said the body of Deborah Hill , 48 , was discovered by her husband just before 2 p.m. Sunday , the Santa Fe New Mexican reported Monday .

Solano said the couple had taken the 55 - gallon plastic rain barrel inside their home to thaw ice inside it .
The barrel was about one - third full once the ice had melted and the family 's kitten is believed to have fallen in .
" It looks like she was standing on something to reach down for the kitten and slid in herself , " Solano told the New Mexican .
The sheriff said no signs of foul play have been found by investigators .
" There 's pretty significant evidence for the cat theory , " he said .
" There 's scratches in the barrel and there 's scratches on the body . "
He said the barrel had been tied to the door to prevent it from tipping over .
" That means once she fell in , she was n't able to tip it herself , " he said to the newspaper .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The national minimum wage is set to increase by 70 cents on Thursday to $ 6.55 an hour , the second of three increases to take place after the wages earned by the nation ’s poorest and least educated failed to rise for ten years .
In an economy where the richest 20 percent in the country earned more than half of all income earned , experts say the increase is more than due .
“ It ’s about as perfect an economic stimulus as you can get .
Minimum wage raises go directly to those who absolutely need to go out and spend it on food and healthcare , ” said Holly Sklar , director of Business for Shared Prosperity , a network of business owners supporting minimum wages .
U.S. wages have not kept pace with inflation .
Taking into account higher prices paid for food , healthcare , housing and a range of other necessary expenditures , U.S. wages are equal to those paid 40 years ago .
“ It really comes down to what sort of economy are we running here , ” said John Arensmeyer , founder and Chief Executive Officer of the Small Business Majority , a national organization of business entrepreneurs .
“ It ’s a moral issue , but it ’s much more than that , it ’s an economic issue .
I do n’t think we should be trying to compete with third world countries on slave wages , ” said Arensmeyer .
A year ago , the first of three increases was mandated .
Next summer the wage will rise to $ 7.25 , but these increases come as more than half of U.S. state governments have raised minimum wages on their own above the federal standard , with a handful tying increases to annual inflation , an important criterion as higher energy , food and healthcare costs have cut into earnings .
HIGHER WAGES COULD MEAN JOB CUTS
But mandating a federal increase in minimum wage has its critics .
Many argue that this will hurt small business , reduce jobs , and add more of a tax on this economy that is already limping through the worst housing slump since the Great Depression .
“ In terms of timing , this could n’t come at a worse time , ” said Richard Vedder , Ohio University Professor and American Enterprise Institute Scholar , a conservative think tank here .
Already the economy has shed 438,000 jobs this year and will likely lose more as businesses cut back amid a credit crisis brought on by the worst housing collapse since the Great Depression .
Vedder warns that weakest segment of the workforce , teenagers , unskilled workers and minorities stand to suffer the most from the hike .
“ When the minimum wage goes up , some of these workers tend to be disproportionately minorities and they are younger people who naturally do n’t have the skills .
These are the people that are most impacted , ” he said .
Not only will the increase reduce jobs but employers will “ game the system ” by cutting back on benefits such as healthcare .
“ You could see a cut in some of these alternative benefits , ” he warns .
Other critics agree and caution that the imposed increases do nothing to reduce poverty .
“ These decisions end up hurting the very employees that wage increases are meant to help , ” the National Restaurant Association said in a policy statement .
NO EVIDENCE OF JOB LOSSES
Experts on the other side of the fence say there is no evidence that minimum wage increases lead to job losses and they emphasize that more wages earned translates into more money spent , helping local economies and small businesses .
“ We already have a lot of variation ( in minimum wages ) and there is no evidence of job losses , ” said Arindrajit Dube , labor economist with UC Berkeley Institute for Research on Labor and Employment .
He and others note that the sporadic increases are less effective and that regular increases , indexed to rates of inflation , would be a better approach .
“ We went from 1997 to 2007 , 10 years of complete stagnation of the minimum wage and a decline in the minimum wage in real terms and that just seems not a good way of doing policy , ” Dube said .
AFL - CIO President John Sweeney , the nation ’s largest labor federation , applauded the latest increase but called it a modest step .
“ To truly aid working families , we need to build an economy that works for all , not just the top 10 percent , ” he said .
“ Rising inflation -- especially in gas prices -- continues to eat away at the value of the minimum wage and all of wages . ”

The chief prosecutor wants to ban Prime Minister Erdogan from politics Turkey 's chief prosecutor has appeared before the country 's Constitutional Court calling for the governing party to be closed down .
Founded by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the Justice and Development Party , the AKP , won a landslide victory in the last election .
But its critics say it is trying to impose Sharia law on the secular state .
The party 's attempt to ease a ban on the wearing of the Islamic headscarf is expected to be central to the evidence .
Prosecutor Abdurraham Yalcinkaya , who has argued that the party has become the focal point of anti-secular activities in Turkey , is appearing before judges in a closed - door session .
" This risk has been increasing every day " reads the 162 - page petition submitted to the Constitutional Court by Mr Yalcinkaya .
" The danger is clear and concrete .
There is no other way to protect society than to close the party down , " it reads .

He is calling for the prime minister , president and 69 other party members to be banned from politics .
The AKP has condemned the case as an assault on democracy .
A team representing the party are expected to present their defence on Thursday .
The EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has warned the case could jeopardise Turkey 's bid to join the bloc - arguing such disputes should be resolved through the ballot box , not the courts .
' Plotters ' held The AKP was formed after a previous pro-Islamic party was banned .
Its founders have since steered a moderate path , pursuing democratic reforms and directing Turkey towards the EU , says the BBC's Sarah Rainsford .
But they spent their political youth in the ranks of an overtly Islamist movement - and ardent secularists do not believe their views have changed .
As the hearing opened , Turkish media said police had made a series of arrests of people believed to be linked to an anti-government network .
Two retired generals and a senior journalist were detained during an early morning swoop which broadcasters said was part of an investigation into an ultra-nationalist grouping called Ergenekon .
The group is reported to have planned political disturbances and is accused of trying to organise a coup against the government .
The police have made no official comment on the arrests .

MILFORD , Conn. , Aug. 27 ( UPI ) --
An 18 - year - old Boy Scout from Connecticut was diagnosed with the bubonic plague after his scout troop visited Wyoming , officials say .
Connecticut Yankee Council Scout executive Louis Salute said the unidentified scout had been bitten by a flea during a troupe outing last week to rural areas in Wyoming including Bridger - Teton National Forest , The Hartford ( Conn . ) Courant said Wednesday .

" It appears the boy was bitten by a flea , " Salute said .
" He came back here and got ill .
He was running a pretty high fever . "
After being taken to a hospital because of swelling of his neck and malaise , blood tests revealed the teenager was suffering from the bacterial disease .
Salute told the Courant said the disease , which most people commonly associate with the Black Death that decimated Europe six centuries ago , was caught in its first stage in the teen and was n't considered contagious or potentially fatal .
The newspaper said Wyoming officials are investigating the rural areas for signs of the potentially deadly infection .
Religion today in the USA is a salad bar where people heap on upbeat beliefs they like and often leave the veggies — like strict doctrines — behind .
There are so many ways of seeing God , public policy expert Barry Kosmin says , that " the highest authority is now the lowest common denominator . "
And the wide - ranging ways people construct their spiritual lives could make the so - called religious vote unpredictable in the 2008 elections .
Such are the key findings in latest data from the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life 's U.S. Religious Landscape Survey of 35,000 Americans .
Pew released demographic data in February from the survey , conducted May through August 2007 .
This new installment focuses on 60 questions about participants ' religious beliefs and social and political views .
The survey finds U.S. adults believe overwhelmingly ( 92 % ) in God , and 58 % say they pray at least once a day .
But the study 's authors say there 's a " stunning " lack of alignment between people 's beliefs or practices and their professed faiths .
Likewise , the long - standing links between highly religious people , conservative ideology and the Republican Party are starting to fray , says a co-author of the study , John Green , a Pew Forum senior research fellow .
" There are votes to be had for both Democrat and Republican candidates , " Green says .
" Evangelical Protestants ' votes may be more in flux than in 2004 … more open to persuasion . "
The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 0.6 percentage points for overall findings .
The margin is a bit larger for subgroups such as " evangelicals " ( 26.3 % of adults , who share strict ideas on salvation and common historic origins ) , mainline Protestants ( 18.1 % , who share " a less exclusionary view of salvation and a strong emphasis on social reform " ) and historically black churches ( 6.9 % , " shaped by experiences of slavery and segregation " ) .
Among the highlights :
• 78 % overall say there are " absolute standards of right and wrong , " but only 29 % rely on their religion to delineate these standards .
The majority ( 52 % ) turn to " practical experience and common sense , " with 9 % relying on philosophy and reason , and 5 % on scientific information .
• 74 % say " there is a heaven , where people who have led good lives are eternally rewarded , " but far fewer ( 59 % ) say there 's a " hell , where people who have led bad lives and die without being sorry are eternally punished . "
• 70 % , including a majority of all major Christian and non-Christian religious groups except Mormons , say " many religions can lead to eternal life . "
• 68 % say " there 's more than one true way to interpret the teachings of my religion . "
• 44 % want to preserve their religion 's traditional beliefs and practices .
But most Catholics ( 67 % ) , Jews ( 65 % ) , mainline Christians ( 56 % ) and Muslims ( 51 % ) say their religion should either " adjust to new circumstances " or " adopt modern beliefs and practices . "
Green observes , " Americans are deeply suspicious of institutional religion .
… ( Some see religion ) as about money , rules and power .
That 's not a positive connotation for everyone . "
• 50 % say " homosexuality is a way of life that should be accepted by society , " but the most consistently traditional religious groups say society should discourage it — 76 % of Jehovah 's Witnesses , 68 % of Mormons , 61 % of Muslims and 64 % of evangelicals .
• 51 % have a certain belief in a personal God , but 27 % are less certain of this , 14 % call God " an impersonal force , " and 5 % reject any kind of God .
" People say ' God , ' and no one knows who they mean , " says Kosmin , director of the Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture at Trinity College in Hartford , Conn .
• 14 % of all surveyed , including 28 % of evangelicals , say religion is the " main influence in their political thinking . "
Many who label themselves " conservative " also turn up in agreement with liberals and moderates on issues such as the environment , the economy and the role of government .
" Politics does n't occur in a vacuum , " says Green , pointing out a tendency by broadcast and print journalists to " focus on the most outspoken believers , who often tend to be the most conservative " and miss the tilt toward middle ground .
Church attendance is the best predictor of political activity — whether people vote — but beliefs predict how they vote , he says .
Pew Forum director Luis Lugo attributes the decline of dogmatism to living in a pluralistic society , in which friends , co-workers , even family members come from myriad faiths .
The survey found 37 % of couples with children were married to or living with someone from another religion or faith tradition , bringing diversity " right down to the kitchen table , " Lugo says .
" Americans believe in everything .
It 's a spiritual salad bar , " says Rice University sociologist Michael Lindsay .
Rather than religious leaders setting the cultural agenda , today , it 's Oprah Winfrey , he says .
" After the attack on Pearl Harbor , the national memorial service was at Washington 's National Cathedral , conducted by Episcopal clergy .
After the 9/11 attack , Oprah organized the official memorial service at Yankee Stadium , and while clergy participated , she was the master of ceremonies .
" The impact of Oprah is seen throughout this survey .
She uses the language of Bible and Christian traditions and yet includes other traditions to create a hodgepodge personalized faith .
Exclusivism ( one religion has the absolute and exclusive truth ) has gotten a bad name in America today , " he says .
Political science professor Alan Wolfe , director of the Boise Center for American and Public Life at Boston University , says many people , despite their religious claims , " have no command of theology , doctrine or history , so it 's an empty religiosity . "
Still , he finds " a very forgiving quality " to this non-sectarian , no - mention - of - sin view .
" No one wants to think their spouse , friends or co-workers are mad or bad . "
Duke University sociologist Mark Chaves , like Lugo , attributes the shifts to long - term changes in family with rising divorce , increased cohabitation , smaller families and steady increases in religiously mixed marriages .
" Do n't look at the church , look at home , " he says .
Among couples ( married or living together ) with children , 63 % say they read the Bible or pray with their children , and 60 % say they send kids for religious education .
The numbers drop significantly for the 37 % in religiously mixed marriages : 48 % say they pray or read Scripture with their children , and 44 % say they send their children for religious education , says Greg Smith , a Pew research fellow and co-author of the survey .
Adults under 30 are further from strict religious adherence than their parents .
Although other studies show they cycle back to religion at key moments such as marriage or rearing children , those spirals are getting smaller and smaller , says Tom Smith , director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Society at the University of Chicago , which has measured religion and society for decades through the General Social Survey .
" Every religious group has a major challenge on its hands from all directions , " says Lugo .
When he factors in Pew's February findings that 44 % of adults say they 've switched to another religion or none at all , Lugo says , " You have to wonder :
How do you guarantee the integrity of a religious tradition when so many people are coming or going or following ideas that do n't match up ? "
Cardinal Francis George , Archbishop of Chicago and president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , sees in the numbers that Catholics , like everyone else , are shaped by an individualistic culture where " people are trained to trust only their own spiritual experience " rather than in the historic message of the church .
" Religion is about conversion , self - surrender as opposed to self - righteousness , " he says .
" That 's hard in any culture but particularly in our own . "
The Rev. Frank Page of Taylors , S.C. , past president of the Southern Baptist Convention , the nation 's largest Protestant denomination , is not surprised by the Pew findings .
" The number ( of churches that ) teach a clear doctrinal Christianity are a minority today .
How would people know it when they never hear about how to be saved ? "
Still , Page is undaunted .
" Jesus predicted all this , " he says , quoting from the Bible ( Matthew 15:8 ) : " People honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me . "
" We still work as hard as we can to share the good news , " he says , " even though we know most will reject the way . "

If you ’re into adding a little JavaScript interactivity to your web pages you may have heard of JavaScript event delegation and thought it was one of those convoluted design patterns only hardcore JavaScript programmers worry about .
The truth is , if you already know how to add JavaScript event handlers , it ’s a snap to implement .
JavaScript events are the bedrock of all interactivity on web pages ( I mean serious interactivity , not those dinky CSS drop - down menus ) .
In traditional event handling you add or remove event handlers from each element as needed .
However , event handlers can potentially cause of memory leaks and performance degradation — the more you have , the greater the risk .
JavaScript event delegation is a simple technique by which you add a single event handler to a parent element in order to avoid having to add event handlers to multiple child elements .
How does it work ?
Event delegation makes use of two often overlooked features of JavaScript events : event bubbling and the target element .
When an event is triggered on an element , for example a mouse click on a button , the same event is also triggered on all of that element ’s ancestors .
This process is known as event bubbling ; the event bubbles up from the originating element to the top of the DOM tree .
The target element of any event is the originating element , the button in our example , and is stored in a property of the event object .
Using event delegation it ’s possible to add an event handler to an element , wait for an event to bubble up from a child element and easily determine from which element the event originated .
How will it help me ?
Imagine an HTML table with 10 columns and 100 rows in which you want something to happen when the user clicks on a table cell .
For example , I once had to make each cell of a table of that size editable when clicked .
Adding event handlers to each of the 1000 cells would be a major performance problem and , potentially , a source of browser - crashing memory leaks .
Instead , using event delegation , you would add only one event handler to the table element , intercept the click event and determine which cell was clicked .
What does it look like in code ?
The code is simple ; we only need to worry about detecting the target element .
Let ’s say we have a table element with the ID “ report ” and we have added an event handler to the table for the click event that will call the editCell function .
The editCell function will need to determine the target element for the event that has bubbled up to the table .
Expecting that we ’ll write a few event handler functions that will need this functionality , we ’ll place it in a separate function called getEventTarget :
function getEventTarget(e ) { e = e || window.event ; return e.target || e.srcElement ; }
The variable e represents the event object and we need only a sprinkling of cross - browser code to gain access to and return the target element , stored in the srcElement property in Internet Explorer and the target property in other browsers .
Next is the editCell function that calls the getEventTarget function .
Once we have a reference to the target element it ’s up to us to make sure the element is the one we ’re expecting :
function editCell(e ) { var target = getEventTarget(e ) ; if ( target.tagName.toLowerCase ( ) === ' td ' ) { // DO SOMETHING WITH THE CELL } }
In the editCell function we confirm that the target element is a table cell by checking its tag name .
That check may be over simplified ; what if it ’s another element inside the table cell that is the target of the event ?
A quick modification that adds code to find the parent td element may be needed .
What if some cells should not be editable ?
In that case we can add a specific class name to a non-editable cell and check that the target element does not have that class name value before making it editable .
Many options are available and you ’ll just need to choose the one that suits your application .
What are the pros and cons ?
The benefits of JavaScript event delegation are :
There are less event handlers to setup and reside in memory .
This is the big one ; better performance and less crashing .
.
This is the big one ; better performance and less crashing .
There ’s no need to re-attach handlers after a DOM update .
If your page content is generated dynamically , via Ajax for example , you do n’t need to add and remove event handlers as elements are loaded or unloaded .
The potential problems may be less clear , but once you are aware of them they ’re easily avoided :
There ’s a risk your event management code could become a performance bottleneck , so keep it as lean as possible .
Not all events bubble .

You need caution when managing some mouse events .
If your code is handling the mousemove event you are in serious risk of creating a performance bottleneck because the mousemove event is triggered so often .
The mouseout event has a quirky behaviour that is difficult to manage with event delegation .
Summary
There are JavaScript event delegation examples available that use major libraries : jQuery , Prototype , and Yahoo !
UI .
You can also find examples using no library at all , like this one from the Usable Type blog .
Event delegation is a handy tool to have in your kit should the need arise and easy to implement .
“ If you look at those objects before I do , I ’ll kill you , ” John N. Bahcall , an astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study , once told Eric J. Chaisson , now at Tufts University , who was then in charge of public outreach and wanted to take some pretty pictures .

That tale was news to me .
It is recounted in “ The Universe in Mirror : The Saga of the Hubble Space Telescope and the Visionaries Who Built It ” ( Princeton University Press ) , a breezy behind - the - scenes account by Robert Zimmerman , a freelance writer and space historian .
We hear all the time about the great science Hubble is doing , orbiting high above the murky , turbulent atmosphere , and the astronomers using it to stalk dark energy or planets around other stars .
This fall astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis will be in the spotlight as they perform one last maintenance call on the telescope .
But there is a group less well known : people like C.R. O’Dell , known as Bob , who gave up his research career to manage the space telescope project at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala . ; Nancy G. Roman , who championed space astronomy to the agency and her colleagues ; Lyman S. Spitzer Jr. , the Princeton astronomer who thought up the telescope way back in 1946 and then was frozen out of using it ; Frank J. Cepollina , the Goddard Space Flight Center engineer who designed Hubble ’s servicing missions .
These people spent years trudging the corridors of Congress and NASA , fighting bureaucratic battles , defending budgets , hassling with contractors , making hard decisions that alienated their friends , devising fantastical fixes for fantastical problems , skirting the edge of the law and generally growing old without glory .
Isaac Newton once said that if he saw farther than most people , it was because he stood on the shoulders of giants .
If Hubble sees farther , it is because of these men and women , who come to life , warts and all , in Mr. Zimmerman ’s book , and of the process , messy and uncomfortable as it may be , by which dreams are turned into legacies in a democratic society .

What are the worst blights facing our society today ?
A version of that question was asked 104 years ago by Joseph Rowntree , one of Britain 's most famous Quakers .
Rowntree thought the " scourges of humanity " facing his world were poverty , war , slavery , intemperance , the opium trade , impurity and gambling .
A new poll commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation asks a similar question of the UK population today , and the results could have Mr Rowntree turning in his grave .
The " dominant opinion " , according to researchers , is that religion is a " social evil " which leads to intolerance and ignorance .
Terry Sanderson of the National Secular Society is claiming a victory of sorts ; the public , he says , have had it with religion .
I suspect that religion will continue to flourish long after the National Secular Society has ceased to exist .
But the question people of faith need to ask is why the public today are so distrustful of religious believers .
One answer to that question is the public 's perception of religious people as Victorian nay - sayers who oppose scientific progress and bemoan the diversity we now see in so much of our society .
One respondent in the study said : " Faith in supernatural phenomena inspires hatred and prejudice throughout the world , and is commonly used as justification for persecution of women , gays and people who do not have faith . "
Updated ORLANDO – Addressing both his opponent ’s charges of weakness and vacillation , and public doubts about his credibility on military matters , Senator Barack Obama on Tuesday told the Veterans of Foreign Wars that he offered not just tough talk but smart answers to national security questions .
Mr. Obama appeared before the V.F.W. a day after his presumed Republican opponent , Senator John McCain , criticized him for advocating a policy of defeat in Iraq and suggested Mr. Obama put personal ambition before the interests of the country .
Mr. Obama struck back with tough language , although his delivery was largely without passion .
He received a polite but not enthusiastic response from the estimated 3,000 veterans assembled in a cavernous convention hall here .
Many seats were empty because a number of veterans left Orlando ahead of the advancing tropical storm Fay .
“ If we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart , then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ If we think that we can use the same partisan politics where we just challenge our opponent ’s patriotism to win an election , then the American people will lose .
The times are too serious for this kind of politics .
The calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great . ”
Mr. Obama defended his judgment in opposing the war from the outset , saying it had cost America dearly in lives and treasure while feeding radical Islamic movements across the globe .
He also said that while new American tactics and political changes on the ground in Iraq had reduced violence there , he still believed that the troop escalation or surge had been a mistake because it diverted effort from the more important effort against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan .
And he stood by his determination to remove virtually all American combat troops from Iraq by mid-2010 , noting that Iraqi political leaders had endorsed the timetable .
He paid the obligatory homage to Mr. McCain ’s military service and sacrifice as a Vietnam prisoner of war , but then raked him for impugning his motives and patriotism .
He said that he and Mr. McCain were competing for the position of commander in chief and that veterans , and all Americans , should judge them not only on their past but on what they propose to do in the future .
“ But instead of just offering policy answers , he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks , ” Mr. Obama said of Mr. McCain .
“ He said that I have changed my position on Iraq when I have not .
He said that I am for a path of retreat and failure .
And he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by Senator Obama lies the ambition to be president , suggesting , as he has so many times before , that I put personal ambition before my country . ”
Mr. Obama also spoke about the Russian invasion of Georgia , saying “ there is no possible justification for Russia ’s actions . ”
He said Russian troops were guilty of atrocities against civilians and had failed to meet its pledge to withdraw its forces immediately .
And he dropped into his speech the name of one of the purported front - runners to be his vice - presidential running mate , Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. , who returned Monday from a weekend trip to the Georgian capital , Tbilisi .
Mr. Obama endorsed Mr. Biden ’s call to provide $ 1 billion in reconstruction aid for the people of Georgia .
Mr. Obama said that he and Mr. McCain had genuine differences about the course of the war in Iraq and the place of the United States in the world .
But he said those were legitimate subjects for debate rather than personal vitriol .
“ These are the judgments I ’ve made and the policies that we have to debate , because we do have differences in this election .
But one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people can’t disagree without challenging each other ’s character and patriotism , ” he said to a smattering of applause .
“ I have never suggested and never will that Senator McCain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition .
I have not suggested it because I believe that he genuinely wants to serve America ’s national interest .
Now , it ’s time for him to acknowledge that I want to do the same . ”
The McCain campaign criticized Mr. Obama ’s record on Iraq and veterans ’ affairs even before he delivered his speech , saying he had voted against troop financing last year and had exaggerated his record on support for veterans ’ health care and other benefits .
The Obama campaign replied that he opposed one troop funding bill in 2007 because it did not provide a timetable for withdrawal .
It released a bill of bills he has supported or sponsored to improve education , health care , family support and training benefits for veterans and their families .
In a reprise of his 2004 Democratic National Convention speech and in what may be a preview of next week ’s presidential nomination acceptance speech , he called for all Americans to put aside partisan acrimony to support a larger cause .
“ Let me be clear , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ I will let no one question my love of this country .
I love America , so do you , and so does John McCain .
When I look out at this audience , I see people of different political views .
You are Democrats and Republicans and Independents .
But you all served together , and fought together , and bled together under the same proud flag .
You did not serve a Red America or a Blue America , you served the United States of America . ”
That passage received the warmest applause of his 30 - minute address .
President Bush is scheduled to address the V.F.W. on Wednesday .
