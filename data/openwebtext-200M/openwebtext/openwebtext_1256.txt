In the natural world , foraging bees are very effective at isolating and following the scent of a favourite nectar - bearing flower .
This ability is central to the insect 's survival and the bees have to learn many different odours to locate desirable pollen and nectar .
The bee 's antennae are densely covered with individual sensors .
This natural hardwiring explains why the bees are so easy to train to an odour .
Wherever they are working , Inscentinel always uses local honeybees , which are best adapted to local conditions

With December almost done , and all the banks having already issued their rosy outlooks for 2010 ( do n't ask us how the trading desks are axed , but you be sure a certain sense of " contrarianism " permeates Goldman 's traders ) , the objective third pary strategists begin chiming in .
We present Rosie 's 2010 outlook from Today 's Breakfast with Dave piece , courtesy of Gluskin Sheff .
The credit collapse and the accompanying deflation and overcapacity are going to drive the economy and financial markets in 2010 .
We have said repeatedly that this recession is really a depression because the recessions of the post - WWII experience were merely small backward steps in an inventory cycle but in the context of expanding credit .
Whereas now , we are in a prolonged period of credit contraction , especially as it relates to households and small businesses ( as we highlighted in our small business sentiment write - up yesterday ) .
In addition , we have characterized the rally in the economy and global equity markets appropriately as a bear market rally from the March lows , influenced by the heavy hand of government intervention and stimulus .
But in classic Bob Farrell form , 2010 may well be seen as the year in which we witness the inevitable drawn out decline that is typical of secular bear markets .
There may be some risk in industrial commodities if global growth underperforms , but the soft commodities , such as agriculture , may outperform in the same way that consumer staple equities should outperform cyclicals in an environment where economic growth disappoints the consensus view .
Gold is operating on its own particular set of global supply and demand curves and should be an outperformer as well , especially when the next down - leg in the U.S. dollar occurs .
We are not alone in espousing this view — have a look at Why Consumes Are Likely to Keep on Saving on page C1 of today ’s WSJ .
The defining characteristic of this asset deflation and credit contraction has been the implosion of the largest balance sheet in the world — the U.S. household sector .
Even with the bear market rally in equities and the tenuous recovery in housing in 2009 , the reality is that household net worth has contracted nearly 20 % over the past year - and - a - half , or an epic $ 12 trillion of lost net worth , a degree of trauma we have never seen before .
As households begin to assess the shock and what it means for their retirement needs , the impact of this shocking loss of wealth on consumer spending patterns in the future is likely going to be very significant .
Frugality is the new fashion and likely to stay that way for years as attitudes toward discretionary spending , homeownership and credit undergo a secular shift towards prudence and conservatism .
While hedge funds and short - coverings have been the major sources of buying power for the equity market this year , what has really impressed me is what the general public has been doing with their savings , which is to allocate more towards fixed - income strategies .
Looking at the U.S. household balance sheet , what I see on the asset side is a 25 % weighting towards equities , a 30 % weighting towards real estate and there is obviously a lot in cash and deposits , life insurance reserves and consumer durables , but the weighting in fixed - income securities is less than 7 % .
So my contention is that this is the part of the asset mix that will expand the most in the next five to 10 years and I am constructive on income strategies .
What also makes this cycle entirely different from all the other ones experienced in the post - WWII era is that this is the first consumer recession we have witnessed where the median age of the baby boom population is 52 going on 53 .
The last time we had a consumer recession in the early 1990s , the boomer population was in their early 30s and they were still expanding their balance sheets .
The last time we had a bubble burst in 2001 they were in their early 40s .
Now they are in their early 50s , the first of the boomers are in their early 60s , and we are talking about a critical mass of 78 million people who have driven everything in the economy and capital markets over the last five decades .
This cohort realize that they may never fully recoup their lost net worth , and yet they will probably live another 20 or 30 years .
So , what is happening , which is at the same time fascinating and disturbing , is that the only part of the population actually seeing any job growth in this recession are people over the age of 55 .
Everyone else ca n’t get a job or are losing jobs — there is a youth unemployment crisis in the United States of epic proportions and a record number of Americans have been out of work for longer than six months in part because the “ aging but not aged ” crowd is not retiring as early as they used to .
My contention is that many retirees who took themselves out of the workforce because they believed that their net worth would provide for them sufficiently in their golden years are redoing their calculations and coming back to the workforce to make up for their lost wealth .
They are seeking income in the labour market , not because they want to but because they have to in order to satisfy their retirement lifestyles .
So , instead of being tempted into capital appreciation equity strategies , for every dollar that the household sector has allocated to these funds since the March lows , over $ 10 dollars has flowed into income funds — bonds , hybrids , dividends and the like ; the areas of the investment sphere that we have been recommending this year .
We can understand that there are concerns over inflation , but the history of post - bubble credit collapses is that even with massive policy reflation , deflation pressures can dominate for years — this was certainly the case in the U.S.A. and Canada in the 1930s , and again in Japan from the 1990s until today .
Income strategies in both cases worked well with minimal volatility .
Of course , all the talk right now is about reflation and all the efforts from the central banks to create inflation , but the facts on the ground show that the inflation rate for both consumers and producers has turned negative for the first time in six decades .
Perhaps inflation is a consensus forecast but deflation is the present day reality and often lingers for years following a busted asset and credit bubble of the magnitude we have endured over the past two years .
So , to protect the portfolio in this deflationary landscape , a pervasive focus on capital preservation and income orientation , whether that be in bonds , hybrids , or a focus on consistent dividend growth and dividend yield would seem to be in order .
Be that as it may , what has also become crystal clear is the attitude that the U.S. government has taken over the beleaguered U.S. dollar , which can only be described as benign neglect .
After all , 2010 is a mid-term election year in the U.S. and the Administration will do everything it can to squeeze every last possible basis point out of GDP growth and to prevent the unemployment rate , the most emotionally - charged statistic of them all , from reaching new highs .
The decisions to give 57 million social security recipients another $ 250 and to not only extend the first - time homebuyer tax credit but to expand the subsidy to higher - income trade - up buyers smacks of populist economic policies that will stop at nothing to generate growth , even with the budget deficit - to - GDP ratio is already at a record of over 10 % .
While I still believe that a sustainable return to inflation is a long ways away , there is little doubt that we will see continuous efforts at policy reflation , which means that the U.S. money supply is going to continue to expand rapidly , which in turn is positive for commodities , which are after all priced in U.S. dollars .
On top of all that , it does appear from a volume demand perspective , that the secular growth dynamics in Asia , China and India in particular , have reasserted themselves and this part of the world is the marginal buyer of commodities .
This is the key reason why the Canadian stock market , given its resource exposure , has continued to do very well in comparison to the United States , especially when the positive trend in the Canadian dollar enters the equation , and I expect this outperformance to continue .
Typical of a post - bubble credit collapse , I see the range of outcomes in the financial markets and the economy to be extremely wide .
But one conclusion I think we can agree on in this light is the need to maintain defensive strategies and minimize volatility and downside risks as well as to focus on where the secular fundamentals are positive such as in fixed - income and in equity sectors that lever off the commodity sector , under the proviso that the “ experts ” are correct on this particular forecast — that China and India remain the global growth leaders .
With that in mind , we were encouraged to see this on page B1 of today ’s NYT — Cutting Back ?
Not in China : Rising Incomes Make it Easier to Splurge .
As Dennis Gartman pointed out yesterday , there was a time ( 1820 ) when the U.S.A. was 2 % of global GDP and Asia was 33 % .
That is tough for a lot of folks to swallow but maybe we will see in our lifetime a period when the Chinese economy does surpass the size of the U.S.A. ( with 1.3 billion people , four times the U.S. population that actually seems quite likely ) .
After all , for the first time ever , China is going to be buying more vehicles than Americans will this year ( then again , 20 % of the Chinese are n’t exactly three - car families either ) — 12.8 million units in China compared to 10.3 million in the U.S .
And it ’s not even fair to compare appliances any more either with consumption in China now up to 185 million ( we are talking about washers , dryers , refrigerators , etc ) versus an expected 137 million in the American market .
In Q3 , Chinese consumers bought more computers ( 7.2 million ) than the U.S.A. too ( 6.6 million ) .
So while China is indeed still export - dependant and relies heavily on government infrastructure projects , there may be something to be said , at the margin , that consumer demand is also becoming an important contributor to its economic growth .
Now keep in mind that most of this stuff is made in China and not in the U.S.A. , so this is more of a commodity - input story than it is a U.S. export story .
China ’s strategy of deploying its surpluses in assets around the world is quite a bit different than what Japan did with its surpluses in the 1980s .
China is not into golf courses or movie studios as much as in gaining ownership of global resources in the ground .
At last count , the country has signed trade deals with Africa to the tune of $ 60 billion ( heck , that ’s only 8 % of the size of TARP , which is now going to be diverted towards a government - led job creation program in the U.S.A. ) .
Have a look at the nifty article on the topic on page 11 of the FT — Africa Builds as Beijing Scrambles to Invest .
This is a video of Roomba Pac - Man in action .
A few clarifications :
The red tape on the floor is simply so the user can visualize the map in the real world .
The robots are unaware of the tape , and are rather constrained by a virtual boundary embedded in their programming .
The " dots " on the floor are pieces of paper the the Pac - Man Roomba must vacuum up to complete the map .
The ghosts actually autonomously search for Pac - Man , and when they get close enough to " sense " Pac - Man , chase him according to a set of probabalistic rules .
The human controller cannot force the Pac - Man to cross any boundaries , it will only allow inputs in valid directions .

ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan 's beleaguered president , Asif Ali Zardari , is under increasing pressure to step down or to relinquish most of his sweeping powers immediately , as growing political tension threatens the stability of the Muslim nation in the midst of a critical battle with Taliban militants .
In an attempt to defuse the situation , Mr. Zardari over the weekend transferred command of the country 's nuclear arsenal to Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani , signaling his willingness to shed some of his powers .
Mr. Gilani said Sunday the transfer of the chairmanship was " a true litmus test " of relations between him and the president .
Mr. Zardari's move could be the first in a series to diminish his power in an effort to retain his party 's backing .
He is under pressure also to shed his powers to dismiss the parliament and to make key military appointments .
But analysts said the president 's weekend maneuver had only symbolic value .
It seems to have failed to appease his opponents , who said the president needed to act sooner .
" It does not have any political value for Mr. Zardari in the power struggle , " said Maleeha Lodhi , a former Pakistani ambassador and a senior fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington .
Many people passed under the sign to their deaths
The infamous Arbeit Macht Frei sign at the entrance to the Auschwitz Nazi death camp in Poland has been stolen .
The wrought iron sign , whose words mean " Work Sets You Free " , was unscrewed and pulled down from its position above the gate in the early hours of Friday .
Polish authorities denounced the theft , while Israel 's Holocaust museum branded it an " act of war " .
More than a million people - 90 % of them Jews - were murdered by the Nazis at Auschwitz during World War II .
Investigators say at least two people would have been needed to steal the five - metre- long ( 16ft ) , 40kg ( 90 lb ) sign .
The theft occurred between 0330 and 0500 local time on Friday , police spokeswoman Katarzyna Padlo told AP news agency .
HISTORY OF AUSCHWITZ SIGN Made by Polish political prisoners in 1940 Letter ' B ' thought to have been reversed as act of defiance - making it appear upside - down Locals say Red Army soldiers were bribed to leave it in Poland after camp was liberated Occasionally replaced by replica while conservation work is done
Symbol of death and defiance Auschwitz : Past and present Audio - slideshow : Auschwitz decay Jarek Mensfelt , from the Auschwitz - Birkenau Museum , told the BBC : " It is more than just stealing something .
It is a desecration .
" Somebody who did this must have been a person who had a knowledge of our security system because all the area is closed at night and patrolled and there is a system of cameras , " he added .
" This was not an incident - this was a deliberate and organised action . "
Avner Shalev , director of Israel 's Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial , said the theft " constitutes a true declaration of war " .
He added : " We do n't know the identity of the perpetrators but I assume they are neo - Nazis . "
Polish ex-President Lech Walesa described the theft as " unthinkable " , while Poland 's chief rabbi said he could not imagine who would do such a thing .
" If they are pranksters , they'd have to be sick , " said Michael Schudrich .
Polish President Lech Kaczynski called on the public to help recover the sign , which he described as a " worldwide symbol of the cynicism of Hitler 's executioners and the martyrdom of their victims " .
Israeli President Shimon Peres also condemned the theft during a special meeting with Poland 's Prime Minister Donald Tusk .
In a statement , his office said Mr Peres " expressed the deepest shock of Israel 's citizens and the Jewish community across the world " , and urged Poland to " make every effort " it could to find the criminals and return the sign .
The BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw says police are interviewing security guards and viewing closed circuit television footage .
It is not clear why it was stolen but museum officials say the widely recognised sign would be difficult to sell .

More from BBC World Service Oswiecim Police spokeswoman Malgorzata Jurecka told AFP : " All leads are being considered , but we are focusing on a theft ordered by a private collector or a group of individuals . "
It is the first time the sign , made by Polish prisoners , has been stolen since it was erected in 1940 .
It has now been replaced with a replica while the hunt continues .
A 5,000 - zloty ( $ 1,700 ; £ 1,050 ) reward has been offered for information leading to the capture of the thieves , reports AP .
The cynical slogan " Arbeit Macht Frei " was also used at the entrances to other German Nazi camps , including Dachau and Sachsenhausen , although the one at Auschwitz is perhaps the best known .
Hundreds of thousands of prisoners passed under the sign into the camp during the Holocaust , but the majority were murdered or worked to death .
The theft comes just days after the German government pledged 60 m euros ( $ 86 m ) to an endowment fund to help preserve the camp .
Auschwitz , which receives more than a million visitors a year , has been run as a state museum since 1947 .
Here is a selection of comments BBC News readers have sent to us in reaction to this story :
This act is simply repulsive .
I am left speechless and saddened .
Please let me know if there is a fund that has been set up that will allow myself and others to contribute to the reward being offered .
Brian , East Lyme , Connecticut , USA
How is this different to people removing metal plaques from war memorials or lead off church roofs ?
It may not be sold as a sign , but with metal prices as high as they are it could already be melted down and reused .
As a sign it may have sentimental meaning , but it could just be an act of theft , not " a declaration of war " against the Jewish state .
Phil , London , UK
The sign belongs at the bottom of the ocean , or melted down in a forge .
The thieves were probably sons or grandsons of survivors , putting that nazi propaganda to rest .
Kyle W Lewis , USA I am appalled at Israel 's reaction to the theft of the sign .
Their reaction suggests they are paranoid and still see hatred in others ' actions regardless of whether they were directed at them .
The sign on Auschwitz 's entrance is an iconic sign and there are many people who would steal such a piece of history .
It shows paranoia on Israel 's part to brand this an act of hatred toward Jews .
I believe the taking of the sign is more likely to be a bit of fun , an opportunity for someone to get their hands on a piece of history and get one over on those charged to protect the site .
Rebecca Bradbury , Exeter , UK Abominable behaviour .
I have visited the camp and it is the most incredibly atmospheric and moving place I have ever been to .
You can just feel the despair and depravity .
Why would anyone wish to add insult to the memory of these people .
Denise Carey , Northampton , UK After visiting Auschwitz in November for the first time , I think it is awful to see what some people can stoop to .
It 's such an historic , sad and overwhelming site , how anyone can do this is unthinkable and I hope they are caught and severely punished .
Horrible people .
Chris Carless , Liverpool , England I recently visited Auschwitz and the sign was the first symbol that ingrained itself on my memory .
The message on the sign displayed the Nazis ' sickening subterfuge for callousness and cruelty and mass murder .
The whole experience was very emotional and it beggars belief that anyone could go to such a place with ideas of theft or to dishonour the memories of the poor souls who suffered there .
An absolute henious act .
Shame on you .
Michael Tremarco , Liverpool , UK Very shocking .
The cynical sign reminded everyone how sick the human mind can become .
Unfortunately , there is no shortage of maniacal and murderous people to take the place of the departed despots and their depraved followers .
Freddie Chisale , Norton , Zimbabwe A Nazi slogan , intended to enforce and celebrate the enslavement of their Jewish victims , is taken away .
And the theft is condemned by Jewish and Israeli leaders as an anti-semitic act .
History moves in mysterious and ironic ways .
Stephen Engelhard , London , UK
It is absolutely disgusting and we are utterly appalled by such a vicious act of vandalism .
Rachel Melieres - Frost , Petersfield , UK I am absolutely appalled to think somebody would do this .
I visited Auschwitz last year and I regard this sign as a symbol of Nazi atrocities .
I hope they recover the sign soon .
Mike Phillip , Axbridge , Somerset , UK I am so sad that the Jewish people and countless others who were victims of the atrocities by the Nazis at Auschwitz must endure this blatant act of terrorism .
At this time of year we often see acts of humanity to renew our faith in man , but this inhumanity has broken my heart .

A Paris court on Friday found U.S. Internet giant Google guilty of violating copyright by digitising books and putting extracts online , following a legal challenge by major French publishers .
PARIS , Dec 18 ( Reuters ) - A Paris court on Friday found U.S. Internet giant Google guilty of violating copyright by digitising books and putting extracts online , following a legal challenge by major French publishers .
The court found against Google after the La Martiniere group , which controls the highbrow Editions du Seuil publishing house , argued that publishers and authors were losing out in the latest stage of the digital revolution .
La Martiniere , the French Publishers ' Association and authors ' groups SGDL argued that scanning books was an act of reproduction that should be paid for , and demanded the U.S. company be fined 15 million euros ( $ 21.59 million ) .

The Dow fell slightly on Friday .
Oil ended the week at $ 77 .
The dollar went nowhere .
But gold rose to a new high – $ 1,146 .
Whatever else may be going on , there ’s a real bull market in gold .
It ’s a bull market that began ten years ago .
If you ’d bought stocks then , you ’d have about what you have now…less inflation .
If you ’d bought gold … you have about 4 times what you had then .
Today , a quick glance at a chart shows gold looking a little toppy .
Expect a correction .
But remember , this is a bull market .
In a bull market , you buy the dips .
Stocks , meanwhile , are in a bear market .
In a bear market , you sell the rallies .
This looks like a good time to sell – if you have n’t done so already .
“ Take Your Gains , ” says Forbes .
And once you ’re out of stocks , stay out until the bear market is over …probably at around 3,000 – 5,000 on the Dow .
When the price of gold equal the price of the Dow , it will be time to switch .
We have n’t seen the last of this bull market in gold .
It ’s what you buy when you think government is making a mess of the monetary situation .
You put your trust in gold as an antidote …as protection … as wealth insurance .
Are the feds making a mess of the monetary situation ?
Oh dear , dear reader … please ask us something harder .
Trillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see …
Stimulus spending that turns the US into a Zombie Economy …
Handouts to the bankers … gifts to the carry traders …
The feds are out - doing themselves …
As for the bear market on Wall Street , investors are counting on a miracle …a ‘ recovery ’ that doubles corporate earnings in just a couple years .
They think it ’s “ just like 1982 ” .
Of course , it is just the opposite of 1982 … see the chart below .
Besides , there is no recovery … and profits will go down , as businesses compete for less spending .
The recovery may be all in your head , writes Robert Shiller , in The New York Times :
“ Consider this possibility : after all these months , people start to think it ’s time for the recession to end .
The very thought begins to renew confidence , and some people start spending again – in turn , generating visible signs of recovery .
This may seem absurd , and is rarely mentioned as an explanation for mass behavior late in a recession , but economic theorists have long been fascinated by such a possibility .
The notion is n’t as farfetched as it may appear .
As we all know , recessions generally last no more than a couple of years .
The current recession began in December 2007 , according to the National Bureau of Economic Research , so it is almost two years old .
According to the standard schedule , we ’re due for recovery .
Given this knowledge , the mere passage of time may spur our confidence , though no formal statistical analysis can prove it ….
Back in 1931 , for example , The New York Times attributed the emerging economic cataclysm to a “ mood of pessimism which had been carried to grotesque extremes . ”
In 1932 , it compared reckless talk about “ depression ” to shouting “ fire ” in a crowded theater . ”
It does n’t matter what anyone says .
It ’s a depression .
It ’s nothing like the garden - variety recessions of the Post - War period .
It ’s a depression because of the nature of the work it has to do .
It has to clean up 3 decades ’ worth of filthy balance sheets .
It has to wipe away trillions in trashy consumer debt .
It has to defuse trillions more of Wall Street ’s debt bombs .
It has to wash out billions … maybe trillions … worth of bad decisions – houses that are too big , too expensive , too grandiose for their buyers … shopping malls with far too much retail space for the new , thrifty customers … businesses geared up to produce goods and services for millions of people who can no longer afford them .
When will the depression be over ?
When the work is done .
But wait … the world ’s government piling up trash faster than the depression can haul it away .
And here comes the next mega-crisis !
“ US cost of paying i.o.u. ’s gets steeper , ” says a front - page headline at The International Herald Tribune .
And over at The Financial Times in London , Gillian Tett asks “ Will sovereign debt be the next sub- prime ? ”
Everyone knows what when wrong with sub -prime .
When you lend money to people who ca n’t pay it back , you ’re asking for trouble .
So , if you ’re out of a job and looking for a sub - prime loan to buy a double - wide trailer you ’re out of luck .
Bankers wo n’t give you a dime .
But now , the world ’s lenders are doing something just as dumb .
They ’re lending to governments .
Imagine you were a banker .
And the US government comes to you for a loan .
“ Do you have enough income to cover the payments , ” you ask .
“ Well , no , ” comes the answer .
“ In fact , our revenue has fallen off a little .
Because of the recession , you know .
Like everyone else . ”
“ How bad is it ? ”
“ Uh …we spend nearly two dollars for every dollar of income . ”
“ Oh …and you expect us to lend you money ?
What do you have for collateral ?
What is your net worth position ? ”
“ We were hoping you would n’t ask .
The most recent tally of our obligations comes to $ 113 trillion . ”
“ Well , do n’t you have assets ? ”
“ We have some buildings in Washington … military bases around the world … things like that .
But as a practical matter , you could never foreclose on them . ”
“ Oh , I see … ”
What is interesting is that the world ’s investors are beginning to see that the US and many other governments are bad credit risks .
This is an extraordinary event .
Until now , the US government has been able to finance and refinance its debts at the lowest rates in three generations .
Lenders have wanted to lend the feds money , because they believed they were the safest credits in the world .
Bankers can always be counted on to find the worst investments at the worst time .
They are at the tail end of the chain of insights that begins with the sharpest , most independent - thinking analysts …runs through the broker / hedge fund community … passes on to the financial journalists and the TV pundits … arrives at the lumpeninvestoriat through the popular media …and finally gets to bankers when they pick up the Wall Street Journal and read about what ’s going on .
Now , the bankers are buying sovereign debt – government paper – because they think it offers a “ risk free ” return .
In fact , it is one of the riskiest investments you can make .
This year and next , major governments will need to raise $ 12 trillion to fund their debts and deficits .
That is a huge increase to the world ’s supply of sovereign bonds .
Colleague Porter Stansberry estimates that the US government alone will need to finance $ 4.5 trillion worth of bonds next year .
That amount is twice the total capital of the world ’s biggest central bank – the Fed .
Even if the Chinese took every penny they have in financial reserves and used it to buy US debt , there would still be about $ 2.3 trillion in bonds left unsold .
As to the cost of servicing the debt , that too is expected to reach breathtaking levels .
Even the Obama Administration forecasts the interest payments to increase from $ 200 billion at present to $ 700 billion by 2019 .
This is surely a misunderestimation .
If the deficits rise to the level predicted by former OMB head David Stockman , the national debt will soar from $ 12 trillion to more than $ 20 trillion in about 5 years .
Lenders are sure to wise up and ask for higher yields .
Even a banker is likely to want more than 3.5 % interest for lending money to the feds for 10 years .
Maybe 5 % … maybe 10 % .
Remember that during the early years of Volcker ’s time at the Fed , the lending rate rose to 18 % on a 10 - year Treasury note .
There is also a possibility – which seems remote as of this writing – that a government bond auction could go ‘ no bid . ’
It happens .
When lenders come to see the risk higher than the potential rewards , even at high yields .
And when it happens – or even approaches – the feds will be in the same situation that hundreds of their forebears faced over many centuries .
All governments go broke from time to time .
Then , they default .
When they run up more debt than they can pay … like a sub - prime borrower , they always go broke .
And here ’s something interesting .
As near as we can make out this is a joint effort by David Rosenberg and Barry Ritholtz .
It is an answer to the question : Is n’t this just like 1982 all over again ?
The short answer : no , it is n’t .
Tom Cruise !
He is so crazy , what with the Scientology madness .
It 's been so long since we heard examples of his craziness .
Thank god there is a new tell - all book !
In which Tom Cruise controls inanimate objects , with brainwaves .
Scientology refugee Marc Headley has written a book called Blown For Good — featuring a dramatic , action - scene - type cover — detailing his 15 years of work inside Scientology .
The Village Voice interviewed him about his 1990 " auditing " session performed by Days of Thunder - era Tom Cruise himself .
" You do a lot of things with a book and a bottle , " Headley says .
" It 's known as the book - and - bottle routine . "
Cruise , he says , would instruct Headley to speak to a book , telling it to stand up , or to sit down , or otherwise to move somewhere .
" You do the same with the bottle .
You talk to it .
You do it with an ashtray too , " he says .
" You tell the ashtray , ' Sit in that chair . '
Then you actually go over and put the ashtray on the chair .
Then you tell the ashtray , ' Thank you . '
Then you do the same thing with the bottle , and the book .
And you do this for hours and hours . "
This was supposed " to get your intention over to the bottle ... to rehabilitate your ability to control things . "
Well then .
Tom Cruise can control books and bottles with his mind and do n't ever let anyone tell you different .
Headley also says that there are only about 10,000 Scientologists in the whole world .
They could be whupped by the Unitarians !

In other words , do not make money by presenting the site ’s content , and always source back to myself and this website , pretty simple .
This means if you are an educator and want to use the site ’s content in your lessons , do not even bother asking , as I encourage you to use the content for this purpose .
If you are not sure if your use will violate these terms , just ask .
Can I make requests for battles and campaigns to be animated ?
Absolutely !
While I already have an extensive list of engagements I would like to one day animate , I take requests very seriously .
Requests let me know which battles and campaigns viewers wish to see and which ones I should animate .
I cannot promise your requested battle will be completed in any timely manner , or if at all ( just ask one of my earliest viewers who requested the Battle of Torvioll ) , but I can promise I will add it to my list and make a note that it was requested by one of my wonderful viewers .
Many of the animations you currently see featured on the site are in fact requests over the years .
Do you make any money from the website ?
No , it is a registered revenue - neutral non-profit organization with no financial objectives .
Its only objectives are the three education - based ones listed above .
The website is a hobby of mine and trying to make it into anything other than that would take the enjoyment out of it .
Why do you use PowerPoint instead of flash or video ?
There are a few reasons here .
For starters , PowerPoint is what I started on and what I have become very proficient in , using animation sequences and triggers in ways I do not really think its creators imagined it being used .
The time and effort it would now require to put aside my life ’s other responsibilities ( you know , gainful , paid employment , social life , etc. ) and switch over to another media format is overwhelming , and would likely mean a significant hiatus from actually creating and posting new content to the site , which is what I really enjoy .
Second , PowerPoint is an extremely versatile format that can do a lot of things that video and flash may not be able to do .
So while viewers often like the animations that have videos in addition to PowerPoint , a significant amount of information and interaction is lost in the video format .
PowerPoint is also the absolute easiest file format to transfer and display .
With educators and students two of my main target audiences , this is essential .
How often has your teacher tried to include this great video or flash animation only for it to simply not work ?
Instead of switching media formats I have decided to upgrade PowerPoint animations to make them even better .
What do you mean when you refer to these upgrades ?
I constantly struggle to balance between maintaining consistency among all animations and ensuring evolution and improvement in their quality .
If anyone remembers the original website back in 2008 , the animations did not include context or aftermath slides to describe the historical background .
The first series of upgrades in late 2008 added these features now taken for granted .
The second series of upgrades began in mid-2015 to improve the animations ’ quality once again .
With many more animations to upgrade , and the jump in quality more substantial , this process is still ongoing with 70 % completely upgraded .
These upgrades include the addition of a scale , symbol guide , terrain slide to describe the battlefield , improved geography slides to show the political context , conversion to the 2007/2010 Powerpoint file format to ensure content plays on most platforms , as well as general editing of the entire animation and analysis to a higher standard .
What are your favourite military history books and games ?
There is a lot !
Check out the Resources page .
What provoked you to actually start this website ?
The decision and initiative to actually create this site in the first place had built up for awhile .
I had always been captivated by the military , whether it was playing with my plastic toy soldiers as a child , reading the great commanders ’ advice or poring over campaign maps in the late hours after my homework was done .
Simon Goodenough ’s Tactical Genius in Battle peaked my interest in the personal duel between commanders while Robert Greene ’s 33 Strategies of War showed me how military strategy and tactics can be applied to real life , giving the subject real value .
I believe that if one is truly passionate about something , one should always be passionate to share it with others so that they might appreciate it even if it is just a little bit .
So one day , someone asked me to give her a lesson on the Napoleonic Wars so that she could do well in her history course .
I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to educate her on the strategies and tactics used by each nation at the grand strategic and tactical levels .
At the end , she felt that she really understood the Napoleonic Wars militarily and historically as a whole , especially the Battles of Austerlitz and Waterloo which I had drawn up .
I reasoned that if I could teach her military strategy and tactics , and enjoy it , I could and should teach others .
However , even with an extensive knowledge of military studies , I myself found it difficult to understand what happened in a battle or campaign because of the way it was presented .
At most , three still maps and massive paragraph chunks would be used to explain a fluid situation which was constantly changing and progressing .
How was I to teach strategies and tactics to someone who knew nothing of such things to begin with ?
The only solution was to develop the method of presentation you can view now .
Thank you to my late grandfather , Donald Palmer , for sparking my interest in history all those years ago .

Europe 's 2018 rover would focus on trying to find life on Mars The US and European space agencies have signed the " letter of intent " that ties together their Mars programmes .
The agreement , which was penned in Washington DC , gives the green light to scientists and engineers to begin the joint planning of Red Planet missions .
The union will start with a European - led orbiter in 2016 , and continue with surface rovers in 2018 , and then perhaps a network of landers in 2018 .
The ultimate aim is a mission to return Mars rock and soils to Earth labs .
The Washington document was signed by the heads of the agencies , Nasa administrator Charles Bolden and Esa director - general Jean - Jacques Dordain .
The Mars Joint Exploration Initiative ( Meji ) has been under discussion for several months , with the key elements - covering scope , division of responsibility and financing - gradually falling into place .
The letter of intent puts the initiative on a more formal footing .
The US and Europe have taken the view that they can achieve more together scientifically at the Red Planet if they combine their expertise .
And with both parties ' current Mars programmes also experiencing financial pressures , the shared approach means the exploration schedule of a mission every two years can be maintained .
Esa 's member states have already pledged 850 m euros towards a Red Planet venture .
They will need to take that figure up to about a billion euros to properly fund Meji activities .
The existence of this extra funding , and which European nations might provide it , will have to be established at a council meeting of the agency in mid-December ( although the subscription opportunity will officially stay open until the end of the year ) .
" The important thing I think is that the member states have bought into the ideas ; I 'm not expecting any shocks , " Professor David Southwood , Esa 's director of science and robotics , told BBC News .
Professor Southwood has put together the joint initiative with his opposite number at Nasa , Dr Ed Weiler .
Their broad vision would encompass the following launch opportunities : 2016 : A European - led orbiter to study trace gases , including methane , in Mars ' atmosphere .
The mission would also put a static meteorological station on the surface .
Critically , Europe would handle the entry , descent and landing ( EDL ) of this station - a capability it has yet to demonstrate .
2018 : European and American rovers would be despatched to Mars .
The US would do the EDL .
2020 : " Under consideration " is a network of landers focused on geophysics and the environment .
Nasa will provide the launch rockets in 2016 and 2018 .
The 2016 meteorological station would be smaller than the recent US Phoenix lander .
Europe will try to land it during what is expected to be the dust storm season , when Martian dirt is whipped into the sky .
Such storms can sometimes envelop the entire planet and change the characteristics of the atmosphere , making EDL far trickier .
" It will be a challenge but we think we know how to do it , " said Professor Southwood .
The Red Planet experiences periodic global duststorms

How important is it for readers of game reviews to understand the conditions under which a review was written ?
Would it change things if you knew all the early reviews of a game were written based on play time given in one location , under a managed schedule ?
What if the publisher paid for airfare and hotel rooms for the press ?
If you read an early review of a certain AAA game , chances are the circumstances behind the review were n't mentioned , but they may change how you perceive the review .
The title was Modern Warfare 2 , and Activision paid for both the airfare and the hotel rooms to get publications to cover the game .
If you wanted early coverage , this was the only way to get it .
Joystiq added an addendum to its review , expressing its issues with the practice , pointing out the event was organized and paid for by Activision .
" As this was Joystiq 's only opportunity to review the game in advance of its release , we willingly deviated from our standard policy of not accepting accommodations and used the room , " the site explained in its disclaimer .
" We did so because we felt that participating in this event best served the interest of our readers . "
Garnett
Lee wrote about his own misgivings in the Shacknews story about the game , and because of the circumstances he refused to call his thoughts a review .
" A couple weeks ago Activision took a group drawn from members of the videogame media up to a resort in Santa Barbara for an intensive couple of days playing the freshly completed Modern Warfare 2 .
Extravagant ?
Sure , but that goes with the territory for a game that 's become one of the biggest entertainment franchises in pop culture , " he wrote .
" Such an ideal setup also felt a little too removed from the real world to base a fair review on .
So take this as impressions then from playing the full game . "
Most outlets did n't disclose the circumstances of the review .
We tracked down a writer who was willing to speak about the event under the condition of anonymity .
Let 's take a look behind the scenes , and see how the sausage is made .
" We were n't interfered with "
Reviewers were given a hotel room with a high - definition display , a surround - sound system , and a headset .
The game was delivered on a hard drive , and progress was saved on memory cards that were collected after the event .
The game was played in marathon sessions so reviewers could finish the single - player campaign .
" We were n't interfered with by PR at all while we played .
No knocks on the hotel room door to see how things were going , no taps on the shoulder during the common hall review sessions either , " our source explained .
" They were available to answer queries if asked , but mainly kept to themselves and were n't breathing down our necks . "
He pointed out that Activision tends to be very respectful of the boundaries between PR and writers .
He did share some reservations about the time spent playing the multiplayer portion of the game .
" Playing in a room full of friendly developers and your games press colleagues with perfect connections is undoubtedly much more fun than gaming online with some of the legendarily obnoxious Xbox Live players , " he told Ars .
" You 'd have to be a pretty na�ve reviewer to think there 's no difference — and if you let that experience form the basis of your multiplayer assessment without qualification , you 're giving too much credit to online gamers ' behavior . "
The reviewers had two days of managed time to try the single - player , the Spec - Ops missions , and the multiplayer .
The reviews seemed to be limited to the Xbox 360 version of the game , with reviewers given no option to try the PC version .
Does this affect how reviewers think about the game ?
Our writer friend thinks so .
" Yes , to the extent I would n't have plowed through the single - player campaign in one sitting .
But I 'd suggest also that does n't work in Activision or IW 's favor — put most gamers in front of anything for a five - to seven - hour stretch and it will seem old . "
He also points out the importance of disclosure .
" We referenced the review event conditions in our review at points where we thought it would potentially be different from at home , and obviously we consider that adequate , " he told Ars .
" However I readily concede that , too , is open to subjective analysis , especially when gamers erroneously suspect publishers are stuffing money into reviewer 's pockets left , right , and center at the best of times . "
This is becoming more common
It 's not rare for publishers to set up reviews in this way .
We took part in a Microsoft event to review the single - player content in Halo 3 , and disclosed it in the review .
We did not , however , accept paid airfare or accommodations .
The multiplayer was played on our own time , under normal conditions .
Another publisher invited us to play through an upcoming game in their offices more recently , and put up the airfare and accommodations .
We declined , and told them to simply send the retail code when it was available .
The problem is that the gaming press that is n't local to these event is put in a difficult position : either break their ethical policies to ensure early coverage , or deliver late reviews .
It 's possible that some sites could pay for their own airfare and hotel room , but that 's a huge budgetary decision for a single review .
Presenting the game 's online play in such ideal conditions also means that no one is shown a clear picture of what play will be like for the actual consumer , and that should be disclosed during the review .
The reviewers at this sort of event are told how long they can play , they are locked down to a specific version of the game — in this case the 360 — and by accepting the airline ticket and a stay in " a resort in Santa Barbara , " the ethical situation becomes muddy .
Would knowing when and how a review takes place change the way you think about the final score ?
What 's clear is that readers should know the circumstances surrounding how the game was played , and how controlled the situation was .
Reviewing the game at home is one thing , reviewing it in a remote location , surrounded by other enthusiasts and the game 's creators is another .
There is no reason Activision could n't ship writers prerelease copies of the game : it has been finished and packaged for some time , and the leaks had already spread across the Internet .
Instead the company decided to pay for the gaming press to come to a specific location , stay in company - provided rooms , play the game a specific way ... and all this came at a substantial cost to Activision Blizzard .
What value did they get for that money ?
We asked Activision and have yet to receive a response .
Well - educated women and those who live alone are emotionally the hardest hit by breast cancer , according to the findings of a new Australian study announced during October 's Breast Cancer Awareness Month .
The MBF Foundation Health and Wellbeing after Breast Cancer Study , undertaken by Monash University Medical School 's Women 's Health Program , found that older women tended to experience lower levels of overall wellbeing compared to women of similar age in the community two years after their diagnosis .
" Up until now , there has been uncertainty about exactly what the impact of being diagnosed with breast cancer is in terms of mood and wellbeing over time .
In our study , we found that two years post diagnosis women with breast cancer were not more likely to be depressed but were more likely to experience a lowered sense of control over their life , and lower general health , with lessened vitality being limited to older women , " explains Dr Susan R Davis , Professor of Women 's Health , Monash University Medical School , who was involved in the study .
" The experience of having breast cancer is a personal one and is often accompanied by very complex emotions due to the fact that it strikes at a woman 's very sense of self , purpose and sexuality . "
Co-chief investigator of the study , Associate Professor Robin Bell , added : " That women living alone were more likely to have a lower wellbeing is a novel and important finding and would suggest that such women may benefit by targeted provision of social support . "
More educated women are likely to be the best informed about their breast cancer and treatment , and their lower wellbeing results may reflect greater anxiety over decision making and their difficulty coping with a sense loss of control over their health and wellbeing .
" We would encourage health care providers to be sensitive to the fact that more highly educated women may deal less well with psychological aspects of their disease than others , " said Professor Davis .
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in Australia , affecting one in nine women by the age of 85 years , and is responsible for around 2,600 deaths annually .
With improvements in detection and treatment of breast cancer , 87 per cent of women affected survive five years or more from the time of detection .
" At MBF Foundation we are all for women becoming advocates for their breast cancer and their health in general but , as this study has shown , it is important that providing accurate information is n't at the expense of supporting their emotional needs , " commented Dr Christine Bennett , Bupa Australia Chief Medical Officer and Chair of the MBF Foundation steering committee , which has committed $ 300,000 to fund the study .
" As survival prospects for women with breast cancer continue to improve , we should n't lose sight of the fact that each woman 's journey and coping mechanisms are different .
We know from listening to the women in the study , that it is common for breast cancer survivors to experience a range of emotions and concerns once treatment ends .
Indeed , some women , report experiencing feelings of isolation and abandonment once their regular appointments with their medical team stop , " added Dr Bennett .
On a positive note , the study found that women's wellbeing two years out from being treated for the disease was overall only modestly lower than for Australian women in general .
Women who are struggling with their emotions following breast cancer treatment may benefit from sharing their feelings with those close to them and discussing their concerns with a health professional or breast cancer support group .
Have you ever been in a situation where you need to leave a voicemail message for somebody and you just do not want to deal with that person ?
If you have , then I recommend using SlyDial , a multi-platform application / service that allows you to connect straight to a person ’s voicemail .
There are two ways you can access Sly Dial .
The first , which is free * but ad - supported , is by calling 1- 267 - SLY - DIAL ( 267-759-3425 ) .
A short ad will play once you are connected and then it will ask for you to input your victim ’s contact ’s phone number , after which it will connect your call .
I tried it several times and every time it worked , connecting me to the voicemail prompt quickly .
The second way you can access the service is through the SlyDial Application .
They currently have apps that work on the iPhone , Blackberry , and Windows Mobile .
I was able to review the Windows Mobile version of this app .
There are two versions for Windows Mobile : Touchscreen and Standard ( non-touchscreen ) .
Both are compatible with Windows Mobile 5 and 6 .
I have received confirmation from MobileSphere that the SlyDial application is also compatible with WM 6.5 .
After installing the .CAB , I opened the application up .
Minimalistic interfaces that get the job done without clutter are something I really enjoy , and this one is simple and easy to use .
To note , I am using this application on my Touch Pro2 and , as you can see in the image , the words are readable , but blurry .
I hope that they release an update that make viewing on a variety of screen resolutions clearer .
SlyDial worked flawlessly , as I was able to connect directly to my contact ’s voicemail when selected from the contact list in the application .
In all , it took 10 - 15 seconds to go from the contact list to the voicemail prompt .
Of course , results will vary if you are in a poor coverage area .
SlyDial will work in the U.S. for most carriers , but it will not connect to someone who has a prepaid mobile phone ( Virgin Mobile , TracFone , etc. ) , does not have voicemail on his / her phone ( like Zach Morris ) , their voicemail is full , or if they have a third - party voicemail service ( e.g. Google Voice , Youmail ) .
While this application is not freeware , the service itself is free .
Is SlyDial worth purchasing ?
Personally , I would say yes because I have difficulty remembering numbers which complicates dialing in .
For others , the call - to service may suit them just fine .
So readers , what do you think of this application ?
SpaceUp is the world 's first space unconference .

The Corpocracy Uncovered
Bush family supported Third Reich
The GW Bush Gang , IG Farben 2001 by Robert Lederman
“ What my cabinet shows is that I am not afraid to surround myself with strong and competent people … a good executive is one that understands how to recruit people and how to delegate authority and responsibility . ”
GW Bush 1/2/2001
As promised GW Bush has recruited competent and experienced advisors .
Despite their seeming diversity however they have a common denominator .
The America they reflect is the oil , pharmaceutical , armament , Wall Street and eugenics interests long associated with the Bush family .
Seventy years ago a similar configuration of oil , pharmaceutical , chemical , military supply and eugenics interests were organized by Wall Street into IG Farben / Standard Oil - Hitler ’s industrial powerhouse .
To grasp the real significance of what GW Bush ’s cabinet has been brought together to accomplish it is essential to understand the history of IG Farben , its relationship with American corporations and how together they applied modern technology to the task of eugenics or scientific racism .
According to former US Justice Dept. Nazi War Crimes prosecutor John Loftus - who is today the director of the Florida Holocaust Museum - “ The Bush family fortune came from the Third Reich , ”
- Sarasota Herald - Tribune 11/11/2000
http://www.newscoast.com/headlinesstory2.cfm?ID=35115
Along with the Rockefellers ( Standard Oil , Chase Manhattan Bank ) , Mellons ( Gulf Oil , Alcoa Aluminum ) , DuPonts ( DuPont Chemicals ) , General Motors and Henry Ford , banks and shipping companies operated by the Bush family were crucial players in setting up the industrial power behind the Third Reich .
These companies poured hundreds of millions of dollars into IG Farben and provided it with technology for tactically - essential synthetic materials while withholding the same materials and patents from the US government .
The Rockefeller family , long aligned with the Bushes , owned Standard Oil .
Through a stock transfer they became half owners of Germany ’s IG Farben with Farben likewise owning almost half of Standard Oil .
According to the Encyclopedia Brittanica , IG Farben built and operated more than 40 concentration camps in Nazi- occupied Europe , including Auschwitz .
At their slave labor / factory / death camps chemicals , weapons , drugs , synthetic fuels and other materials vital to the Nazi war effort were manufactured .
In addition , eugenicists like Dr. Josef Mengele used the human subjects in the camps for experiments the data from which are today the basis for many drugs marketed by the pharmaceutical industry - not too surprising in light of the fact that more Americans die from prescription drugs than from any other single cause .
At the end of WWII the allies split up IG Farben into companies that are now the top pharmaceutical concerns on earth among them Bayer , Hoescht , BASF , the Agfa - Gevaert Group and Cassella AG .
Many of Wall Streets favorite pharmaceutical / chemical companies behind the proliferation of genetically - altered foods , transgenic animals , human cloning , dangerous psychiatric drugs , deadly vaccines and pesticides - such as Aventis - are subsidiaries of these same companies .
War provides the necessary medium in which this witches brew of oil , eugenics , pharmaceuticals , munitions and Wall Street investing can reach maximum growth .
Likewise , war is also the essential frame of reference for the newly formed GW Bush administration .
The high - profile minorities who are working as Bush advisors have been hand - picked , funded and carefully cultivated by right wing think tanks and conservative foundations with a white supremacist philosophy in order to provide cover for their anti-poor , anti-minority eugenics agenda .
For those who scoff at the validity of comparing the Bush administration to the Nazis and IG Farben please note the following .
I ’m not suggesting that GW Bush is a literal Nazi nor am I implying that everyone who is an oil or pharmaceutical company executive automatically deserves to be linked to IG Farben .
That the Bush wealth and prominence in American politics is derived from Prescott Bush and George Herbert Walker ’s support of Hitler is a historical fact .
If the connection ended in 1945 with the destruction of Nazi Germany that might have been the end of it - it did n’t end there however .
Not only has the eugenics agenda continued but many of the top Nazis who were advancing it during WWII were brought to the US after the war and installed in academia , the media , government research institutions and the CIA - by the same American officials who worked with the Bush family to build up Nazi Germany in the first place .
Their ideas formed the basis for much of the agenda promoted by this nation ’s most influential right - wing think tanks - the same think tanks that are the sponsors of GW Bush and virtually every one of his appointees .
Why is it significant that many of Bush ’s staff and cabinet appointees are former pharmaceutical company executives as was GW ’s father , former President George Bush ?
These corporations are voraciously patenting the earth ’s life forms - its plants , bacteria , viruses , animals and even human genetic lineages .
Reproduction of plants , animals and humans may eventually be totally controlled by these corporations , genetically - altered , recombined into chimeric life forms and exploited for profit .
The Human Genome Project , as it admits on the very first page of its website – http://vector.cshl.org/eugenics.html, is derived from the eugenics movement in the US and Nazi Germany during the first half of the 20th century .
The Eugenics Records Office at Cold Springs Harbor NY - where American eugenics started - was built by the Harriman family - the Bushes ’ Wall Street business partners in funding Hitler .
This is the new frontier of colonialism in the 21st century - the total domination and exploitation of the earth and everything on it - the New World Order both former President Bush and Adolf Hitler so frequently called for .
While my writings focus on the Republican aspect of this agenda there is no question that many Democrats are participants and that none of these things could be accomplished without the full “ bipartisan support ” we hear about each and every day .
Some of the men and women who do the thinking for GW Bush :
– Vice President , Dick Cheney , arguably the real President - elect , was one of papa Bush ’s top advisors .
His company , Haliburton , is one of the nation ’s largest recipients of government contracts , supplying military equipment , oil services and infrastructure .
Cheney epitomizes corporate - welfare and like most of Bush ’s appointees is a multi-millionaire who will receive huge financial benefits from the administrations ’ policies and any wars it manages to get the US into .
– Secretary of Labor Linda Chavez ( NOTE : she was forced a couple days ago to withdraw her nomination ) - who is outspokenly anti-union - was a research fellow at the CIA ’s Manhattan Institute during 1993 and 1994 and has received almost $ 200,000 in grants from the John M. Olin Foundation , a notorious right - wing fund derived from a family business in munitions and chemicals with roots in white supremacy .
Despite her Hispanic surname she is an outspoken advocate for the English First Movement .
Chavez is president of the Center for Equal Opportunity , based in Washington , D.C. an organization dedicated to eliminating affirmative action .
On their website Chavez quotes Charles Murray , author of The Bell Curve , a classic of modern racial eugenics which has become the “ bible ” for the anti-welfare anti-affirmative action movement .
– Secretary of Health and Human Services , Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson , is known for his controversial welfare reforms - based in large part on two books by Charles Murray , Losing Ground and The Bell Curve .
Murray was a consultant for the Wisconsin welfare reform program .
Thompson ’s protege , Jason Turner , was later brought to NYC where he has run Mayor Giuliani ’s characteristically brutal welfare elimination program .
Turner became notorious for quoting the motto on the gates over Auschwitz - “ Arbeit Macht Frei - work shall make you free ” .
He is frequently a guest with Charles Murray in panel discussions at the CIA ’s Manhattan Institute and other Bush - connected think tanks .
Murray wrote the Bell Curve while a fellow at the Manhattan Institute where his pseudo - scientific research on the genetic inferiority of African Americans was primarily financed by the Pioneer Fund .
Since 1937 the Pioneer Fund has promoted eugenics and the ideology of white racial superiority .
– Secretary of Energy , Spencer Abraham , who served as Vice President Dan Quale ’s chief of staff , spent years trying to abolish the very agency he will now head .
His legislative positions include being against higher fuel efficiency standards for cars , being against government regulations for industry and support for opening up national parklands to oil drilling .
He is a recipient of oil company contributions totaling more than $ 221,000 according to the NY Times .
The American Petroleum Institute has said it looks forward to working with Abraham .
Abraham helped found the conservative law group the Federalist Society which specializes in eliminating social programs , affirmative action , welfare and bilingual education .
The society is funded by the John M. Olin Foundation , the Sarah Scaife Foundation , the Bradley Foundation , and the Lilly Endowment - America ’s leading far right think tanks .
Among its most prominent members are Supreme Court Justices Scalia and Thomas whose questionable election ruling gave Bush his illegitimate Presidency .
Spokespersons for the Federalist Society include Bell Curve author Charles Murray , Manhattan Institute fellow Abigail Thernstrom , and Dinesh d’Souza of the American Enterprise Institute .
– Secretary of Education , Rod Paige , the latest African American Bush appointee , is a conservative public schools administrator in Texas and decades - long crony of the Bush family who supports vouchers , tying teacher pay directly to test scores and school privatization - all of which will negatively impact African American students by destroying public education .
– Secretary of Defense , Donald H. Rumsfeld was Secretary of Defense under President Ford .
Rumsfeld like Powell , Cheney , Rice and numerous other Bush administration officials is a salesman for the Star Wars Missile Defense Shield .
He served four terms in the US Congress where he voted against Medicare , anti-poverty programs like Headstart , food stamps and various healthcare proposals .
Rumsfeld , who formerly headed Searle Pharmaceuticals , is part of the drug company axis within the Bush administration .
Former President Bush was director of Eli Lilly , OMB head Mitchell E. Daniels was also senior executive of Eli Lilly and AG John Ashcroft is known as a lobbyist for pharmaceutical companies .
Dr. Gail R. Wilensky - one of numerous John M. Olin grant recipients attached to Bush - is the principal author of GW ’s Medicare plan .
Wilensky serves on the boards of eight health care companies in which she owns more than $ 12 million in stock .
– Secretary of State , Colin Powell is a lifelong operative of the CIA / military - industrial complex .
While working for the Pentagon he earned his present stature by helping cover up the Mai Lai massacre , the contra / arms - cocaine deal and Gulf War Syndrome .
Powell ’s reputation as a hero derives from presiding over a war in which US troops were used as guinea pigs for drug companies ’ experimental vaccines so that they could “ safely ” fight George Bush ’s friend Sadamn Hussein - who had been supplied with chemical and biological weapons by the Bush administration .
Unlike most of GW ’s appointees of color , Powell proudly admits he owes his career to affirmative action yet willingly joins an administration that considers ending affirmative action a top priority .
– Secretary of the Treasury , Paul H. O’Neill is the chairman of Alcoa Aluminum , one of the world ’s worst polluters and a leading corporate supporter of Nazi Germany and eugenics .
O’Neill owns 1.6 million shares of Alcoa , worth more than $ 50 million .
During WWII Alcoa negotiated a deal with the Nazis and IG Farben to supply Germany ’s war machine rather than the US military with aluminum .
“ If America loses this war , ” said then Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes on June 26 , 1941 , “ it can thank the Aluminum Corporation of America [ ALCOA ] . ”
Alcoa produces hundreds of millions of tons of fluoride .
This highly toxic waste byproduct of aluminum has been linked in thousands of medical studies to cancer and other degenerative diseases .
In the 1950 ’s Alcoa arranged to have it added to our nation ’s drinking water rather than disposed of as toxic waste .
During WWII in IG Farben ’s slave labor camps Nazis scientists discovered that by adding fluoride to the drinking water they could make prisoners more submissive to authority .
O’Neill is a fellow at the RAND Corporation and American Enterprise Institute , two more extreme right - wing think tanks .
– Attorney General John Ashcroft ( NOTE :
His nomination is strongly opposed – see the Confirmation Hearings process at http://dailynews.yahoo.com/fc/US/Bush_Administration/ ) is a self - styled moral crusader as strongly anti-abortion as he is enthusiastic about the death penalty .
Last year , Ashcroft received an honorary degree from Bob Jones University .
He is closely aligned with the Christian Coalition , Pat Robertson and Southern heritage groups which admire the Confederacy and defend the institution of slavery as practiced in the South .
He is known among lobbyists as an advocate for drug companies and the automotive industry and for preventing consumers from suing HMO’s .
The furor over Ashcroft ’s anti-abortion views is being played out exactly as planned by Team Bush .
Not only will the Bush administration never make abortions illegal , if anything the eugenics agenda that underlies the Bush family history guarantees that abortion , sterilization and other technologies intended to limit population - including war , chemical exposure , pesticide use in urban areas , genetically - altered foods and vaccines - will proceed at an unprecedented level .
The Bush gang are delighted to see Democrats , women ’s rights advocates and the left focusing on Ashcroft while virtually ignoring the other Bush appointees .
– Secretary of Commerce Donald L. Evans is an insider in the Texas “ oil mafia ” and is GW ’s closest friend and confidant .
He ’s also friend , confidant and contributor to one of America ’s biggest recipients of government contacts , Halliburton ’s Dick Cheney .
– Office of Management and Budget Director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. , was senior executive of the Eli Lilly drug company and was previously the president of the arch - conservative Hudson Institute .

Jehovah [ meaning " He causes to become " ] .
The personal name of God.
Throughout the history of the Hebrews , they worshiped the One God , Jehovah .
He was known as the True God , and the Hebrews worshiped Him all their lives .
Although they had pitfalls , Jehovah remained to be the only true God they worshiped .
Jehovah was the God that commanded Pharaoh to " Let his people go " ( Exodus ch.5 ) and was also the one who led them to the promised land ( Numbers 9:15 - 20 ) .
Also Jehovah was with the Israelites when they went to war and was the cause of winning the wars .
Yes , the Israelites did get captured by the Babylonians and some may have worshiped their false gods , but true worship was restored when the Persian king Cyrus overthrew king Belshazzar some 2400 years ago .
Jehovah was and is a very powerful , wise , merciful , and loving God always forgiving the Israelites when they repented for their errors .
The name Jehovah is known in Hebrew as YHWH and is the correct name for God .

Dictionaries define " Judaism " as The monotheistic religion of the Jews , since the founding principle of Judaism was and is the belief in One God , creator of the universe .
This was the teaching which was spread by Abraham , and has continued since then .
From Judaism , belief in One God has spread through the Western world .
never invented their own idol
never universal
Jews have always worshiped the One God.
Abraham worshiped " the Lord God of Heaven and Earth " ( Genesis 14:22 and 24:3 ) and complained about the Philistines ' lack of fear of God ( Genesis 20:11 ) .
Jacob confiscated the idolatrous images taken from Shechem ( Genesis 35:2 ) and got rid of them ( Genesis 35:4 ) ; and refrained from invoking the gods of Nahor ( Genesis 31:53 ) .
Rachel pilfered Laban 's statue - images ( Genesis 31:19 ) in order to prevent him from idolatry ( Rashi commentary , ibid . ) .
Joseph placed his hope in the God of the Forefathers ( Genesis 50:24 ) .
At the time of the Exodus , God wrecked the Egyptian idols ( Exodus 12:12 ) and warned against idolatry ( Exodus 22:19 ) .
Later , Moses characterized the Golden Calf as " a great sin " ( Exodus 32:21 , 30 ) and punished the worshipers ( Exodus ch.32 ) .
During the rest of his lifetime and that of Joshua ( Judges 2:7 ) , no incidents of Israelite idolatry were reported .
Shortly before he died , Moses warned the people that he suspected that they would eventually succumb to the lure of the idols ( Deuteronomy 29:17 ) .
Joshua gave a similar warning ( Joshua ch.24 ) .
These warnings came true .
Many of the Israelites went astray after the foreign gods ( Judges 2:11 ) .
However , they .
It was always the baneful influence of other peoples .
And there were times when the entire Israelite nation repented ( Judges 2:1 - 4 ) and prayed to God ( Judges 3:9 , 3:15 , 6:6 , 10:10 ) .
Those who did sin did not represent or influence normative Judaism , just as the later Sadducees and Essenes did not .
They were deviating from the Torah 's standard ; they were publicly , repeatedly , and scathingly excoriated by the prophets , and they caused God 's retribution to come upon the entire people ( 2 Kings ch.17 ) .
Because of the idol - worship that did happen , ancient images of idols have been found in Israel too .
Images of God are n't found because it is forbidden to represent Him through imagery ( Deuteronomy 4:15 - 16 ) .
It should be noted that idolatry wasamong the Israelites .
The belief in One God was continued in every generation , whether by the few or the many ; and it is those who handed down that tradition whose beliefs we Jews continue today .
Deborah ascribed victory to God ( Judges 4:14 ) , Gideon tore down the idolatrous altar ( Judges 6:25 - 27 ) ; Samson prayed to God ( Judges 16:28 ) , as did Hannah ( 1 Samuel 1:11 ) and Samuel ( ibid . 12:18 ) ; Eli blessed in the name of God ( 1 Samuel 2:20 ) , Saul built an altar to God ( 1 Samuel 14:35 ) ; Jonathan ascribed victory to God ( 1 Samuel 14:12 ) , as did David ( 1 Samuel 17:46 ) ; and Solomon built the Temple for God ( 1 Kings 8:20 ) .
A number of the kings " did what was right in God 's eyes " : David ( 1 Kings 15:5 ) , Solomon ( see 1 Kings 3:3 ) , Asa ( 1 Kings 15:11 ) , Yehoshaphat ( 1 Kings 22:43 ) , Yehu ( 2 Kings 10:30 ) , Yehoash ( 2 Kings 12:3 ) , Amatziah ( 2 Kings 14:3 ) , Azariah ( 2 Kings 15:3 ) , Yotam ( 2 Kings 15:34 ) , Hizkiah ( 2 Kings 18:3 ) , and Josiah ( 2 Kings 22:2 ) .
Part of this righteousness was their destroying whatever idolatrous incursions had occurred among the populace ( 1 Samuel 7:3 - 4 , 2 Chronicles 15:8 , 2 Chronicles 17:6 , 2 Kings 18:4 ) .
Even at the height of the unfortunate spread of idolatry among the less - loyal Ten Tribes , there were thousands who remained loyal to God ( 1 Kings 19:18 ) .
And , of course , the Prophets , who spoke in the name of God and warned against idolatry : Isaiah , Jeremiah , Ezekiel , Hosea and so on .
The later sages of the Talmud , who ridiculed idolatry ( Megillah 25 b ) , were simply continuing in the tradition of the Prophets whose verses are quoted in that context ( ibid . ) .
More information :
While no excuse should be made for those Israelites who strayed , the following may at least clarify the topic a little .
1 ) The ancients were tested by a powerful lure towards idolatry .
We do n't understand it because conditions have changed ( Talmud , Yoma 69 b ) .
2 ) Most Israelites ( if not all ) who committed idolatry did n't completely forget about their One God .
They introduced idols into the picture .
3 ) It was thought that each nation has its own god .
They thought that they needed to propitiate the gods of the nations around them so that those gods " would n't give military victory " to those nations over the land of Israel .
4 )
They figured that they would acknowledge other gods " just in case , " and that it would be no worse than someone today who carries a " lucky " penny or rabbit 's foot .
The Ministry of Defence spent £ 149 million on an " urgent " upgrade to 900 tanks that are now only being used in training exercises , it was revealed .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The tanks were upgraded for use in Iraq but are unsuitable for deployment in Afghanistan where Mastiff and Ridgback vehicles are better suited to cope with the terrain and threat .
The refit programme , ordered as an " urgent operational requirement " three years ago , saw 900 FV430 variant vehicles given new engines , drive trains and driver controls and reclassified as Bulldogs .
An MoD spokeswoman said : " We provide our Armed Forces with the vehicles that best meet their operational need .
" The Bulldog was specifically upgraded for use in Iraq where it played a key role in providing armoured protection for many personnel .
" In Afghanistan , where the terrain and threats are different , this role is performed by the Mastiff and Ridgback .
" The Bulldogs continue to have a role in training exercises in the UK . "
The upgrade came to light after freedom of information requests submitted by The Times newspaper .
The Mastiff and the Ridgback , it 's " baby brother " , were rolled out in Afghanistan to withstand the increasing threat of roadside bombs and take the place of the more vulnerable Snatch Land Rovers .

At the time , Mayor Nutter spurned deals that would have let the city take the network over .
But Frank , who was not yet working for the city , said it was clear to him after reviewing the city 's technological needs that a municipal wireless network would be a huge boon .
Under the plan , which will be announced in the next few days by the Treasury Department , the seven companies that received the most assistance will have to cut the annual salaries of their 25 best - paid executives by an average of about 90 percent from last year .
Their total compensation — including bonuses and retirement contributions — will drop , on average , by about 50 percent .
The companies are Citigroup , Bank of America , American International Group , General Motors , Chrysler and the financing arms of the two automakers .
( The cuts are for 2009 only , a source told CNBC , and 2010 decisions will be made next year ) .
At the financial products division of the insurance giant , A.I.G. , the locus of problems that plagued the large insurer and forced its rescue with more than $ 180 billion in taxpayer assistance , no top executive will receive more than $ 200,000 in total compensation , a stunning decline from previous years in which the unit produced many wealthy executives and traders .
In contrast to previous years , an official said , executives in the financial products division will receive no other compensation , such as stocks or stock options .
And at all of the companies , any executive seeking more than $ 25,000 in special perks — such as country club memberships , private planes , limousines or company issued cars — will have to apply to the government for permission .
The administration will also warn A.I.G. that it must fulfill a commitment it made to significantly reduce the $ 198 million in bonuses promised to employees in the financial products division .
The five 2LoveMyLips gloss products contain a drug testing kit in the form of a pink taper that can detect GHB and Ketamine .
Managing director of the company 2LoveMy , Tracy Whittaker , explained that girls on a night out with suspicions about their drink can just dab the taper in , and watch to see if the colour changes to blue .
“ If they turn blue tell your friends immediately and get help from security and the police , ” ​ she explained .
Sales have already proved ' positive ' ​
Sales of the product to UK beauty salons are positive , according to Whittaker , who is planning to launch the product in USA and Asutralia .
In addition , she said the company hopes to target tourist spots in the Far East where drink spiking is a significant problem .
Although no official figures of the numbers of people affected by the phenomenon are available , the Roofie Foundation , a UK agency set up to help victims of drug rape received 1,200 calls to their helpline in the last two years .
Significant but hard to track problem ​
Commenting on the lip gloss concept , Roofie Founder Graham Rhodes said : “ The Roofie Foundation welcomes any product that helps women to avoid becoming victims of drug rape . ” ​
“ Over the years there have been many different tests and a wide variety of products that claim to prevent drink spiking , however we believe that the addition of a testing strip to a lip gloss is a major step forward in prevention . ” ​
2LoveMyLips is also planning to make the product available in vending machines in pub and club toilets as this is where girls may need it most .
Other cosmetic products are also planned by the company but all of them will come with the date rape testing kit included .
Looking for a new work of art to adorn your home ?
If you are happy to part with a cool $ 1.2 billion , Used Car Part From Afghanistan could be yours .
Australian artist Van Thanh Rudd's work , on display at Off The Kerb gallery in Melbourne , is entering uncharted territory with his asking price .
Rudd claims the work contains a small piece of an Afghan civilian car , destroyed by an International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) missile in southern Afghanistan .
" All art must be priced and the price paid by victims of war is astronomical .
So my price tag should reflect this , " he said .
" I know it 's beyond reason to put $ 1.2 billion on this object , but everything out there in the global market place is extremely devoid of reason .
The global recession is showing us this . "
Rudd says while he has not been approached by anyone willing to fork out $ 1.2 billion for the work , it has generated a lot of interest .
" [ I 've had ] no prospective buyers so far , but just general commentary as to whether it's a genuine article , where it 's come from and how it came here , that sort of thing , " he told ABC News Online .
But he would not say how he came to be in possession of the piece .
" That 's just the mystery part of the artwork .
I can't reveal any more , " he said .
He says he has not been to Afghanistan himself .
Rudd says he examined the pricing strategies of the elite auction houses , Christies and Sothebys , but decided his work should be priced more realistically .
He says instead of pricing which is based on an artist 's profile , he decided to ask for a figure which he thought reflected the art work 's message .
Cost of war
Rudd says his pricing analysis included a breakdown of the multi-trillion dollar US war budget in the Middle East since 2001 , and other variables such as the cost of civilians and soldiers wounded .
Once he came up with the figure , he instructed the gallery director to put it in the catalogue .
Off
The Kerb 's director Shini Pararajasingham says the work is probably uninsurable .
Damien Hirst 's Beautiful Inside My Head
Forever set the record for the most expensive single artist auction - going for $ 203 million in 2008 .
If Rudd's Used Car Part sold it would eclipse this figure - although Rudd admits a sale is unlikely .
" Christies and Sothebys would no doubt argue that my piece is unsellable , " he said .
" This is totally the point . "
Rudd is not a stranger to controversy .
The artist , who is the nephew of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , is known for his left leaning political views .
Last year his painting , depicting Ronald MacDonald carrying an Olympic torch past burning monk Thich Quang Duc , was at the centre of controversy when it was banned by the Melbourne City Council from being shown at an exhibition .
Rudd says Used Car Part From Afghanistan will probably become part of a larger collection he is working on that will have similar price tags .
" They 'll be , in terms of the formal aspect , they 'll be presented in a similar way - museum sort of style and very minimal , " he said .
" I guess it 'll be a work in progress in which objects that are displayed do have a mystery narrative or mystery background . "
Rudd says he does not know what he would do if someone actually wanted to buy the work .
" To be honest I have n't thought that far ahead .
It 's almost out of the question , " he said .
" But hopefully what comes across is just the actual point of it being so extreme . "
This is a bright week for smartphone users who do n't own iPhones .
Google and Palm are rolling out some nice improvements in new point releases of their respective platforms .
Windows Mobile users also have something to look forward to , as Microsoft prepares to launch Windows Mobile 6.5 in a matter of days .
Android 1.6 , which is codenamed Donut , has been rolled out to unlocked developer handsets and is coming soon to the G1 and possibly other carrier - supported phones .
This version includes some compelling improvements for both users and developers .
One of the most significant advancements is the introduction of CDMA support in the telephony stack which will open the door for Android phones to launch on Verizon and Sprint .
Sprint is planning to launch the HTC
Hero later this month , making it the first CDMA carrier with a confirmed Android handset .
Verizon 's first Android phone will likely be the Motorola Tao , which was previously codenamed Sholes .
Rumored to have a WVGA display and an OMAP 3430 processor , the Tao could break the pattern of lackluster specs that has afflicted virtually all previous Android offerings in North America .
Android 1.6 introduced expanded support for screen resolutions , which makes WVGA seem pretty likely .
Some blurry shots of the device have recently surfaced and are attracting interest on gadget blogs .
Under the hood , Android 's Linux kernel got a boost from version 2.6.27 to version 2.6.29 .
The kernel has undergone a lot of significant changes between those versions .
The most important smartphone - related change is the introduction of Intel 's open source WiMAX stack and drivers in the mainline kernel for version 2.6.29 .
Some reports indicate that Sprint is interested in launching dual - band Android devices in 2010 with both WiMAX and 3G support .
New development frameworks introduced in 1.6 bring intriguing new capabilities to the platform , such as support for implementing gesture - based user interfaces and text - to - speech functionality .
For more details about developer features , you can refer to the SDK release notes .
Android 1.6 also offers a bunch of nice improvements for end users , such as new camera software with significantly better performance .
The platform has also introduced a new universal search and indexing system .
Through a search box on the home screen , users will be able to input a query and see results from many different sources of content , including bookmarks and contacts .
The search box offers AwesomeBar - like smart completion and will remember your most frequently picked items .
Palm has also released a new update , version 1.2 of WebOS .
One of the most noteworthy improvements in this update is support for LinkedIn in the Palm Synergy synchronization service .
Palm has also added the ability for users to input a credit card number in the App Catalog program , indicating that commercial software could be available soon .
Palm announced the release in an entry on the company 's official blog .
A more detailed overview of the changes can be found in the release notes .
The announcement by Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) on Tuesday that he may part company with the Democratic caucus to join with Republicans in filibustering health care reform dismayed advocates of a public option but sent health insurance stocks soaring .
MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow noted that this action is unusual even for Lieberman , who in the past has refrained from blocking floor votes on bills that he himself opposed .
Maddow was joined by blogger Jane Hamsher , founder of FireDogLake , to discuss the unprecedented nature of Lieberman ’s decision .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s never happened before that one party had — technically , in the caucus — a filibuster - proof majority and one of the members went to join over with the opposition party , ” Hamsher told Maddow .
“ You have to ask yourself , ‘ What were they thinking when they let Joe into the caucus and did n’t get him to agree to join with them on procedural votes ? ' ”
Hamsher put primary blame for the decision on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , who said back in 2008 , “ I trust Joe , ” when he was asked if Lieberman could be counted upon not to filibuster .
with the Republicans in return for keeping his committee chairmanship .
“ Reid ’s the one who , as majority leader , did not get Lieberman to commit as the price of his gavel to join with the caucus on procedural votes , ” Hamsher emphasized .
“ So if Joe wants to screw him over , that ’s fine .
Joe may not pay a price in Connecticut , but Reid will pay a price in Nevada for it . ”
Maddow also pointed out that “ the most high - profile thing that Joe Liberman has done with his Homeland Security chairmanship is hold a hearing on whether or not President Obama has too many czars , just like Fox News said that he did .
What value is he to the Democrats ? ”
“ One has to wonder , ” Hamsher agreed .
“ Sixty votes is meaningless if you do n’t have them . …
His job is basically to be of more value to the Republicans within the Democratic caucus than he would be on the outside of it . ”

Hamsher concluded by suggesting that Reid and President Obama “ are going to have to lean on Joe this time , because otherwise I think there will be a price to pay for allowing him to dictate what the caucus does .
…
There are consequences down the line for Joe ’s lack of loyalty . ”

The second malicious worm to attack jailbroken iPhones has been spotted in the wild , and is the first to directly target users ' bank accounts .
Called iBotnet .
A by security research firm Intego , the worm tries to steal account logins from customers of popular online banking service ING Direct .
Though it only affects iPhones that have been jailbroken by the user with SSH installed , this is clearly a trend that is growing quickly — and one that Apple is n't likely to care about until it affects " legit " users .
According to Intego , the malware scans for phones on a local network and a range of IPs with an open SSH port , then attempts to log in using the default root password that is the same on all iPhones .
This is the same method used by the first malicious iPhone worm that came out earlier this month .
The IPs scanned by this particular worm include those in the Netherlands , Portugal , Hungary , and Australia .
After it finds a vulnerable phone , iBotnet .
A changes the root password to " ohshit " ( we think that 's a pretty accurate assessment of the situation ) and connects to a command and control center ( CnC ) in Lithuania in order to upload personal data collected from the iPhone .
What makes this server a CnC is the fact that distributes executables to the jailbroken phones and assigns each device an identifier so it can reconnect later for further action .
Most importantly , however , iBotnetA specifically changes an entry in the iPhone 's hosts file for ING Direct — this means users who try to go to ING Direct from their phones after the file has been changed will be redirected to another page that looks just like it .
If they try to log in , the scammers will then have their bank login credentials and can transfer out any cash that is available .
Another security research firm , F - Secure , wrote on its blog that this worm is n't widespread but is more serious than the first .
The first copied personal data , such as e-mail , contacts , SMSs , calendars , photos , and more — opening up the doors for more serious exploitation but nothing as heinous as taking bank passwords .
These two worms are not the first for iPhones , however .
Two others circulated earlier this month as well — one claiming to hold the device " hostage " for �5 and the other merely Rickrolling users as punishment for leaving the default passwords intact on their jailbroken phones .
As usual , non-jailbroken iPhones remain unaffected by these worms ( or any real worms ) .
Like on the Mac , researchers have demonstrated several proof - of - concept exploits for locked - down iPhones , but none have turned into a legitimate concern for iPhone or iPod touch users as of yet .
Still , targeting jailbroken iPhones looks like a hot trend for malware writers .
If you 're one of those users , F - Secure has provided a guide to changing your default password so that you 're not vulnerable to these hacks , but do n't expect Apple to care about your plight anytime soon .
Until regular users begin to find themselves victim of an attack , jailbreakers will have to rely on the sympathetic research world to stay on top of this kind of malware .
Dating in New York can seem like rolling a pair of dice directly into a venomous snake 's mouth .
In fact , the easiest way to find a significant other in this city is probably surviving a plane crash with them .
New York has released its annual list of " Reasons to Love New York , " an exercise in NYC boosterism which we must grudgingly salute , ourselves being sometimes given over to that overwhelmed feeling of " why the fuck am I here " — a feeling which is probably most effectively addressed by making just such a list .
( Because there are so many reasons ! )
One of New York 's Reasons to Love New York caught our eye in particular , not least of all because it was the first reason : " Because there was more than one miracle on the Hudson . "
Wha - huh ?
The first miracle was , obviously , the US Airways 1549 .
The other Miracle they speak of is not the deer that swam 2,000 yards across the Hudson , although that was pretty badass .
It is the burgeoning love of Ben Bostic and Laura Zych : two Flight 1549 survivors who met and fell in love at a 1549er reunion .
Take it away , New York Magazine 's Chris Rovzar :
In July , Kristy Spears ( seat 8A ) hosted a reunion in her home outside Charlotte .
Zych ( seat 17B ) met up with Amy Jolly ( seat 14C ) , whom she had befriended through a survivors ' Facebook group .
Bostic hung out with them , but had to leave early and drive out of town for another party .
Late that night , they persuaded him to drive back , and Zych offered to let him crash at her place .
" I did n't think of it until the next day , but it was the second time I crashed with them , " says Bostic , who calls going back into town that night " one of the best decisions I 'd ever made . "
He and Zych ended up talking on her porch until six in the morning .
" I had to work the next day .
And I did n't care !
At that time , that 's exactly what I wanted to do .
The couple has been dating ever since . "
And check out what a great relationship was borne from chaos , according to what the couple told CBS :
Zych said on the couple 's second get - together , they danced together , and now they dance together every day .
Bostic said , " No matter where we 're at , whatever we 're doing , we end up dancing somewhere . "
Now if you excuse us , we are going to take a shower and book some flights through heavily goose - populated areas .
I SAW U
You : Blue sweatshirt w/ University of Michigan logo .
You were silently weeping as our plane plummeted to Earth .
Me : Glasses , white T - shirt .
Hands in the air , screaming a promise to God that I would volunteer at the food bank every week if He guided our plane to safety .
You looked so damn good contemplating your mortality — I just can't stop wondering how you would look in the morning wearing one of my T - shirts .

The Russian space agency may build a nuclear - powered spacecraft with the blessing of the country ’s leader , Russian and international media reported Thursday .
The craft would cost $ 600 million and Russian scientists claim it could be ready as early as 2012 .
“ The idea [ of nuclear - powered spaceflight ] has bright prospects , and if Russia could stage a breakthrough it could become our main contribution to any future international program of deep space exploration , ” Andrei Ionin , an independent Moscow - based space expert , told Christian Science Monitor .
Building a nuclear - powered spacecraft is feasible , said Patrick McDaniel , a nuclear engineer and co-director of the University of New Mexico ’s Institute for Space and Nuclear Power Studies , but probably not in the short time frame that the Russians have proposed .
“ To have a test article that they could test on the ground , that ’s very reasonable , ” McDaniel said .
“ To have a completed system , that ’s highly unlikely . ”
If the spaceship actually gets built , it would complete a half - century quest to bring nuclear power to space propulsion , beginning with a 1947 report by North American Aviation to the Air Force .
It ’s not hard to see why engineers would want to use nuclear power .
Fission reactors provide a lot of power for their size , which is a key attribute in designing space systems .
One engineer claims nuclear rockets are inherently twice as efficient as their chemical brethren .
Their attributes could have increased the exploration range of the space program , nuclear propulsion advocates argue , allowing us to get to more interesting places .
“ We could have done a lot more things in space .
We could have gone more places , ” McDaniel said of nuclear rocket research .
“ It ’s highly likely we would have gone to Mars . ”
The current plans to potentially return to Mars do not include a nuclear rocket , but several decades of plans from the 1950s through the 1980s just assumed that nuclear power would be a part of the effort to reach the Red Planet .
Toward that end , the Air Force , which preceded NASA in managing space programs , created Project Rover in conjunction with Los Alamos National Laboratory .
The goal of Rover was to develop a reactor that could be used for propulsion .
Various incarnations of the reactor the scientists developed , called Kiwi , were tested at Jackass Flats , Nevada ( see video ) .
The idea behind the reactor was to use the heat generated by fission to heat hydrogen , which would expand , generating the force to push the rocket .
None of the reactors ran for more than eight minutes , but they were considered to have met their goals .
Technically , they worked .
Later , the concept was largely abandoned just because no one really knew what to do with a nuclear reactor in space .
“ Snap 10A was a technology demo , the question was then , well , what do we want to do with it ? ” McDaniel said .
“ And no one had a really good answer . ”
Other , more fanciful nuclear propulsion ideas were proposed , too .
One , Project Orion , would have been powered by nuclear bombs .
The physicist Freeman Dyson , who worked on the project , told The New York Times Magazine he saw it “ as the solution to a problem .
With one trip we ’d have got rid of 2,000 bombs . ”
“ Orion was a delightful scientific exercise , but not very feasible , ” McDaniel said .
These various technologies cost money to develop , of course , and the scale of the cash that flowed their way shows how seriously Americans took nuclear propulsion .
Between 1955 and 1972 , the United States spent more than $ 1.4 billion in then - year dollars on developing nuclear rockets and related technologies .
At the end of that period , when the Nixon administration cut NASA ’s budget generally and NERVA ’s specifically , the United States was well on its way to developing nuclear power for spacefaring and space purposes .
“ It is indeed remarkable that the adoption of the Rover–NERVA database , upgraded and modernized by current rocket - engine technology , would fully satisfy NASA ’s space transfer propulsion and long - distance exploration requirements and permit realization of a safe and low programmatic risk development programme , ” wrote Stanley Gunn , who worked on the nuclear propulsion program for Rocketdyne , in a 2001 article for Space Policy .
There were several attempts to resurrect nuclear propulsion of various types , most recently the mothballed Project Prometheus .
None , though , have garnered much support .
One major reason is that NASA picks its propulsion systems based on its targets — and true exploration of the solar system and beyond has n’t really been a serious goal , the Constellation plans for a return to the moon aside .
“ The destinations dictate the power system , ” said Rao Surampudi , a Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineer who works on the development of power systems .
By and large , it ’s cheaper and easier to go with solar power or very low - power radioisotope generators like the one that powers the Cassini mission .
McDaniel agreed that the targets drive things , citing the general decline of pure technology development research at NASA .
“ Until we commit to going back to Mars , we ’re not going to have a nuclear rocket , ” McDaniel said .
Or perhaps a new nuclear - powered Russian spacecraft could get anxious minds at the Pentagon and NASA worrying about the need to keep pace with the Ivanovs .
After all , the Soviet nuclear rocket program may have been more advanced than the American efforts at the time of the USSR ’s collapse .

LONDON ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Men only buy their own underpants when they are hoping to entice a potential partner into a relationship , according to a new survey .
Women look at underwear models in Times Square during Freshpair 's National Underwear Day fashion show in New York , August 7 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Shannon Stapleton
The poll by British retailer Debenhams showed that men normally leave the purchasing of their underwear to their mothers until about the age of 19 , relatively late when compared to women , who start buying their own knickers around 13 .
Between the ages of 19 and 23 , men tend to buy their own underwear , up to 31 pairs a year in the belief that wearing new underpants is an essential prerequisite to a relationship .
Buying declines gradually to zero between 23 and 33 , because most men are in stable relationships and leave the shopping to their partners , unless they are still on the prowl .
“ Our research shows that you can tell when a man is looking for a partner by the number of new underpants they buy for themselves , ” said Debenhams Head of Men ’s Accessories Buying , Rob Faucherand .
“ If he buys more than 31 pairs every year then he ’s either still trying desperately to impress the woman in his life -- or else she ’s not The One . ”
However , Faucherand said that if your man seldom goes to the underwear section on his own , and instead assumes that you will choose for him , then you can be certain that your relationship is in a very stable phase .
The survey also reveals that underwear - buying among men picks up again briefly between the ages of 38 and 40 , when some men are going through relationship break - ups and seeking new partners again .
The incidence of this new - found purchasing enthusiasm is short - lived however .
It goes into a sharp decline and slumps to zero again at the age of 44 when men mostly find themselves in another stable relationship .
After 44 , most men remain strangers to the underwear department for the rest of their lives , handing all responsibility for their underwear to women , Debenhams said .
“ This is the one issue that feminism has never addressed , ” Faucherand said .
“ It ’s not who wears the pants in each household -- it ’s who has to buy them that counts . ”
Fine I can play this game too .
Is n't that vampire from the Underworld a pedophile too ?
She 's over 400 years old and she fell in love with a human !
What about Peter Pan ?
He 's lived forever , and Wendy and him have a little somethinsomethin goin on .
Is he a pedophile ?
Nooo .
So people need to shut up before they ask a question .
Edward is the same age as Bella , and just to let you know he was a virgin until he met her , so read the damn books and get your story straight .
I am sick of ppl bashing and screaming that they love the books .
Its a BOOK , build a bridge and get over it .
Everyone has their own opinions .
Tom and Jerry cocktail recipe is a classic holiday cocktail drink that is enjoyed by many starting with the Thanksgiving holiday all the way to New Year ’s day .
The main ingredients of the Tom and Jerry batter is made of beaten eggs , sugar , and vanilla .
A healthy scoop of the batter is added to the cup , then hot water , and the liquor of your choice ( rum , brandy or whiskey ) is stirred in .
The Tom and Jerry cocktail is finally topped with a dash of nutmeg .
The taste is best described as drinking a warm Christmas sugar cookie .
Once you make your first batch of batter mix , it gets a bit addictive as it is so easy to make and so delicious !
The Tom and Jerry cocktail drink is a Christmas tradition for my family .
We have been making Tom and Jerry drinks to mark the Christmas season for as long as I can remember .
For some reason , the men in our family like to mix up the batter mix and prepare the cocktails .
Maybe it is because they are looking forward to the first cup !
Traditionally , we prepare the Tom and Jerry batter and serve up with Whisky to the adults on Christmas Eve .
The kids get to enjoy virgin Tom and Jerry ’s too so everyone in the family is included .
Virgin Tom and Jerry drinks are just as delicious with just the batter mixed with hot water and the liquor is omitted .
I can not imagine Christmas without this Tom and Jerry Drink !
Tom and Jerry ’s are often mistaken for eggnog – but eggnog it is not !
A Tom and Jerry cocktail drink is light with a foamy crown that forms when hot water is stirred into the batter .
Tom and Jerry ’s have more of a sweet vanilla flavor ( hence the feeling of drinking a warm sugar cookie ) while eggnog is a thicker / heavier drink .
There are no egg whites used to make eggnog foamy and it is more of a milk - based drink with a combination of spices such as cloves , cinnamon , and nutmeg .
Please check out my Christmas Prime Rib Dinner Menu and Holiday Open House Menu which includes this delicious holiday Tom and Jerry Batter recipe .
History of Tom and Jerry Cocktails :
There is debate on the origin of the Tom and Jerry Drink , whether it was invented by a British journalist who named the drink after characters in his popular novel in the 1820 ’s or if it was invented by an American bartender in 1850 who first published a recipe .
The Tom and Jerry drink used to be extremely popular in the United States .
For over one hundred years , you could even buy Tom and Jerry drink sets .
A resurgence of the drink ’s popularity came about in the 1940 ’s after the World War II .
This is most likely due to more families entertaining at home instead of the bars .
Special drink sets were sold with a punch bowl for the batter and matching mugs with “ Tom and Jerry ” written on the bowl and each mug .
We do not see Tom and Jerry ’s served as much nowadays , but this cocktail still lives on strongly in the Midwest , especially in the states of Wisconsin and Minnesota .
Perhaps it due to the long cold winters in this area of the country .
It is very common for Midwesterner ’s to find the Tom and Jerry drink batter in their local markets during the holiday season .

My Secret Plan to Overthrow the Mullahs
It was late February 2003 , a few weeks before the U.S. invasion of Iraq , and President George W. Bush ’s administration still lacked a real strategy for the would - be regional hegemon next door .
As the Iran desk officer in the office of the secretary of defense , I felt desperate .
We were about to invade Iraq without a definitive policy toward its most bitter foe .
I feared a repeat of Vietnam and saw in Iran a new Ho Chi Minh Trail — the enemy lifeline that snaked through Laos and Cambodia and helped dash U.S. hopes for Southeast Asia .
I knew that the Islamic Republic would endeavor to replicate this disaster in the Middle East from the moment U.S. troops stormed Baghdad — just as it had bloodied our noses in Lebanon , Saudi Arabia , and elsewhere for decades .
In fact , I knew from my sources that Tehran had already prepared an entire network of operatives , proxies , and weapons ready to challenge the United States as soon as it toppled Saddam Hussein .
I also knew it would be foolish to assume — as many in the Bush administration did — that Iraq ’s many pro-Iranian political and religious leaders could be trusted to cooperate with the United States ’ stated goal of building " a peaceful … democratic , and united Iraq . "
I had spoken with many of these people myself and was on friendly terms with the representatives of several prominent Shiite religious leaders .
I was not an ideologue , and I spoke Farsi .
I was steeped in Islamic culture and history .
I suspected that many of these individuals were essentially Iranian agents — including the opportunistic " man for all factions " Ahmad Chalabi , a suspicion eventually confirmed when I was later told he had encouraged the pro-Iranian Shiite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr to " dig in " against the U.S. Marines in Najaf .
I was not , however , very brave .
I did not confront either my boss in the Office of Special Plans , Douglas Feith , or his boss , Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz , about my overriding fears that Iran could spoil our plans in Iraq — and wreak havoc in the region .
In the fevered atmosphere of the time , I did n’t think they would take my concerns seriously , and I was convinced Feith was too ideologically committed to overthrowing Hussein and too enamored of Chalabi in particular to hear any doubts .
So , in a foolish , spur - of - the - moment decision , I asked Steven Rosen , foreign - policy director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , to approach the National Security Council ’s Elliott Abrams with my concerns .
This action ultimately led to my indictment , in 2005 , for espionage after Rosen relayed my comments to an Israeli diplomat .
But my intention was never to leak secrets to a foreign government .
I wanted to halt the rush to war in Iraq — at least long enough to adopt a realistic policy toward an Iran bent on doing us ill .
Today , still serving my 10 - month sentence , I take little solace in the knowledge that my concerns were justified .
As early as 2004 , the editor of Kayhan newspaper , the mouthpiece of Iran ’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , boasted that " the American invaders are our hostage in Iraq . "
I often wonder what would have happened had we fully committed to overthrowing the Islamic Republic .
Inside the Pentagon , I had long argued that regime change , not accommodation or war , would be our best policy .
Competent counterparts in the State Department and the CIA , however , disagreed .
That left us with a muddle :
The hard - line mullahs who run Iran thought we were trying to oust them , but in practice we were n’t .
I sought alternatives , for example , the possibility of shocking Iran into ground - level neutrality in Iraq so that U.S. aims might succeed without unacceptable casualties .
But ultimately , I failed .
My plan was designed to shake the foundations of Iran ’s mullahcracy without resorting to military action .
I urged the United States to recognize a government in exile , perhaps in a nearby Central Asian country with a Persian heritage .
I proposed a sophisticated propaganda offensive , planting stories both true and otherwise in the Persian - language media to undermine Iranians ’ confidence in their leaders .
I urged that we highlight Iran ’s human rights record by focusing attention on at least one victim of the regime every day of the year , and that we expose the regime ’s " gulag archipelago " of prisons .
And I proposed the selective declassification of documents that would embarrass Iran on the world stage .
I also called for our financial specialists to compile and publish a list of foreign - based bank accounts , properties , and businesses owned by key regime leaders , and suggested we disrupt the Islamic Republic ’s monetary transactions , for example , blocking its attempts to secure loans and grants from international lending institutions .
Finally , I suggested we make the same commitment to Iran ’s people as we did to Solidarity in Poland : to help train an entire generation of free unionists and political activists to surreptitiously exit and re-enter Iran .
People forget that containing the Soviet Union did n’t mean accommodating it ; in fact , the United States spent millions to help overthrow that evil empire .
With the passage of time , the Iranian regime ’s grip on power has solidified further , even as opposition to the ruling theocrats has grown .
But some of the same weapons short of war that I proposed could still be effective today .
This past summer ’s election proved there are growing pockets of discontent in Iran .
It also showed that not nearly enough has been done to broaden and focus that discontent beyond the middle - and upper - class confines of north Tehran .
Yet many in the United States now see just two choices for dealing with Iran : military action or some form of accommodation .
Bombing suspected nuclear - related facilities or other military targets would prove inconclusive and risk strengthening the regime .
But allowing a hostile Iran to acquire nuclear weapons , or stop just short of doing so , would hardly be better .
There is a third option .
The United States could offer its unwavering support to the Iranian opposition , strengthening and broadening this newly reawakened movement by arming it with satellite phones , digital cameras , and GPS units .
America could train a cadre of countersnipers to neutralize the regime ’s rooftop shooters , many of whom have fired into peaceful crowds of protesters .
Data could be fed into the government ’s channels of information to confuse its intelligence organs , turning various elements of the regime on each other .
Shortwave radio could be used to educate people in rural regions where the regime enjoys some support .
America could eviscerate the regime ’s moral authority by showing its perfidy and corruption for what it is .
U.S. action might well precipitate a massive crackdown , though such a move by the clerical - military junta could spark widespread resistance .
At last , the great majority of Iranians who oppose tyranny might rebel .
In one scenario , the regime would end with a bang of terrible bloodshed , chaos , and reprisals .
But if Iranians were coaxed into mobilizing a long - lasting general strike , the regime would end in a whimper .
Then , we could finally toss Iran ’s vicious Islamic Republic — a regime that has murdered and wrongly imprisoned thousands of its own citizens — on the ash heap of history .
THE FACTS
With swine flu sweeping across the country , health officials are reminding Americans to wash their hands often to reduce the spread of the disease .
Soap and warm water have long been said to prevent the spread of infections , but is warm or hot water really more effective than cold ?
In its medical literature , the Food and Drug Administration states that hot water comfortable enough for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria , but is more effective than cold water because it removes oils from the hand that can harbor bacteria .
Image Credit ... Christoph Niemann
But in a 2005 report in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine , scientists with the Joint Bank Group / Fund Health Services Department pointed out that in studies in which subjects had their hands contaminated , and then were instructed to wash and rinse with soap for 25 seconds using water with temperatures ranging from 40 degrees Fahrenheit to 120 degrees , the various temperatures had “ no effect on transient or resident bacterial reduction . ”
The congestion on the North Circular can make you wonder whether attending friendlies at Wembley is worth the hassle .
But if you happen to be Brazilian , getting to see your national team play a friendly is a lot more frustrating than sitting in traffic by the Neasden branch of Ikea .
On Saturday , Brazil 's friendly against England is taking place 7,000 miles from Rio de Janeiro in Doha , Qatar .
But that is nothing new .
Since Brazil played England in the first game at the new Wembley in June 2007 , they have played 11 friendlies and only one of them has been in Brazil .
If you want to watch Brazil friendlies , the advice is simple : do n't live in Brazil .
Dortmund , Montpellier , Chicago , Boston , Dublin , London , Seattle and Tallinn have all played host to Brazil in the last two years , some cities more than once .
The promoters , the Kentaro Group , call it the " Brazil World Tour " , and they are not joking .
The most famous football team in the world have become an exhibition team , shoved on a plane and taken to whoever will pay the money .

It has long been argued that playing friendlies in Europe is more suitable for Brazil 's European - based majority of players .
But if that is the case then how do you justify two trips to Boston ( 3,270 miles from London ) , one to Chicago ( 4,520 miles from Milan ) and one to play Canada in Seattle ( 5,400 miles from Barcelona ) ?
The answer is : if you pay then Brazil will play , regardless of the air miles their players rack up .
For Saturday 's game , the Brazil football federation ( CBF ) and the big media conglomerate that owns the " rights " to their friendlies had the first choice on the venue in return for Brazil playing at Wembley in 2007 .
They could have chosen Rio , Sao Paulo or Europe but – with all but one of the players in both squads based at European clubs – they selected a city that is seven hours on a plane from London .
It is a pretty sorry state of affairs for Brazil fans .
For certain European club managers it means , as part of the CBF 's deal , their expensive Brazilian stars are flown around the world in the middle of a busy season .
As for Fifa , it does not care at all .
So long as the friendlies take place within the international calendar it waves them through .
Many of Brazil 's friendlies do not even serve the purpose of giving them serious preparation for major tournaments .
After the England game Brazil are staying in Doha for another friendly against that powerhouse of international football , Oman – ranked 79th in the world , one place below Wales .
In 2005 , with the World Cup finals the next year , Brazil played Hong Kong in Hong Kong , Guatemala in Sao Paulo , FC Seville in Seville and the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi .
The principles of international football are abandoned to the extent that even when Brazil face opponents who have perfectly decent stadiums , the game is staged elsewhere .
For example , instead of playing Turkey in Turkey , Brazil played them in Dortmund , presumably to exploit the lucrative Turkish immigrant population there .
Ditto games against Mexico in Boston and Algeria in Montpellier .
Heaven only knows why last year Brazil played Canada in Seattle , about 140 miles the wrong side of the US - Canadian border .
When Richard Scudamore floated his controversial idea for a 39th Premier League fixture abroad he was cut down by Fifa .
However you feel about that proposal it was devised in order to give all 20 league clubs an equal stake in the popularity of the competition around the world instead of just the big clubs cashing in with pre-season tours .
Sepp Blatter , head of Fifa , called it an " abuse of football " .
How does Blatter square that with a national team which has been turned into a money - making franchise that ignores the sanctity of international football ?
One that does not stage its games according to national borders and plays matches against club sides .
How long before someone suggests that Brazil play World Cup qualifiers outside of Brazil ?
For a rapacious market hungry for the next big thing , it is the logical step .
There is little political advantage in Blatter telling Brazilian football what to do .
Ricardo Texeira , the CBF president , who was once married to the daughter of Joao Havelange , Blatter 's predecessor , is in his 20th year as president .
He is on Fifa 's executive committee and is the kind of football powerbroker to whom even Blatter must listen .
The Brazil " World Tour " is promoted by Kentaro on behalf of International Sports Events ( ISE ) who " own " the rights to Brazil 's friendly matches .
So much for all that Uefa and Fifa - driven criticism of English clubs who sell out to foreign owners : in Brazil , they have sold off the national team .
In turn , ISE is owned by the Saudi Arabian multi-billion dollar conglomerate Dallah Albaraka Group .
That is the long story of how the most iconic football team in the world came to be owned by a Saudi Arabian business and hawked all around the world .
The simple fact is that on Saturday England play Brazil in a distant country – with little football heritage – that costs a lot of money for fans of either nation to visit .
They are doing so for reasons that have nothing to do with football and everything to do with money .
Watch out Wayne , Sir Bobby 's record is far from a done deal
There has always been something about Sir Bobby Charlton 's record of 49 goals for England that looks strangely untouchable .
Gary Lineker was a shoo - in to surpass it and ended up finishing one goal short .
Michael Owen always looked destined to sail past it but is now marooned , possibly forever , on 40 goals .
So when Sir Bobby says that he expects Wayne Rooney – 25 goals in 56 caps – to break the record , Rooney should pause to think .
Forty - nine goals might not sound a lot in a lifetime but with every famous England striker that falls short , Charlton 's phenomenal achievement takes on an even greater lustre .
Bridge needs change of identity to drop debt
We can't have it both ways with Chelsea .
We cannot ridicule them for their reliance on Roman Abramovich 's wealth – the debt must be somewhere around £ 800 m now – and then do the same when they make some tough choices to try to be self - sufficient .
New chief executive Ron Gourlay 's plan to sell the naming rights to Stamford Bridge is a hard one to stomach for any fan .
But with all the money that has been pumped in since 2003 to win two Premier League titles , two FA Cups and two League Cups they have been living beyond their means .
Something has got to give .
Hill - Wood deserves credit
" Dead money " .
That was how Peter Hill - Wood described David Dein 's initial £ 292,000 investment in Arsenal in 1983 .
With the club now valued at £ 530 m
I still feel sorry for Hill - Wood who sold out too early but has nonetheless served Arsenal with love and loyalty .
The best league in the world is back .

For months ( years ? )
Rupert Murdoch has been waving his jowls around and shouting that Google is stealing from him by not paying to index his material .
And all along , we 've been saying , " Pffft , right .
If you do n't like it , just add a robots .
txt file that tells Google not to index you .
Until you do , stop whining and put it back in your pants . "
Now Rupert has promised to do exactly that .
He claims that he 's going to take all of News Corp 's websites pay - only and have them removed from Google when he does .
You know what ?
He 's lying .
But I think it'd be entertaining if every reporter who interviewed him , for the rest of his life , said , " Hey , Rupert , when are you going to take all your company 's websites out of Google ? "
It 'd also be hilarious to get the CEOs of the various pieces of Rupert 's empire to comment on whether they want all their company 's materials invisible to search engines .
Rupert also thinks that fair use is illegal and that the right court case would result in it being " barred altogether . "
Again , another hilarious interview question for the rest of his career : " Hey , Rupert , when are you going to abolish fair use ?
How 's that plan coming , pal ? "
The revelation came early in the interview , after Murdoch claimed that Google and others are stealing News Corp content in response to a question about who he was talking about when he talked about plagiarists .
" The people who simply pick up everything to run with , and steal our stories … they just take them .. without payment .
That 's Google , Microsoft , Ask.com .. a whole lot of people . "
Murdoch claimed that readers who visit News Corp sites via search offer little value to advertisers , and that News Corp would rather have fewer people coming to their websites , but paying .
Asked why News has n't made its sites invisible to Google , Murdoch replied : " I think we will …. but that 's when we start charging . "
Murdoch also claims that News Corp believes that the doctrine of Fair Use can be challenged in court and " barred altogether . "
Epic Win : News Corp Likely To Remove Content From Google
( Thanks , Dustin ! )
Update :
So here 's what I think it going on .
Murdoch has no intention of shutting down search - engine traffic to his sites , but he 's still having lurid fantasies inspired by the momentary insanity that caused Google to pay him for the exclusive right to index MySpace ( thus momentarily rendering MySpace a visionary business - move instead of a ten - minutes - behind - the - curve cash - dump ) .
So what he 's hoping is that a second - tier search engine like Bing or Ask ( or , better yet , some search tool you 've never heard of that just got $ 50 MM in venture capital ) will give him half a year 's operating budget in exchange for a competitive advantage over Google .
He may , in fact , get a taker .
And it will be a disaster .
A search engine whose sole competitive advantage is " We have Rupert Murdoch 's pages ! " will not attract any substantial traffic .
The search engine will either go bust or fail to renew the deal .
On this fair use question , my guess is that some evil Richelieu in the legal department has been passing torrid whispers to Rupert about how the Berne Convention 's " Three Step Test " for exceptions to copyright is overstepped by US fair use and by many countries ' fair dealing rules .
So Rupert thinks that he can take a case to the WTO ( membership in the WTO is contingent on compliance with the Berne Convention ) and get all these rules struck down .
Of course , Rupert 's own media products make frequent and copious fair use of other copyrights — you can't create without fair use .
But the mustache - twirling lawyer at Newscorp probably did n't mention this to Rupert Palpatine ( the lawyer probably thinks it'd be OK if every single one of those fair uses was replaced by a process in which lots of lawyers negotiated the terms of every use , probably all reporting to him ) .
They 're wrong , of course .
The WTO 's rules — and Berne — are necessarily subservient to realpolitik , viz. , the US gets $ 1 trillion of economic activity out of fair use , and it's not going to get rid of it because it makes some UN agency sad ( if the UN mattered to the US , the US'd be paying the billions in back - fees it owes ) .
And if the WTO imposes trade sanctions on the US , they 'll just be ignored , because the world 's factory - states ( China , with also - rans such as India and Vietnam ) can't afford to stop sending shipping containers full of Happy Meal toys to America .
And if the WTO tries to embargo China , it 'll quickly discover that the rest of the world is n't prepared to live without plastic tchotchkes and junkware either .
So good luck with that , Rupert .
have a delightful , Howard - Hughesian dotage , acting out a crazed , Moby - Dick dumbshow against the Internet , hoping that the world 's politics and economies will reform themselves to suit your fevered imaginings .
This is how history will remember you .
What you probably never knew about Hexane extraction
Soybean processing releases hexane into the environment
How can you protect yourself and your children from hexane ?
The bottom line - the Health Ranger 's opinion
Protect yourself from the toxicity of processed foods
Why modern society looks the other way on chemical contamination of foods
( NaturalNews ) Virtually all " protein bars " on the market today are made with soy protein .
Many infant formula products are also made with soy protein , and thousands of vegetarian products ( veggie burgers , veggie cheese , " natural " food bars , etc. ) are made with soy protein .
That soy protein is almost always described as safe and " natural " by the companies using it .
But there 's a dirty little secret the soy product industry does n't want you to know :
To determine the true extent of this hexane contamination , NaturalNews joined forces with the Cornucopia Institute ( www.Cornucopia.org ) to conduct testing of hexane residues in soy meal and soy grits using FDA - approved and USDA - approved laboratories .
The Cornucopia Institute performed the bulk of this effort , and NaturalNews provided funding to help cover laboratory costs .
The results proved to be worrisome : commonly used to produce soy protein for infant formula , protein bars and vegetarian food products .
These laboratory results appear to indicate that -- a neurotoxic substance produced as a byproduct of gasoline refining .
But how dangerous is hexane , exactly ?
Is it something that could be dangerous at a few parts per million ?
And which soy - based products on the market right now might be contaminated with hexane
To answer these questions , NaturalNews looked into public documents surrounding , a company that manufactures DHA for infant formula , using hexane for extraction .
We found disturbing details about Martek , including a documented explosion in the wastewater treatment system downstream from the manufacturing plant .
This explosion was caused by hexane pollution .
We also found documents revealing Martek 's application for permission to pollute hexane into the environment , as well as a planned emission cap that would put the company just under the limit for being considered a " major polluter " ofAdditional documents reveal concerning information about the safety of Martek 's oils used in infant formula .
All this information is being released in tomorrow 's feature story on NaturalNews , so be sure to check back to read that .
The remainder of this story focuses on the use of hexane inTo learn more about the use of hexane in the health industry -- and in soy products in particular -- we turn to the Cornucopia Institute 's recently - published report called This report contains some of the most shocking information you 've probably ever read about the possible dangers of this chemical solvent used in the processing of soy .
Here are some highlights of what it explains about hexane : ( Quotation marks indicate exact verbiage from thereport . ) •
Hexane is a petroleum chemical produced as a by - product of gasoline refining . •
" Hexane is used to process nearly all conventional soy protein ingredients and edible oils and is prohibited when processing organic foods . " •
Soybeans are bathed in hexane as part of their processing by food manufacturers . •
" Hexane is a neurotoxic chemical that poses serious occupational hazards to workers , is an environmental air pollutant , and can contaminate food . " •
Hexane has been detected as a chemical contaminant in soy - based foods . •
There is no requirement that food companies test their products for hexane residues ( including soy - based infant formula ) . •
Soy protein isolate and texturized soy protein ( TVP ) are made using hexane baths . •
" The soy protein ingredients in most nonorganic foods such as vegetarian burgers and nutrition bars are processed with the use of hexane . " •
Shocker : " Products such as Clif Bars with the label " made with organic oats and soybeans " are required by law to have 70 % organic ingredients -- the remaining 30 % , however , can legally be hexane extracted .
" Perhaps one of the most shocking realizations in all this is that soybean processing facilities release huge amounts of hexane chemicals into the environment .
It is an unavoidable part of the hexane extraction process , and right nowlike Archer Daniels Midland and Cargill .
Here are more startling facts about the release of hexane chemicals by soybean processing facilities : ( cited fromby the Cornucopia Institute ) ( http://www.cornucopia.org/2009/05/soy-report... )
( Quotation marks indicate a direct quotation from the Cornucopia Institute 's report .
Non-quotation marks indicate paraphrasing of this source . ) •
Soybean processing plants release hexane into both the air and water . •
Hexane is considered by the EPA to be a hazardous air pollutant .
It defines this as airborne compounds " that cause or may cause cancer or other serious health effects , such as reproductive effects or birth defects , or adverse environmental and ecological effects . " •
" In 2007 , the last year for which data is available from the EPA Toxics Release Inventory , grain processors were responsible for more than two - thirds of all hexane emissions in the United States , releasing 21 million pounds of this hazardous air pollutants . " •
A soy processing facility owned by Archer Daniels Midland ( ADM ) in Decatur Illinois reportedly released almost 2 million pounds of hexane into the environment in a single year !
Each year in Illinois , ADM , Cargill , Bunge and other companies release nearly 5 million pounds of hexane into the environment . •
" Solae , a major supplier of soy protein ingredients found in vegetarian burgers , energy bars , and other " all - natural " foods , emitted nearly one million pounds of hexane , as a pollutant , from its factories in Ohio and Illinois .
Its plant in Bellevue , Ohio , is the nation 's seventh largest emitter of hexane , releasing more of this hazardous air pollutant than other major sources such as Exxon Mobil 's oil refinery plant in Baytow , Texas , and Firestone 's tire factory in Orange , Texas . " •
" On August 29 , 2003 , two workers died when hexane gas in a Sioux City , Iowa , soybean processing plant ignited . " •
Hexane explosions have occurred in Italy , Mexico ( 200 dead ) and South Africa , often killing or injuring chemical plant workers . •
In 2001 , a truck carrying 4,500 gallons of hexane caught fire and exploded , injuring the truck driver and setting fire to nearby homes . •
Hexane also poses a serious health danger to workers : " Workers who come in dermal ( skin ) contact with hexane experience immediate irritation characterized by erythema and hyperemia , and they develop blisters after several hours . " •
According to The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) , the permissible exposure level of hexane is 500 parts per million ( ppm ) for workers with 8 - hour exposures .
Exposures of 800 ppm for 15 minutes can cause respiratory tract and eye irritation , as well as symptoms of carnosis .
At higher exposure levels , workers can develop symptoms of nausea , vertigo and headaches . •
" Workers who are chronically exposed to hexane levels ranging from 400 to 600 ppm , with occasional exposures of up to 2,500 ppm , have developed polyneuropathy , a neurological disorder .
In these cases , distal symmetrical muscle weakness is common , and nerve biopsies show nerve damage .
A recently published peer - reviewed article inhypothesizes that occupational exposure to hexane may contribute to the development of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy , a disease that causes loss of vision .
Chronic exposure may also lead to blurred vision , restricted visual field , and optic nerve atrophy . "
( Read more details inat http://www.cornucopia.org/2009/05/soy-report... •
Almost no research has been done to test the toxicity of hexane residues in foods -- not on adults , nor infants . •
" According to EPA reports , small quantities of solvent ( up to 0.2 percent by volume of oil ) can be present in oil after extraction , even after solvent recovery by film evaporators and a distillation stripper .
A Swiss team of scientists tested various oils and found hexane residues in some of the tested oils . " •
Test results from the Cornucopia Institute 's lab tests ( funded in part by Natural News ) : < 10 ppm hexane residues in soy oil .
Soy meal : 21 ppm hexane residues .
Soy grits : 14 ppm hexane residues . •
" Most soy - based infant formulas contain ingredients that have been hexane extracted .
In fact , nearly every major ingredient in conventional soy - based infant formula is hexane extracted .
" As these laboratory tests reveal , hexane residues may be alarmingly widespread across the " natural " foods industry .
In fact , as the Cornucopia Institute reports :
In the United States , there is currently only one way of knowing for sure that the soy - based foods you purchase is free of hexane contaminants : • Beware of claims of " natural " soy --
Even hexane - extracted soy can be called " natural . " •
Beware of claims of " made with organic soy " --
Such products may still contain non-organic soy - based ingredients extracted with hexane . •
Beware of " veggie " products containing texturized vegetable protein .
Many of these products not only likely contain hexane chemical residues ; they also are usually made with , a flavoring ingredient that contains MSG , a neurotoxin .
( Imagine the impact of these two neurotoxins in combination ... ) •
Do n't feed your infant soy protein .
Instead , opt for human breast milk ( the best option ) , or goat 's milk formulas such as Genesis Organics ( www.GenesisOrganics.com ) .
From my point of view , these highly disturbing findings about hexane residues appearing in processed soy products just confirm what we 've known about these food conglomerates for a long time :
Not only are these food companies bathing their soy products in a neurotoxic chemical , , allowing dangerous chemicals to remain prevalent in the food supply while doing virtually nothing to warn consumers or ban the toxic chemical from soy product processing .
Thus ,
We the People once again find ourselves in the position of being .
If that sounds familiar , it 's because this has happened again and again with toxic ingredients ranging from monosodium glutamate and aspartame to sodium nitrite and petrochemical food colorings .
Big Food and the FDA , in fact , almost appear to be conspiring to poison the population ... which just happens to create a windfall of profits for Big Pharma -- the other corporate master of the FDA .
It 's a clever scam : Poison the people with hidden chemicals in the food supply , then when their organs start to fail , drug them on monopoly - priced pharmaceuticals .
Meanwhile , the FDA enforces the whole thing by outlawing ( like raw almonds or raw organic cow's milk ) , thereby forcing people to eat chemically - contaminated processed food .
To put icing on the ( processed ) cake , the FDA allows these companies using toxic chemicals to claim their products are " natural . "
They even allow some health claims for companies using soy in their formulas -- even when that soy has been bathed in hexane !
There is no limit to the insanity of what goes into the food supply when profits are at stake , it seems .
And this use of the toxic solventto process soy that 's used in infant formula , protein bars and " veggie " products is yet another example of whyWhen you grow your own food ( or just buy fresh produce and food staples ) and prepare it in your own kitchen , you know what goes into it .
You also know what 's NOT in it ( such as hexane or melamine ) .
It 's the only sure way to protect yourself and your family from the dangers of processed foods made by food commodity giants that are motivated by money , not concern for your health .
In fact , the attitude about chemical contaminants by many U.S. food giants mirrors the attitude about melamine in infant formula as demonstrated by China 's powdered milk manufacturers : " Ah , what 's a little melamine gonna hurt anyway ?
" But it does hurt .
It hurts your health and harms your children .
There are 10,000 children on dialysis machines in China who can prove it to you .
And that 's why , in my opinion , these companies using hexane - contaminated soy protein in their products deserve to be publicly exposed , heavily fined and perhaps even shut down and run out of business .
Why are companies run out of business whenis found in their peanut butter ( for example ) , but when toxic chemical solvents are found in their soy proteins , the mainstream media says nothing , the FDA does nothing , and the whole world pretends it 's all just business as usual ?
I 'll tell you why .
There is an irrational , false belief that continues to permeate society today , and it 's founded in the lies ofand the reductionist approach to western thinking .
That false belief is that This is the whole thinking behind the widespread use of antibiotics ( which actually promote hospital superbugs ) and the mass fumigation of California almonds ( just to make sure they 're no longer RAW ) .
It 's the reason why raw milk is outlawed , but chemically - contaminated soy milk is legal .
It 's the reason why the FDA views the food supply as safe .
It 's , and virtually every mainstream newspaper , TV station and journalist buys into it .
They think salmonella is deadly dangerous , but MSG , aspartame and sodium nitrite are just fine .
They believe in the lie that chemicals are safe as long as the FDA does n't say anything against them !
But it 's hogwash .
A sterile food supply is a dead food supply .
And dead foods do n't keep people alive for very long .
Hence the slow , torturous death of our aging population .
Our people are notlonger ; they 'relonger !
I say this :
We are headed for a disastrousstemming from the mass chemical contamination of the food supply and the genetic alteration of the human population .

In the mean time , avoid all soy products that are not labeled , and do n't feed yourself or your babies processed soy protein bathed in toxic hexane .

During the first week of swine flu vaccines in New York , most parents ( more than half ! ) chose to keep their kids out of the program .

No mention of longitudinal studies or long - term side effects .
No science at all , really , just rumors and hunches and gut instincts .
This gut - instinct approach served people well for hundreds of thousands of years , but it 's pretty clear that it does n't work in a complex world .

Adding decimal points to our irrationality does n't change much .
The problem with being an amateur scientist is precisely the reason that marketers relish the opportunity to sell to us , the amateurs : we make stupid decisions , easily manipulated by those who might choose to do the manipulation ( on their behalf or on ours ) .
The news here is not that people are irrational , giving too much credence to the dramatic and the local and the short - term ( that 's not news ) , but that people have added a veneer of scientific rationality to their irrational decisions .
Armed with Zagats or internet data or some rumor off Snopes , we act as though now we 're supremely rational choicemakers .
This is one of the problems with breast cancer screening .
It appears to give information , really good information , but in practice , it does n't .
Since the information is vivid , we give it too much credence .
The challenge for people trying to market vaccines or highlight long - term side effects of various consumer choices is that it 's much easier to spread a story about exploding cars or hair falling out than it is to spread a story of ' nothing bad happens ' or ' no one got the swine flu and died ' or ' three years from now , this section of ocean will be dead . '
We prefer the vivid anecdote to the dry and statistically useful fact , which in a complex world , is to our detriment .
PS if I was marketing the swine flu vaccine , I 'd name it after a kid who died last season and put her picture on the release form .
Alas , teaching amateurs like us to be real scientists is going to take a while .
Rome , Italy ( CNN ) -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will remain in the hospital at least " another 36 hours , " his doctor , Alberto Zangrillo , said Monday , following an attack that broke his teeth and fractured his nose .
Berlusconi , 73 , is receiving antibiotics , anti-inflammatory medication and painkillers , the doctor said .
The man accused of hitting the controversial prime minister in the face with a replica of Milan 's cathedral was charged with grievous bodily harm and held overnight , Milan police said .
Massimo Tartaglia was kept in Milan 's San Vittore prison , authorities said .
Under Italian law , police can hold him for up to 48 hours without a judge 's order .
Anti-terrorist prosecutor Armanda Spataro has been assigned to investigate the assault , police said .
The attack at a campaign rally Sunday in Milan left Berlusconi bleeding profusely from his left upper lip and cheek .
He underwent a CAT scan at Milan 's San Raffaele Hospital , and his personal physician , Alberto Sangrillon , recommended more tests be done , Berlusconi spokesman Paolo Buonaiuti told CNN .
Berlusconi was feeling well Monday morning , press aide Marco Ventura told CNN .
When he woke up , he asked for newspapers , reports said .
The suspect has a history of mental illness , according to Milan police .
The suspect 's father said he had never committed a violent act before , Italian media reported .
Berlusconi , a conservative media mogul - turned - politician , has been dogged by allegations of corruption and is the middle of a messy divorce from his second wife .
He was in Milan , his hometown and political base , to stump for a local political ally , and blamed his legal woes on his political opponents during the rally .
Milan police said Berlusconi's attacker hit him with a small metal souvenir replica of the Doumo di Milano , the city 's central cathedral , but it was not immediately clear whether the man swung at the prime minister with the object in his hand or threw it at him .
Defense Minister Ignazio La Russa told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Berlusconi continued to shake hands with supporters for " a couple of minutes " after being hit .
" He remained calm and leaned out the window as he was being driven to the hospital and waved to the crowd , " La Russa said .
Buonaiuti said there was " a lot of confusion " surrounding the assault , but he put some of the blame on Berlusconi 's critics .
" What I can tell you is that there has been such a buildup of hatred toward the premier , and this is not good , " Buonaiuti said .
" This campaign of hatred has been building quite rapidly recently , and I am not surprised that what happened tonight took place . "
Milan police said the man being questioned in connection with the assault was a " mentally unstable " man in his early 40s who had been undergoing psychological treatment for some time .
The man , Tartaglia , is the only person arrested and is believed to have acted alone , they said .
The three - term prime minister faces trial on tax fraud charges after Italy 's top court struck down an immunity law that shielded him from prosecution .
He denies the charges , calling them politically motivated .
And his private life has been in the spotlight since his wife of 19 years , Veronica Lario , filed for divorce in May .
The divorce followed allegations that an Italian businessman hired escorts for the premier and that he had attended the birthday party for an 18 - year - old girl , with whom he has denied having an inappropriate relationship .
Berlusconi remains popular among the Italian public , however , with his approval ratings remaining well over 50 percent .
He won a third term in 2008 , and his conservative coalition has control of both the Italian Chamber of Deputies and the Senate .
CNN 's Hada Messia contributed to this report .
We compromised on single payer by backing a public option , and now we are being asked to compromise the public option with negotiated rates .
In conference , we will likely be asked to compromise negotiated rates with a trigger .
In each and every step of the health care debate , the insurance companies have won .
If they get hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxpayer subsidies , they get to raise their premiums , and increase their co pays and deductibles , while the public is forced to pay for private insurance , then the insurance companies win big .
If this is the best we can do , then it is time to ask ourselves whether the two - party system is truly capable of representing the American people or whether the system has been so compromised by special interests that we ca n’t even protect the health of our own people .
This is a moment of truth for the Democratic Party .
Will we stand for the people or the insurance companies ?

The desire for revenge runs deep in all of us .
Everyone who has ever been wronged has at one time or another felt the urge to strike a counterblow .
Most of us do n’t indulge in this pursuit because we ’ve deemed the cost of getting even too high to justify the benefits gained , yet we revel in thoughts of comeuppances doled out by others .
Such imaginings give us the chance to vicariously experience the joys of retribution , joys we ’re not likely to sample in real life , such as the following :
I ’ve heard that barmaids and cocktail waitresses have a secret for getting rid of obnoxious customers .
Seems they use the eye medication Visine for a little Montezuma ’s revenge .
A few eyedrops in someone ’s drink can apparently leave him sitting on the toilet for the rest of the evening with a nasty case of “ the runs . ”
The “ Visine slipped into the drink ” pay back carries additional appeal because it seems to offer an effective yet harmless form of retaliation that could be easily and furtively administered even by the wimpiest of revenge seekers .
Also , the mental image of an enemy sent hotfooting for the toilet is a hugely satisfying one , especially in a society that views fecal output as something to be ashamed of .
An act of spite that forces the victim into making repeated visits to the john is regarded as not only extremely inconveniencing to him , but degrading as well .
Yet all is not well in revenge land .
While it is true that Visine is readily obtainable ( it ’s an non-prescription eye drop manufactured by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer ) , a drink spiked with it is not a sure - fire means of producing diarrhea in the one unfortunate enough to swallow it , and ingestion of such a concoction is downright dangerous , making this “ harmless ” form of retaliation fraught with hazard .
The active ingredient in Visine eye drops is Tetrahydrozoline HCl 0.05 % .
Swallowing this substance can result in a number of nasty effects , including :
Lowering body temperature to dangerous levels
Making breathing difficult , or even halting it entirely
Blurring vision
Causing nausea and vomiting
Elevating and then dropping blood pressure
Causing seizures or tremors
Sending the ingester into a coma
Pfizer ’s cautions to users of Visine include : “ If swallowed , get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away . ”
In view of the above list , that advice should not be taken lightly .
One thing tetrahydrozoline has not been known to do is to cause sudden onset bouts of severe diarrhea .
Although this belief has been around for decades , and everyone knows someone who knows someone who really did administer a Visine mickey to a deserving miscreant and thereby caused him an immediate serious case of the trots , there ’s no documented evidence the producthas that effect .
Of all the Visine poisoning cases studied by medical observers , we found none that mentioned diarrheal output brought about by the drug .
Yet if Visine does n’t cause diarrhea , it has done things far more terrible .
Drinking it can ( and has ) caused severe depression of the central nervous system .
In 1996 , a two - year - old child who ingested at most 2 to 3 mL of Visine eye drops became dangerously lethargic and unresponsive to every stimulus except deep pain .
Thanks to prompt medical attention the child recovered , but not before enduring intubation and two days ’ worth of mechanically - assisted breathing .
In June 2014 , a 22 - year - old woman named Samantha Elizabeth Unger was arrested in Thurmont , Maryland , and charged with aggravated assault and endangering the welfare of children .
According to police , Unger confessed to poisoning her 3 - year - old son by putting Visine in his water bottle and juice bottle ( the boy was hospitalized several times but survived ) and also causing her 1 - year - old son to fall ill when he accidentally consumed the poisoned drinks she had made for his brother .
In January 2015 Unger pleaded guilty to six counts of aggravated assault of a victim less than six years old and one count of endangering the welfare of a child .
Medical literature reports other cases of small children brought to the brink of crisis by ingestion of tiny amounts of over - the - counter eye drops .
The danger is real , and parents are well advised to keep eye drops away from children .
Yet it is not only toddlers who risk central nervous system shutdown or other dire results if they swallow Visine , as demonstrated by the following examples :
In 1995 an adult customer at a Whole Foods market ( a retail chain of natural and organic foods ) had his wheat - grass smoothie spiked with a bottle of Visine by a clerk intent upon playing a practical joke .
The victim , Rudy Trabanino of Houston , became violently ill and had to be hospitalized for several days with acute pain and a variety of serious medical problems .
The clerk responsible for the act was dismissed , and Whole Foods Market settled out of court with Trabanino for an undisclosed sum after he brought a $ 1 million suit against the store .
suit against the store .
On 17 November 2001 , Damien Kawai , a member of the U.S. Air Force , killed his roommate and fellow airman , Charles Eskew , by strangling the young man , then attempted to conceal the crime by slitting the wrists of the corpse to make the death appear to be a suicide .
Kawai admitted to earlier spiking his roommate ’s beer with Visine , under the belief this would render the doomed man unconscious .
( It actually caused him to vomit and suffer labored breathing . )
In May 2002 , the 19 - year - old Kawai was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Eskew .

In the 19 - year - old Kawai was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Eskew .
In October 2003 , an unnamed Southern California high school student put eye drops in teacher ’s water bottle in an attempt to give his instructor severe diarrhea .
Others in the class who saw the act removed the adulterated beverage before the intended victim could drink it .
The student responsible has been charged with tampering with a drink with intent to cause harm .
In June 2006 , five Wisconsin high school students trying to pull the Visine prank poured about a quarter of a bottle of the eyedrops into a classmate ’s water .
The victim spent several days in the hospital recovering from reactions to the poisoning that included a dangerously low heart rate and blood pressure .
Each of the five “ pranksters ” pleaded no contest to misdemeanor counts of battery and disorderly conduct and received sentences of 18 months ’ probation and 60 hours of community service .
probation and of community service .
Also in June 2006 , Kristine Anzalone served her roommate , Joseph Gentissi Jr. , an iced tea spiked with Visine .
Gentissi experienced vomiting and bleeding from his rectum , and Anzalone eventually agreed to a plea bargain with prosecutors under which she was ordered to pay $ 10,000 in hospital bills , serve three years ’ probation , and obey an order of protection .
In January 2009 , 40 - year - old Tonia L. Peterson of Fair Grove , Missouri , was charged with first - degree assault for dumping half a bottle of eye drops into her husband ’s tea in an attempt to kill her spouse .
When investigators contacted the husband he reported experiencing stomach problems for the past two months , and poison control personnel informed a detective that ingesting too much Visine “ would put a person in a coma with several other serious symptoms . ”
In June 2009 , Denise Moyer of Wells , Vermont , was arrested for third degree assault after police confirmed she ’d spiked a co-worker ’s drink with Visine a few days before the woman became ill and died .
The assault took place on 31 October 2008 at a Halloween party , and on 2 November 2008 , 49 - year - old Marceline Jones of Comstock died of what were then presumed to be natural causes .

The assault took place on 2008 at a Halloween party , and on 2008 , 49 - year - old Marceline Jones of Comstock died of what were then presumed to be natural causes .
In 2012 , 56 - year - old Byron Shull spiked the milk of his 84 - year - old father with Visine drops “ because he thought his dad was mean and wanted to make him pay . ”
Frank
Shull nearly died as a result , spending one month in the hospital and another month in rehab .
In February 2013 , a Pennsylvania court sentenced 33 - year - old Vickie Jo Mills to two to four years in prison for putting eyedrops into her boyfriend ’s drinking water 10 to 12 times , causing him to suffer from nausea , vomiting , blood pressure problems and breathing trouble before blood tests revealed the presence of tetrahydrozoline in his system .
Mills said she wanted her boyfriend to pay more attention to her .
In March 2013 , a 27 - year - old mechanic named Shayne Carpenter was arrested in Grass Valley , California , for putting eye drops in his girlfriend ’s drink after an argument with her , causing her to feel ill .
The girlfriend later discovered that Carpenter had been texting his friends to boast about the eye drops prank and called the police on him .
In April 2015 , a New Jersey high school student was charged with aggravated assault after he allegedly put some Visine drops in a teacher ’s coffee .
The teacher reported feeling ill and was taken to a hospital for treatment .
In October 2019 , a food - service worker at Crater Lake National Park named Christopher Michael Morrison was sentenced to 200 hours of community service and two years ’ probation on misdemeanor assault charges for having put severely sickened two co-workers by putting Visine eyedrops in their water bottles in 2016 .
Revenge seekers still not quite convinced that a Visine mickey finn wo n’t produce the diarrheal results they crave , or that the drinking of such a potion could potentially result in a life - threatening medical crisis in the object of their prank , should consider one final fact : the act of secreting noxious substances in ingestibles for the purpose of bringing harm to others is called poisoning .
It matters not if actual harm results from the attempt — the act itself is enough to land one in the hoosegow .
Oct. 8 , 2009  --
A young man blew his hands off while making homemade high explosives inside his family 's California home , where his mother ran a day care center , law enforcement sources say .
Neo Nazi and anarchist type literature were found in the home , authorities said .
There is no known link at this time to any organized rightwing extremist group .
The sheriff in Riverside , CA said suspect Benjamin Kuzelka , 23 , was also growing marijuana in the home .
A substantial quantity of the high explosive TATP -- used in London bombings and suspected in the current Najiboullah Zazi / alleged New York terror plot case -- has been located at the scene , counter terrorism sources say .
After cordoning off the scene , LAPD bomb technicians placed explosive material in a LAPD " total containment vehicle , " and a bomb technician yelled " fire in the hole " before detonating it .
Officials say there is no relation to any of the ongoing terrorism cases .
Kuzelka is expected to be charged with manufacturing explosives , growing marijuana and child endangerment , since he was mixing the explosives inside the Kuzelka Day Care center run by his mother .
He is currently in the hospital with serious injuries and will be taken to jail upon release .
His brother and mother were also arrested on marijuana charges .
Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) are on their way to the scene .
The FBI says " there is no threat to public safety . "
Phone calls left at the day care center were not immediately returned .
This is the second case involving explosives in Riverside , CA in the past 24 hours .
Another resident was arrested for possession of an explosive device , possession of bomb making material , possession of a firearm and possession of ammunition .
The suspect was booked into the Riverside County Jail and is expected to be arraigned today .
The cases appear to be unrelated .

Advertisement Thousands of people may have died in remote village areas when a powerful earthquake struck Sumatra last week , emergency workers and officials fear .
Some villages were completely destroyed in landslides , with access roads torn apart by the quake preventing medical teams reaching the injured .
Aid is now arriving in Indonesia , but hopes are fading of finding survivors in the worst - hit city of Padang .
More than 1,000 people have died in the city .
About 3,000 others are missing .
Australian , British , Japanese and South Korean rescuers have arrived in Indonesia and the EU and Russia are also sending help .
The 7.6 - magnitude quake devastated a large stretch of Sumatra 's coast
Enlarge Image
But while rescue efforts are still concentrated in Padang , there are serious concerns that it may be too late to save most of those missing , presumed trapped beneath the city 's collapsed concrete buildings .
Instead the focus is shifting to emerging stories of widespread destruction in areas outside the city .
At least 600 people are believed to be missing in villages north of Padang .
" All the houses seem to have been swallowed by earth , " a health ministry official in the village of Pulau Aik told the Associated Press .
Villagers contacted by reporters told of hundreds of people missing in each settlement .
" In my village , 75 people were buried .
There are about 300 people missing from this whole area .
We need tents and excavators to get the bodies but the roads are cut off , " one villager , Ogi Martapela , told Reuters .
WEST SUMATRA QUAKES
First quake struck on Wednesday at 1716 local ( 1016 GMT ) under sea north - west of Padang Second quake followed on Thursday at 0852 local
In pictures : Extent of destruction One Red Cross worker , Testos , told Reuters his team needed medicines , drinking water and clothes to take to those left homeless by the quake .
But access to these areas remains difficult , and few details are known yet of the extent of the destruction or the loss of life .
Local TV stations have begun to reach some of the affected areas , broadcasting images of villages reduced to rubble and tales of villagers without access to clean water .
" We have not received a thing .
We need food , clothes , blankets , milk .
It seems like the government has forgotten about us , " Reuters quoted one woman , Siti Armaini , as saying in Pariaman , 40 km ( 25 miles ) north of Padang .
Hope dwindles
In Padang , witnesses report that the stench of decomposing bodies now hangs over collapsed buildings as rescuers battle to reach survivors .

At the collapsed wreckage of a hotel , rescuers worked frantically on Saturday to find any of eight people thought to have survived Wednesday 's earthquake .
One person trapped in the ruins of the Ambacang Hotel sent a text message to a relative on Friday asking for help , rescuers revealed .
Those trapped were believed to be on what was the 6th floor .
But by mid-afternoon in Padang none of the eight had been located .
The head of a Japanese search and rescue team said his men and dogs had found " no signs of life " .
" Our dogs are trained to smell for living people , not the dead , and they did n't sense anything , " Hidehiro Murase told AP .
' No bureaucracy ' Specialist teams from around the world have begun arriving at co-ordination centres in Padang , waiting to be deployed to the field .
The Red Cross planned to hold a meeting in the city on Saturday to co-ordinate relief efforts .
The priority is to ensure injured survivors receive the medical attention they needed , Red Cross officials say .
Two Australian planes carrying medical personnel and rescue experts have arrived in Padang , with dozens of British firefighters - delayed for 24 hours by a broken - down plane - due to join a 16 - man charity deployment late on Saturday .
As well as the Japanese , a Swiss sniffer - dog team is already on the ground , and Russian and Estonian personnel have all been sent .
Countries around the world have pledged relief funds .
Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has also called for $ 10 m ( £ 6.2 m ) in government aid to be distributed quickly .
" The ... fund has to flow quickly , no more bureaucracy for this , " he said .
" This is an emergency , so speed is crucial . "
Wednesday 's 7.6 - magnitude quake struck off the coast of Padang and caused devastation .
A second quake of 6.8 struck nearby on Thursday causing panic but no reports of damage or casualties .

Yes , they 're perfectly serious .
The film 's pitch line : " Liberty 's march has a new generation of patriots . "
Here 's the cast of characters , including :
NATE : Nate , a young black man from Detroit , Michigan , voted for Barack Obama in 2008 from an upbringing that taught him to mistrust America because of the color of his skin .
As a Libertarian with a paradigm shift and a newfound understanding of the nation he loves , he is risking the anger of family and friends by joining the march against a President ’s policies that would victimize the very people he loves the most .
Translation : Nate , the only relatively sane - seeming black person we could find for the film , whose key role is to help blunt the image of tea parties as an almost purely all - white phenomenon featuring angry white nationalists who have no compunction about carrying racist signs and calling the president a racist .
JACK : Jack is a father of two young children , a little league baseball coach and a health insurance agent .
He risks losing his job under current healthcare reform .
He is a Democrat turned Constitutionalist and the younger brother of a Vietnam veteran who is marching for his children and the future of the America he believes in .
Translation : Even though Jack has a fairly obvious motive for opposing health - care reform , he was included because the filmmakers could n't find a health - insurance lobbyist who could convincingly portray himself as a moderately sympathetic figure .
JENNY BETH : In 2008 , she and her husband lost a multi-million dollar business , were forced into bankruptcy and home foreclosure .
Nine months later , she is working as a national leader in the grassroots tea party movement , organizing events and taking her message to the steps of the National Mall with the company of millions behind her .
Translation : Beth helps provide a portrait of America 's most benighted victims of the Bush administration :
Whole - hog ideological conservatives who made lots of money relying on conservative values ( i.e. , the cutthroat pursuit of profits at the expense of everything else ) and who suddenly lost everything when Bush popped the housing bubble .
The resulting cognitive dissonance -- " OMFG we lost our entire fortune because " conservative values " like a mania for deregulation and cutting taxes for the wealthy caused a near - collapse of the entire economic system !
And now we have to rely on a liberal black man to fix the problem !!!! " -- drove them completely insane , so that now of course they think the solution is to go back and embrace the very policies that destroyed their wealth in the first place .

* Army suicide rate nearly double U.S. national rate
* Many suicides among soldiers who never fought abroad
WASHINGTON , Nov 17 ( Reuters ) - Suicides in the U.S. Army will hit a new high this year , a top general said on Tuesday in a disclosure likely to increase concerns about stress on U.S. forces ahead of an expected buildup in Afghanistan .
The findings , released as President Barack Obama inches toward a decision to send up to 40,000 additional troops to Afghanistan , show the number of active - duty suicides so far in 2009 has already matched last year 's record of 140 deaths .
" We are almost certainly going to end the year higher than last year , " General Peter Chiarelli , the Army 's vice chief of staff , told a Pentagon briefing .
" This is horrible , and I do not want to downplay the significance of these numbers in any way . "
Another 71 soldiers committed suicide after being taken off active duty in 2009 -- nearly 25 percent more than the end - year total for 2008 .
Some had returned home only weeks before taking their own lives .
The figures applied only to the U.S. Army .
Data from other branches of the armed services was not immediately available .
Chiarelli cautioned against generalizing about the causes of the suicides , or assuming links to combat stress on forces stretched thin by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
He said the causes were still unclear and noted that roughly a third of the soldiers who took their own lives had never been deployed abroad .
The Army recently revealed that about one in five lower rank soldiers suffered mental health problems like depression .
The latest data and this month 's shooting spree at a base in Fort Hood , Texas attributed to an Army psychiatrist have raised new questions about the effects of combat stress and the state of the military 's mental health system .
' HARD LOOK '
The Army has announced it would take a " hard look " at itself to discover how accused shooter Major Nidal Malik Hasan , who is charged with killing 13 people in the Nov. 5 rampage , slipped through the cracks .
As the largest branch of the U.S. armed forces with 1.1 million active duty and reserve soldiers , the Army has done the brunt of the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan , including years of extended duty and repeated deployments .
President Barack Obama has said he would hold to account those who missed warning signs , which U.S. officials say included Hasan 's communications with an anti-American cleric in Yemen sympathetic to al Qaeda .
The military 's suicide rate among active - duty soldiers was about 20 per 100,000 , nearly double the national U.S. rate of 11.1 suicides per 100,000 people , as reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Chiarelli said the Army was investigating whether stress related to a future deployment could be a factor in the deaths of soldiers yet to be sent abroad .
He said a study being carried out in conjunction with the National Institute of Mental Health could shed some light .
" The reality is there is no simple answer ... I scrub the numbers every way I possible can , " Chiarelli said , calling for more substance abuse counselors and mental health professionals to detect early signs of mental illness .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The number of Americans receiving food stamp assistance soared above 36 million for the first time in August , the eighth month in a row that enrollment set a record , the U.S. Agriculture Department said on Wednesday .
USDA said 36.492 million people were receiving food stamps , also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program .
In July , enrollment stood at 35.851 million .
At the current rate , an estimated one in eight Americans receive benefits .
The program , which helps poor people buy food , has seen enrollment jump by 4.707 million during 2009 amid a lingering economic downturn in the United States .
Participation grew by 2 million people from May to August .
In the latest data , the average person received $ 132.99 in August , compared with $ 101.31 in August 2008 .

Perhaps the greatest treasure in the recent MacHeist nanoBundle ( which was covered by Simon in a recent post ) is ShoveBox .
It ’s a clippings organizer that lets you capture , view , organize and edit data that is elegant in its simplicity .
This very usable application resides in the menubar , making it accessible at all times regardless of what application you are using .
Capture Information in ShoveBox
Living online , we can get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of “ stuff ” that we need to keep track of — URLs , images , notes , quotes , snippets of information , the list goes on .
With ShoveBox , you can easily capture all of that stuff into the application and keep it organized and easy to find when you need it .
It ’s designed to fit effortlessly into your workflow , making it ideal for users who are n’t productivity or organizational ninjas .
For example , you can quickly capture images from your Mac ’s iSight Camera .
Another capture option is QuickJot , which lets you speedily add your own notes into ShoveBox through a user - definable hotkey .
While QuickJot notes do n’t have the tagging and Source URL fields like Evernote , ShoveBox is n’t designed to be a full - blown note - taking application .
QuickJot is for capturing notes on the fly .
ShoveBox also lets you capture data from the clipboard — it ’s really easy to use and a great way to capture snippets of text you want to keep .
Organize Information in ShoveBox
ShoveBox does n’t force you to use any organizational mantra or fad , so novice users can be organized and productive from the get - go .
It has a simple set of organizational tools ( folders , flags and labels ) that you can set up and use as you wish .
You also have the option to export textual data to text , RTF , and Word files , and images to BMP , TIFF , JPG and PNG .
ShoveBox for iPhone
After checking out ShoveBox as part of the bounty from the MacHeist nanoBundle , I was happy to see there was an iPhone application — I was lucky enough to snag it while it was on sale .
ShoveBox for iPhone lets you sync up with ShoveBox on your desktop via Wi-Fi and have full access to all your clippings while on the go .
If you missed the MacHeist nanoBundle , you can obtain ShoveBox directly from WonderWarp Software .
It costs $ 24.95 for a full license with a 30 - day trial available .
The ShoveBox Mobile application is available from the iTunes App Store for $ 3.99 .

U - Test has just completed a substantive , independent review of three major e-tailing sites — and found a gaping security hole in one of them .
U - Test retains a stable of 21,000 professional testers from 159 countries available to run any website through the paces .
As part of its marketing efforts , U - Test has been running a once - a- quarter contest by which its testers can earn cash testing certain groupings of online services .
In this case , uTest paid 600 software professionals from 20 countries to click away at Amazon , Walmart.com and Target.com , then rank the e-tailers based on best pricing , ease of use , product search capacity , reviews and ratings and product comparison tools .
The consensus : Amazon is more bug - free and user - friendly than rivals Walmart.com and Target.com .
But uTesters also discovered a cross -site scripting vulnerability at one of the three major sites .
Johnston declined to name the e-retailer , noting that uTest has notified the retailer about the security hole .
“ Only one of the sites had a security issue , but it ’s our practice to reach out to the site owner and not disclose who it is , ” he says .
Johnston said the vulnerability was of the type that would “ allow ( user ) accounts to be taken over ” and give an intruder full access to “ all of the sensitive information in the account . ”
Cross -site scripting vulnerabilities show up when Web apps fail to validate user input from form fields .
Attackers can embed their own script into a page the user is visiting to purposefully manipulate the behavior or appearance of the page .
Malicious attacksÃ‚Â are limited only by the attacker ’s imagination , as LastWatchdog described in this 31 Mar2008 USA Today story .
Most often attackers will create a specially - crafted Web link , and then entice a visitor into clicking to it , via spam , Facebook messages , Tweets , etc. — another reason why bad URLs are proliferating .
The user is more likely to be tricked to clicking on the link , since it ’s from a trusted company .
It would be interesting to see uTest turn its testers loose on other security - related reviews .
Suggestions welcomed .

This essay offers respite to all the people who confront our collective energy problems with a furrowed brow and an expression that is puzzled by the continuous stream of theoretical insights that explain our current circumstances .
This essay confronts our collective energy problems in more practical terms - with an adjustable spanner and a puncture repair kit at the very least .
Many of the articles that discuss the causes and effects of humanity 's unprecedented energy use are entirely theoretical , offering little practical guidance for the everyday reader .
Be the change poster seen on a bicycle in York
2. Target audience
3 . Why should you set up a bicycle repair company ?
Petrol exploding in an internal combustion engine ’s combustion chambers exerts a force on the pistons inside the bonnet of a car .
Kerosene igniting inside a turbofan combustion chamber expands , spinning the jet turbines and thrusting the oxidised waste products out the back .
For every 1 kg of fuel burned , a typical commercial jet engine produces 3.16 kg of CO2 , 10 g of NO2 , and 1 - 3.5 g of CO , all important greenhouse gases ( Brasseur et al. , 1998 ) .
Hydrogen molecules in natural gas ( CH4 ) react with nitrogen in the Haber - Bosch process , creating nitrate fertiliser that improves the yield of the world 's industrial agricultural systems .
The food derived from farming may eventually end up metabolized in a human body , in order to power leg muscles to walk or push pedals .
If you are young of heart and pioneering of spirit , this article is aimed at you .
If you sometimes think about forming a small company in response to unprecedented global circumstances - the prospect of terminal declines in oil production and a changing climate - I suggest that you need to read this condensed chunk of knowledge , especially if you enjoy riding a bicycle and can operate a spanner .
Rich people ( anyone earning more than $ 20,000 a year is rich , regardless of what their neighbours may think ) burn ~ 200 kWh of primary chemical energy each day .
Of this 70 kWh is converted into transport ( MacKay , 2009 : Chapter 3 and Chapter 5 ) .
( 70 kWh equates to 30 miles in a 30 mpg car burning 40 kWh of gasoline and one long haul flight burning 30 kWh / day of kerosene , averaged over the year . )
Conversion processes for transport include :
All of these processes depend on fossil fuels that are running out .
Thus , a good reason to set up a bicycle repair company is that , despite the lengthy food chain , cycling is the most efficient of the above methods of converting fossil fuels into personal locomotion ( especially if you eat well ) .
A typical US car consumes 100 kWh of chemical energy per 100 passenger Km ( 24 miles per gallon ) , a plane 50 kWh and a bicycle 2.4 kWh – the bicycle is 50 times more efficient , ignoring the energy costs of production of the car or the food ( MacKay , 2009 , 2009 ) . [ 1 ]
Another reason for setting up a bicycle repair company may be to make money .
Cycling is a strong growth industry globally .
There are more bikes than cars in the world and thousands of these cycles are sat in garages in various states of disrepair .
Bike repair is labour intensive , uses few resources , and provides people with a new form of transport .
If you are a bike mechanic and operate a fair business in your area , you may become a valued member of your local community , especially if fuel becomes scarce .
4 . Why you should not set up a bicycle repair business
Is there demand for bike repairs in your area ?
( Test this by offering a ‘ Dr Bike ’ free session , or create demand through advertising / collaboration with local government )
Can you fix bikes ?
( Put yourself to the test by fixing as many bikes as you can – fix those of friends , family and acquaintances ; work / volunteer in a local bike shop ; get an official qualification )
Will you be offering something new in your area ?
( If there is already a good bike shop or mechanics – collaborate with them unless they are not interested )
Before diving in , consider your circumstances and the nature of the local economy where you live .
If the answer to the following questions is no , setting up a bicycle repair company may not be such a good idea :
Do not give up if you cannot say yes to all the questions .
Bike repair should not be seen as a short - term money spinner like a trendy new Internet company during the dot - com boom .
Bicycle repair is inevitably a social activity where you will slowly build up a network of friends and fellow cyclists who trust your abilities .
But this growth will only occur in proportion with your bike repair skills : try to go too fast and you may have problems .
Therefore when the answer to any of the questions is a ' maybe ' instead of a definitive ' yes ' perhaps you should consider abandoning the profit motive altogether , especially in the first few months or years .
Remember , every time you look at a bike , or help someone else to fix one , you are gaining something priceless : important knowledge and skills that can be bought only with time .
In my experience , the reward of fixing someone 's bike for free is the satisfaction of providing them with increased independence from cars , money and petroleum .
An option I highly recommend is volunteering for a community bike project or helping an experienced bike mechanic – that way you will learn more quickly and support a good cause .
The altruism and goodwill mentioned above does not mean you should never make money from fixing bikes .
By contrast , the warm glow generated from free repairs on both sides of the equation may become one of the central selling points of your business .
You may also need money in order to invest in better tools and equipment .
RobRod 's repairs overcame this problem with a £ 500 grant from a small entrepreneurs organisation .
This highlights the low startup costs of bike repair industries and the possibility of acquiring funding from sources acting in the public interest .
5 . What you ’ll need
Tools are the most important work items a bike mechanic owns .
Good tools will last decades , and it is possible to grow an affinity to tools that are used frequently .
Low - quality tools can provide a cheap solution to infrequent problems , but may become a burden when they fail .
For this reason , I recommend investing in high quality tools right from the beginning , as they will make bike repair more enjoyable .
I have found it useful to divide my tools into two groups – one group I always bring with me , and another that I leave at home unless I know they will be used .
Frequently used tools , in rough order of frequency of use ( Figure 1 ) :
Allen keys ( known as hex keys in the USA )
An adjustable spanner with a range up to 20 mm +
Decent metal tire levers – could save you much time and effort
8 mm spanner – used frequently on older bikes
10 mm spanner – receives very frequent use
13 mm spanner – for adjusting seat height
15 mm spanner – the most common wheel nut size
15 mm pedal spanner – simple a thin , sturdy 15 mm spanner
Philips and flat - head screwdrivers – medium and small sizes
Pliers
Chain tool – essential for fixing chains
Spoke keys - 3.23 mm , 3.30 mm and 3.45 mm keys will fit practically all spoke nipples
15 mm and 17 mm cone spanners are frequently needed for hub servicing
Crank extractor
14 mm socket wrench
Cable cutters – essential for replacing worn cables
Plumber wrench or 30 , 32 , and 36 mm spanners for adjusting old headsets
Figure 1 : Frequently used tools
Infrequently used tools , best used in a work shop :
Shimano freewheel and cassette removers ( other , less commonly used removers exist )
Bottom bracket tool – for the Shimano 20 tooth BB cups common on newer bikes
Bottom bracket lockring
Hook spanner – for the majority of older BBs
Hack saw
Many specialized tools such as BB thread chaser , headset race hammer and truing jigs exist .
Because of the cost of these tools , they are not accessible to most amateur bike mechanics .
By working or volunteering in an established workshop , it may be possible to use these tools .
Along with the tools there are a number of items that are used in bicycle repair .
These can be split into essential and useful items .
Essential items for basic bike maintenance :
Lubricant is necessary to make bikes perform better .
Mineral oil is the cheapest and most widely available lubricant .
A few drops added to chains or oxidised cables can make a bicycle more pleasant to ride at virtually no cost .
Grease is necessary for servicing hub , headset and and bottom - bracket bearings , although I rarely use grease for minor repairs .
A light , squirtable lubricant is extremely useful for penetrating inaccessible components and removing handlebar grips .
A high quality pump is essential for inflating tires to the correct pressure ( 40 - 80 psi is correct for most bikes , although one should always check the recommended pressure on the outer tire ) .
As well as having gauges , track pumps require less effort to pump - up tires than do hand pumps .
Puncture repair kits are crucial .
There are many types on the market , and can be acquired at low cost .
Spare inner tubes – there comes a time when puncture repairs are no longer sufficient to fix a leaky inner tube .
Presta ( thin ) and Schrader ( thick ) tires are the main categories , although many diameters and thicknesses are available
A bicycle work stand is near - essential if you do frequent repairs .
Lightweight and compact models are available for the mobile bike mechanic .
Spare inner cables – there are different types of both gear and brake cables , so make you get the right ones
Spare outer cables – gear and brake cables are different .
Buying in bulk ( e.g. 30 m ) yields significant economies of scale and will allow you to share with buddies .
Cable tidies – allow you to finish your cable repairs with a safe and attractive finish .
Spare outer tires – will come in useful but are costly ( if bought new ) and bulky .
Pannier racks and baskets – these can greatly increase the utility of a bicycle .
Other useful items :

Figure 3 : The whole mobile repair kit ready to go
6 . How to set up
Setting up shop can be as simple as that .
However , it is highly recommended that you get public liability insurance before doing repairs for people you do not know .
Personal experience leads me to recommend keeping bureaucracy to a minimum in the early stages , although it may be necessary to keep detailed logs if the project grows into a full - scale company .
It is possible to set up shop just with a bike trailer , tools and a work stand , and preferably another bike mechanic for support .
This was found to be an enjoyable and profitable option for RobRod ’s repairs when we would set - up on the University of York campus on sunny afternoons ( Figures 4 - 7 ) .
Having a workshop as base of operations is highly desirable , but can be expensive .
One solution is to work in collaboration with a local bike shop in the area , or to set up a bike co-operative if you have the time and experience .
The potential to expand may grow as global oil production shrinks , but the key is to start small and master the art of walking before you begin to run .

The advantages of being a mobile mechanic : more business and more old bicycle donations
7. Conclusion
Bicycle repair is a practical activity that can empower individuals and communities to tackle energy - related problems with their own initiative and skill – without recourse to state intervention or mass social change .
The increased usage of bikes that small - scale industries such as RobRod 's Repairs induces is likely to lead to broader change relating to localisation and shifting attitudes towards energy and the local environment .

Appendix
The late Sheldon Brown has created the best website on bicycle repair available .
There are many second hand books available on bicycle repair on Amazon .
www.jakesbikes.co.uk is a bike business set up for the greater good ; it inspired me to become an amateur bike mechanic .
Your best resource will be the real human beings who you work with to fix bikes .

Even assuming the bicycle rider is powered by typical US food – an unhealthy choice requiring 10 units of fossil energy input for every one unit out ( Pollan , 2006 ) – he would still consume 5 times less fossil energy per km travelled than the car driver .
One could argue that the increased usage of a shower to cleanse the sweaty rider would offset this energy gain .
However the argument is spurious for a number of reasons :
KUALA LUMPUR , Malaysia —
This cup of joe will keep you up all night .
Malaysian authorities have confiscated 900 boxes of coffee laced with Viagra , a newspaper report said Sunday .
Health Ministry officials raided a company in Kuala Lumpur that marketed the coffee as an energy booster , The New Straits Times said .
The report did not say whether the package labeled Viagra as an ingredient .
Sunday 's report said the 900 confiscated boxes containing some 9,000 coffee packets were worth more than 72,000 ringgit ( $ 20,000 ) .
Some of the Viagra - laced coffee had been distributed nationwide , it said .
Viagra is legal in Malaysia , but it requires a prescription .
The drug helps men get an erection , but it can pose a heart hazard , especially when taken with certain medications .
The report quoted an unnamed Health Ministry official .
A ministry spokesman could not immediately confirm the report Sunday .
PARIS / SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - A new email client unveiled by Mozilla this week contains code from an unusual source -- the French military , which decided the open source product was more secure than Microsoft ’s rival Outlook .

The story of how the French government became involved with the open source movement , which has transformed much software around the world from proprietary to free , goes back six years .
France ’s military chose open source software after an internal government debate that began in 2003 and culminated in a November 6 , 2007 , directive requiring state agencies “ Seek maximum technological and commercial independence . ”
The military found Mozilla ’s open source design permitted France to build security extensions , while Microsoft ’s secret , proprietary software allowed no tinkering .
“ We started with a military project , but quickly generalized it , ” said Lieutenant - Colonel Frederic Suel of the Ministry of Defense and one of those in charge of the project .
The Gendarmerie Nationale police , which was part of the military at the time and did the design , released some of its work to the public under the name “ TrustedBird , ” and co-branded it with Mozilla .
The military uses Mozilla ’s Thunderbird mail software and in some cases the Trustedbird extension on 80,000 computers and it has spread to the ministries of Finance , Interior and Culture .
LINUX ALSO WINS ACCEPTANCE
The French government is beginning to move to other open source software , including Linux instead of Windows and OpenOffice instead of Microsoft Office .
The non -profit groups that make most such programs , including Samba server programs and Mozilla ’s best - known product , the Firefox Web browser , depend on volunteer programmers around the world .
Thunderbird 3 used some of the code from TrustedBird , as well as drawing on 1,000 other computer geeks and users around the world .
“ The primary changes ( the military ) have made allow them to know for sure when messages have been read , which is critical in a command - and - control organization , ” said David Ascher , chief executive of Mozilla Messaging .
That qualifies it for NATO ’s closed messaging system , and the French military has shown TrustedBird to NATO , military officials said .
The French military is “ helping build an ecosystem of specialists around the world that provide specialized add - ons , leveraging our platform to help meet customer needs , ” Mozilla ’s Ascher said .
The result is a product that is compatible with Yahoo ! mail , Google Gmail and other email systems , but competes against Microsoft Outlook .
Some observers said the original decision to go to open source was in part to show the French public that the government was trying to save money .
But many software experts say free software also has its costs and the French acknowledged that .
“ It is never completely free , ” said Col. Bruno Poirier - Coutansais of the information technology team Gendarmerie Nationale .
New software requires the re-training of information technology specialists .
Experts point out that it also requires employees to learn to use the software .
Poirier - Coutansais said there was initial reluctance to embrace Thunderbird “ because it is less reassuring than to have a renowned company that can bring quality support . ”
Microsoft has platoons of technicians in France at a state - of - the - art glass building in a western suburban business district emblazoned with the company logo , while Mozilla , with 10 employees in an anonymous concrete colored residential building , is distant from Paris ’s business districts .
Nonetheless , the French government is now pleased with the results .
Suel said they may move beyond government , because Trusted Bird ’s security extensions make it “ transposable to large international companies . ”
One expert was less certain of that .
“ The professional market is showing more resistance to open source software , ” said Bernard - Louis Roques , chief executive of Truffle Capital IT , an investment fund specializing in software .
Lawmakers have said they expect the issue to be brought up shortly after the Nov. 3 election .
Democratic Gov. Corzine has said he would sign a law making New Jersey one of a handful of states to recognize same - sex marriage .
Climate change help for the poor ' has not materialised '
Large sums promised to developing countries to help them tackle climate change cannot be accounted for , a BBC investigation has found .
Rich countries pledged $ 410 m ( £ 247 m ) a year in a 2001 declaration - but it is now unclear whether the money was paid .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has accused industrialised countries of failing to keep their promise .
The EU says the money was paid out in bilateral deals , but admits it cannot provide data to prove it .
MONEY PAID INTO UN FUNDS Least Developed Countries Fund Received $ 155.4 m Biggest donor : Germany $ 34.6 m Special Climate Change Fund Received $ 104.1 m Biggest donor : UK $ 18.6 m Source : Global Environment Facility ( figures at 30/9/09 )
Q&A : Climate cash controversy
What 's your climate solution ?
The money was pledged in the 2001 Bonn Declaration , signed by 20 industrialised nations - the 15 countries that then made up the European Union , plus Canada , Iceland , New Zealand , Norway and Switzerland .
They said they would pay $ 410 m per year until 2008 .
The date the payments were meant to start is unclear , but the total should be between $ 1.6bn and $ 2.87bn .
The declaration said : " We are prepared to contribute $ 410 m , which is 450 million euro , per year by 2005 with this level to be reviewed in 2008 . "
But only $ 260 m has ever been paid into two UN funds earmarked for the purpose , the BBC World Service investigation has found .
" There have been promises which have not been fully materialised .
There is an issue of trust , " says Ban Ki-moon .
The question of finance for developing countries to tackle climate change is one of the keys to a deal at the Copenhagen summit next month .
Poor countries may not sign up to a new agreement unless they trust rich countries to keep their promises , and are satisfied with the mechanisms put in place to handle the flow of funds .
Unequal sums
The industrialised governments which drew up the Bonn Declaration say they never intended to put the money just into the UN funds .
CASE STUDY , LIBERIA Liberia on Africa 's west coast is in desperate need of help .
The rising sea level and longer rainy season are eroding the coastline and causing flooding .
Homes have been swept away and lives lost .
Amma Ennim 's home was damaged for the first time last year .

The sea was rough .
I could feel the shaking of the house .
The whole roof lifted off .
The water forced its way in .
[ It ] took half of the house . "
The sea now regularly enters her home .
The Liberian government is appealing to the international community for help building sea defences for its major cities .
Liberians face rising flood threat The Declaration allowed them to spend it in " bilateral and multilateral " ways , they say .
Artur Runge - Metzger , the senior climate change negotiator for the European Union , maintains the EU has lived up to its end of the bargain .
" We can say we met the promise , climate finance has really been stepped up , " he argues .
However he admits the EU cannot provide data to show it did pay the money through these bilateral and multilateral means .
" It 's sometimes very hard to say what is the climate bit of this financing , " he says .
Richard Myungi , a climate change negotiator for the Least Developing Countries says : " We feel frustrated , we feel betrayed . "
Boni Biagini , who runs the UN funds , also believes much more money should have been paid in .
" These numbers do n't match the $ 410 m per year .
Otherwise , we'd be handling billions of dollars by now , " he says .
Confusion CLIMATE CHANGE GLOSSARY
Glossary in full Dr Marc Pallemaerts , who drafted the Bonn Declaration in 2001 when he was the deputy chief of staff for the European Union 's Belgian Presidency , admits some developing countries may have been led to believe the promised money would go solely into the UN funds .
" Some countries may have been genuinely misled - others knew it was deliberate ambiguity , " he maintains .
The Bonn Declaration is surrounded by confusion and has led to mistrust between developed and developing countries .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says any new financing agreement signed at Copenhagen must be clear .
" This whole agreement and negotiation should be based on trust and confidence , " he says .
He adds that any new financing deal must be " measurable , reportable and verifiable " .
Should rich countries agree a new deal to help developing nations ?
What kind of deal would you strike at Copenhagen ?

The Urban Cursor was an art project that was shown off at the Festival Ingravid in Spain in September , it is basically a giant cursor that people could sit on , or move around , it had a built in GPS tracker which transmitted its location to Google Maps .
Despite being removed from its normal screen based environment , the cursor was still in touch with the digital world .
Via an embedded GPS device , the cursor transmitted its geographic coordinates to a website .
At the website , the coordinates were mapped in Google Maps thereby documenting the cursor ’s movements in the physical world and making it possible for participants to see how they collectively helped move the object around .
During the festival participants could also upload photos of the cursor at the website .
The photos were automatically placed on the map by matching the photos ’ digital time stamp with the GPS coordinates .
Libya 's leader Muammar Gaddafi attends the Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) Food Security Summit in Rome November 16 , 2009 .

ROME ( Reuters ) - Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , in Rome for a U.N. food summit , spent several hours in the company of 200 Italian women recruited by an agency and tried to convert them to Islam , Italian media reported Monday .
“ Seeking 500 attractive girls between 18 and 35 years old , at least 1.70 meters ( 5 foot , 7 inches ) tall , well - dressed but not in mini-skirts or low cut dresses , ” read the ad by the Hostessweb agency and quoted in Italy ’s Corriere dell Sera newspaper in its story .
Some 200 women showed up at a Rome villa , having been told they would receive 60 euros ( $ 90 ) and “ some Libyan gifts . ”
Among them was an undercover reporter for Italian news agency ANSA , who took photos and described the evening ’s proceedings .
Most had expected to attend a party , according to ANSA , but instead were invited to wait in a large hall until the arrival of Gaddafi , who gave them a lesson on Libya and the role of women in Islam .
After around two hours the lesson , including questions and answers through an interpreter , concluded with an exhortation by Gaddafi to “ convert to Islam ” and with each woman given a copy of the Koran and a book of sayings by Gaddafi .
“ It was anything but the VIP party we were expecting , they did n’t even give us a glass of water , ” one woman told ANSA .
Others said they were offended by what they considered anti-Christian aspects of his lesson , including a claim that Jesus was not crucified but that “ someone who looked like him ” was put to death in his place .
The Libyan ambassador told ANSA that Gaddafi was planning other similar evenings during his three - day stay for the summit .

I am told by people I respect that Barack Obama cannot pull out of both Iraq and Afghanistan without becoming a one - term president .
I think that may be true .
The charges from various quarters would be toxic — that he was weak , unpatriotic , sacrificing the sacrifices that have been made , betraying our dead , throwing away all former investments in lives and treasure .
All that would indeed be brought against him , and he could have little defense in the quarters where such charges would originate .
These are the arguments that have kept us in losing efforts before .
They are the ones that made presidents Kennedy , Johnson , and Nixon pass on to their successors in the presidency the draining and self - lacerating Vietnam War .
They are the arguments that made President George W. Bush pass on two wars to his successor .
One of the strongest arguments for continued firing up of these wars is that none of these presidents wanted to serve only one term ( even Lyndon Johnson , who chose not to run for a second full term ) .
But what justification is there for buying a second presidential term with the lives of hundreds or thousands of young American men and women in the military ?
I have great hopes for the Obama presidency , even in his first term , and especially if he could have two terms to realize the exciting new things he aspires to do in the White House .
But I would rather see him a one - term president than have him pass on another unwinnable war to the person who will follow him in office .
I know how difficult it will be to withdraw from Iraq and Afghanistan .
We go into these places , now , trailing baggage of a deadly sort .
There are more hired American contractors in both nations than there are military personnel .
What to do with these unaccountable and corrupt bands ?
We have farmed out so many of our national duties that the contractors , like our banks , have grown too big to be dealt with .
Who is to guard our soldiers if not our mercenary bodyguards ?
But we had a thousand soldiers wounded in the last three months — a quarter the number of wounded since 2001 .
These include many lives shattered forever .
We sink deeper into blood , with no foreseeable end in sight .
Qualified reporters and military officials foresee another ten years in Afghanistan — and their projections usually err on the short side .
The American people now oppose the war , and it is folly to keep up a war without support back home .
We will hear predictions of dire consequences if we do n’t carry out a commitment , and do n’t yield to demands of the military to expand forces .
We heard that for years about Vietnam .
But when we did withdraw , the consequences were not as fatal as those we incurred during the years that saw the deaths of over 50,000 of our soldiers and many more Vietnamese .
Some leader has to break the spell before costs mount further while our wars are passed from president to president .
Among other things , this will give our military a needed chance to repair the wear and tear on men and equipment that the overstretched regular services and the National Guard have suffered , and to make them ready for other challenges .
It is unlikely that we will soon have another president with the moral and rhetorical force to talk us out of a foolish commitment that cannot be sustained without shame and defeat .
If it costs him his presidency , what other achievement can match it ?
During his presidential campaign , Barack Obama said he would rather be a one - term president than give up on his goals .
Here is a goal no other president we can imagine would have a possibility of reaching .
Presidents who just kick the can down the road are easy to come by .
Lost lives and limbs are not .
I 've been selected as one of the Top 8 in this year 's Unlock Xbox contest .
What this means is that out of 1500 entries , my game idea , The Artifact , has been selected as one of the eight best .
Now it 's up to America to vote in the Top 3 , through Xbox Live and the Unlock Xbox website .
You do have to register , but after that every vote you place earns you a chance at winning a 360 .
A new 360 is given out each day , and you can vote once a day , so you get 30 chances at winning a 360 if you vote every day .
If you have a 360 , you can actually vote twice a day , one on the site and once on Xbox Live , giving you 60 chances at winning a 360 .
This whole thing started on October 1st , my twenty - third birthday .
I was playing 360 with my brother when I spotted an ad for the Unlock Xbox contest .
I switched the display over to my computer , checked out the rules , and decided this was my chance to get my idea out there .
The only problem was I had 3 days to do it in because the contest ended on the 4th .
I knew there was no time to waste so I grabbed my sketch pad , and my Wacom Tablet , and I got to work .
I was literally working 10 hour days to get this thing done , most of which was spent drawing diagrams frame by frame .
I put everything I had into my two minute pitch and it paid off because I made the Top 10 .
The Top 10 ?
Did n't I say Top 8 earlier ?
Well , we started with 10 .
Doritos actually flew all 10 of us out to Seattle , all expenses paid , they loaded us up with prizes and best of all gave us the chance to pitch our idea to industry insiders .
You can see my pitch at the link , as well as the judges reaction to my pitch .
After all ten of us pitched our ideas , two of us were eliminated .
And that 's how we ended up with eight .
Seattle was amazing , I could probably write a book about those 4 days .
I ate food I 've never had , I played games I 've always wanted to play in the Arcade ( most notably F - Zero AX ) , and best of all I met 10 great people who are also passionate about games .
Honestly , everyone was really cool and all of the finalists were extremely nice people .
We all stuck together and helped each other out , this was definitely not a cut throat competition .
As I said throughout " Solidarity man , it 's all about solidarity " .
Every vote counts , and every vote is appreciated .
You can vote at the website and on Xbox Live .
I would encourage you to check out all the pitches and really decide which games you 'd like to play because the Top Two get their games made and everyone on Xbox Live gets to download them for free off XBLA , so it 's in your best interest to pick something you like .
I 'd love it if you dig my idea and you want to vote for me , but definitely give all of them consideration .
So yeah , right now I 'm kind of in shock seeing my whole thing up on the website for people to see , so I 'm probably leaving a ton out .
If you guys have any questions about the contest or about my game idea , post them up here and I 'll answer them for you .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Pointing an accusing finger at the United States , the Palestinians on Sunday said Washington ’s backing for Israeli refusal to halt Jewish settlement expansion had killed any hope of reviving peace negotiations soon .

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , buoyed by new - found support from the Obama administration , urged the Palestinians to “ get a grip ” and drop their settlement freeze precondition for restarting talks suspended since December .
On a one - day Middle East visit on Saturday , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton endorsed Israel ’s view that settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank should not be a bar to resuming negotiations -- contradicting the Palestinian position .
Netanyahu has proposed limiting building for now to some 3,000 settler homes already approved by Israel in the West Bank .
He does not regard building in occupied East Jerusalem , annexed in defiance of international opposition , as settlement .
U.S. President Barack Obama himself , after persuading Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in September to meet Netanyahu in New York , called only for “ restraint ” in settlement , not the “ freeze ” he had previously proposed .
Stung by Obama ’s about - face and Clinton ’s remarks , the Palestinians voiced their frustration .
“ The negotiations are in a state of paralysis , and the result of Israel ’s intransigence and America ’s back - pedaling is that there is no hope of negotiations on the horizon , ” Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah said .
He said the Palestinians were calling for the Arab League to formulate a “ unified Palestinian - Arab position ” on the stalled peace process .
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said it was a “ critical moment ” and insisted settlement must halt to revive peace moves .
“ Pressuring Palestinians to make further concessions to accommodate Israeli intransigence is not the answer , ” he said .
Netanyahu told his cabinet that U.S. envoy George Mitchell would continue efforts on Sunday to revive negotiations .
“ We hope very much that the Palestinians will get a grip and engage in the diplomatic process , ” Netanyahu said .
“ It is in the interests of Israel and the Palestinians . ”
DOMESTIC PRESSURE
Abbas faces intense domestic pressure from Hamas Islamists who control the Gaza Strip , and any compromise on settlements could hurt him politically in a run-up to Palestinian elections he has scheduled for January 24 .
Hamas has rejected holding a vote .
Some 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem alongside 2.8 million Palestinians .
Israel captured the territories in a 1967 war with its Arab neighbors .
Palestinians say settlements could deny them a viable state .
Netanyahu ’s coalition , including pro-settler groups , does not believe Abbas is strong enough to deliver Israeli security in any deal .
Some analysts see Netanyahu ’s cooperation with Obama ’s demand for a resumption of talks on establishing a Palestinian state as intended mainly to ensure U.S. support against Iran .
Palestinians warn that popular frustration with the failure to produce statehood deal could spill over into an upsurge in violence , even if few have appetite for a broad new uprising .
George Giacaman , a political analyst at Birzeit University in the West Bank said , “ The Palestinian Authority is weak and has not been achieving any results .
“ I believe we are at a dangerous stage .
With no credible political process , this could create a political vacuum that might lead to violence . ”
Nadir Saeed , at the same institution , said Abbas had little option but to try and keep talking with Israel and the Americans , adding : “ It is no better for him to come back to his public empty - handed .
“ ( Abbas ) has built his career on the idea of negotiations .
He can not credibly back away . ”
Greece is trying to reassure markets about its economy
The Greek prime minister has unveiled a series of spending cuts , warning that the country is at risk of " sinking under its debts " .
George Papandreou said the planned cuts would include a 10 % cut in both social security spending , and overall government operating expenditures .
Calling for national unity , he vowed to reduce Greece 's public deficit from the current 12 % to under 3 % by 2013 .
He also announced a 90 % tax on the bonuses of senior bank workers .
ANALYSIS Malcolm Brabant , BBC correspondent in Athens .
This was a speech that was designed to appease international markets and European central bankers .
Mr Papandreou said there were certain moments in the history of a nation when the choices made defined the time to come .
Today was such a moment he said .
Then he announced what the government described as sweeping structural reforms .
These included a 10 % reduction in both government operating expenditures and social security expenditure .
Mr Papandreou 's Socialist government will try to convince the unions and opposition political parties that the cuts he has proposed are in the national interest .
The Conservatives are likely to concur , but left - wing groupings have already indicated that they will fight the government .
Other proposals include a cut in defence spending , pay and hiring freezes for public sector workers , and the closure of a third of Greece 's overseas tourism offices .
" We must change or sink , " said Mr Papandreou , in a speech to business and union leaders .
He added that Greece had " lost every trace of credibility " and the country had to " move immediately to a new social deal " .
Indicating that some spending cuts would be painful , he said that " we must all lose our comfort " .
' Not Iceland ' Mr Papandreou 's comments come a week after international ratings agency Fitch downgraded the country 's credit rating - meaning that it thought Greece was now a riskier place to invest .
Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou earlier defended Greece 's position in the eurozone , despite its deficit being far above the European Union limit of 3 % .
He said Greece was worthy of its place because it " abides by the rules " and was " not the only eurozone country with a deficit of that order " .
Mr Papaconstantinou told the BBC : " Greece is not the next Iceland , nor is it the next Dubai ... it is tackling the very serious situation that we have .
" It is doing it with specific measures that cut expenditure and increase government revenue and also it is a government which is immediately tackling long - term structural problems , " he added .
Since last week 's decision by Fitch , Greece has come under increasing pressure to take action over its deficit from the European Central Bank .
However , Collin Ellis , European economist at Daiwa Securities , says that " the idea that the euro area is on the the brink of losing Greece and possibly other members is simply absurd " .
He believes there is still time for the Greek government to sort out its finances , and , should it not be able to , " it is inconceivable that other euro area member states and , if necessary , international organisations would not step in " .
The country 's public debt stands at 300bn euros ( $ 442bn ; £ 269bn ) .

Equipped with wearable AI systems and digital eyes that see what human eyes can't , space explorers of the future could be not just astronauts , but " cyborg astrobiologists . "
That 's the vision of a research team led by Patrick McGuire , a University of Chicago geoscientist who 's developed algorithms that can recognize signs of life in a barren landscape .
" When they look at scenery , children gravitate towards the thing that 's different from the other things , " said McGuire .
" That 's how I looked at the cyborg astrobiologist . "
At the heart of McGuire 's system is a Hopfield neural network , a type of artificial intelligence that compares incoming data against patterns it 's seen before , eventually picking out those details that qualify as new or unusual .
As described in a paper published Thursday inarXiv , the system successfully differentiates lichen from surrounding rock — a proof - of - principle test that lays the foundation for adding other types of data .
For the last several years , McGuire worked on CRISM , a Mars - orbiting imager that detects infrared and other invisible - to - human - eye wavelengths of light , allowing it to identify different types of rock and soil .
McGuire envisions the digital eyes of cyborg astrobiologists as scaled - down versions of CRISM , their data perpetually crunched by the Hopfield networks on their hips .
" You would have a very complex artificial intelligence system , with access to different remote sensing databases , to field work that 's been done before in the area , and it would have the ability to reason about these in human - like ways , " said McGuire .
The lichen tests were conducted in Spain and at Utah's Mars Desert Research Station , where two of the researchers donned spacesuits and lived for two weeks in the field as astronauts .
They carried hand - held digital microscopes and cell phone cameras , which sent the data via bluetooth to netbooks running McGuire 's Hopfield network .
The lichen identification was based on color data .
McGuire next plans to train the network to process different textures .
Ultimately he wants to conduct analysis at different scales , from the microscopic up to landscape - wide .
McGuire cautioned that his team 's system is " nowhere near " its ready - for - Mars ideal , and it will likely be decades before people explore the surface of Mars in person .
In the meantime , cyborg astrobiologists might search the South Pole for Martian meteorites , and feature - identifying algorithms could be uploaded to Mars - roving robots .
" Then you 'd have a robotic astrobiologist , and the humans would be back here on Earth , in Mission Control , " he said .
" The algorithms help us out , but humans are ultimately responsible . "

Brandon Keim's Twitter stream and reportorial outtakes ; Wired Science on Twitter .
Brandon is currently working on a book about ecosystem and planetary tipping points .
On most days , Andrea Deckard can be found in her home office , digging through stacks of coupons and grocery receipts for money saving tips and recipes that she can share with readers of her Mommy Snacks blog .
That is , when the stay - at - home mom is n’t being wined and dined by giant food companies .
Earlier this year , Frito - Lay flew her to Los Angeles to meet celebrities such as model Brooke Burke and the Spice Girls ’
Mel B , while pitching her on its latest snack ad campaign .
More recently , Nestle paid to put her and 16 other so - called “ mommy bloggers ” -- and one daddy blogger -- up at the posh Langham Huntington hotel in Pasadena , treated them to a private show at the Magic Castle in Hollywood and sent packages of frozen Omaha Steaks to their families to tide them over while the women were away learning all about the company ’s latest product lines .

In return , Deckard and her virtual sisterhood filed Twitter posts raving about Nestle ’s canned pumpkin , Wonka candy and Juicy Juice drinks .
“ People have accused us of being corporate shills , ” said Deckard , a Monroe , Ohio , mother of three whose junkets have also included a free trip to Frito - Lay ’s Texas headquarters .
Deckard , noting that she is up front with her readers about such trips , said they are educational for her and her fans , and “ just fun . ”
Besides , she added , “ it ’s not like I sold my soul for a chocolate bar . ”
Others are n’t so sure .
As food companies big and small scramble to woo parents - turned - bloggers , nutrition activists worry that the food industry is funding an advertising campaign for its products without consumers realizing it .

“ This is very shrewd marketing , ” said Barbara Moore , chief executive of Shape Up America , an obesity - fighting nonprofit group .
“ The expectation that the industry players have is that people they are wining and dining will write about their products positively . ”
Free -flowing wine and buffet tables laden with crudites are now common features of a company - sponsored function for bloggers .
Some companies are even offering free kitchen appliances , vacations , groceries and enough fruity snacks to feed a neighborhood ’s worth of kids .
The growing trend is fueling legal and social debate over how bloggers disclose what goodies they get .
New guidelines unveiled last month by the Federal Trade Commission say bloggers must divulge financial or product compensation they get in exchange for writing about a company ’s products .
The regulations are set to go into effect Dec. 1 .
But critics worry that the guidelines are too vague and will hold bloggers to a different , or more stringent , standard than traditional media outlets .
They say the FTC is n’t being clear about what material needs to be disclosed and does n’t specify how these disclosures must be made .

“ They ’re treating blogging like it ’s pornography , ” said Elisa Camahort Page , co-founder of the online community group BlogHer .
“ They think you ’ll know unethical blogging when you see it . ”
Whatever one may think of mommy bloggers , there has never been a better time to be a parent with Internet access .
An estimated 42 million women in the U.S. take part in social media services each week , and 55 % of them are regularly reading , writing or responding to blogs , according to a 2009 survey by BlogHer .
In some ways , this marketing push has been happening for years : Companies hawking a variety of goods , from diamonds to digital cameras , have been eager to get parent bloggers to write posts that tout their products .
But recently , these bloggers say , food companies have upped the ante , bombarding them with free trips to corporate kitchens and mountains of edible swag .

Starbucks , eager to get working parents drinking its Via instant coffee , sent limousines to shuttle bloggers in New York City for a private lunch with executives .
They left with bags stuffed with coffee and offers of bottomless future refills .
Fast - food purveyor Taco Bell flew a group of bloggers from Maryland , Michigan and Missouri to California for a retreat this spring , paid for their lodging and let them spend the day creating new taco and burrito concoctions .
Kraft Foods curried favor with mommy bloggers by bringing some to Los Angeles for the Grilled Cheese Invitational , in an effort to get online parents hungry for cheese .
The rationale is pure economics .
The food industry -- from restaurants to supermarkets and manufacturers -- has seen sales slide during the recession and is looking for new ways to reach customers .
And the people online they want are parents .

It ’s a strategy that recalls post - World War II ad campaigns , in which women touted the benefits of certain laundry soaps and the household brands that would make them a domestic goddess .
“ They handle the family budget , ” said Amanda Vega , an industry consultant who specializes in social media and public relations .
“ People read them and believe them , because they ’re easy to identify with . ”
They also rarely are critical .
Christine Young , owner of the From Dates to Diapers blog , has a closet full of free baby products she never liked .
She has n’t mentioned them in her blog .
They ’re still there , sitting on the shelves , waiting to be donated .
Advertisement
“ My business is not to bash companies , ” said Young , 32 , who lives in the Sacramento area .
“ My business is to create buzz for the products and services we enjoy . ”
That philosophy has created a rift in the parental blogosphere , between those who take freebies and those who do n’t .
And companies have learned that backlash over corporate pampering can quickly turn explosive .
The recent Nestle trip was designed to let the bloggers “ get a better feel for Nestle ” in exchange for consumer input , said organizer Becky Chao , director of the company ’s Moms With Kids Insights program .
Nestle set up a Twitter tag and created a website with pictures of the invited mom and dad bloggers to encourage them to talk to their readers .
Advertisement
And the company intentionally made its recent event a lavish one “ to make the bloggers feel comfortable while they were here , away from their families , ” Chao said .
But critics of the company countered that the event was a public relations ploy in reaction to an ongoing boycott of Nestle for marketing baby milk formula as a substitute for breast feeding in developing countries .
In fact , before the trip , critics reached out to the bloggers invited to California and urged them to not go .
No one canceled .
Advertisement
As the event got underway , the online conversation quickly turned into an online battlefield .
The company ’s Twitter channel was so inundated with anti-Nestle messages , and nasty accusations aimed at the attendees , that it was essentially shut down .
The company , caught off guard , let the parents field questions aimed at executives until finally stepping into the fray .
Afterward , thousands of people joined Facebook groups dedicated to boycotting the company , according to critics of the company .
“ I do think they should have done a bit of due diligence in researching the company before choosing to be associated with them and to accept a free trip from them , ” said Annie Urban , author of the PhD in Parenting blog and the person credited with kicking off the Nestle brouhaha .
“ It is one thing to cluelessly pick up a Nestle chocolate bar in the store , but it is another thing altogether to accept an all - expenses - paid trip and agree to have your face and name on a Nestle Family Bloggers page . ”

As for those who just say no , they fret about their credibility being tainted .
Tales of unreported luxury suites and cross-country trips made Liz Gumbinner cringe so much that she helped launch Blog With Integrity .
The goal is to rally support for demarcating the line between personal observations and paid posts .
“ It ’s easy to paint everyone as product whores , ” said Gumbinner , 41 , who lives in Brooklyn and has run her Mom101 blog since 2006 .
“ They ’re not .
I think sometimes they ’re just naive . ”

Capitalism is the social system of and for the human mind .
GearDiary reports on a recent change to Adobe 's " Get Flash " download page for Flash Player that appears when visited by iPhone users .
i Phone users are linked to the page when attempting to load Flash video and have traditionally been greeted with a simple message informing them that Flash was not available for their platform .
The updated text clearly passes the blame for lack of Flash support on the iPhone to Apple , pointing to Apple 's restrictions on the use of such technologies .
Apple restricts use of technologies required by products like Flash Player .
Until Apple eliminates these restrictions , Adobe cannot provide Flash Player for the iPhone or iPod Touch .
Adobe recently launched a Flash Player initiative to facilitate the integration of Flash across platforms , including smartphones .
Apple , however , was been notably absent from the list of companies participating in the initiative .

El sector empresarial detect� sobreejercicios en la partida de Servicios Personales en varias entidades federativas , que en los �ltimos tres a�os representan una cantidad superior a los 350 mil millones de pesos , cifra equivalente al d�ficit fiscal previsto para 2010 .
En el documento Finanzas P�blicas para Crear Empleo Productivo , del Centro de Estudios Econ�micos del Sector Privado ( CEESP ) , se reprocha que no se apliquen recortes y ajustes en los gobiernos federal y estatales , antes de decidir sobre nuevos impuestos o modificaciones fiscales .
El estado con m�s deudas por sobregirar los presupuestos de Servicios Personales es Tabasco , que registra 800 % m�s de su gasto , seguido de Yucat�n con 300 % m�s , y en contraste , s�lo Chiapas , Guanajuato , Zacatecas y Nuevo Le�n presentan ahorros .
Seg�n el documento , las entidades que m�s se excedieron en recursos para servicios personales — dinero destinado a salarios , prestaciones , gratificaciones y retiro voluntario — en los tres �ltimos a�os fueron Tabasco , Yucat�n , Guerrero , Tamaulipas y Colima .
El sector privado impulsa que para controlar los presupuestos federal y estatales se hagan p�blicas las facturas y registros de todos los gastos superiores a 10 mil pesos , y se homologuen los requerimientos de gasto y comprobaci�n .
Los que doblaron el presupuesto asignado fueron Tlaxcala , Coahuila , Sinaloa , Hidalgo , Jalisco , Oaxaca , Campeche , Durango , Sonora , Puebla , Aguascalientes , Quer�taro , Veracruz , Michoac�n , Baja California , estado de M�xico , Baja California Sur , Quintana Roo , San Luis Potos� y Chihuahua .
La entidad con m�s ahorros fue Chiapas , en contraste con Guanajuato , Zacatecas y NL que reportaron m�s gastos .
En el documento distribuido a diputados federales se solicita reducir los gastos de las campa�as , partidos e institutos electorales .
En el cabildeo de los empresarios en contra de la modificaci�n del r�gimen fiscal se evidencia que la austeridad del gobierno federal suele ser s�lo en ramos de operaci�n , pero no en salarios .

It ’s one that ’s been much - discussed in this space : reading all the lines in a large file and computing some simple statistics .
It was the discovery that this sort of script ran faster on my Mac laptop than a pricey industrial - grade Sun server that originally motivated the Wide Finder work .
What I would really like to come out of all this work would be a set of tools , accessible to ordinary programmers , that help them accomplish everyday tasks with code that makes good use of many of the compute engines on a modern multi-core processor .
I keep coming back to this “ read lines and compute stats ” task because it ’s as simple as you can imagine , it occurs in the real world , and if I ca n’t manage that one maybe that ’s a signal that the whole project is doomed .
If you want an application to process lines out of a file concurrently , you need , first , to parallelize the process of reading the file , and second , parallelize the application code .
Paralines ·
This is Clojure code I wrote to parallelize the line - reading part of the problem .
I ’m not sure what the right name is for a splodge of Clojure code : “ Module ” ?
“ Package ” ?
Whatever ; let ’s ignore Paralines for the purposes of this essay ; I ’ll get back to it later .
It offers a function called read - lines ; here ’s its doc string :
( [ file - name destination all - done user - data params ] )
Reads the named file and feeds the lines one at a time to the function ' destination ' , which will be called in parallel on many threads with two arguments , the first being a line from the file , the second ' user - data ' .
When all the lines have been processed , the the ' all - done ' function will be called with ' user - data ' as its single argument .
The ' destination ' function will be called on multiple threads in parallel , so its logic must be thread - safe .
There is no guarantee in which order the lines from the file will be processed .
The ' params ' argument is a map ; the default values for the number of threads and file block - size may be overridden with the : width and : block - size values respectively .

This is the little Clojure script I wrote to solve the original Wide Finder problem : read an Apache logfile from this blog and find the ten most popular pieces ; for a refresher , see the original Ruby script .
It calls Paralines like so :
( read - lines " data / O.1 m " proc-line report ( ref {} ) {} )
In this invocation data / O.1 m is the one - million - line sample of logfile data .
proc-line is the function to which each line will be passed .
report is the function which will be used to report on the results of the run .
The second - last argument , ( ref {} ) , is more interesting .
This will be passed as the second argument to each invocation of proc-line and as the sole argument to the final report invocation .
It ’s meant to be used to hold the program ’s state as it does its computations .
{} is the Clojure idiom for an empty map ( think hash table ) .
The ref function produces a reference , a thing that ( unlike most things in Clojure ) can be changed , and in particular can be changed safely in a concurrent environment .
The notion of using a hash table to build up state in this kind of work should hardly be surprising to anyone who ’s ever written a Perl script .
And we ’re going to use it just as we would in a Perl script ; the hash will be keyed by the URIs of ongoing pieces , and the values will just be integers , how many times we ’ve seen each one so far in the logfile .
The final argument , {} , is an empty hash table which tells Paralines to use the default block - size and thread - count .
proc-line · Paralines calls this function once for each line , the first argument being the line as a string , the second being that hash - table - reference that we set up at the beginning .
1 ( def re #" GET / ongoing / When / \d\d\dx /( \d\d\d\d/\d\d/\d\d/[^ . ]+ ) " ) 2 3 ( defn proc-line [ line so - far ] 4 ( let [ hit ( re - find re line ) 5 target ( if hit ( last hit ) nil ) ] 6 ( if target ( record target so - far ) ) ) )
Line 1 : in Clojure a string with # in front is a regular expression .
I find it pleasing that I can use pretty well the same regexes in Perl , Ruby , Java , and now anything built on the Java platform .
Line 3 : The ref to the hash where the results live will be called so - far from here on in .
Line 4 : re-find uses the java.util.regex library to scan the string .
Line 5 : If re-find missed it returns nil .
If it hits , it returns a list whose first member is the whole match , then $ 1 , $ 2 , and so on .
Since I only have one ( ) - group , it ’ll always be of size two and I can use last to fish out $ 1 .
Line 6 : Assuming the regex hit , we call record with the interesting part of the URI and the so - far hash ref .
record ·
Here is where we start to use Clojure references .
1 ( defn record [ target so - far ] 2 ( let [ counter ( @so - far target ) ] 3 ( if counter 4 ( incr counter ) 5 ( incr ( new - counter so - far target ) ) ) ) )
Line 2 : Remember that so - far is n’t the results hash table , it ’s a ref .
The @ means “ reach through the ref and extract the value ” , apparently ignoring concurrency issues .
In Clojure , a hash is just a function ; so ( @so - far target ) says “ reach through the ref , get the hash table , and look up the target in it ” .
Lines 3 - 4 : If counter is non-nil , that means we ’ve already seen this target and have started counting references to it .
So we just use the incr function to increment that counter .
Line 5 : We did n’t find a counter for this target , so we ’re going to have to use new - counter to add one to the hash table ; new - counter also returns the counter it just added , so we can increment it .
incr ·
What could be simpler than adding one to a counter ?
Well , except for , this is running in ( a potentially large number of ) parallel threads , more than one of which might be wanting to increment this counter at the same time .
Above , we said that the values in the hash table were the occurrence counts , but that was n’t quite accurate .
They ’re actually Clojure refs to the occurrence counts , so we can run in parallel .
1 ( defn incr [ counter ] 2 ( dosync ( alter counter inc ) ) )
All the magic is in Line 2 .
First , since we ’re going to update a reference , we have to call dosync to launch a “ transaction ” , the STM voodoo that Clojure uses to make this possible and safe .
Inside the dosync , we use alter to send the inc function to the actual integer with the count .
Since Clojure always uses immutable values as opposed to traditional variables , what actually happens is it creates a new integer and rejiggers the counter ref to point to that .
new - counter ·
This is the function that gets called when we ’re trying to record the occurrence of a URI but the hash does n’t yet contain a counter for it .
1 ( defn new - counter [ so - far target ] 2 ( dosync 3 ( let [ c ( @so - far target ) counter ( ref 0 ) ] 4 ( if c 5 c 6 ( do 7 ( ref - set so - far ( assoc @so - far target counter ) ) 8 counter ) ) ) ) )
Line 2 : The function wraps itself up in a dosync because it ’s going to be poking and prodding at the hash reference quite a bit .
Line 3 : The part where we set c may be a little puzzling ; we look the target up in the hash table ; but did n’t we just do that , and call this function because it was n’t there ?
Be careful :
We ’re running in parallel , and someone else might have got in and added it , and counted a few occurrences even , while we were n’t looking , and we would n’t want to reset the count to zero accidentally .
Remember that when we dereferenced the table in the higher - level record function by saying ( @so - far target ) , I said “ apparently ignoring concurrency issues ” .
Well , not quite .
If another thread had been in this new - counter function , the dosync function and Clojure ’s concurrency magic would have prevented the dereference from seeing the hash in an inconsistent state .
The second half of Line 3 , assuming that we ’re probably going to need a new counter , goes ahead and creates a new ref - to - an - int for that purpose .
Line 4 - 5 : If c came back non-nil , that means that , yes indeed , someone came along and created the counter and we do n’t need to , we can just return it .
Line 7 : This is the normal path through the function , where we update the hash table with the new counter .
ref - set is like alter ; I find it a bit more readable when the code is something more complicated than just inc .
assoc looks like it updates the hash table , but because we ’re living in the land of immutability it does n’t really , it creates a new one which differs only by having the new key / value pair .
This is n’t as horrifically inefficient as it sounds , Clojure is smart about creating a “ new ” object by just twiddling pointers and re-using most of the old one .
report ·
We ’re about done ; all that ’s left is the function that prints out the top ten most - referenced ongoing pieces .
( defn report [ so - far ] ( let [ sorted ( sort - by last ( fn [ a b ] ( > @a @b ) ) @ so - far ) ] ( doseq [ key ( keys ( take 10 sorted ) ) ] ( println ( str " K " key " - " @ ( @so - far key ) ) ) ) ) )
There ’s nothing terribly exotic here , except for we have to throw a lot of @ characters around to reach through the references to the table itself and then to the values in the key / value pairs .
Which is perfectly OK since this stage is read - only .
Looking Back ·
Note that actual collisions between concurrent threads are probably going to be rare in this implementation .
Most times when you probe the hash - table ref you ’ll find that yes , we ’re already counting this URI ; no transaction required .
And most times when you increment the counter , probably no other threads are , so once again , the STM should work smoothly .
So there , you have it ; 30 or so lines of code that reliably and concurrently compute line - at - a - time statistics .
Does This Actually Work ? ·
This section used to begin :
Not quite , at the moment .
I mean , it works fine for the first 50 million lines or so of the big dataset ’s quarter - billion , keeping my eight - core 32 - thread SPARC T2000 maxed , and I mean smokin’ , you can see the 50 M blocks that Paralines is reading go by pop-pop - pop .
But then it hits its heap limit and descends into garbage - collection hell and thrashes its way to a miserable single - threaded standstill .
No more !
I found the bug , due to a combination of some moderate stupidity on my part and an old and well - known Java issue , and killed it .
It runs fine ; see Parallel I /O for more .
The Big Question · Are the ref and @ and dosync and alter and ref-set machinery accessible to ordinary programmers ?
Will they figure out how to use them and use them correctly ?
Clearly this is a lot less painful than wrangling locks and threads , but on the other hand there is still careful thought required and places where you can go wrong .
Is this a primitive that will be one of the distinguishing features of the Java of Concurrency ?
Reactions to Commenters ·
On the question of whether agents would be a better fit ;
Well , maybe .
I do n’t think there ’s a single person on this green planet who is smart enough to predict , based on intuition , where the bottlenecks are going to happen in this kind of a setup .
Once I ’ve fought through the GC weirdness , I ’ll see if going to an agent - based system helps .
I will point out that , until the GC conflagration broke out , this gave the appearance of running very efficiently on the Niagara box , with all the available threads maxed out .
So it may be that the Clojure mechanisms have hit an 80/20 point and further improvement is incremental .
We ’ll see .
To Avi and others who suggested map / reduce or other more deeply - parallel approaches :
Well , maybe .
Do bear in mind that I ’m trying to nail down The Simplest Thing That Will Really Help , not the most optimal solution regardless of complexity .
To those who suggest that my performance problem is due to concurrency contention rather than GC : I really think you ’re wrong .
I have the GC diagnostics printing out , and I can see it descending into GC hell when it bottlenecks .
To those advancing theories based on the number of unique counters , lines , and so on :
There are around 3,000 unique URIs , and a quarter - billion lines of data , just under 10 % of which match the regex and will lead to an update .
The MPAA scored a victory last night when millions of people tuned in to CBS 's 60 Minutes .
The ' investigative ' news magazine ran a propaganda piece on movie piracy yesterday , allowing the MPAA to insinuate once again that organized crime and BitTorrent go hand in hand .
The MPAA getting free airtime on one of the most watched television programs in the U.S. is not really a surprise , since CBS has close ties to Hollywood .
However , for a program that claims to do ‘ investigative ’ journalism , yesterday ’s item on movie piracy was not very well researched .
What bothered us the most is that the item conveniently mixed file - sharing with commercial piracy , while linking it to organized crime , human trafficking and child prostitution .
This setup is a bit misleading to say the least .
That aside , the claimed role that piracy plays in organized crime is based on an MPAA - funded study we have previously debunked .
The MPAA ’s stance did n’t really surprise us that much though .
Their job is to manipulate public opinion in the hope that less people will engage in illicit file - sharing .
But it was disappointing to see that CBS did n’t care to bring someone in to counter the arguments of the anti-piracy lobbyists .
No , instead they managed to get director Steven Soderbergh on , who joined the movie industry trade group by providing more twisted facts .
Reciting the MPAA ’s propaganda , Soderbergh said he wished the Internet was never invented .
“ Piracy is costing Hollywood $ 6 billion a year at the box office , ” he told the reporter , adding that “ as the margins of profit shrink , fewer projects get made , which means fewer people go to work . ”
These statements are both inaccurate , or at least highly doubtful .
The $ 6 billion statistic Soderbergh is referring to actually comes from an MPAA - funded report for which the sources were never revealed .
In fact , the MPAA itself had to release a statement saying that they “ made a mistake ” with one of the figures , but they continue to use the report nonetheless .
Similarly , Soderbergh ’s claim that “ fewer projects get made ” was debunked only last week after Sony boss Michael Lynton made a similar statement .
The opposite seems to be true .
Hollywood is far from bankrupt .
In the past decade box office earnings actually increased significantly .
The only piece of the entire item that was pretty accurate and worth watching was the explanation of how BitTorrent works .
John Malcolm , a former Director of Worldwide Anti-Piracy Operations for the MPAA shows that his work for the trade group paid off , as it turned him into a BitTorrent expert ( video below ) .
The entire piece is disappointing nevertheless .
It fails to ask the questions about why people download movies illegally and acts as if the movie industry is a powerless victim .
Perhaps Hollywood should start to see the millions of illegal downloaders as potential customers instead of thieves .
There ’s a huge demand for online entertainment , so why not compete with piracy instead of spending millions of dollars fighting it ?
Evidence that the US is a failed state is piling up faster than I can record it .
One conclusive hallmark of a failed state is that the crooks are inside the government , using government to protect and to advance their private interests .
Another conclusive hallmark is rising income inequality as the insiders manipulate economic policy for their enrichment at the expense of everyone else .
The Banksters are still in charge .
Income inequality in the US is now the most extreme of all countries .
The 2008 OECD report , “ Income Distribution and Poverty in OECD Countries , ” [ PDF ] concludes that the US is the country with the highest inequality and poverty rate across the OECD and that since 2000 nowhere has there been such a stark rise in income inequality as in the US .
The OECD finds that in the US the distribution of wealth is even more unequal than the distribution of income .
On October 21 , 2009 , Business Week reported that a new report from the United Nations Development Program concluded that the US ranked third among states with the worst income inequality .
As number one and number two , Hong Kong and Singapore , are both essentially city states , not countries , the US actually has the shame of being the country with the most inequality in the distribution of income .
The stark increase in US income inequality in the 21st century coincides with the offshoring of US jobs , which enriched executives with “ performance bonuses ” while impoverishing the middle class , and with the rapid rise of unregulated OTC derivatives , which enriched Wall Street and the financial sector at the expense of everyone else .
Millions of Americans have lost their homes and half of their retirement savings while being loaded up with government debt to bail out the banksters who created the derivative crisis .
Frontline 's October 21 broadcast , “ The Warning , ” documents how Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , Deputy Treasury Secretary Larry Summers , and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt blocked Brooksley Born , head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , from performing her statutory duties and regulating OTC derivatives .
After the worst crisis in US financial history struck , just as Brooksley Born said it would , a disgraced Alan Greenspan was summoned out of retirement to explain to Congress his unequivocal assurances that no regulation of derivatives was necessary .
Greenspan had even told Congress that regulation of derivatives would be harmful .
A pathetic Greenspan had to admit that the free market ideology on which he had relied turned out to have a flaw .
Greenspan may have bet our country on his free market ideology , but does anyone believe that Rubin and Summers were doing anything other than protecting the enormous fraud - based profits that derivatives were bringing Wall Street ?
As Brooksley Born stressed , OTC derivatives are a “ dark market . ”
There is no transparency .
Regulators have no information on them and neither do purchasers .
Even after Long Term Capital Management blew up in 1998 and had to be bailed out , Greenspan , Rubin , and Summers stuck to their guns .
Greenspan , Rubin and Summers , and a roped - in gullible Arthur Levitt who now regrets that he was the banksters ' dupe , succeeded in manipulating a totally ignorant Congress into blocking the CFTC from doing its mandated job .
Brooksley Born , prevented by the public 's elected representatives from protecting the public , resigned .
Wall Street money simply shoved facts and honest regulators aside , guaranteeing government inaction and the financial crisis that hit in 2008 and continues to plague our economy today .
The financial insiders running the Treasury , White House , and Federal Reserve shifted to taxpayers the cost of the catastrophe that they had created .
When the crisis hit , Henry Paulson , appointed by President Bush as Rubin 's replacement as the Goldman Sachs representative running the US Treasury , hyped fear to obtain from “ our ” representatives in Congress with no questions asked hundreds of billions of taxpayers ' dollars ( TARP money ) to bail out Goldman Sachs and the other malefactors of unregulated derivatives .
When Goldman Sachs recently announced that it was paying massive six - and seven - figure bonuses to every employee , public outrage erupted .
In defense of banksters , saved with the public 's money , paying themselves bonuses in excess of most people 's life - time earnings , Lord Griffiths , Vice Chairman of Goldman Sachs International , said that the public must learn to “ tolerate the inequality as a way to achieve greater prosperity for all . ” [ Public must learn to ' tolerate the inequality ' of bonuses , says Goldman Sachs vice - chairman ]
In other words , “ Let them eat cake . ”
According to the UN report cited above , Great Britain has the 7th most unequal income distribution in the world .
After the Goldman Sachs bonuses , the British will move up in distinction , perhaps rivalling Israel for the fourth spot in the hierarchy .
Despite the total insanity of unregulated derivatives , the high level of public anger , and Greenspan 's confession to Congress , still nothing has been done to regulate derivatives .
One of Rubin's Assistant Treasury Secretaries , Gary Gensler , has replaced Brooksley Born as head of the CFTC .
Larry Summers is the head of President Obama 's National Economic Council .
Former Federal Reserve official Timothy Geithner , a Paulson protege , runs the Obama Treasury .
A Goldman Sachs vice president , Adam Storch , has been appointed the chief operating officer of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The Banksters are still in charge .
Is there another country in which in full public view so few so blatantly use government for the enrichment of private interests , with a coterie of “ free market ” economists available to justify plunder on the grounds that “ the market knows best ” ?
A narco - state is bad enough .
The US surpasses this horror with its financo - state .
As Brooksley Born says , if nothing is done , “ it 'll happen again . ”
But nothing can be done .
The crooks have the government .
[ PCR Note : The OECD report shows that despite the Reagan tax rate reduction , the rate of increase in US income inequality declined during the Reagan years .
During the mid-1990s the Gini coefficient ( the measure of income inequality ) actually fell .
Beginning in 2000 with the New Economy ( essentially financial fraud and offshoring of US jobs ) , the Gini coefficient shot up sharply . ]

Ron Paul Says Fed " Oversight is Laughable "
Today the House Finance Committee approved the Ron Paul and Jim DeMint amendment to audit the Federal Reserve .
It ’s a step in the right direction , but the amendment still has some way to go before it sees the light of day .
To build momentum , Paul and DeMint have written their opinion in the Wall Street Journal that the “ trillion - dollar interventions in the economy merit scrutiny by taxpayers and their representatives . ”
Since 1913 , the Fed has been in place to defend the dollar while fulfilling its dual mandate of stable prices and full employment .
Despite its efforts the US dollar has basically lost 95 percent of its purchasing power over the past 96 years .
Paul and DeMint argue that Fed transparency is required to reveal “ who the Fed is giving money to , what types of securities are being purchased and what backs those securities , [ and ] how much money is being paid for those securities ” .
As it stands , the Freedom of Information Act is not sufficient for making these facts public .
Even with it in place , media like Bloomberg and Fox News are forced to litigate in order to gain access to the kind of financial crisis - related information that should be readily at their disposal .
Currently , the only Fed supervision in place is the chairman ’s twice - yearly appearance before Congress to explain his decisions .
As Paul and DeMint explain , “ the idea that this constitutes any sort of oversight is laughable . ”

Judge Goldstone visited Gaza during his inquiry into war crime claims
The UN General Assembly has voted in favour of a resolution calling for independent inquiries by Israel and the Palestinians into war crime claims .
After a two - day debate on a report by former war crimes prosecutor Richard Goldstone , there were 114 votes in favour , 18 opposed and 44 abstentions .
The report condemns the conduct of both sides last December and January , after Israel launched an offensive in Gaza .
The Palestinians backed the report but Israel said it did not promote peace .
Mr Goldstone 's report concluded that Israel had " committed actions amounting to war crimes , possibly crimes against humanity " by using disproportionate force , deliberately targeting civilians , using Palestinians as human shields and destroying civilian infrastructure during its Gaza offensive .
Time and again , the report inverts Israel 's unprecedented extensive efforts to save civilian lives as proof that any civilian casualties were therefore deliberate
Gabriela Shalev , Israeli Permanent Representative to the UN
It also found there was evidence that Palestinian militant groups including Hamas , which controls Gaza , had committed war crimes , and possibly crimes against humanity , in their repeated rocket and mortars attacks on southern Israel .
The report demanded that unless the parties to the Gaza war investigated the allegations of war crimes within six months , the cases should be referred to the International Criminal Court .
Palestinians and rights groups say more than 1,400 Gazans died in the 22 - day conflict , but Israel puts the figure at 1,166 .
Thirteen Israelis , including three civilians , were killed .
' Realisation of justice '
The General Assembly draft resolution was introduced by Arab states and the Non-Aligned Movement , which represents 118 nations .
It called for independent investigations of alleged war crimes to be set up by both the Palestinian Authority and Israel within three months .
The resolution also asks Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to report to the General Assembly within three months on implementation " with a view to considering further action , if necessary , by the relevant United Nations organs and bodies " , and to send the report to the Security Council .
The report accuses Israel of using " disproportionate force " in Gaza
UN seeks close Gaza scrutiny Key extracts from UN statement Full UN report on Gaza war General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding - unlike Security Council resolutions .
However , correspondents say the Security Council is unlikely to take any action if the case is ever referred to it .
Riyad Mansour , the Palestinian UN observer , backed the resolution but also insisted that Israel 's " aggressions and crimes " could not be equated " with actions committed in response by the Palestinian side " .
" We are determined to follow up this report and its recommendations in all relevant international forums , including the Security Council and the International Criminal Court , until the realisation of justice , " he said .
Israel 's permanent representative , Gabriela Shalev , warned that the report and the debate did " not promote peace - they damage any effort to revitalise negotiations in our region " .
" Time and again , the report inverts Israel 's unprecedented extensive efforts to save civilian lives as proof that any civilian casualties were therefore deliberate , " she told the Assembly .
The US , as a key ally of Israel , was one of a small number of countries expected to vote against the resolution .
For the EU , Sweden 's UN envoy Anders Liden urged Israel and the Palestinians to " launch appropriate , credible and independent investigations into possible violations " .
He described the report as " serious " and said the EU was " committed to assessing it seriously " .
Inquiries criticised
The UN debate also comes as an Israeli human rights organisation criticised investigations being carried out by the Israeli military .
B'tselem said 13 of 23 military police investigations under way were based on information it and two other rights organisations had gathered .
Three of the cases concerned civilians allegedly killed while holding white flags , and four were cases where Gazans were said to have been used as human shields .
B'tselem said the investigations were not sufficient because they " only relate to isolated incidents in which a suspicion exists that soldiers breached military orders " .
" To date , not one investigation has been opened regarding Israel 's policy during the operation , on matters such as the selection of targets , the open - fire orders given to soldiers , the legality of the weapons used , the balance between injury to civilians and military advantage , and so forth , " it said .

Dividing the Flower Bed
This is an original puzzle .
Lord Emsworth has a large circular flower bed in his park , whose centre is marked by a single tall rose stem .
It is divided into two parts by a straight line through the centre .
He now wishes to divide it into four equal quadrants with a second diameter at right angles to the first .
The gardeners can mark straight lines by sighting along lines of pegs and hammering in a fresh peg where two lines cross , but cannot measure distances or draw any kind of circular arc .
How can they find the second diameter ?

Ramanujan 's Puzzle
I have just been reading a biography of the Indian mathematical genius , S. Ramanujan , The Man Who Knew Infinity : A Life of the Genius Ramanujan , and the book has given me several puzzles .
This is a puzzle he posed in an Indian journal and received no solutions .
The book does not give his solution so I have provided one .
Let sq( x ) imply the positive square root of a positive number .
Consider a sequence of functions as follows :-
f 1 ( x ) = sq( 1+sq ( x ) )
f 2 ( x ) = sq( 1+sq ( 1+2*sq ( x ) ) )
f 3 ( x ) = sq( 1+s q ( 1+2*sq ( 1+3*sq ( x ) ) ) )
.
.
f n ( x ) = sq( 1+sq( 1+2*sq( 1+3*sq ( ... ( 1+n*sq ( x ) ) .. ) ) )
Evaluate this function as n tends to infinity .

A Long Street
While Ramanujan was at Cambridge , a friend posed a problem to him which was taken from the " Strand magazine " .
Ramanujan answered immediately , giving a continued fraction , whose convergents were the general solution to the problem .
His friend was astounded .
How , he asked Ramanujan , had he done it ?
He replied : " Immediately I heard the problem , it was obvious that the answer was a continued fraction ; I then thought , ' Which continued fraction ? ' , and the answer came to my mind ! "
Slightly shortened , the problem was as follows .
A friend of mine lived in a long street with houses numbered one , two , three , and so on .
The numbers of the houses below him added up to exactly the same as the numbers above him .
There were between fifty and five hundred houses in the street .
What was the number of my friend 's house ?

Twelve Coins
This is a very old puzzle which I was shown when I first started work just after the war .
It was rumoured to have been created by the Germans during the war and circulated in British defence establishments to waste engineers ' time .
It is very frequently posted in various user groups .
I include it because of my extra requirement , which is that you mark the coins in weightless chalk and declare the weighings in advance .
You are given 12 identical looking coins , and a balance type weighing machine .
11 of the coins are identical .
The twelfth differs in weight and may be heavy or light .
You may make 3 weighings , putting coins in either scale pan .
Find which coin is different and whether it is heavy or light .

Kirkman's School - Girls Problem
This puzzle dates from 1850 and is quoted in W.W. Rouse Ball 's book , Mathematical recreations and essays .
He devotes a chapter to finding solutions without a computer and I shan't repeat his methods .
However , I invite programmers to find and count all the solutions , excluding permutations .
A School Mistress was in the habit of taking her pupils on a daily walk .
There were 15 of them and they walked in five groups of three .
The problem is to arrange them so that , for seven days , no girl will walk with any of her school - fellows in any triplet , more than once .
Sets of Points separated by Rational Distances

Crossing the Desert
An explorer is at the edge of a desert 800 miles wide .
He has a truck , but , when full of petrol , it only has a range of 500 miles .
He may however , drive out into the desert , dump some petrol for later use and drive back .
Assuming no losses from evaporation , spillage , etc. , what is the smallest number of 500 mile loads he must use to cross the desert ?

Rational Right - Angled Triangles with Equal Areas
This puzzle has a long history .
Lewis Carroll 's diaries have a reference :
" Up all night with a new puzzle , just in from New York .
The problem is to find 3 right - angled triangles with integer sides and equal areas .
I could two but not three ! "
H.E. Dudeney , in his book The Canterbury Puzzles ( Illustrated Edition ) ( Dodo Press ) , uses the same idea in a puzzle called ' The Four Princes ' which asks for four such triangles , and , in his solution , gives a formula which allows the finding of as many such triangles as are required .
He claims to have discovered the formula himself .
However , T.L. Heath , in his translation of the works of the Greek Mathematician Diophantus , attributes the same formula to the 16th century French mathematician Pierre Fermat .
None of these authors could find all the solutions , or prove that their solution is the smallest .
I invite programmers to list all such triangles with area less than 1 million square units and thus find the smallest set of 4 integer sided right angled triangles with equal area .

Looking Glass Zoo
By SIR ARTHUR EDDINGTON
( Sir Arthur Eddington was a famous mathematician who wrote many papers on Relativity .
The animal names are taken from Lewis Carroll 's delightful nonsense poem , " Jabberwocky " ) .
I took some nieces and nephews to the zoo , and we halted at a cage marked
Tovus Slithius , male and female Borogovous Mimsius , male and female Rathus Momus , male and female Jabberwockius Vulgaris , male and female
The eight animals were asleep in a row and the children began to guess which was which .
" That one at the end is Mr. Tove . "
" No , no !
It 's Mrs. Jabberwock " , and so on .
I suggested that they should each write down the names in order from left to right , and offered a prize to the one who got most names right .
As the four species were easily distinguishable , no mistake would arise in pairing the animals ; naturally , a child who identified one animal as Mr. Tove identified the other animal of the same species as Mrs. Tove .
The keeper , who consented to judge the lists , scrutinised them carefully .
" Here 's a queer thing .
I take two of the lists , say John 's and Mary's .
The animal which John supposes to be the animal which Mary supposes to be Mr. Tove is the animal which Mary supposes to be the animal which John supposes to be Mrs. Tove .
It is just the same for every pair of lists , and all four species .
Curiouser and curiouser !
Each boy supposes Mr. Tove to be the animal which he supposes to be Mr. Tove ; but each girl supposes Mr. Tove to be the animal which she supposes to be Mrs. Tove .
And similarly for the other animals .
I mean , for instance , that the animal Mary calls Mr. Tove is really Mrs. Rath , but the animal she calls Mrs. Rath is really Mrs. Tove . "
" It seems a little involved . " I said , " but I suppose it is a remarkable coincidence . "
" Very remarkable , " replied Mr Dodgson ( whom I had supposed to be the keeper ) " and it could not have happened if you had brought any more children . "
How many nephews and nieces were there ?
Was the winner a boy or a girl ?
And how many names did the winner get right ?

The Village Surveyors
This puzzle is based on one by Hugh ApSimon .
I do n't have his book to hand so I must improvise .
The villages of Amwell , Boxford and Crofton lie on a plain .
Each has a church with a tower and the views are extensive .
A feature of the plain are four old trees , an ash , a beech , a cypress and an oak .
It is well known that , from the church tower at Amwell , the oak partly obscures the tower at Boxford , the ash partly obscures the tower at Crofton and the beech is in line with the cypress .
From the tower at Boxford , the cypress partly obscures the tower at Crofton and the beech is in line with the ash .
From the tower at Crofton the beech is in line with the oak .
Three surveyors were told to survey the area , but were not quite sure what to measure .
Their first thought was that they should measure the area of the triangle formed by the Oak - Beech - Cypress ; so they did .
It measured 6 acres .
Their second thought was that they should measure the area of the triangle formed by the Ash - Beech - Cypress ; so they did .
It measured 8 acres .
Their third thought was that they should measure the area of the triangle formed by the Oak - Beech - Ash ; so they did .
It measured 10 acres .
When they got back , their boss did n't want to know anything about trees at all .
He wanted to know the area of the triangle formed by the three villages .
No problem said the surveyors .
It is ...???

Enlarge By Douglas Healey , AP Bishop William Lori announces nearly six years ago at the Catholic Center in Bridgeport , Conn. , that the Diocese of Bridgeport settled 42 claims of sexual abuse of a minor , against 16 priests , for $ 21 million .
Join the conversation : Religion , spirituality & ethics | Reader forum : Your beliefs WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The Supreme Court refused on Monday to block the release of documents generated by lawsuits against priests in Connecticut for alleged sexual abuse .
The justices turned down a request by the Roman Catholic diocese in Bridgeport , Conn .
FAITH & REASON : What did the bishops know ?
Several newspapers are seeking the release of more than 12,000 pages from 23 lawsuits against six priests .
The records have been under seal since the diocese settled the cases in 2001 .
Courts in Connecticut have ruled that the papers should be made public .
The decision ends a legal battle that dragged on for years and could shed light on how recently retired New York Cardinal Edward Egan handled the allegations when he was Bridgeport bishop .
It 's unclear when the documents will be released .
Waterbury Superior Court clerk Philip Groth said he needs to consult a judge to determine whether a hearing is necessary before the records are released .
He said Monday morning it was unlikely the documents would be released Monday .
Telephone messages were left Monday for the diocese and an attorney for the newspapers .
A Waterbury Superior Court said in 2006 that the documents were subject to a presumption of public access .
The Connecticut Supreme Court upheld the lower court decision .
Barbara Blaine , founder of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests , welcomed the decision .
" This decision sends a clear message to those who would endanger kids : eventually , you 'll have to face the music and reveal your callousness , recklessness and deceit , " Blaine said in a statement .
" We hope that this ruling will deter every pedophile 's supervisor and co-workers from protecting a predator . "
She urged Bridgeport Bishop William E. Lori to disclose how much the diocese spent in church donations on the case .

Stop me if you 've heard this one before .
In a Salary Cap World ( all caps mandatory ) , what makes a team successful is n't picking up big - name free agents or acquiring magic bullets : players with huge reputations and equally huge cap hits .
It 's spending money wisely up and down the roster .
To win games when your spending is limited , you have to distribute your spending properly ; get elite players but not at the costs of gutting the bottom half of your lineup .
And at all costs , avoid throwing Hefty bags full of cash at role players like , say , thecaptainEthanMoreau over here .
The Oilers , it is unanimously accepted , struggle at that .
Ethan Moreau 's cap hit is an I - wish - I - were - making - this - up $ 2 million per season , signed sealed and delivered until 2010 - 11 ( all figures from NHLNumbers.com ) .
Robert Nilsson , he of the Mini Magic nickname and amazing on - ice disappearing act , shares a $ 2 million hit .
Patrick O'Sullivan tags us for $ 2.925 million , or about a buck for every muffed pass .
To a certain crowd on what Bob Sacamano used to call the number six bus , Shawn Horcoff 's $ 5.5 million a year is the worst financial management since the sponsorship scandal .
And to me , rather than paying Nikolai Khabibulin $ 3.75 million a year you'd be better off letting Jeff Deslauriers start , signing Jocelyn Thibault or somebody for minimum wage , and giving me what 's left .
By now , you know me well enough to know how much I love slapping the Oilers around in public .
So I had a great idea - I 'd blow the dust off my old calculator and work out just how much bang the Oilers were getting for their buck .
My methodology was perhaps too simple .
I took the NHL cap hit for each team from NHLNumbers.com .
I divided it by the number of wins to get their cap hit per win .
I then divided that by the number of games played so we could get a per -game figure .
Now , I do n't pretend this is a perfect statistical analysis .
For one thing , this early in the season , the resolution is wild : if a team wins its next game , that team will experience a considerable swing in its number .
I picked wins to eliminate the bizarro world that is the Bettman point , but these obviously wo n't match up exactly with the standings .
It is nothing more or less than a rough guide to who , so far , has spent their money wisely .
The results follow the jump .
Higher numbers are worse .
Anything below .3 is in the upper echelon , anything above .5 is properly bad and if you 're above .7 maybe you should just fold .
Well , then .
A few observations immediately recommend themselves from this list .
First off , Brian Burke should probably go ahead and learn carpentry .
Second , the Maple Leafs and Hurricanes are really , really , remarkably , historically , amazingly , Ryan O'Marra bad in the " wins and losses " department ( Leafs fans commenting on all their overtime and shootout losses will be mocked ) .
Third , I 've defended Wayne Gretzky as a coach before but looking at what the Coyotes are doing , maybe I 'm just stupid .
Fourth , the Oilers are below average , but they 're really not doing that bad .
It 's early in the season so the sample size is small .
To put it in perspective , if they win Sunday they 'll be better than the current average .
I repeat that this formula is n't perfect or even that good .
It is an indicator , nothing more .
But I distrust using statistics as a fine - toothed comb to find out which player is 2 % better than that other player , so I consider a great big glob that throws teams in pretty much the right order and leaves you to figure out the rest a feature , not a bug .
Bear in mind that I went into journalism in university .
Moreover , measuring only wins has obvious flaws .
Somebody more ambitious than I might come up with a metric using shots or scoring chances .
The Oilers , who have been outchanced to a shameful degree this season despite coming out only three games below .500 , would certainly come off worse by this measure ( and the Maple Leafs considerably better ) .
But so far , as Oiler fans , it 's possible to cautiously hold our breath .
We might just be average .
I think most of us would take that .
Everybody wants to have a solid financial plan , but over 40 % of Americans do n’t have one .
Unless you develop a formal strategy – like a written plan – it can be tough to accomplish a financial goal of any type .
And let ’s face it , if you do accomplish your goal it ’s more likely luck has more to do with it than your financial savviness .
The goal is not the main thing .
It ’s deciding how you achieve and stay w/ the plan that counts .
Let ’s go over some financial planning basics , that will help you to establish a financial plan that will have concrete steps you will actually be able to accomplish .
1. Define Your Goals
This gets down to answering the question
What is my financial plan ?
You have to decide exactly what it is you need your finances to do , and what those strategies will need to accomplish .
Once you establish goals , it will simply be a matter of creating a plan as to how you will get there .
For example , do you have children who will need to attend college day ?
If so , you ’ll have to save so you will have money available to make it happen .
At what age do you hope to retire ?
That will help you to decide how much time you have to save , and then to establish how much you can save to meet that goal .
Do you want to get completely out of debt ?
If so , will have to add up all of the debt you have , and determine how much you have available to pay toward it , and how much time it will take .
It can be helpful to work with a financial planner to help you target the most worthwhile and realistic goals .
If you are not aware of one in your area , FacetWealth makes it easy to work with a dedicated CFP to help set your goals and get your financial plan rolling .
Once you have your goals established , it will simply be a matter of working out the details as to how you will accomplish them .
But you ca n’t do that until you have a solid plan , and that ’s why creating one needs to be the first order of business .

2. Setting Up a Budget
There ’s no getting around the fact that any type of financial planning is going to require creating surplus money in your finances .
Whether your goal is to retire at a certain point your life , or to payoff your mortgage , you will need extra money in order to make any such goal a reality .
This is why a budget is so important .
A lot of people skip this step , and that ’s the reason why they never accomplish any kind of meaningful financial goals .
A budget enables you to see exactly how much money you spend each month , compared the amount of income that you earn .
It will help you to see where you ’re spending too much money , and where you might be able to make some cuts that will enable you to direct the money to where you want it to go .
Many people think that a budget adds stress . . . but many times over the long - run it does the opposite !
Adam Broughton , CFP® of PlanningBetterLives.com remarked on the psychological benefits of a budget :
Many people view budgeting negatively because they believe a budget is all about saying “ No . ”
In reality , your budget is equally about saying “ Yes . ”
Being in control of your spending gives you the ability to say “ Yes ” to the things that really make life meaningful .
You are also able to enjoy your expenditures more when you eliminate the stress of constant overspending .
So next time you start hating on your budget , start asking yourself what you want to say “ Yes ” to .
It may help you start saying “ No ” with a smile .
3. Cutting Expenses
Once you have a budget in place , you ’ll know exactly where your money is going , and you ’ll be able to prioritize and also to redirect the flow of your money .
You can start by identifying necessary expenses .
These are budget items that must be paid no matter what – your house payment , debt payments , insurance payments , and taxes .
You can think of these as being non-negotiable expenses .
The next category can be important expenses , but those over which you have large degree of control .
This can include groceries , utilities , and work or school related expenses .
All are necessary , but you have the ability to cut these expenses at least to some degree .
The third category are pure discretionary expenses .
This includes entertainment , vacations , and recreational shopping .
These may be desirable , but they ’re not at all necessary .
These are expenses you can eliminate completely , without threatening your survival .
Once you put your expenses in the proper categories , you ’ll be in a position to make reductions or complete cuts .
For example , you can reduce your important expenses , but completely eliminate one or more of your discretionary expenses .
Making these kinds of cuts frees up your cash flow which you can direct into savings or to debt payoff .
But you have to make certain expense cuts in order for that to happen .
4. Creating an Emergency Fund
Once you have identified significant expense cuts in your budget , the next order of business is to set up an emergency fund .
This step is often ignored in favor of other goals that seem to be more dramatic , yet it is entirely a financial must have .
An emergency fund is basically a savings account or money market that represents your liquid cash .
The idea is to have it available when either an unexpected expense hits , or when there is an income disruption .
That will not only enable you to weather a short - term financial storm , but will also help you to avoid borrowing money for the same purpose .
The general rule on an emergency fund is it should contain sufficient cash to cover 3 to 6 months worth of living expenses .
5. Getting Out of Debt
Once you have filled your emergency fund with a sufficient amount of cash , the next step will be to get out of debt .
The cash flow you create in your budget by cutting expenses – that was going into your emergency fund – can now be redirected into paying off debt .
There are different methods for getting out of debt , but Dave Ramsey ’s debt snowball might be the most effective .
You start by targeting your smallest debt , and paying it off .
Once the smallest debt is paid , you target the next smallest debt
You start small and get progressively larger with the debts , which is why it ’s referred to as a “ snowball ” .
This type of debt payoff strategy has several powerful advantages :
Each debt that is paid off – regardless of how small – represents visible progress and a moral victory
Each debt that is paid off eliminates a monthly payment , increasing your cash flow to take on the next debt
By the time you get to your largest debt , you have a greater ability to pay it off because all the other debts are already gone – along with their monthly payments
Each debt that is paid off reduces the number of debts that you owe , even if it does n’t substantially cut down on the amount that you owe
There ’s a strong element of psychological warfare when it comes to getting out of debt , and that needs to be in your favor if you ’re to have any chance of succeeding .
6. Saving For Retirement
Hopefully you ’re already saving for your retirement , even if it ’s just a little bit each month .
But as you get out of debt , your cash flow begins to increase , which will ultimately enable you to save a lot more money for retirement , and for everything else .
As is the case with every other financial goal , the most important step in saving for retirement is to get started .
If you have not done so already , start contributing to a plan with an amount that does not significantly hurt your financial situation overall .
Once you have that going , your goal should be to increase your contribution level each year .
You can do this by directing future pay increases into your retirement contribution .
You can also redirect debt payments into retirement , once those debts have been paid off .
And if your overall financial situation is strong , you ’ll probably feel confident contributing a lump sum to your retirement plan , such as income tax refunds and bonus checks .
According to Forbes staff member Jennifer Eum :
If an investor contributes just 10 % of her salary a year , beginning at age 25 with a starting salary of $ 50,000 , she will have socked away $ 916,618 by the time she retires at 65 .
7. Saving For Other Goals
There ’s a whole host of reasons to save money that sits somewhere between an emergency fund and a retirement fund .
Saving for your children ’s college education is an example .
You can also consider saving money for the purchase of a new car ( so you can buy it without going into debt ) , or for replacing major components in your home , such as your roof or your air conditioning system .
The purpose of saving for intermediate goals is obviously so you will have money available for major expenses that are completely predictable .
But it ’s also for the purpose of avoiding using debt to pay for them .
It will do you little good to work hard to get out of debt , only to plunge back in when you ’re faced with a major expense .
That ’s the debt merry - go - round so many people get stuck on , and have a very difficult time getting off of .
Prevention is the best strategy , and that involves saving up money for what you know is coming in the not - too - distant future .
Looking for a great way to save money ?
Ryan Fuchs , JD , LLM , CFP ® of IfrahFinancial.com shows us :
Set up automatic weekly , rather than monthly , deposits to your savings accounts .
Do $ 100 per week instead of $ 433 once a month .
After a while , you barely notice the transfers , you are less likely to “ miss ” the money if it goes out in smaller amounts , and you are less tempted to spend the money elsewhere since it sits in your checking account for shorter periods of time .
8. Having Adequate Insurance
There are a whole bunch of contingencies you can’t possibly save enough money for , and that ’s the whole purpose of insurance .
There are various types of insurance coverage , and you probably need them all .
This includes life insurance , health insurance , auto insurance , homeowners insurance , and business insurance if you are self - employed .
And often overlooked benefit of insurance is it mostly protects your financial assets .
This is why insurance is a fundamental part of smart financial planning .
For example , homeowners insurance enables you to repair your home as a result of damage from certain catastrophes without having to drain other financial resources .
Auto insurance does much the same , paying claims you would have to cover out of pocket if you have no insurance .
Life insurance is typically used to replace the lost wages of a deceased wager earner .
Once you realize insurance primarily protects your financial assets , you understand what ’s a critical part of your overall financial plan .
9. Setting Up a Will
Financial planning does n’t end upon your death – you need to make provisions for what will happen to your estate after your gone .
At a minimum , if you do n’t set up a will , your survivors will end up in probate court working out some sort of a deal to distribute your assets .
At worst , your assets can end up disappearing down a sinkhole .
This is why having a properly drawn and executed will is so important .
It ’s your final direction as to the state of your financial affairs .
Make some time to get together with a trusted attorney , and set up a will that will distribute your estate according to your wishes .
You can set it up one way now , and make modifications later on as your financial situation changes .
You may also be surprised to find you experience a certain sense of peace upon completing your will .
That peace will come from the fact you know you have done the best you can take care of your loved ones after your death .

San Francisco resident Elena Duran represents an unfortunate job trend that is n't reflected in the unemployment rate .
For years , Duran has been a full - time server at a downtown hotel .
But the recession has cut so deeply into business that her hours were cut to half time in July .
" It 's better than a layoff , but it still requires a lot of sacrifices , " said Duran , who , along with her working husband , supports three sons .
Because she works , Duran does n't count in California 's 12.2 percent unemployment rate .
But her situation is captured by a broader measure , the underemployment rate , which , in addition to the jobless , includes people who could get only part - time work as well as those who want jobs but were too discouraged to look .
The state Employment Development Department estimates that this underemployment rate hit 21.9 percent in September .
That figure includes 1.9 million jobless Californians , 1.4 million people who had to work part time , and 865,000 adults loosely described as discouraged .
" Underemployment is at the highest level since we started keeping these records in 1994 , " said economist Sylvia Allegretto of the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at UC Berkeley .
The Employment Development Department , which publishes the state 's jobless rate , has not typically calculated underemployment .
Dynamics of jobless recoveries
Paul Wessen , an economist with the department , said one reason is that the broader measure tends to rise and fall in concert with the traditional jobless rate , so both indicators provide the same signal .
" All the data tell us that this is the worst economic downturn since World War II , " Wessen said .
But Allegretto said the underemployment rate is worth tracking because it helps explain the dynamics of so - called jobless recoveries - times when growing economic output does not bring a strong rebound in hiring .
Recessions since the early 1990s have been followed by relatively sluggish job recoveries .
Economist Amar Mann of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in San Francisco said the agency started to publish a national underemployment rate after the 1990s recession .
" A lot of researchers were asking for this data , " he said .
Fuller picture of market
San Francisco labor attorney Michael Bernick , a former head of the state Employment Development Department , said the underemployment rate offers a fuller picture of the modern labor market primarily because it captures how many workers are cut to part time when the economy is in recession .
Bernick said employers who need to cut costs often choose to reduce hours as an alternative to layoffs , which can be better for employees and presumably for the business because it retains trained workers .
But he said the practice may mean that the unemployment rate wo n't drop quickly as the economy recovers , because employers tend to bring part - timers back to full time before they make new hires .
Wessen said the department is considering putting more emphasis on the underemployment rate .
" This measure has hit the radar more of late , " he said .
Californians ' challenges
Meanwhile , Californians face difficulties that the statistics only begin to describe .
Santa Rosa resident Lori Houston used to put in 40 to 60 hours a week as a self - employed communications specialist .
But since January , she has been working half as much because her clients have cut back in the face of their own financial woes .
Houston said she has been seeking contract or full - time work for months , to no avail .
" I 've been turning over every stone , " she said .
" It 's a tough market out there . "
Adding skills during search
Mark Gutierrez of San Jose , who has been looking for work in sales and distribution for more than a year , has fended off discouragement by adding new skills , such as Web design , while actively job hunting .
Gutierrez said he has a promising lead while he keeps an eye on his dwindling finances .
" Something has to break my way soon , " he said .

Divers discovered a large dent
The booster used on the Ares 1 - X test rocket on Wednesday was damaged when it fell back into the ocean , the US space agency ( Nasa ) says .
The recovery team sent to retrieve the stage from waters east of the Kennedy Space Center found a large dent in the side of the booster .
Nasa said the damage resulted from failures in the parachute system .
The Ares 1 - X was a demonstrator for the vehicle Nasa plans to use in the next decade to launch astronauts into orbit .
Wednesday 's two - minute sub-orbital mission was intended to help verify design assumptions so that when the final vehicle is built , the engineers can be confident it will fly as expected .
Once the first - stage booster had completed its burn , it separated from a dummy upper - stage and all the elements fell back to Earth .
Nasa expected the simulation stage to be destroyed , but engineers wanted to inspect the booster .
The powered part of the flight appeared to go well
It had a parachute system to slow its descent towards the ocean , and it now appears two of the three chutes malfunctioned .
The booster would have hit the water harder than expected , causing the dent later discovered by recovery divers .
Ares managers said they were not too concerned by what had happened because the booster was never going to be used a second time .
" Do n't play this too much , " said Bob Ess , the 1 - X mission manager .
" The parachute thing was like ' Hey , look at that ' .
We 're not worried about that .
There 's no investigation .
There 's no unusual thing we 're doing .
We 're just going through our usual post ( flight ) tests , " he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press .
The parachute system would be studied to determine why it had not worked properly , he added .

From the ' Wacky Software Names ' files :
Ubuntu Linux founder Mark Shuttleworth has announced the name of 2010 's first Ubuntu release .
Ubuntu 10.04 will be named the Lucid Lynx .
No , I 've never seen a drunk Lynx before myself , but then again it 's not like I see Lynx 's on a regular basis either .
Shuttleworth made the announcement via Webcast ( now posted on YouTube ) , to the Atlanta Linux Fest which occurred over the weekend .
During the announcement , he also explained the rationale for the name and why it will lead to a sweet smell .
" Coming up with a name for a distribution is a wonderful challenge and a
wonderful art form , " Shuttleworth said .
" Ubuntu 10.04 will be the Lucid Lynx which is a name
that I think brings together all of the key characteristics that we're
striving for in our next LTS .
To be Lucid means to be very clear and focused on the important points . "
As far as the Lynx part goes , Shuttleworth noted that the Lynx is a predator , but it 's a very thoughtful and considered
predator that is focused on finding the right target opportunity at the
right time .
So what about the smell part ?
That 's where some Shuttleworth humor comes into play .
" Lynx is also well known as a global brand of deodorant so this year 's Ubuntu developer summit is going to be the sweetest smelling Ubuntu developer summit ever , " Shuttleworth said .
" Despite the fact that 's it 's happening in Dallas . "
The blogosphere is talking about the fact that we ’ve just signed a $ 680 billion defense bill without any national conversation while we are having a very heated debate about $ 90 billion a year for health care .

Avent dreams about a world where transit gets the military budget ; Yglesias has follow - up .
Here ’s my simple idea .
Let ’s say your salary is $ 60,000 / year , and you take one exemption .
According to this paycheck calculator , this is what your pay stub looks like every two weeks , leaving the States out of it :
You see your hard earned money pulled off into Social Security , Medicare and Federal Withholding .
If you are a person capable of harnessing great rage , your blood is probably boiling at the thought of the looters stealing from you .
Now let ’s do one of those informational nudge things .
Taking numbers from the Federal Budget from here , what if your paycheck looked like this instead , which is the same paycheck :
Here you get a special line that identifies the amount of the Federal Withholding was actually going to the defense budget all along , and it tells you what it is .
You get a number that lets you identify exactly how much of your time you are working to keep the defense budget as large as it is .
( Social Security % = Defense Spending % = 21 % ; Since SS has a fund it deals with , I assumed that [ ( Federal Withholding + Medicare ) * 21 % / ( 1 – 21 % ) ] = Defense Spending , since I just wanted to take Social Security out of the front and back end .
Right way to approach it ? )
There was a similar argument with ‘ menu labeling ’ , where chain fast food restaurants have to give the amount of calories with the menu , in order to give consumers better information .
There ’s evidence that it has n’t changed consumer behavior when its been tried .
Karl Smith has an excellent writeup .
I ’m not sure if that means it is a failure ; if the calorie intact went up , for instance , would n’t it be a success still ?
People may have wanted to eat more junk food calories , and were unfortunately eating fewer calories than they thought they were , and now that they know better they can go to town on an super - sizes .
So it goes with benevolent nudging paternalism !
It ’s equally possible that workers will see this and think they want to spend more on the military .
The half of the day it takes to get to that $ 97 , sometime around 2 pm on your Monday of the two week cycle , may be too little , and people might want to work until late Tuesday to make sure Blackwater is keeping its returns high .
That ’s how it goes .
How much of your two weeks work cycle would you like to spend working to keep a global military hegemony going ?
I ’d probably want to clock it out around my first coffee break on Monday ( which is fairly early ) , but that ’s me .
But either way , making this information much more clear to workers would make for a much more interesting discussion when it comes to how our federal money gets spent .
Before the financial crisis , the banking industry was too concentrated and clubby .
And now ?
It ’s even more so .
In the midst of the crisis , the country ’s four biggest banks — Citigroup , Bank of America , JPMorgan Chase , and Wells Fargo — actually got bigger .
Thanks primarily to a series of government - sanctioned mergers , they now control almost forty per cent of the country ’s total banking deposits and two - thirds of its credit cards , and issue half of all mortgages .
Investment banking , too , remains more or less dominated by the usual suspects , which have seen their market share grow as the number of their competitors has shrunk .
Firms that were recently on the brink of collapse have n’t had to struggle to hold on to their old customers , as you might have imagined .
They ’ve had to struggle to keep up with their new ones .
Illustration by Christoph Niemann
This is n’t because the big banks have been making a special effort to be customer - friendly .
On the contrary , in the credit - card market they ’ve slashed credit lines and jacked up interest rates .
In retail banking , they have n’t capitalized on the benefits of size ( like lower borrowing costs ) to cut prices for their customers , the way big retailers like Wal - Mart do .
Instead , they typically pay lower interest rates on deposits than smaller banks do , and charge higher interest rates on loans .
Overdraft fees , too , have typically been higher at big banks than they are at smaller ones .
In investment banking , there has traditionally been little or no competition on price , and that has n’t changed .
There are no discounts in the M. & A. department .
So why are n’t customers and clients moving on ?
In the case of ordinary consumers , “ switching costs ” have a major effect .
It ’s a serious hassle to shut down a bank account and transfer money to a new one , especially with direct deposit , automatic bill payments , and the like .
The same is true of refinancing at a different bank from the one that currently holds your mortgage , or trying to persuade a new bank to give you a business loan .
These costs are n’t trivial : a 2001 study showed that the cost of switching a loan came to about a third of the loan ’s annual interest rate .
Even if people are dissatisfied with their bank , it ’s usually cheaper not to fight than to switch .
If you ’re a restaurant or a retailer , you have to work hard to insure that your customers keep coming back .
But once banks get a customer he ’s pretty much theirs for good .
The big banks have the further advantage of their brands , however tattered the brands may be .
It ’s nearly impossible for consumers to evaluate how healthy a bank is .
So , at a time when banks are failing with some regularity , the size and ubiquity of these big banks is reassuring .
It seems improbable that they will simply vanish ( the way a bank like IndyMac did ) , because the government wo n’t allow it .
It ’s possible , in fact , that the crisis , instead of eroding the reputational advantages of the big banks , ended up bolstering them .
In times of uncertainty , people are inclined to shun experiment for the safe choice .
Reputation arguably plays an even bigger role in the competition for corporate business .
A major part of what Wall Street firms do for their clients is , in effect , to vouch for their financial prospects : when a bank underwrites a company ’s bond offering or an I.P.O. , it is essentially certifying that company in the eyes of investors .
Companies hire high - profile firms to advise on mergers not just for the advice but for the public signature of approval .
The more powerful the bank that ’s giving the advice , the better the cover it offers .
Success , then , feeds on itself : having a big market share today makes it easier to win business tomorrow .
Researchers have found that during the stock - market bubble of the late nineteen - nineties higher - reputation banks actually did a worse job of managing I.P.O.s : they regularly set new stock offerings at a point well below what the market was willing to pay .
But companies still avidly wanted those banks to run their public offerings .
Similarly , a series of studies of M. & A. advice has found no evidence that deals managed by market - dominant , high - reputation firms work out better .
No matter — a 2007 paper by economists from M.I.T. found that banks were generally hired not on the basis of their performance but on the basis of their market share .
That makes it tough for newer or smaller competitors to break in : it ’s a variant of the “ to get a job you need experience , but you ca n’t get experience without a job ” problem .
Should we worry about all this concentration ?
Maybe megabanks are what we need .
Certainly most developed nations have banking systems even more concentrated than ours .
The trouble is that the “ market ” for banking is so distorted — by switching costs , by government subsidies and guarantees , and by the banks ’ market power — that it ’s hard to know whether big banks are adding value or are simply exploiting their oligopolistic positions .
We do know that too much concentration in finance increases risk , since a handful of dominant players are more likely to make the same kinds of mistakes , and jeopardize the entire system .
Unless consumers rise up en masse to move their money to credit unions , the market is n’t going to deal with the problem .
And that means Washington has to . ♦
Two pilots will parachute from a passenger jet before it crash - lands at high speed in an empty desert as part of a scientific experiment to be screened on television next year .
Viewers will be able to watch as the pilots board the plane before setting it on a collision course for the Channel 4 documentary .
Plane Crash is expected to give scientists invaluable information about how aircraft react in potentially fatal accidents .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The 300 - seat wide - bodied passenger jet will be loaded with cameras and sensors , along with crash test dummies taking the place of passengers and crew .
The landing site will be filmed from every angle .
Broadcasters expect the footage and data will give scientists an " unprecedented insight " into what happens when a plane crashes , enabling experts to study how areas such as seatbelt design , seat arrangement and overhead baggage can have an impact on passenger safety .
Producer Geoff Deehan , at Dragonfly Film and Television Productions Ltd , said : " As well as making spectacular television , we hope Plane Crash will be one of the most useful experiments ever in the history of aviation , an experiment devised , run and supervised by some of the world 's leading aviation experts - experts who are consulted by all the world 's leading aircraft manufacturers on aircraft safety , crashworthiness and survivability .
" It will give us unprecedented answers to the big question : how can we make air crashes more survivable ? "
Prof R John Hansman , one of the scientists involved in the experiment , said the crash would give experts a " rare " opportunity to examine a crash test on a " full - scale aircraft " .
" Much of our understanding of aircraft impact phenomena comes from accident investigations where we only have limited data , " he said .
" It is rare to be able to instrument an aircraft to be able to document what is going on inside and outside of the aircraft during a crash event .

" This will provide valuable data to calibrate models of crash dynamics , forces on the passengers , and post - crash fire .
We often crash - test automobiles but we rarely are able to conduct crash tests on full - scale aircraft . "
The T. Wilson Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics added : " This will be a remarkable opportunity to increase passenger survivability . "
The documentary has been announced as part of the new season on Channel 4 .
Programme makers are keeping the location of the crash under wraps but say they have overcome the " known obstacles " and are ready to press ahead with the purchase of the passenger jet .
The aircraft , a secondhand plane , will crash - land in such a way that it will not be completely destroyed , simulating the most common type of serious - and survivable - incident .
The identities of the two pilots have yet to be announced but they are understood to have backgrounds with the US navy .
The documentary is among a number of new programmes planned for the 2010 season , which will begin with the UK television premiere of the Oscar - winning film Slumdog Millionaire .
This will be followed with a special one - off episode from The Secret Millionaire series - The Slumdog Secret Millionaire - in which a female British - Indian entrepreneur will leave her affluent lifestyle behind to go incognito in India .
The programme will feature in the channel 's India Season , along with a special edition of Dispatches and Gordon 's Great Escape , showing chef Gordon Ramsay 's first trip to India .
Other highlights for the new season include Blitz Street - a science and history series presented by Tony Robinson which will show a typical row of 1940s terrace houses being subjected to a range of high explosives similar to those used by the Luftwaffe .
Chef Heston Blumenthal will return to the small screen with his second series of Heston 's Feasts , along with the final series of Celebrity Big Brother .
Celebrity endorsements are an interesting thing : on one hand they will almost certainly boost sales of the product or service in question .
On the other hand the celebrity will most likely look back on the endorsement in their twilight years with a new found sense of shame and regret .
1 Ice Hockey by Activision Phil Hartman
What is Phil Hartman ’s best performance as an actor ?
Scholars and nerds alike will debate the topic until the end of days and through most of the Rapture .
But you ’re kind enough to have spent precious minutes of your life reading this article so I ’ll give you the answer : it was Blasto .
But his second best performance was actually for Activision ’s Ice Hockey , thirty seconds of film more terrifying than Apocalypse Now .
A young , classy and not - at - all - a- corpse Phil enters his local hobby shop .
He ’s searching for his white whale : Ice Hockey by Activision .
Of course , the shop - keep has it , but he ca n’t just sell it to Phil .
No , that would be too easy .
“ Think you ’re ready for it ? ” asks the shop - keep , knowing very well that the best sales pitch is one that questions the customer ’s masculinity .
Phil scoffs at this .
Hell , it ’s just a video game , like Ms. Pac Man or Pong .
How many balls could it possibly bust ?
All of them , apparently .
The shop - keep continues to warn
Phil that this is n’t just Ice Hockey .
It ’s Ice Hockey by Activision .
This shit ’ll mess you up .
He demonstrates by playing the game , pointing out that it ’s just like real hockey if real hockey went straight to hell .
Having been challenged by a complete stranger over a matter of no importance , Phil begins to freak out .
As Hulkamania runs wild through him the innocent woman in the background suddenly begins to fear for her safety .
After watching the game for all of nine seconds
Phil is foaming at the mouth .
After bringing his customer to a crazy boil the shop - keep successfully sells the title despite permanently scarring another potential customer in the process .
At this point we can only assume that after thrashing about the store like a rabid animal , Phil would quietly pay and leave before sitting in his car , contemplate his life and silently sob for half an hour .
Sadly , the commercial ends too soon , leaving us to wonder what could have been had he not moved on to have an actual career .
2 Spider -Man for Atari Spider - Man
Some would argue that Spider - Man is n’t a celebrity .
To those people I would argue screw you , Spider - Man is awesome .
Spider - Man is also one of the whiniest dudes in comic book history .
It does n’t matter what ’s going on in his life : his girlfriend could be taken to an alternate dimension or Doctor Octopus could kidnap his aunt and force her into marriage for reasons I can’t really remember , and Perter Parker will take time out of his busy schedule of kissing ladies upside down to post sad poetry to his MySpace account .
Despite this , he ’s also borderline invincible .
He ’s thwarted everyone from Macho Man Randy Savage and Topher Grace to the terror that is hunger ( with the help of Hostess Fruit Pies , of course ) .
Given this impressive resume you may be a bit disappointed to learn that all it takes to outwit Peter Parker is an Atari and about thirty seconds of spare time .
Spider - Man ’s downfall begins when The Green Goblin leaps onto a New York city rooftop .
Logic would dictate that anyone who could make such a jump without the aid of a complex pulley - lever system could beat down any angst - ridden teenager regardless of web slinging capabilities , but that is apparently not the case .
Anyway , after making this terrifying entrance , he informs Spider - Man that he ’s placed time - bombs through out the city .
He then proceeds to laugh like a coked - out hyena before the camera reveals that Spider - Man is playing his own video game and the city the Goblin was referring to is actually part of the game .
Programming a terrible game is n’t actually a crime , but laws be damned , Spider - Man will stop this plot most foul !
As the Web - Slinger feels the pressure of saving those non-existent citizens from a non-existent threat , the Goblin continues to ruthlessly taunt him while conveniently describing game play for any passer - by that may be watching the situation unfold ..
Also , the fuse on his pumpkin bomb seems to get shorter and longer between shots .
Indeed , continuity in comics means nothing anymore .
Their back and forth continues for a brief moment before the pressure of playing his own game cracks Spider - Man like a farm - fresh egg .
Having successfully gotten under his advisery ’s skin the Green Goblin takes off , perhaps to plant bombs in Super Mario Bros .
He also leaves a bomb on top of the T.V. , but Spidey ’s too busy complaining to notice .
3 Atari Console Pete Rose & Don Knotts
Sometimes the best way to sell something is to blow your audiences ’ minds with as much star power as possible within a thirty second period , and with that in mind Atari treated us with a double feature .
First up is baseball legend Pete Rose .
To be honest , I ’m not much of sports fan but I could tell Rose was a baseball player by detecting two tell - tale clues : he ’s holding a bat and is wearing a single glove but not singing Thriller .
As Rose prepares to hit a dinger he challenges his foe , an Atari , to throw his best pitch .
Again , to be honest , I ’m not much of a doctor , but I can tell that Rose is suffering from some sort of head trauma because he challenged a poorly - made electronic device to throw a baseball as fast as it could , a demand that can only end in disappointment for all parties involved .
The camera then cuts to some footage of an Atari baseball game , wherein a blue guy throws a rectangle before teleporting away .
Then , three red dudes river dance .
An umpire then pops out from behind the television to inform Rose that he ’s out .
It ’s odd that a television would need an umpire but if your aim is so terrible that an inanimate object can manage to strike you out with a spitball , it ’s probably for the best .
Act two presents us with a much more grim scenario .
Lovable scamp and world - renowned old guy Don Knotts has been incarcerated for his crimes against his young and sexy tenants .
What landed him in prison is never really elaborated on so my assumption may be way off base , but I ’ve seen enough episodes of Three ’s Company to know that he ’s clearly off his rocker .
Gripping the bars , he delivers his only line of the ad , a threat to the one who brought him to justice : “ You ca n’t keep me in here , Atari . ”
He then proceeds to stare into your very soul , longing for the freedom that was taken from him .
After some Breakout footage Knotts manages to escape through an unexplained hole in his wall .
Given that this takes place in a universe where Pete Rose is a worse batter than gambler and Don Knotts is a convicted felon , chances are he simply punched through the wall with the raw fury of ten - thousand men .
It ’s a scary world that Atari lives in .
Sorry this one is so late , some friends and I went to see 2012 for our weekly Bad Movie Night , and ... holy god .
Normally the movies we watch are at the very least entertaining , but that movie is fucking AWFUL .
See you tomorrow .
One of the interesting aspects of the Go language is interface objects .
In Go , the word interface is overloaded to mean several different things .
Every type has an interface , which is the set of methods defined for that type .
This bit of code defines a struct type S with one field , and defines two methods for S .
type S struct { i int }
func ( p * S ) Get ( ) int { return p.i }
func ( p * S ) Put ( v int ) { p.i = v }
You can also define an interface type , which is simply a set of methods .
This defines an interface I with two methods :
type I interface {
Get ( ) int ;
Put ( int ) ;
}
S is a valid implementation for I , because it defines the two methods which I requires .
Note that this is true even though there is no explicit declaration that S implements I . A
Go program can use this fact via yet another meaning of interface , which is an interface value :
func f(p I ) { fmt .
Println ( p.Get ( ) ) ; p. Put (1 ) }
Here the variable p holds a value of interface type .
Because S implements I , we can call f passing in a pointer to a value of type S :
var s S ; f( &s )
The reason we need to take the address of S , rather than a value of type S , is because we defined the methods on S to operate on pointers .
This is not a requirement — we could have defined the methods to take values — but then the Put method would not work as expected .
The fact that you do not need to declare whether a type implements an interface means that Go implements a form of duck typing .
This is not pure duck typing , because when possible the Go compiler will statically check whether the type implements the interface .
However ,
Go does have a purely dynamic aspect , in that you can convert from one interface type to another .
In the general case , that conversion is checked at runtime .
If the conversion is invalid — if the type of the value stored in the existing interface value does not satisfy the interface to which it is being converted — the program will fail with a runtime error .
For example , since every type satisfies the empty interface interface {} :
func g( i interface{} ) int { return i. ( I ) . Get ( ) }
func h( ) {
var s S ;
fmt. Println ( g( &s ) ) ;
fmt.Println ( g(s ) ) ; // will fail at runtime
}
The first call to g will work fine and will print 0 .
The second call will fail at runtime ; when using gccgo , the program will print
panic : interface conversion failed : no ' Get ' method
This is because , as discussed above , a value of type S rather than *S does not have any methods .
So , how does this work ?
I will describe the current gccgo implementation .
The implementation used in the 6g/8g compiler is generally similar but is different in important respects .
For every type which is converted to an interface type , gccgo will build a type descriptor .
Type descriptors are used by the type reflection support in the reflect package , and they are also used by the internal runtime support .
Type descriptors are defined in the file libgo / runtime / go - type.h in the source code .
The relevant part here is that for each type they define a ( possibly empty ) list of methods .
For each method five pieces of information are stored : a hash code for the type of the method ( i.e. , the parameter and result types ) ; the name of the method ; for a method which is not exported , the name of the package in which it is defined ; the type descriptor for the type of the method ; a pointer to the function which implements the method .
In gccgo , an interface value is really a struct with three fields ( libgo / runtime / interface.h ) : a pointer to the type descriptor for the type of the value currently stored in the interface value ; a pointer to a table of functions implementing the methods for the current value ; a pointer to the current value itself .
The table of functions is stored sorted by the name of the method , although the name does not appear in the table .
Calling a method on an interface means calling a specific entry in this table , where the entry to call is known at compile time .
Thus the table of functions is essentially the same as a C++ virtual function table , and calling a method on an interface requires the same series of steps as calling a C++ virtual function : load the address of the virtual table , load a specific entry in the table , and call it .
When a value is statically converted to an interface type , the gccgo compiler will build the table of methods required for that value and that interface type .
This table is specific to the pair of types involved .
gccgo will give this table comdat linkage , so that it is only built once for each pair of types in a program .
Thus a static conversion to an interface simply requires loading the three fields of the interface struct with values known at compile time .
A dynamic conversion from one interface type to another is more complex .
Of the three fields in an interface value , the type descriptor and the pointer to the real value can simply be copied to the new interface value .
However , the table of methods must be built at runtime .
This is done by looking at the list of methods defined in the value ’s type descriptors and the list of methods defined in the type descriptor for the interface type itself .
Both lists are sorted by the name of the method .
The runtime code ( libgo / runtime / go - convert - interface.c ) merges the two sorted lists to produce the method table .
The merging is done using the name of the method and the type hash code .
If the interface requires a method which the type does not provide , the conversion fails .
Interfaces in
Go are similar to ideas in several other programming languages : pure abstract virtual base classes in C++ ; typeclasses in Haskell ; duck typing in Python ; etc .
That said , I ’m not aware of any other language which combines interface values , static type checking , dynamic runtime conversion , and no requirement for explicitly declaring that a type satisfies an interface .
The result in Go is powerful , flexible , efficient , and easy to write .
As Windows 2000 was being developed in the second half of the 1990s , Microsoft was firmly focused on building in as much functionality as possible , in a play to push Novell Netware aside and establish Windows NT as the operating system for the business world .
When NT was released to manufacturing ten years ago , it was well - received by reviewers , businesses , and enthusiasts alike , and for much of the decade the OS has been considered by some to be the pinnacle of Windows releases .
Its headline business features — Active Directory , Group Policy , Internet Information Services , Management Console , Windows Management Instrumentation — have become industry standards .
But most importantly , Windows NT served as the technological basis for what can fairly be described as the most successful and well - known software product of all time : Windows XP .
But there ’s always been a dirty little secret hiding underneath that iconic field of green grass .
From an engineering and security standpoint , the foundation of Windows 2000 and Windows XP is absolutely horrible .
The many security shortfalls of Windows have been discussed at length over the years .
Terms like “ Nimda , ” “ Code Red , ” and “ Messenger Service ” can still give battle - hardened IT administrators involuntary twitches .
Malware evolved from being the hobbyhorse of bored teenagers into being a profitable industry .
It was the sorry state of security that led Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates to announce a company - wide " Trustworthy Computing " initiative ; he told the company 's software developers that " when we face a choice between adding features and resolving security issues , we need to choose security .
This resulted in Windows Vista and Server 2008 being delayed by years , so that Microsoft could focus instead on fixing many of the worst security problems in Windows XP and Server 2003 .
While the improvements made in XP Service Pack 2 such as the on - by - default firewall , less permissive Internet Explorer , and tightened permissions were both necessary and welcome ( despite the slow uptake ) , it did n’t take long for it to become obvious that Windows had received first aid , not surgery — the rate at which new security vulnerabilities were found barely abated .
Even now , more than five years since the release of XP SP2 , the rate at which new security vulnerabilities are found remains steady .
Microsoft ’s problems with Windows development extended well beyond security .
By the time Windows Server 2003 was released , Microsoft had come to accept that while it was pretty good at producing a fully - featured NT - based operating system with an extensive graphical user interface , it was wholly unable to produce a fully - featured NT - based operating system without one .
Evidence of reliance on the presence of a graphical user interface can be seen all through older Windows 2000 and Windows XP .
For example , there were no command - line tools to configure and install patches and software from Windows Update , nor was it even possible to select the updates to install without using Internet Explorer .
Another problem was the tendency of some low - level system services to present graphical interfaces to the user , and to make use of code inside of DLLs that were primarily concerned with displaying a user interface .
Worse still for Microsoft ’s thousands of Windows developers , Windows had become such a large project that it was extremely difficult for any group to make changes to one part of the system and know exactly how those changes would affect the rest of the system .
Readers who are familiar with Windows Embedded ( and third - party tools like nLite ) are probably scratching their heads right about now , wondering what all the fuss is about .
Has n’t the ability to build a small version of Windows for a specific purpose been around for a very long time ?
Yes , it has , but the approach used by these tools is roughly equivalent to taking a hacksaw to a large Persian rug in order to make it fit in a smaller room .
Sure , it ’s still a rug , but it ’s a pretty nasty way of getting the job done .
Windows Embedded , nLite , and similar tools simply chop the unwanted DLL files from the system , twiddle a few things here and there in the Registry , and call it a day .
With Windows Embedded , this may not be such a bad approach , because the intended purpose of Windows Embedded is to run a single application , such as a kiosk , ATM , or outdoor display .
But for a general - purpose operating system , it ’s just not an option .
Getting to the Core of the problem
With these problems in mind , Microsoft assembled a team of core operating system architecture experts that were tasked with mapping out the many interdependencies between the 5,500 + components of Windows , and devising a plan to separate them into “ layers . ”
The lowest layer would become a self - contained system that has no understanding of , or dependence on , the large majority of Windows .
Successive layers would include more functionality , but would only be dependent on layers underneath it .
This project , which was underway by the end of 2003 , was given an internal name of “ MinWin . ”
The first real manifestation of this componentization effort was the Windows Server Core installation option in Windows Server 2008 .
The Server Core pitch is simple and compelling enough — it ’s still Windows , but without the vast majority of the desktop components that have no place on a dedicated server .
You get something that can still run your Active Directory domain controllers , your file shares , and your DNS servers , without having to be bothered by installing patches for Internet Explorer , Windows Media and a host of other components that were welded into prior releases of Windows .
Fully two - thirds of the security patches released for Windows Server 2003 offered no actual increase in security for dedicated servers , but still required software to be installed and reboots to be performed on a near - monthly basis .
When you install Server Core , you are greeted with the familiar Windows login screen , complete with high - resolution graphics .
Log in , and you ’re presented with a command prompt .
Server Core in 2008 R2 is a vast improvement on 2008 in this area ; just type “ sconfig ” and you can step through some simple menus to configure networking , remote management , Windows Update , and domain participation .
A couple of graphical applications and configuration panels like Notepad , Task Manager , and Date and Time are still present , but all other tasks on the machine must either be done through command - line utilities , or via remote management .
What is offered in terms of UI capabilities is very basic .
Because Windows Explorer and many of the components of the Shell are n’t included in a Server Core install , applications like Notepad , which would normally show an “ Open ” dialog box like this :
instead looks like this :
Yes , that ’s really the Open dialog that was introduced with Windows 3.1 in 1992 !
Printing does n’t work because there is no print subsystem .
Help does n’t work , either , because neither the help files nor the help engine are installed .
Twelve fonts are available instead of the 50 or so that a full Server 2008 install will have .
Sounds good so far , yes ?
There ’s a big problem — a Server 2008
Core installation , without any installed roles or extra features , still has disk and memory requirements that handily exceed a full Windows 2000 install .
Server 2008 R2 ’s memory consumption is somewhat lower ( I estimate about 30 % lower than Server 2008 before roles and features are installed ) , but disk requirements remain high .
Microsoft says there are still about 600 interconnected DLLs and other binaries , totaling hundreds of megabytes .
None of these could be safely removed without causing other parts of the system to break .
Even Mark Russinovich , widely regarded as one of the world ’s top experts on Windows internals , admits that they still can’t predict what exactly would break .
Clearly , if Microsoft wants to demonstrate that its idea of a “ slimmed - down ” server operating system resembles something a bit smaller than , say , Canada with the northern territories chopped off , there is still a lot more to be done .
President Barack Obama promised to boost funding for national parks and forests , and a bill he signed on Oct. 30 , 2009 , has done just that .
In the latest appropriations bill for the Interior Department , which oversees national parks and forests , Congress approved about $ 2.7 billion to preserve and improve the tracts of land .
That 's a $ 218 million increase over the last National Park Service budget , or about 10 percent , according to the House Appropriations Committee .
About $ 2.2 billion will go to operating the national park system , and about $ 15 million will support a new grant program for park preservation , among other things .
National parks advocates praised the increase .
" This bill demonstrates a concerted effort by Congress and the Administration to restore our national treasures in time for the 2016 centennial of the National Park Service , " said Tom Kiernan , president of the National Parks Conservation Association .
" In general , yes we 're pleased , " said Myke Bybee , Sierra Club 's wilderness campaigns coordinator .
" There 's an increase — a modest increase — but an increase nonetheless ...
We feel that Obama lived up to his promise , so we 're pretty happy about it .
On this one , it 's a Promise Kept for Obama .
For example , the “ Silly Olympics ” sketch ( see script , right ) includes a gag about the inability of the competitors to hear the starting pistol in a race for the deaf .
Then there ’s the scene in which Chapman ( who in real life was gay ) lists the rules of the philosophy department at the University of Woolloomooloo : “ Rule 1 — No poofters ; Rule 2 —
No member of the faculty is to maltreat the Abos in any way whatsoever ( if there ’s anyone watching ) ; Rule 3 — No poofters ; Rule 4 — I do n’t want to catch anyone not drinking in their room after lights out ; Rule 5 — No poofters ; Rule 6 — No rule 6 ; Rule 7 — No poofters . ”
The greatest controversies , however , attached to the Pythons ’ last two films , The Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life .
Houston Dome –
The fourth - largest city in the United States and the largest city in Texas , Houston is vulnerable to killer hurricanes , extreme heat and other natural disasters .
And the problem is only getting worse as the city is forced to spend a fortune in a losing battle against nature .
Hence why a team of engineers decided that the most viable solution for the moment is to “ move the city indoors ” .
The Houston Dome surface area will stretch over 21 million sq ft , which will make it the biggest structure with the largest roof in the world .
The dome ’s panels will be 15 ft across , with over 147,000 to cover the city of Houston .
The only problem would be that using glass or plexiglass would make the whole structure extremely heavy .
But the answer comes from German city of Bremen , from a company dubbed Vector Foil .
Vector Foil manufactures an innovative strong , lightweight , transparent polymer known as ethylene tetra fluoro ethylene ( ETFE ) .
At just one percent of glass , ETFE is described as 99 percent nothing .
And considering that it can withstand winds of 180 miles per hour , it could be the breakthrough for the Houston Dome .
Designed to protect a city from a category - 5 hurricane , the Houston Dome raises other problems related to actually building the structure .
It will take years and billions of dollars , but would it be worth it ?

According to a press release from the University of Chicago Press :
Piecing together 3000 individual photographs , a physicist has made a new high - resolution panoramic image of the full night sky , with the Milky Way galaxy as its centerpiece .
Axel Mellinger , a professor at Central Michigan University , describes the process of making the panorama in the forthcoming issue of Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific .
An interactive version of the picture can viewed on Mellinger 's website .
" This panorama image shows stars 1000 times fainter than the human eye can see , as well as hundreds of galaxies , star clusters and nebulae , " Mellinger said .
Its high resolution makes the panorama useful for both educational and scientific purposes , he says .
Mellinger spent 22 months and traveled over 26,000 miles to take digital photographs at dark sky locations in South Africa , Texas and Michigan .
After the photographs were taken , " the real work started , " Mellinger said .
Simply cutting and pasting the images together into one big picture would not work .
Each photograph is a two - dimensional projection of the celestial sphere .
As such , each one contains distortions , in much the same way that flat maps of the round Earth are distorted .
In order for the images to fit together seamlessly , those distortions had to be accounted for .
To do that , Mellinger used a mathematical model - and hundreds of hours in front of a computer .
Another problem Mellinger had to deal with was the differing background light in each photograph .
" Due to artificial light pollution , natural air glow , as well as sunlight scattered by dust in our solar system , it is virtually impossible to take a wide - field astronomical photograph that has a perfectly uniform background , " Mellinger said .
To fix this , Mellinger used data from the Pioneer 10 and 11 space probes .
The data allowed him to distinguish star light from unwanted background light .
He could then edit out the varying background light in each photograph .
That way they would fit together without looking patchy .
The result is an image of our home galaxy that no star - gazer could ever see from a single spot on earth .
Mellinger plans to make the giant 648 megapixel image available to planetariums around the world .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Playboy founder Hugh Hefner changed American pop culture , one centerfold at a time .

With his Playboy Enterprises Inc in talks to be sold for about $ 300 million , the 83 year - old Hefner will be giving up control over the iconic adult entertainment empire he founded that was instrumental in shaping society ’s opinions on nudity , sex and free speech .
With $ 600 , Hefner in 1953 published the first Playboy magazine with a partially nude photo of Marilyn Monroe at its center .
The magazine would become not only one of the most successful publications ever , but also a brand that led many Americans to think about sex in a more carefree way .
“ Hef ” turned Playboy and its bunny head logo into a symbol for a lifestyle he embodied as bachelor extraordinaire , living in a mansion surrounded by wealth and beautiful women .
“ This guy was one of the major players in the transformation of American culture in the second half of the 20th century and not just because he had a magazine with naked women in it , ” said Robert Thompson , a professor of pop culture at Syracuse University .
In 1972 , Playboy had a worldwide circulation of 7 million , but that has been in decline ever since , as the liberalization of sexual attitudes Hefner promoted became more mainstream -- and more competitive .
But even as it grew ever more popular , the magazine created rivals such as Penthouse and Hustler .
In the 1980s , adult videos grew into a major business and by the late 1990s , the rise of the Internet and free pornography on the Web became Playboy ’s greatest rival for an audience .
REALITY STAR
Hefner remains in the limelight today , showing up at media events with numerous girlfriends by his side .
He enjoyed a role in reality television show “ The Girls Next Door ” on cable network E ! and his dating life and break - up with model Holly Madison made him a staple of celebrity magazines .
Hefner has said that growing up during the depression he always looked back wistfully to the 1920s age of flappers as an era of freedom he had missed .
He has described himself as having liberated America from its Puritan past and experts agree he did make sexual images and content more acceptable to Americans .
But Playboy magazine also showed men how to enjoy stylish clothing , good liquor , sports cars and other luxuries , and became a standard bearer for that lifestyle -- real or imagined .
“ All that kind of stuff just piled up issue after issue -- promoting that idea of consumer abundance as being synonymous with the good life in this country -- and Hefner is very important in promoting that idea , ” said Steven Watts , author of “ Mr. Playboy : Hugh Hefner and the American Dream . ”
But as Playboy ’s fortunes waned , some of the symbols of wealth that surrounded Hefner became harder for him to hang on to .
In the early 1980s , he had to give up a private jet plane with a bedroom , a miniature disco and a kitchen , Watts said .
Through the decades and despite the loss of business , Hefner continued to live the good life and made sure everyone knew it .
“ Hefner really tries to completely disengage the notion of guilt and sin from having a good time and , the last couple of generations , that has pretty much prevailed , ” said Thompson , the Syracuse professor .
“ Certainly , when I talk to my students , I do n’t get a sense they ’re feeling guilty about the good deal of fun they ’re having . ”
Eighty files are to be sent to the Republic 's Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) by a garda team investigating fresh complaints of clerical child abuse .
The complaints were made after publication in May of the Ryan report , which detailed horrific physical and sexual abuse perpetrated by members of religious orders .
The revelation comes as gardai turn their attention to investigating priests in the Dublin Archdiocese who are the subject of the Murphy report , which was published this week .
Bishops who served in the Dublin Archdiocese while children were being sexually abused were desperately resisting calls for their resignations last night .
Pope Benedict XVI remained silent over the devastating abuse report , which accused the Church of " denial , arrogance and cover - up " , with survivors saying there was no regard within the Catholic Church for child welfare .
The Pope 's representative in Ireland gave an assurance to the Irish public that Pope Benedict was committed to rooting paedophile priests from the ranks of the Irish clergy .
Apostolic Nuncio , Archbishop Giuseppe Leanza , said Pope Benedict had told all the Irish bishops during their meeting with him in Rome after the Ferns report of his abhorrence of child sexual abuse .
A number of bishops yesterday issued apologies for their handling of complaints -- but none went so far as to say they would resign .
Bishop of Limerick , Donal Murray , was found by the Murphy inquiry to have handled a number of complaints and suspicions " badly " .
But he insisted he would not resign .
" I certainly was never involved in a cover - up .
I was not involved in covering up , " he said .
" I do n't think I was aware of the scale of it .
I am horrified at the scale of it ( the report ) . "
Both Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny and prominent priest Fr Brian D'Arcy said the Limerick bishop should resign following the shocking revelations .
" In my view , from the point of view of personal leadership , of Church integrity , to have any semblance of moral authority to lead , people who were in positions and are still in positions should not continue in those positions , " said Mr Kenny .
Fr D'Arcy said the findings of the report were " absolutely sickening " .
And he pointed out that although he served on the Council of Priests in Dublin during the 1990s , he never even " heard a hint " of accusations of abuse .
" This is not just in the diocese , this goes right to the top in Rome , " he said , adding that the policy of cover - up was the same in Ferns and in Boston , where a similar investigation was carried out .
Meanwhile , publication of the Ryan report in May resulted in around 150 calls to a special phoneline and led to new lines of inquiry being opened .
The flood of complaints was lodged with the gardai following the publication of the report into horrific levels of physical and sexual abuse perpetrated by religious orders .
A group of clerics accused of abuse offences have since died and those inquiries have been ended by the gardai , while other callers wanted details of progress on allegations that had already been made .
But 80 individual allegations are being actively pursued , with inquiries being carried out in the Irish Republic and in the UK .
Each one will result in a file to the Irish DPP , who will determine if criminal charges should be brought against the suspects .
Around 60 pc of the fresh complaints involved sexual abuse of children by members of religious orders , while the rest referred to physical assaults .
Meanwhile , a separate hotline , established by the gardai this week for victims in the wake of the publication of the report on abuse in the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin , has so far received about a dozen calls .
Garda Commissioner Fachtna Murphy said he had ordered an examination of the findings of the report on the handling of complaints and investigations by the Church and state authorities .
He said he had asked Assistant Commissioner John O'Mahony to carry out the investigation and make inquiries as he deemed appropriate and to issue a report to him with recommendations .
Mr Murphy said he would then consult with the Republic 's DPP as to what issues arose in the context of criminal liability .
He stressed that garda investigations could never be influenced by the profession or background of a suspect and must concentrate on dealing sensitively with victims , applying the best investigative methods , and placing a case before the courts to secure a just outcome .
" The commission has identified failings on the part of both Church and state authorities in their response to complaints of child sexual abuse .
The focus of this examination will be to establish whether those failings amounted to criminal behaviour . "
Mr Murphy appealed to victims or anybody with information about criminal offences in the context of the report to contact the gardai .

Australia 's largest irrigation property , Cubbie Station , is about to be placed in voluntary administration .
Cubbie Station sits on the upper reaches of the mighty Murray - Darling river system , and its water storage capacity is equal to that of Sydney Harbour .
The move into administration means the massive cotton farm in southern Queensland could be snapped up for far less than the rumoured asking price of $ 450 million .
Cubbie Station 's huge water storage capacity is often blamed for the lack of water downstream .
But Cubbie group chairman Keith De Lacy says Australia 's largest cotton farm has been beaten by the drought .
" This drought has gone on just two years longer than it should have done , by all the record keeping and analysis that we 've done , and it 's just pushed us over , " he said .
Cubbie was put up for sale in August with a rumoured price tag of $ 450 million .
But it is believed the five bids made were too low to match even the $ 320 million in debts to the National Australia Bank and Suncorp .
Mr De Lacy says now that the banks have appointed administrators McGrathNicol , Cubbie could be snapped up cheaply .
" That 's the likelihood , but that will be determined over the next few weeks , " he said .
" If the bank is moving in that direction , they must have decided that they 're going to accept less than what they 're owed . "
Ian Burnett from the rural lobby group AgForce says several grower groups have shown an interest in purchasing Cubbie .
" It would n't take that much for the whole operation to turn around , " he said .
" We 're hopeful that this summer will provide better season conditions .
If we get continued dry periods and there 'll only be a limited time to how long they can continue operating . "
Cubbie ' not to blame '
Cubbie Station has long attracted controversy over its massive water allocations .
New South Wales , Victoria and South Australia have all argued the cotton farm colossus in Queensland takes too much water from the Murray - Darling system .
But Mike Young , the director of the Environment Institute at Adelaide University , says Cubbie is not to blame for a lack of water downstream .
" Cubbie 's been an icon because it 's so big and because of where it 's located , " he said .
" But the reality is that even if all the water was left in the river at Cubbie , then irrigators in New South Wales would end up taking the water out and very little would make it through - that 's because of the way the licences are written at the moment .
" It 's possible to negotiate what are called shepherding agreements to take water all the way through .
" But even then most of the water is lost .
You 'd only get about 10 to 15 per cent of the water in Cubbie all the way through to the River Murray . "
The Federal Government wants to buy back water across the Murray - Darling Basin , and has already started .
But Professor Young doubts the Commonwealth would be interested in Cubbie Station .
" I would be surprised if they would be interested at buying Cubbie unless the price became very , very low , " he said .
" At the moment the priority and the urgency is in the southern connected system around the Murrumbidgee and the Murray and all of the tributaries of Victoria .
" I 'm sure [ Water Minister ] Penny Wong and her staff are all looking very carefully at the southern system because that 's where the problems are . "
Neither the Commonwealth nor the Queensland Government would comment on Cubbie going into administration .

Advertisement A European satellite is set to provide major new insights into how water is cycled around the Earth .
The Smos spacecraft will make the first global maps of the amount of moisture held in soils and of the quantity of salts dissolved in the oceans .
The data will have wide uses but should improve weather forecasts and warnings of extreme events , such as floods .
A Rockot launcher carrying Smos lifted off from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia at 0450 ( 0150 GMT ) on Monday .
Some 70 minutes later , the upper -stage of the Rockot released the spacecraft , and telemetry confirming all was well with the mission was acquired by the Hartebeesthoek ground station , near Johannesburg , South Africa .
The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity ( Smos ) satellite is part of an armada of European spacecraft being sent into orbit over the next few years to study the planet .
The mission will run for three years in the first instance " We had a very beautiful launch , " said Jean - Jacques Dordain , the director - general of the European Space Agency ( Esa ) .
" This is not just a satellite ; this is a very important event .
This is the second of our Earth Explorers and with that we confirm that Esa is the space agency of the world making the best efforts for Earth science and a new understanding of climate change . "
Smos carries a single instrument - an interferometric radiometer called Miras .
Some eight metres across , it has the look of helicopter rotor blades .
Miras will measure changes in the wetness of the land and in the salinity of seawater by observing variations in the natural microwave emission coming up off the surface of the planet .
It carries 69 antennas positioned on a central structure and along the lengths of its three arms .
The whole system is folded for launch to fit inside the rocket , and its correct unfurling on day two of the mission will be a critical procedure .
" We do it in two steps , " said Francois Bermudo , the Smos project manager with the French space agency ( CNES ) .
" The arms are attached by 12 nuts , four on each arm .
First , the pyrotechnic sequence will cut nine nuts so that each arm is held by one nut .
Then we will fire the final nuts to have a synchronous opening of the arms .
It will take about three minutes , " he told BBC News .

Advertisement Smos data will result in a better understanding of the hydrological cycle - the description of how water is constantly exchanged between the Earth 's land and ocean surfaces and the atmosphere .
Information from Smos is expected to help improve short and medium - term weather forecasts , and also have practical applications in areas such as agriculture and water resource management .
In addition , climate models should benefit from having a more precise picture of the scale and speed of movement of water in the different components of the hydrological cycle .
ESA'S EARTH EXPLORERS
Goce is mapping the subtle variations in Earth 's gravity field Smos will study ocean salinity and soil moisture Cryosat - 2 ( above ) is designed to map the Earth 's ice cover Aeolus will use an innovative laser to measure winds Swarm is a trio of satellites to map the Earth 's magnetism Earthcare will examine the formation and effects of clouds Explorer 7 will emerge from a current selection competition Explorer 8 is open to ideas from the scientific community
Ice mission returns for second go The satellite is part of Esa 's Earth Explorer programme - eight spacecraft that will acquire data on issues of pressing environmental concern .
The first is already in orbit - a mission called Goce , which is mapping variations in the pull of gravity across the Earth 's surface .
Smos is the second Explorer to launch ; and a third spacecraft , known as Cryosat , is due to go into space early next year .
Cryosat will assess the state of the world 's ice cover .
" We 've been waiting a long time to get the Earth Explorers up , " explained Dr Volker Liebig , the director of Earth observation at Esa .
" That is partly due to the waiting for launchers but also due to some technical problems , because all these missions are at the edge of technology and very innovative , " he told BBC News .
" Now , we are very happy because if Cryosat goes up in February , within 12 months we will have launched three of our Earth Explorers . "
The Smos programme cost is about 315 m euros ( $ 465 m ; £ 280 m ) .
It is led by Esa but with significant input from French and Spanish interests .
The satellite is expected to operate for at least three years .
" If the instrument is still in good shape and we get the funding from our delegations , we would extend the mission for another two years and then review it again , " said Dr Susanne Mecklenburg , the Esa Smos mission manager .
" From experience , Esa missions have lived for a lot longer than they were designed for . "
Smos shared its ride into space with a small Esa demonstration satellite called Proba - 2 ( PRoject for OnBoard Autonomy ) .
The spacecraft will test hardware and software that might be incorporated into future missions .
These include new types of computer , battery , thruster , and solar panel systems .
Confirmation of Proba - 2's successful separation from the Rockot upper - stage came three hours after launch .
The Smos instrument uses techniques pioneered in radio astronomy

Back in 1931 , for example , The New York Times attributed the emerging economic cataclysm to a “ mood of pessimism which had been carried to grotesque extremes . ”
In 1932 , it compared reckless talk about “ depression ” to shouting “ fire ” in a crowded theater .
President Roosevelt is widely remembered for saying , in 1933 , that “ the only thing we have to fear is fear itself . ”
But he was only repeating an oft - told message .
It was n’t until 1948 that the Columbia University sociologist Robert K. Merton wrote an article in The Antioch Review titled “ The Self - Fulfilling Prophecy , ” using the Great Depression as his first example .
He is often credited with having invented the “ self - fulfilling prophesy ” phrase , but by the 1930s the idea was already as commonplace as the breakfast toast made with modern electric toasters .
( Interestingly , the same Robert Merton documented the tendency for important ideas to be falsely attributed to celebrities . )
In fact , in 1937 , “ Think and Grow Rich , ” a book by Napoleon Hill , urged readers to adopt a positive mental attitude and to channel the power of the subconscious mind so that real wealth would follow .
It became a runaway best seller .
Faddish interest had already emerged not only in Freud ’s theory of the unconscious mind , but also in the theories of the psychologist Émile Coué , who urged people to recite that “ every day in every way I ’m getting better and better . ”
He said this “ autosuggestion ” would bolster the unconscious self .
In important ways , we are still using that 1930s pattern of thinking .
We are instinctively fearful of reckless talk about depressions , and we try to support one another ’s confidence .
We like the idea that modern scientific economics seems to show that all recessions end in due course .
For now , our common efforts at building confidence appear to be working somewhat .
But the economy has still not recovered , by any means .
COUÉISM has been discredited generally , as has much of the old business - cycle theory , but they live on in our popular notions about recessions .
We may hope that our resorting to euphemism and belief in timetables of business - cycle recoveries work better to restore confidence than they did in the ’30s .
The problem might be put this way :
There is still a nagging doubt afloat that the current event is really just another example in that long sequence of recessions .
In which mental category does the current contraction belong : recession or depression ?
We may still be at a tipping point .
To the extent that the theory of the self - fulfilling prophecy is correct , there is a case for continued vigilance , to ensure that adverse events do n’t encourage widespread talk of the second category .
I ’ve been thinking about money lately .
No , not just because I need more of it , but that haunts all of us from time to time .
I ’ve been thinking about how the various attempts at making our US currency more colorful and difficult to slap into a copier and come up with a decent counterfeit have only highlighted how incredibly lame our currency is compared with other nations .
Mexico , our North American sibling , is celebrating its bicentennial with a fabulous 200 Peso note , pictured here .
Not only does it feature Father Hidalgo proclaiming independence , it does it with an audacity that hopefully can make the whole nation proud .
My guess is that they had the dramatic and beautiful image they wanted to use , but realized that it was too vertical to plunk in the middle of an ordinary bill without it becoming pathetic and lost .
The solution was to orient the whole bill vertically to the picture , letting Father Hidalgo take up half of the note in all his glory .
It ’s dramatic , it ’s gorgeous , and if it does n’t arouse patriotic pride in Mexicans , nothing will .
From just over the Río Grande are notes often considered more desirable .
Our small portraits of Jackson are worth about as much as the 200 Peso note at purchasing power parity , but you would n’t know it to look at them .
Where Mexico and other nations have featured Poets and Revolutionaries , we have Presidents .
Tired , old , sometimes unknown people who are supposed to represent stability but often look simply worn .
Who are these guys ?
The truth is , the use of the people on our bills was an act of political compromise dating to 1919 .
The decision was to put the founders of the Democratic Party , Jefferson and Jackson , on the $ 2 and $ 20 , with the first Republicans , Lincoln and Grant , on the $ 5 and $ 50 .
The $ 1 , $ 10 , and $ 100 were given to non-partisans and Federalists Washington , Hamilton , and Franklin .
Once again , the American spirit of compromise got everyone past a difficult decision – and straight into major boredom .
No other nation has this problem .
Poets often feature well on currencies alongside founding revolutionaries .
I remember fondly the 10 Deutschemark note with Karl Friedrich Gauss , a mathematician , or the 20 Austrian Schilling note with Sigmund Freund .
These said something about the people that crafted and used them in a way that mere Presidents only hope to .
How do we ditch the bills we have ?
It starts by setting up an outline of all the security strips , magnetic ink , and other details that make them secure and countable in big piles by machines .
After that , the faces we use can be changed out with one gorgeous portrait after another , teaching a bit about our culture and encouraging people to collect them the way they do measly state quarters .
This is the USofA , after all , so it ’d never sell without some kind of windfall to the issuers .
I suggest that we consider forgetting the $ 1 and $ 2 and issuing the $ 5 , $ 10 , $ 20 , $ 50 , and $ 100 .
We can have series based on different kinds of heroes that define who we are as a people .
For artists , I would suggest Mark Twain , Scott Joplin , Emily Dickinson , Ansel Adams , and Georgia O’Keefe – but your mileage may vary .
I only ask that we have a bill with a portrait of Scott Joplin on the front with the first eight bars of “ Maple Leaf Rag ” on the back , ready to be pounded out on the piano by anyone willing to try .
After that , a series of scientists would be just glorious .
Imagine a bill with Edison on the front and the patent for the light bulb on the back , or Einstein ( a naturalized US citizen ! ) and an illustration of relativity on the back .
We could also have a series of important activists , such as Alice Paul , César Chávez , Dr. Martin Luther King and , if we can get it past the Republicans , Harvey Milk ( it ’s worth a try ) .
The possibilities become endless .
This may seem unimportant , but it ’s not .
Money is , no matter what , a statement of values and faith .
Are we a people characterized by who we elected or by the people that inspire us ?
Dead presidents may have been a decent compromise , but they are n’t who we are .
Let ’s have money that says more about the people of this great land than the politicians – if we really want to say it ’s ours and not theirs , that is .
The Blue Road
ROAD PAINTED IN BLUE – AMAZING STREET ART
Artist Henk Hofstra created an “ urban river ” in Drachten ( Netherlands ) .
The Blue Road installation is an example of what mind - blowing urban public art can be .
Featuring 1000 metres of road painted blue and the phrase “ Water is Life ” written in eight - meter - high letters across it , the Blue Road is reminiscent of the waterway that used to be where the road is now .
It ’s a memorial to nature , but it ’s also just plain awe - inspiring .
There ’s even a few cool tidbits along the road , like a sinking car .
The project took 4000 liters of paint and cost 75,000 Euros .
Half of the cost was covered by municipal funds .
I thought Ben Gordon was a big time scorer that could propel teams to victory just by getting his shots off .
Hmmm .
Maybe not ?
Last night Gordon stunk up the United Center in his first game against his old team and the Bulls beat the Pistons 92 - 85 .
Gordon shot just 6 - 16 and was 2 - 8 from beyond the arc .
He played some point and had the ball in his hands quite a bit , but somehow ended up with no assists .
True , the Pistons are without their main players , but the loss still sends them to 6 - 12 .
And Gordon could not lift them to victory , even if he did have ancient Lindsay Hunter guarding him for part of the game .
I hope now that since Gordon is in a different uniform fans can focus on his defensive play .
He was terrible as usual in that department last night and he had 5 fouls .
And when his shot is n’t falling — like last night — he ’s a big zero .
For the year he ’s shooting 43 % and just 36 % from 3 .
The Bulls miss Ben Gordon ?
A bit .
Of course they do .
At least his points .
But the main problem offensively has been that Pargo , Hinrich and especially Salmons have not played to their abilities .
Those 3 , as well as Rose to an extent , have to pick up the scoring that is missed with Gordon now a Piston .
The Highlights :
Young women in Fallujah in Iraq are terrified of having children because of the increasing number of babies born grotesquely deformed , with no heads , two heads , a single eye in their foreheads , scaly bodies or missing limbs .
In addition , young children in Fallujah are now experiencing hideous cancers and leukaemias .
These deformities are now well documented , for example in television documentaries on SKY UK on September 1 2009 , and on SKY UK June 2008 .
Our direct contact with doctors in Fallujah report that :
In September 2009 , Fallujah General Hospital had 170 new born babies , 24 % of whom were dead within the first seven days , a staggering 75 % of the dead babies were classified as deformed .
This can be compared with data from the month of August in 2002 where there were 530 new born babies of whom six were dead within the first seven days and only one birth defect was reported .
Doctors in Fallujah have specifically pointed out that not only are they witnessing unprecedented numbers of birth defects but premature births have also considerably increased after 2003 .
But what is more alarming is that doctors in Fallujah have said , " a significant number of babies that do survive begin to develop severe disabilities at a later stage " .
As one of a number of doctors , scientists and those with deep concern for Iraq , Dr Chris Burns - Cox , a British hospital physician , wrote a letter to the Rt. Hon.
Clare Short , M.P. asking about this situation .
She wrote a letter to the Rt. Hon.
Douglas Alexander , M.P. the Secretary of State of the Department for International Development ( a post she had held before she resigned on a matter of principle in May 2003 ) asking for clarification of the position of deformed children in Fallujah .
She received a reply dated 3rd September 2009 ( two days after the Sky TV broadcast of 1st September 2009 ) from a junior minister , deputy to The Secretary of State , Mr. Gareth Thomas MP , Duty Minister , Department for International Development .
In his reply he denies that there are more than two or three deformed babies in Fallujah in a year and asserts that there is , therefore , no problem .
This is at wild variance with reports coming out of Fallujah .
One grave digger of a single cemetery is burying four to five babies a day , most of which he says are deformed .
Clare Short passed us a copy of this letter .
It bears a remarkable similarity to three other written answers we have received over a four year period , in regard to child health and the use of depleted uranium .
All these letters are based on lies and an aim to confuse the recipients .
In her autobiography " Honorable Deception ? " Clare Short says
" The first instinct of Number 10 ( Downing Street ) is to lie . "
We regard the mendacity of Mr. Thomas 's letter , and of the other letters we have received , as extremely serious .
These letters do not deal with minor matters of corruption , or taxes , but do deal with the use of armed forces and deadly weapons .
The use of certain weapons has tremendous repercussions .
Iraq will become a country , if it has not already done so , where it is advisable not to have children .
Other countries will watch what has happened in Iraq , and imitate the Coalition Allies ' total disregard of the United Nations Charter , The Geneva , and Hague Conventions , and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court .
Some countries , such as Afghanistan , will also come to experience the very long term damage to the environment , measured in billions of years , and the devastating effect of depleted uranium and white phosphorous munitions .
If , as we say in our letter to the Duty Minister of the Department for International Development , the UK Government clearly does not know the effects of the weapons it uses , nor , as a matter of policy , does " it do body counts " , how can the UK Government judge whether it is conducting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan according to International Law , especially in terms of " proportionality " and long term damage to the natural environment ?
How can the UK know about the illegality of the weapons systems it sells on the international market , such as the " Storm Shadow " missile , if the very Department of the Government that is supposed to assess the deaths and medical needs of children and adults in Iraq is not telling the truth .
We request from the United Nations General Assembly the following :
1 . To acknowledge that there is a serious problem regarding the unprecedented number of birth defects and cancer cases in Iraq specifically in Fallujah , Basra , Baghdad and Al - Najaf .
2 . To set up an independent committee to conduct a full investigation into the problem of the increased number of birth defects and cancers in Iraq .
3 . To implement the cleaning up of toxic materials used by the occupying forces including Depleted Uranium , and White Phosphorus .
4 . To prevent children and adults entering contaminated areas to minimize exposure to these hazards .
5 . To investigate whether war crimes , or crimes against humanity , have been committed , and thereby uphold the United Nations Charter , The Geneva and Hague Conventions , and The Rome Statute of The International Criminal Court .
Please find enclosed a copy of our letter to Mr Gareth Thomas , dated 12th October 2009 , and his letter to The Rt Hon Clare Short , M.P. dated 3rd September 2009 , and enclosures relating to this matter .

Qantas says it does not deserve " in any way " the " Shonky " award it received from Choice today , for what the consumer watchdog believes is the airline 's " sky - high " surcharge on bookings made with a credit card .
The airline was named a winner in the awards today alongside a cereal brand , chicken stock and a food processor dubbed a " cheese - fearing surrender monkey " for its timid approach to a block of cheese .
The Shonky awards - now in their fourth year - aim to name and shame " dubious , dodgy and doubtful " products on the basis of their performance , pricing and marketing claims , Choice said .
Topping the list this year was Qantas 's $ 7.70 credit card surcharge per passenger for domestic flights , which Choice claimed was " way above " the average levy of 1 per cent paid by merchants to process Visa and MasterCard transactions .
The Covid economy has developers all over rethinking construction plans , especially office projects , since it seems pretty likely not nearly as many people will be going in to the office in our future .
And so it goes with Fortuitous Partners ’ soccer stadium project for a USL team in Pawtucket , which was going to involve $ 360 million in apartments , shops , offices , and a hotel and conference center to go along with the $ 40 million stadium , and which now will include something less than that :
Brett Johnson , one of the cofounders of Fortuitous told the Pawtucket City Council on Wednesday night that the project was being scaled back .
The former Apex site — the centerpiece of the project due to its highway visibility — is now being eliminated .
Johnson , who is also owner of the Phoenix Rising USL team , told the Providence Journal that his new price tag was “ likely in the ‘ low $ 300 million ’ range . ”
The pandemic , he explained , has reduced demand for office space , though he could still add more offices later if those become a thing again .
But at least if the project is slimmed down , it wo n’t need so much in public tax subsidies , right ?
Hahahahahaha , no :
The project is still looking for $ 70 to $ 90 million in public financing .
The company has hired high - powered Rhode Island lobbyists to try and secure the funding .
Or as the Journal says , in a sentence that manages to contradict itself in a single clause :
Johnson said Fortuitous still intends to privately finance the project using Opportunity Zone investments aided by tax increment financing with the city and state .
Kicking back $ 70 - million - plus in tax revenues to get a $ 40 million minor - league soccer stadium ( and a pile of other stuff ) never seemed like the best idea , but it ’s singularly worrisome at a time when minor - league sports is reeling and may never fully recover .
Here ’s Holy Cross economist Victor Matheson back in April on Pawtucket ’s USL plans :
“ This is a league with 100 teams and different tiers .
Minor league sports are above everything the sort of thing to get crushed by coronavirus — everything they do is about getting people into the stadium .
That ’s not going to be happening with this team , ” said Matheson .
“ And this is n’t Lucchino — this is n’t John Henry , or Bob Kraft .
These are often shoestring operations .
[ Coronavirus ] could bankrupt a reasonably large number of teams in that league and suddenly this is n’t the league it was before , ” added Matheson .
The tax increment financing plan still needs to be approved — I think by the state legislature , though it already approved a Pawtucket TIF district , so maybe just the city or the governor needs to okay it , really the reporting on this has been terrible — so there ’s still time for things like public hearings , if anyone believed in those anymore .
Maybe I ’ll see if I can ask Matheson about it when he and I join up as part of this big Zoom get - together on the Los Angeles Angels stadium deal tonight at 9:30 Eastern / 6:30 Pacific .
I ’m told it ’s going to be broadcast live on the Voice of OC ’s Facebook page , so check that out if you ’re interested — I anticipate being very active in the comments …
WHERE ARE THE JOBS CONGRESSMAN ?
I'LL TELL YOU
By : Devvy

ï¿½ 2009 - NewsWithViews.com
" The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies , one , perhaps , of the Right and the other of the Left , is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrinaire and academic thinkers .
Instead , the two parties should be almost identical , so that the American people can " throw the rascals out " at any election without leading to any profound or extreme shifts in policy . "
----
Carrol Quigley , member of the treasonous Council on Foreign Relations , author of Tragedy and Hope ( 1975 ) ; mentor to Marxist Bill Clinton
October 1 , 2009 .
Boehner to Obama : ' Where are the jobs ? ' -
" While the president is in Copenhagen tomorrow , '' House Republican Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) said today , " the American people are going to wake up and find out that hundreds of thousands more Americans have lost their jobs .
" The administration 's trillion dollar stimulus plan clearly is not working .
Americans were promised that this plan would create jobs immediately and keep the unemployment rate below eight percent .
But Americans are asking , where are the jobs ? ''
John Boehner has been in Congress for ten terms ( 20 years ) .
Boehner voted for the unconstitutional North American Free Trade treaty ( NAFTA - No American Factories Taking Applications ) .
That treaty has been the biggest killer of domestic jobs in the history of this republic .
THOUSANDS of factories closed within the first few years after NAFTA was unlawfully ratified .
Boehner voted for the unconstitutional GATT - General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , which has done nothing but erode our sovereignty and cost American companies huge fines .
GATT has been a killer for our industries while enriching banana republics and our enemies .
Where are the jobs , Boehner ?
You helped kill them with your votes .
The Republicans held power from January 1995 until the " new " Congress was sworn in January 2007 .
For eight years a Republican ( Bush , Jr ) was president .
Yet , not a single step was taken to get us out of those destructive treaties .
MILLIONS of jobs to communist and third world countries while Americans stand in unemployment lines .
Boehner , Bush , Pelosi -- all of them have simply allowed the bleeding to continue year after year after year .
The Democrats have done nothing to bring our jobs home since they took " power " almost three years ago .
Those destructive treaties remain in tact while 15 MILLION Americans are now out of work .
The Democrats , like the Republicans , have done NOTHING to stop the work visas bringing in foreign workers while American workers sink further into debt and poverty :
August 19 , 2009 .
125,000 brand new foreign workers with work permits each month .
" Here is the explanation and justification for saying that the federal government brings in 1.5 million new foreign workers each year ( 125,000 a month ) to take U.S. jobs while Americans lose theirs .
( This is a key number in our national TV ad campaign . )
For months , the open - borders blogosphere has insisted that NumbersUSA is telling tall tales when we talk about these numbers .
Most of the commentators and open - borders politicians even claim that we have no source for our information .
So , once again , let us lay out the federal government 's own data . "
Now , tell me the Democrats care about American workers .
Ohio has been devastated by jobs hemorrhaging to foreign countries and Boehner has done NOTHING to correct his anti-American votes for NAFTA and GATT .
Know what ?
The machine will make sure Boehner 's the only Republican to get on the ballot in 2010 because he has supported the agenda of the global elites :
" NAFTA will represent the most creative step toward a New World Order taken by any group of countries since the end of the Cold War .
What Congress will have before it is not a conventional trade agreement , but the architecture of a new international system .
The trade agreement with Mexico is the vital first step for a new kind of community of nations , a first step toward the New World Order . "
CFR , Trilaterialst traitor , Henry Kissinger , July 18 , 1993 .
" GATT is the third pillar of the New World Order . "
NY Times , full page ad , April 15 , 1994
All politics are local .
I know because I ran for Congress and saw first hand how the game is played .
The whole sorry story is in my Blind Loyalty booklet on my CD .
Most likely the voters will reelect Boehner because after all he 's pro-life ( I am , too ) and pro-Second Amendment ( I am , too ) , what choice do we have - another big spending Democrat ?
I hope that keeps those voters warm in this winter when they can't pay for heating because their job has gone to Bangladesh , commie China or an illegal alien .
If you do n't get involved at the local level in your party , nothing will change .
Just like it has n't changed election after election after election .
Marxists Hillary Clinton and Obama / Soetoro exchanged spit during the phony primaries over NAFTA :
" NAFTA is unpopular in Ohio , which has lost blue - collar jobs to other countries .
The treaty was signed by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 ; the legislation to implement it was signed by President Clinton in 1993 .
Hillary Clinton said Obama 's ads unfairly portrayed her as a supporter of the agreement which she says she is working to change .
Over the weekend , Obama told an Ohio audience : " She was saying great things about NAFTA until she started running for president . "
Clinton did n't lift a finger as a U.S. Senator to get us out of that job killing treaty .
Neither did the usurper president when he was in the Senate .
Both of them are professional liars , and yet , they have the support of big unions .
Insanity in real time .
While holding absolute power , the Republicans during all those years did NOTHING to stop the anchor babies scam . [ 1 ]
Instead , slick lawyers who care nothing for our laws or sovereign status , use the courts with known activist , bleeding heart judges to bastardize the Fourteenth Amendment and give babies of ILLEGAL aliens ( criminals ) citizen status .
It goes without saying the agenda of the Democrat Party is open borders .
The Republicans let this invasion get so far out of control and now we 're back to blaming the opposite party 's administration .
Same old games .
I was somewhat enthusiastic when I read these headlines : CA one step closer to ending illegal " Anchor Baby " births .
Until I read the fine print : " According to the Attorney General for the state of California , who prepares the title and summary , the state would deny birth certificates to children born to undocumented parents unless the mother provides a fingerprint and other information to be given to the federal authorities . "
Another half arsed job .
They are n't " undocumented . "
They are by federal status illegal aliens .
The solution :
The baby is born and then deported with the illegal alien mother .
Period , end of sob story .
What good does it do to give a birth certificate to a baby who has NO legal right to one if all the mother has to do is get finger printed which is handed over to federal authorities ?
The illegal benefits she will receive far outweigh her fear of ICE with the Democrats and activist judges protecting illegals .
And , do n't forget : YOU will pay for this illegal to deliver her baby in a hospital when you can't even afford health care coverage for your family .
ALERT : This week get in the face of your Congress critter and stop this insanity :
October 2 , 2009 :
" Under the direction of a Clinton official who orchestrated the pardon of a major - league drug trafficker , the federal agency that oversees lawful immigration is preparing to legalize millions of illegal immigrants .
" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) is getting ready for the huge influx of applications that will bombard the agency when President Obama ’s plan to legalize the nation 's estimated 12 million illegal aliens becomes law , according to a major newspaper report .
Advertisement
" The agency 's director , Alejandro Mayorkas , says his goal is to be ready to expand rapidly in order to handle the massive increase in visa applications under Obama ’s comprehensive immigration reform plan .
As the Homeland Security agency responsible for overseeing lawful immigration and granting visas , USCIS is equipped to handle applications from about 6 million immigrants a year .
" If Obama ’s amnesty measure comes to fruition USCIS could receive that many applications in just a few weeks , according to Mayorkas , who recently distributed $ 1.2 million in grants to help migrants adjust in America .
In order to efficiently handle the increase , Mayorkas is implementing several measures to process applications faster .
Among them is a method of receiving visa forms in the mail and another that allows illegal aliens to start the legalization process through a simple mail - in registration form . "
You can thank Ronald Reagan for opening the flood gates when he signed the insane immigration " reform " bill back in 1986 .
He did n't have to sign a major bill that was so flawed as to be downright written for illegals , but he did anyway .
Millions of jobs that Americans WILL do are now being done by criminals who smuggled themselves across our border like thieves in the night and neither party has stopped it .
The border governors ( California , New Mexico , Arizona , Texas ) for decades did n't put their foot down and put the National Guard on the borders and stop the invasion .
Nor , have any of the states reconstituted the organized militia MANDATED by the Second Amendment to repel this invasion . [ 2 ]
Another constitutionally challenged writer recently made this statement : Mr. Obama , Your Job is More Jobs .
No , it is not .
No where in Art. II , Sec. II of the U.S. Constitution does it say the president 's job is to create jobs .
Creating jobs in a free market is done by private enterprise , not government .
This is EXACTLY the wrong message that has caused the federal government to grow into a massive monster that is completely and totally dysfunctional .
It is because of government interference , rules , regulations , unconstitutional cabinets and endless agencies killing free enterprise , along with a debauched currency under the privately owned " Federal " Reserve that has brought us to this dire condition :
Economic recovery underway - a cruel deception
One thing Congress could do in a week if they wanted , but wo n't - is to stop the big scam called withholding .
This would pump millions into the economy .
Ron Paul tried to get two bills passed , but his colleagues in CON - gress ignored them and kept spending and spending and spending .
One thing we can do everyday is buy American .
Yes , you can and if a retailer does n't have Made in USA , tell them you will order on line .
I do it all the time ; see the Made in America section on my web site .
The more we buy from American companies who are using American labor and materials , the more competitive those companies will become as far as stretching your dollar .
More sales means more jobs for Americans , not workers in foreign countries .
Either we invest in America or become dependent upon our enemies to supply even our most basic needs .
Either we take the time to support American jobs and industry or we will end up beggars in our own land .
Free trade has been economic suicide .
Fair trade benefits all trading partners .
Do n't tell me NAFTA brought " cheap " goods .
The cost in MILLIONS of lost jobs has n't been cheap .
Go to Macy 's or Dillard 's and compare the price of a ladies dress made in this country vs commie China .
The same or more .
Make the comparison yourself .
The exception might be cheap tee shirts .
I do n't want cheap .
I want quality and keeping my fellow Americans employed .
I also do without because I will NOT reward my enemies .
Commie China is NOT our friend .
You , me , our children and grand children are paying a brutal , butchering regine who celebrated the attacks on 9/11 , $ 800 MILLION dollars a week on the debt created by CON - gress with their reckless spending --- incumbents in both parties .
Do you grasp that number ?
Since there 's no money in the treasury , that $ 800 MILLION has to be borrowed from someone to pay the commies interest on money we borrowed from them !
Insanity in real time .
In case you missed this from our " trading partner " :
News Telegraph , UK November 3 , 2001
Beijing Produces Videos Glorifying Terrorist Attacks on ' Arrogant ' US
" The Chinese state - run propaganda machine is cashing in on the terror attacks in New York and Washington , producing books , films and video games glorifying the strikes as a humbling blow against an arrogant nation .
Communist Party officials say President Jiang Zemin has obsessively watched and re-watched pictures of the aircraft crashing into the World Trade Center .
In the immediate aftermath of the attacks , workers at Beijing Television worked round - the - clock to produce a documentary they called Attack America .
" As rescue workers pick through the rubble of the twin towers , the commentator proclaims that the city had reaped the consequences of decades of American bullying of weaker nations .
He said : " This is the America the whole world has wanted to see .
Blood debts have been repaid in blood .
America has bombed other countries and used its hegemony to deny the natural rights of others without paying the price .
Who until now has dared to avenge the hurts inflicted by unaccountable Americans . "
" Two months after 9 - 11 , one month after Mr. Bush was in Shanghai playing nice with Zemin and what do we see ?
Jiang Zemin and his fellow countrymen celebrating the 9 - 11 attack against America . "
There can be no economic recovery without jobs which are created by Americans spending into the economy --- not endless extensions of unemployment checks which will only prolong the misery of Americans .
There can be no real economic freedom and prosperity as long as the FED remains the central bank in this country issuing worthless fiat currency to fund the grotesque spending by Congress .
We either drive the banking cartel out once and for all or our demise is a done deal .
In the meantime , the states of the Union had better pass an honest money bill into law soon or they will collapse within another year , maybe two .
Right now investors and Americans who smell blood in the water are buying gold like crazy .
Have you noticed how little your " dollar " is buying these days ?
When you once took $ 100 bux out of the ATM and it went all week , is now eaten at the grocery store with $ 10 bux left over for the gas station .
It 's going to get worse because as people get more strapped for cash , the next wave of businesses to go under ( besides the retail melt down now underway ) are unnecessary things like entertainment .
If you are looking to diversify some of your fiat paper into gold before it hits $ 2,000 an ounce , I highly recommend you contact Rob Westfall of RWI Coins in Florida at : 1.813.838.5600 .
We all have hope for the future and that all we the people by the millions are doing is going to save our republic .
The reality is , it 's going to get a whole lot uglier before it gets better .
Do n't gamble with your life 's savings believing the lies coming out of Washington , DC .

Microsoft Corp.'s massive security update yesterday marked the completion of the sixth year of the company 's move to a monthly patch release schedule .
Since moving to a monthly schedule in October 2003 , Microsoft has released about 400 security bulletins based on an informal count of releases in its bulletin archives .
The bulletins address about 745 vulnerabilities across almost every Microsoft product .
More than half of the bulletins , or about 230 , addressed security vulnerabilities that were described by Microsoft as " critical . "
The company typically uses this definition for vulnerabilities that allow attackers to take full administrative control of a system from a remote location .
More vulnerabilities are being discovered in Microsoft products than when the company first moved to a monthly patch schedule .
The total number of flaws disclosed and patched by the software maker so far this year stands at around 160 , more than the 155 or so that Microsoft reported for all of 2008 .
The number of flaws reported in Microsoft products over the last two years is more than double the number of flaws disclosed in 2004 and 2005 , the first two full years of Patch Tuesdays .
The last time Microsoft did not release any patches on a Patch Tuesday was March 2007 , more than 30 months ago .
In the past six years , Microsoft had just four patch - free months -- two of which were in 2005 .
In contrast , the company has issued patches for 10 or more vulnerabilities on more than 20 occasions and patches for 20 or more flaws in a single month on about 10 occasions , including yesterday .
The increase in the number of flaws being discovered comes at a time when attackers are getting much faster at exploiting them .
A survey by security vendor Qualys earlier this year showed that 80 % of vulnerability exploits are available within 10 days of the vulnerability 's disclosure .
Nearly 50 % of the vulnerabilities patched by Microsoft in its security updates for April this year already had known exploits by the time the patches were available .
The numbers highlight Microsoft 's continuing challenges on the security front , said David Rice , president of the Monterey Group , a security consultancy in Monterey , Calif . and author of Geekonomics : The Real Cost of Insecurity Software .
But it is important to keep them in perspective , he added .
Other major vendors , such as Oracle Corp. and Apple Inc. , have also announced large numbers of vulnerabilities over the past few years , Rice said .
But neither of these two vendors have invested anywhere near the money and resources that Microsoft has spent on security over the past several years , largely because of the lack of incentive for them to do so , he said .
Unlike other sectors , such as the automobile industry , where a vehicle 's safety rating has an impact on product sales , software vendors have not been penalized by consumers for buggy software .
Many have therefore chosen not to invest in increased product security , he said .
" Apple and Oracle are classic examples of companies that have not invested in security to the same level that Microsoft has , " Rice said .
David Jordan , chief information security officer at Virginia 's Arlington County government , is growing impatient at the continuing number of flaws disclosed by Microsoft .
" These updates are necessary , but the vulnerabilities they fix are most unwelcome , " Jordan said .
" Much like auto recalls , one has to wonder how some of this stuff got to production so many years down the road , " he said .
" We 've just recently retired our IBM mainframe , but back in the day , there was in software development a phrase known as ' zero tolerance for defects . ' "
Jordan said such an attitude toward software development would be welcome today .
Microsoft 's huge installed base and the popularity of its products make it a prime target for hackers looking for software vulnerabilities to exploit , which is one of the reasons so many flaws continue to be found .
" Microsoft has gargantuan cash reserves , and they are doing all they need to do .
If they are still meeting with so much failure , it means they may have reached a glass ceiling " in terms of their ability to reduce flaws , he said .
The sheer number of patches Microsoft releases each month shows the company may have reached the " inherent limits " of the software debugging process , said Amichai Shulman , CTO at security vendor Imperva in a blog post .
Microsoft could not be reached for comment at deadline .
Microsoft has been investing more than any other company in secure coding practices with its software development life cycle process , Shulman said .
Yet in the past year , the number of vulnerabilities is still on the rise .
" There is a point in time in which any increase in QA resources ( and time ) has a negligible effect over software quality , " he said .
" This is giving us an excellent perspective about the inherent limitations of SDLC as the first and last line of defense when it comes to information security , " he said .
" The crooks tend to spend the majority of their effort on Windows , " because of it huge market share , said Tim O'Pry , CTO at the Henssler Financial Group in Kennesaw , Ga .
While the sheer number of patches released by Microsoft is " a royal PIA for system administrators , " Microsoft is getting better at locking down some of the bigger holes in their operating systems , he said .
One big reason why Microsoft is still reporting so many vulnerabilities is because they have " decided to drag the ball and chain of backward compatibility with them from the DOS days , " O'Pry said .
But overall , " I think Microsoft is doing a reasonable job considering the huge installed base and their attempts to break as little as possible , " from a backward compatibility standpoint , he said .
Matt Kesner , chief technology officer at Fenwick & West LLP in Mountain View , Calif. , said it is n't surprising that during times of economic trouble there are more attempts to exploit systems .
" So , on the one hand we applaud Microsoft 's continuing efforts to patch its software in a timely manner , " he said .
" On the other hand , the number of patches shows that security still is n't a primary consideration when software is written . "
At a certain point in time - perhaps sooner than most people think - the ever - increasing average human lifespan will begin accelerating faster than people age .
This moment , according to anti-aging expert Aubrey de Grey , will be more important than the Singularity - when the human race achieves this “ longevity escape velocity , ” we will essentially become immortal .
And de Grey , who is in his mid-40s , argues that this moment has a 50/50 chance of occurring in time for him to live forever .
Crazy talk ?
Maybe not —de Grey shared with Big
Think some surprising aging research and explained why there are no more major breakthroughs necessary for us to defeat aging for good .
He even provided a vision of how we might defeat cancer .
De Grey ’s optimistic vision brings up some interesting questions ; most importantly , would n’t an ageless society present a logistical nightmare ?
Aubrey de Grey is confident that arguments about economic difficulties and overpopulation in an ageless society are unwarranted ; he does , however , believe that society would change dramatically , but mostly for the better .
Above , he explains why he considers immortality an ideal motivator of world peace and cooperation in the fight against climate change .
The Challenge
Last Tuesday , the first incision was made at about 10 a.m .
It was tough going from the start .
Scar tissue from the radiation treatment had essentially welded Mr. Collison ’s insides together , requiring hours and hours of delicate dissection just to free organs and tissues so that surgeons could work on them .
In addition , the bulging tumor had shoved organs and blood vessels out of its way , distorting Mr. Collison ’s anatomy .
The right side of his liver was squashed flat .
Nothing was where it was supposed to be .
Dr. Kato and his team had to rummage through their patient ’s belly in search of veins they could normally have found with their eyes closed .
As the operation wore on through a day and a night , and then another day , exhausted nurses and surgeons rotated in and out .
Dr. Kato , calm and soft - spoken , rarely left the room .
Much of the time , Evelina Badalov , his physician ’s assistant , worked by his side .
Dr. Kato ’s focus , patience and stamina did not ebb .
“ He ’s like a machine , ” one of the surgeons said .
“ He loves this . ”
The surgery was really a series of dauntingly complex operations .
A certain amount of ground had to be ceded to the tumor , because it had a stranglehold on parts of Mr. Collison ’s stomach , intestines and pancreas .
Each of those organs had to be cut in two , so the healthy parts would stay with Mr. Collison while the entangled parts , including two - thirds of the stomach , would be taken out with the tumor .
The portions that stayed had to be reconnected to the digestive tract .
Several blood vessels had also been captured by the tumor and would have to be replaced .
Dr. Kato had to rebuild parts of two major veins with Gore - Tex tubes and replace another with the internal jugular vein from Mr. Collison ’s own neck .
And because major blood vessels would have to be clamped off before the liver could be removed , Dr. Kato would also have to reroute Mr. Collison ’s circulation temporarily through a pumping machine .
The Operation : Day 1
Surgery is a stunning blend of finesse and brute force .
The incision was a huge , cross - shaped cut that ran from Mr. Collison ’s breastbone to his pubic bone , then across his belly near the navel .
Metal retractors needed to hold open the wound looked like tools from a hardware store , and it took three people to wrestle them into place .
Electrocautery pens that did much of the cutting sparked , smoked and sent up a stench of burning flesh .
Suction probes like bigger versions of the ones that dentists use gurgled as they vacuumed blood from the incisions .
Project Archer
Project Archer is a gdb development branch primarily dedicated to improving the C++ debugging experience .
However , other modifications to gdb may be attempted on the branch as well .
Getting the source
Archer is hosted in a git repository .
You can clone it using :
git clone -- origin archer git://sourceware.org/git/archer.git
git clone -- origin archer ssh://sourceware.org/git/archer.git
The git :// scheme is not recommended for read - write access .
If you intend to push to the Archer repo , use the ssh :// scheme .
Then you can check out and track the trunk using :
cd archer ; git checkout -- track -b BRANCHNAME archer / BRANCHNAME
BRANCHNAME must be the specific branch of the Archer project .
There is currently no single merged branch of the whole project .
See ArcherBranchManagement for the available branches .
Archer has its own mailing list ( and as gmane group gmane.comp.debugging.archer ) .
You can also find the Archer developers on the gdb irc channel , aka irc.freenode .
net #gdb .
Archer also has a read - only commits mailing list .
All commits to the git repository are also sent to this list .
Feel free to follow - up posts to the commits list to the main archer list .
To subscribe to a list , you can either send email to the standard - subscribe address , or you can fill out the form about halfway down this page .
Roadmap
The Archer project consists of a number of sub-projects .
Initially the Archer mandate was to improve the C++ debugging experience , but since then it has broadened a bit .
Specific tasks that go into a sub- project are generally tracked in gdb's bugzilla and tagged with the archer keyword .
You can use this search to find all the open archer - related bugs .
Expression Parsing .
GDB 's understanding of C++ expressions is incomplete .
Most of the sub - tasks here are in bugzilla .
Virtual methods table printing ( print OBJ -> VIRTFUNC ) using DW_AT_vtable_elem_location ( set print object ? ) .
Fedora patches .
Fedora has a big backlog of gdb patches .
We will rebase these to a more recent gdb , integrate them into archer , and send them upstream as appropriate .
Keeping abreast of GCC changes .
This mostly involves coping with changes to the DWARF that GCC emits , but occasionally there are other tasks .
These are tracked in bugzilla .
Scalability .
Can we scale to thousands of breakpoints ?
Of inferiors ?
Does it make sense to also lazily read minsyms ?
See DebuggingLargePrograms for some hints .
See also the discussion around PTRACE_O_INHERIT in this thread .
Try to delay even the search for a separate debug info file till it is required for a specific operation .
See what , if anything , we need to do to make multi-inferior work excellently on Linux .

Trivia
Q : Why is it called Project Archer ?
A : The Archer Fish is the GDB Mascot .
Completed Projects
We 've completed a number of tasks and put some others on hold .
We record these for posterity .
The text here is directly taken from our old task list , so it is mostly phrased in the negative .
Expression Parsing .
Sometimes gdb requires the user to do excessive quoting
There are several problems involving namespaces : Namespaces and classes cannot currently own using declarations in gdb using declarations are not considered on a per- block basis gdb does not understand namespace aliases gdb does not understand the global namespace operator C++ new - style cast operators , like reinterpret_cast
There are some bugs with virtual classes Koenig lookup is not implemented ( Sami ) Printing of annotated virtual method table ( for both instances and classes - is it set print vtbl ? ) .
decltype
Exception handling .
An inferior function call which throws an exception will cause GDB to lose control of the inferior .
This is because of the mechanics of the dummy frame construction .
If this is the case , rescue the inferior and unwind .
( GDB PR 9600 .
Solution submitted under archer - pmuldoon - exception - rewind branch ) .
next over an exception - throwing call will cause GDB to lose control over the inferior .
This is very unfriendly .
( GDB PR 9593 .
Solution being worked on archer - pmuldoon - next - over - throw branch . ) catch throw and catch catch are documented as catching named or all exceptions .
GDB can only catch all exceptions .
Fix documentation to reflect reality .
( GDB PR 9598 )
DWARF - related tasks Opcode audit .
We know that there are a few DWARF opcodes that are not implemented ( some are in bugzilla ) .
This task is to audit GDB and implement all unimplemented opcodes ( except those mentioned above ) .
DW_OP_ * piece implementation .
GDB does not fully implement DW_OP_piece and does not implement DW_OP_bit_piece at all .
GDB should track data availability by bit or byte , and expression evaluation and value printing should nicely reflect this .
See GDB PR 9977 and GDB PR 9978 .
( Tom ) Improve GDB performance using a DWARF index .
See the GCC PR .
To be a success this would have to eliminate the delays in the current lazy symtab reading code .
( Tom ) Lazy type instantiation .
This might be part of the indexing task .
( We do n't seem to need this .
The index seems fast enough , and the DWARF compressor will help with memory use when the time comes . )
Remove psymtabs when using DWARF .
This might also be part of the indexing task .
( Tom ) Implement DW_OP_GNU_implicit_pointer ( Tom ) Implement typed DWARF stack .
GDB PR 12617 Handle break inlinefunction better .
GDB PR 10738 Implement DW_TAG_imported_unit .
GDB PR 10240 ( Tom )
Pretty - printing .
Many containers in libstdc++ , for example , are inscrutable to the user .
Our goal is to fix this by allowing application - and library - specific pretty - printers , written in Python , to change how values are displayed .
See STLSupport .
Fortran support improvements .
Support for Fortran modules and importing of their namespaces does not work ( flat fix is GDB PR 9806 , namespaces support is archer - jankratochvil - fortran - module ) .
Arrays allocated , associated or passed as parameter are now displayed with their passed length ( GDB PR 9260 , GDB PR 9395 , in archer - jankratochvil - vla ) .
Fortran Unicode wide characters are printed as numbers ( GDB PR 10036 ) .
Scalability .
Attaching to programs with many shared libraries is very slow .
One subproject is to fix this .
GCC changes .
Part of our project 's scope spills over to gcc .
There are a number of gcc debuginfo bugs that we would like to fix .
Syscall .
One archer branch is dedicated to adding catch syscall functionality .
Implement catch signal .
This has been reported a couple of times ; it is different from handle in that you can put commands on a catch .
Implement watch - location .
Maybe just take the code from Apple 's repository .
( Tom )
Python
Let the user do prompt substitutions .
This comes up over and over .
It is also easy ( probably should n't be on this list Clean up and integrate Oguz 's patches

Twitter has announced agreements with both Bing and Google to allow the two search engines to get access to the full feed of public Tweets .
Facebook , meanwhile , has opened it 's doors to Bing so Facebook updates will soon be available to search .
Real - time search is one of the next battlegrounds for internet search , with web users tapping in to services such as Twitter to find out the hot topics of conversation and latest news at any given moment .
Microsoft has already rolled out a beta edition of a dedicated Twitter search within Bing .
These deals appear to be a slight victory for Microsoft ’s Bing versus Google , with Bing being the first to market with Twitter data and , so far , the only one to sign a deal with Facebook .
Both Facebook and Twitter status updates can provide a tremendous source of firsthand , real - time information .
However , the vast majority of tweets and Facebook status updates are pointless nonsense .
Breaking political or sports news will add value to search , but do we really need real - time indexing of what everybody in the world is doing right now ?
There are also potential privacy concerns .
Twitter tweets are public by default and there are already numerous ways to search tweets .
If you tweet it , anyone can search it and read it .
Facebook on the other hand is private by default and even with that Facebook has been dealing with challenges from a wide range of public and private entities .
Facebook began as a place for college connections , hidden from the eyes of the outside world and only recently introduced on - site search across user profiles and messages .
Now , just months later this data will be made available to Bing .
With over 300 million members , Facebook has over 45 million status updates per day .
However , the majority of those status updates are private and only status updates that users have chosen to share publicly will be included in Bing search results .
So far it is not clear how Facebook Pages and Groups will be searched .
In general , these pages are more public in nature and used to encourage interaction with fans , or advocate for causes .
In the coming weeks , Facebook users will want once again re-evaluate their Facebook privacy settings against the risk or potential of appearing in Bing searches .
Likewise , whether it is Twitter or Facebook , realize that your comments might be public in ways that you never anticipated .
Robert Caplin for The New York Times
Lou Dobbs , the longtime CNN anchor whose anti-immigration views have made him a TV lightning rod , said Wednesday that he is leaving the cable news channel effective immediately .
Sitting before an image of an American flag on his studio set , he said “ some leaders in media , politics and business have been urging me to go beyond the role here at CNN and to engage in constructive problem solving as well as to contribute positively to the great understanding of the issues of our day . ”
“ I ’m considering a number of options and directions , ” Mr. Dobbs added .
A transcript of his remarks is available here .
Jonathan Klein , the president of CNN / U.S. said in a statement that “ Lou has now decided to carry the banner of advocacy journalism elsewhere . ”
“ All of us will miss his appetite for big ideas , the megawatt smile and larger than life presence he brought to our newsroom , ” Mr. Klein said .
Wednesday ’s program will be Mr. Dobbs ’s last on CNN .
His contract was not set to expire until the end of 2011 .
He told viewers that CNN had agreed to release him from his contract early .
CNN indicated that it would name a replacement for Mr. Dobbs on Thursday morning .
Mr. Dobbs informed his staff members of his intentions in a meeting Wednesday afternoon , catching some of the staffers off - guard .
Well known for his political positions , Mr. Dobbs is an outlier at CNN , which has sought to position itself as a middle ground of sorts in the fractious cable news arena .
The CNN employees said Wednesday that they did not know if Mr. Dobbs was moving to another network .
Mr. Dobbs met with Roger Ailes , the chairman of the Fox News Channel , in September .
At the time Mr. Dobbs was viewed as a potential hire for the Fox Business Network .
But a
Fox representative said Wednesday , “ We have not had any discussions with Lou Dobbs for Fox News or Fox Business . ”
Mr. Dobbs has been with CNN since its founding , save for a two - year stint at a Web site called Space.com .
He has evolved over the years from a straight - laced business anchor to an outspoken commentator who rails against illegal immigration and taxpayer bailouts , among other subjects .
Lately , though , he has saved most of his opinions for his afternoon radio show , which made its debut in March 2008 .
It is on the radio show that he talked repeatedly about the conspiracy - theory claims that President Obama is not a United States citizen .
When he mentioned the citizenship issue on CNN over the summer , his bosses were forced to call it a “ dead issue . ”
More recently , Mr. Dobbs ’s views on immigration provoked a protest by Hispanic groups .
Members of the groups complained that CNN was allowing Mr. Dobbs “ to spread lies and misinformation about us each night . ”
Wednesday evening , the advocacy group Presente.org , which had called on CNN to fire Mr. Dobbs , declared a “ victory . ”
“ Our contention all along was that Lou Dobbs — who has a long record of spreading lies and conspiracy theories about immigrants and Latinos — does not belong on the ‘ most trusted name in news , ' ” Roberto Lovato , a co-founder of Presente.org , said in a statement .
“ We are thrilled that Dobbs no longer has this legitimate platform from which to incite fear and hate . ”
Last month , the New Jersey State Police were called to Mr. Dobbs ’s home to investigate a report of gunfire .
Mr. Dobbs suggested that his family had been singled out because of his views on illegal immigration and border security .

Al - Hayat reports in Arabic that the Iraqi parliament again on Thursday failed to pass an electoral law to govern the holding of the planned January 16 parliamentary elections .
The Kurdish delegates refused to come into the parliament building , thereby denying the session a quorum .
The Turkmen and Arab delegates had demanded that Kirkuk be treated differently in the legislation than other provinces ( Kurds are now a majority in Kirkuk , and the Kurds wish to annex the province to their Kurdistan Regional Government , a semi- independent confederacy in northern Iraq ; Turkmen and Arabs consider the majority artificial , the result of Kurdistan - backed Kurdish in - migration , and consider having an ordinary election there a reward to the Kurds for land - grabbing .
Kurds maintain that the province has long been theirs and that they are just correcting the ‘ Arabization ’ or ethnic cleansing and settlement policies of Saddam Hussein , who brought Arab families north to make the oil - rich province indisputably Arab ) .
Many pundits are maintaining that the failure to hold parliamentary elections on time will , perhaps , force US troops to stay longer and in greater numbers than envisaged in the Status of Forces agreement .
Meanwhile , the Iraqi government arrested dozens of security officials , saying that they were implicated in Sunday ’s attacks .
Back to elections .
Elections in Iraq cannot be held to international standards .
There typically are no big public rallies , for fear that they would be blown up by Sunni Arab guerrillas .
Candidates can seldom campaign publicly for fear of assassination .
For the election itself , the US military declares a curfew and prohibits vehicular traffic for 3 days .
Everyone is reduced to walking to the store to buy bread and other necessities .
You ca n’t drive .
This measure prevents car bombings of the polling stations .
So why does the US still have 120,000 troops in Iraq ?
They are n’t for the most part doing patrols anymore .
They are just being kept in place so that they can swing into action as soon as the election date is fixed , and protect the electoral process from sabotage by bombing .
Is this rationale really a good enough reason to keep so many troops in Iraq ?
Should n’t the Iraqi army by now be able to supervise a vehicular curfew on its own ?
And , why should the Obama administration care if the election is held or not ?
Saudi Arabia has n’t held any elections lately and it is our ally .
The Iraqis were made by the US to have several elections , and they know how to do it if they want to .
Why allow their interminable parlays on basic things like an electoral law to hold US troops hostage in the country with nothing much to do for a year ?
The parliamentary and provincial elections and the referendum on the constitution were always imagined by the Bush administration as propaganda exercises on behalf of the Republican Party and Neoconservatism .
Although the elections have not been meaningless , and a lot of Iraqis obviously express their political spirit through them , they have been highly flawed and artificial .
The first , in January 2005 , completely excluded the Sunni Arabs because it was not based on voting districts , and it appears to have been stolen by Iran , much to the delight at the time of the Red States ( ? ) .
In some ways that election provoked the Great Sunni-Shiite Civil War .
The constitution was rejected by a majority in each of the major Sunni Arab - majority provinces and so is not a national constitution , and it has a strong theocratic overtone ( read it and weep , Christopher Hitchens ) .
Islam is the state religion and parliament may pass no legislation contradicting sharia or Islamic canon law .
Kurdish separatism is virtually enshrined in it .
The Muslim fundamentalists won the December 2005 parliamentary elections as well .
Critics accused Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki of using intimidation by tribal forces and the advantages of incumbency to skew the results of the provincial elections of January , 2009 toward his Islamic Mission ( Da ’wa ) Party .
( Some charge al - Maliki of increasingly adopting the techniques and rhetoric of the region ’s ‘ soft ’ dictators ) .
Iraq is a poor candidate for successful transition to democracy or for social peace .
It has a low per capita income if you subtract the notional petroleum income , which is not exactly shared out with the people .
Poor countries often fail in their attempt to democratize .
It does not have a long - established , respectable business class .
It has no effective trade unions to speak of , since the Baath Party had coopted them and then Paul “ Jerry ” Bremer dissolved them by viceregal fiat .
The UN / US sanctions of the 1990s and the US occupation has pushed literacy down to 58 % from more like 78 % in the heyday of the pre-Saddam Baath Party .
The country has come to be strongly divided by ethno- religious divisions .
Its economy is dominated by a pricey primary commodity , petroleum , and gasoline is easily stolen and fought over , producing militia competition and deaths . .
All of these factors have been cited to explain failure at democratization and / or high rates of political violence , and all are present in Iraq in spades .
Me , I do n’t think the US troop withdrawal should be tied to the successful holding of a parliamentary election , in which US troops are assigned the role of watchmen .
The Status of Forces Agreement ( SOFA ) should be adhered to , and the Iraqis will just have to decide if they want to hold an election or not , and if they do , their troops should supervise it .
I ’m as in favor of democracy as anyone else .
But I ’m a also skeptical that it can be imposed at the point of a gun on a deeply divided society that is at the moment dirt - poor .
The time for elections as US propaganda victory has passed .

Whether you ’re constantly worried about your weight , busy bashing your body or , from time to time , find yourself criticizing your appearance , we could all use a body image boost .
Last week , we talked about food , body and eating disorder myths with some fabulous bloggers .
Today , I ’m happy to present their effective tips for building a healthier body image and being proud in your own ( sensational ) skin .
From eating disorder specialist Stacey Rosenfeld , Ph.D , who writes Does Every Woman Have an Eating Disorder ?
1. Recognize that your body is just one aspect of your appearance , your appearance just one aspect of who you are .
Focus on everything else you are , everything else you have to offer .
Make a list of 25 things you like about yourself .
2 . Spend some time in front of the mirror without criticizing yourself .
Focus simply on observation , not judgment .
If you ca n’t do this at first , recognize the judgmental self - statements and try again another time .
3. Focus on what your body can DO rather than how it LOOKS .
Are you able to swim , hanglide , enjoy a loving hug ?
The more you focus on your body as subject rather than object , the better your body image will be .
4 . Think about how much time you ’ve spent judging or criticizing your body and recognize how you could have better spent the time .
Make a commitment to stopping yourself when you find yourself engaging in these behaviors .
5 . Toss the scale .
It ’s not your friend , and you know about how much you weigh .
From Toni , Michelle and Tee of The Fat Girl ’s Guide to Living , “ a life hacker for the full - figured set . ”
Toni :
6. Body - image booster – Mirrors in your home .
It ’s easy to hide and never see yourself and then feel all bummed out when you see yourself while out and about or in photos others take of you .
Look at yourself every day and say nice things to yourself when you do .
7 . Wearing clothes designed to fit instead of hide lumpy bits makes a big difference .
Curve - hugging shirts , jackets , and jeans look so much better than baggy ANYTHING when you ’re overweight .
Michelle :
8. Accentuate the good .
Dress for your body and stop fixating on the numbers .
Tee :
9 . Try a daily self - portrait project like Flickr ’s “ 365 Days . ”
It may sound silly , but the number of women I ’ve crossed paths with who ’ve said it ’s changed their whole self - perception blows me away .
From Sunny Sea Gold , health articles editor at Glamour magazine and founder of HealthyGirl.org , a website for young women who overeat .
10 .
Something that helped me gain a more realistic idea of what women actually look like was taking a peek around me in the gym locker room .
Seriously !
I do n’t want to sound like a peeping Tomasina , but a quick glance at the incredible diversity of bums , boobs and bellies in one little locker room is enough to make any woman feel normal .
We ’re all so different–so how could there possibly be one perfect ideal look ?
That ’s easy : there is n’t .
11 . Most days my body image is pretty darn solid–I ’ve done a lot of work on myself to get to that point .
But a couple of weeks ago I found myself feeling really , really fat .
It shocked me .
Was I actually ( magically ) heavier than the day before ?
No , I knew it was all in my head .
I was tired , worn down , anxious , and like so many of us do , I experienced those things as ‘ feeling fat . ’
Next time something like this happens to you , repeat after me : ‘ It ’s all in my head ! ’ and ask yourself what else is going on in your life that could be the real issue .
Thanks so much ladies for contributing your fantastic body image boosters !
And here ’s one from me
12 . Think about what you ’re genuinely proud of , from the seemingly smallest things to the bigger ones .
Is it that you ’ve recently accomplished something great at work ?
Is it that you helped a friend ?
Ran a marathon ?
Had a great time playing with your kids ?
Started taking better care of yourself ?
When a negative thought creeps in , take out your list , and go through it .
Then , take that no - good thought and toss it , beat it with a baseball bat , stomp on it with both feet , slap it around a few times , tell it where to go and truly let it go ( if it keeps coming back , use a gun : ) ) .
You have too many great things in your life to have a negative thought ( or thoughts ) color your entire existence and perspective of yourself .
What do you say to yourself or do when you ’re feeling lousy about your body ?
How do you work toward a healthier body image and body acceptance ?
In Copenhagen they are debating how to end deforestation , but in Cuba 's Pinar del Río they were replanting 50 years ago , creating lush , unspoilt valleys
Birds and butterflies are swooping above us and , as our taxi reaches the summit of this forest road just 40 minutes from the heat and noise of Havana , the view opens to an undulating landscape painted every shade of green .
Before Castro these hills were dusty yellow and brown scrub .
If Copenhagen needs a model , this is the most eloquent I know , a visionary example of reforestation and the long term benefits it brings .
While the rest of the world is ripping up forests in the name of minerals and wood , Cuba has been replanting its tropical forests in the name of jobs , the environment and a lush holiday destination for decades .
This policy has worked so well that in 1984 Unesco gave biosphere status to 26,686 hectares of forest in the western region of Pinar del Río , where I am heading to stay at Las Terrazas , 50 km from Havana .
Our journey has taken us along an empty motorway , past plains with grazing cattle and sugar cane fields .
Few Cubans can afford the petrol to make trips out here .
Those who live here survive on smallholdings down dirt tracks that wind into the forest or in villages where the main employment comes from tourism at Las Terrazas .
We reach our destination , Las Terrazas valley , and drive across a lake studded with water lilies .
Clouds of turkeys and chickens scatter in front of us and , above us , orange and blue shuttered apartments for local people curve around the hillside .
Hotel Moka , and a host of restaurants , bars and attractions , are dotted discreetly around the community .
We check in and walk 40 minutes along a hilly track in search of a river to wash away the dust and heat of Havana .
Steps lead from the track down to a river cascading from the hills into a series of natural pools .
Above , sunlight trickles through bamboos , the orange - red blooms of hibiscus trees , teaks , royal palms and a tree covered in curly red seed pods .
We plunge into the cool , clear water .
Grey and red bromeliads and tiny orchids stud the trees above us .
A large kingfisher swoops onto a rock a couple of metres away .
Eagles circle overhead .
This is Castro's Eden , a paradise he dreamt up soon after the revolution in 1959 , when he ordered a reforestation programme .
Back then this place was grassland .
Now it looks much like it must have done before European settlers cleared the forest for coffee and cattle .
When Columbus arrived here in 1492 the island was 90 % forest .
By the time Castro came to power the figure had dropped to 11 % .
Now forest covers about a quarter of the island .
Later , we walk though the forest with curator Fidel Hernandez , who lives at Las Terrazas .
" The climate is cooler and the people are gentler than the rest of Cuba , " he says , leading us through the cultivated edges of the forest past grapefruit trees , red ginger and Cuba 's national flower , the mariposa .
We walk uphill along one of the steep tracks that crisscross the area .
Guides lead parties through the forest but it 's OK to walk independently and the snakes , Fidel says , are not poisonous .
" Las Terrazas was made to create better conditions for the peasants here who were very poor .
They had no water or electricity or medicine and so it was decided to build this community and give the people the work of replanting the forest .
Between 1983 and 1990 we planted 8 million trees over 5,000 hectares .
Now we have more than 500 plant species , 117 bird species , and 13 bat species , from tiny ones weighing four to five grams to fishing bats with a wingspan of 17 cm . "
Thanks to reforestation , Las Terrazas has become a tourist attraction .
When the eastern bloc , Cuba 's main trading partner , collapsed in 1989 , the country was thrown into crisis as food and cash supplies dried up almost overnight .
Tourism became crucial to the island 's survival .
The Moka hotel appeared along with nine cafes and restaurants .
We walk to one of them , Bamboo , upstream beside a river .
We have a late lunch of classic black beans and rice , chicken and tinned vegetable " salad " , a souvenir of Soviet - sponsored Cuba .
I had heard a lot about Cuba 's terrible food but most of the food at Las Terrazas is fine , although not always cheap .
Main courses range from around £ 3-£ 10 .
A Cuban carrying palm baskets of oranges passes our table .
I offer money and point to one of the baskets but the orange seller looks baffled .
In Havana there 's pressure on tourists to buy CDs , cigars , food and souvenirs , but here we are offered nothing except conversation .
Las Terrazas is pressure free .
In fact it is unpressured to the point of frustration , because Las Terrazas does n't mention or sign many of its glorious attractions .
It is a charmingly naive mix of being geared up for tourism and unaware of how to market itself .
By chance we find several beautiful mountain pools , complete with lifeguards and bars .
These natural pools are picture postcard perfect and they are open to everyone .
But , like the motorway , they are often empty .
We come across one while trying to find the ecology centre .
The centre – a small room with a few posters about the climate , creatures and flora of the forest – is closed so we join young Cubans partying along to deafening music on a lake with a floating trampoline .
In Cuba partying is second nature .
While in Havana a car stopped outside our hotel at around midnight , pumped up the music and attracted dancing locals like moths to a lamp .
The same thing happens when we visit Las Terrazas ' Boat House restaurant .
The banging music is not as welcome at the homestay where we sleep ( not a lot ) for the first two nights at Las Terrazas .
The homestay is a sort of B&B without the breakfast .
It is thatched with royal palm and has balcony views over the valley on one side and a courtyard garden of roses and staghorn fern on the other .
As the tropical night plunges us into dark , the crickets start . . . along with some of the loudest music I have ever heard .
Next door parties all night , every night if the comments in the visitors ' book are anything to go by .
We return to the peace of Hotel Moka across the valley .
It is relatively luxurious although it sometimes runs out of hot water .
Given our budget we should have booked into one of the permanent campsites or thatched huts a mile or so from the hotel – both have water and electricity .
And I should have worked on my fitness .
The steep , precarious concrete steps between the home stay , the community and the hotel are reminding my calf muscles that they need more exercise .
We take another calf - aching walk to find the 900 m zip wire " canopy ride " .
We can't find the ride but we find plenty of interest as we walk through the community : an old man roasting coffee , his wife making guava membrillo ( quince ) .
A group of handsome fighting cocks tethered in a garden .
A family celebrating a birthday who invite us to share marshmallow - topped rum cake .
And a handful of other tourists .
Visitors here are mixed .
Older people come for the peace and the wildlife coach tours .
Young ones are outdoor enthusiasts who want challenging forest walks , horse rides , canyoning , swimming and thigh - pounding bike rides .
We head up the valley past turkeys , ponies , dogs , cats , children and chickens to the spartan community museum .
There are pictures of the area before reforestation plus a skeleton , three pieces of coffee machinery , some palm figures and a mood board about a local artist .
Art of all kinds gets state funding and respect in Cuba .
At Las Terrazas it is supported by tourism as hotel manager , Lionel Guitierrez , explains through local guide and interpreter Emilio Jorge Arias : " 100 % of the profit from the hotel goes to the state and 35 % from the outlying activities , rides and restaurants .
The rest of the money goes to the community for repairing houses and encouraging art and music .
Over 90 % of the people who live here work here in the hotel or the forest . "
The standard of living here is now far higher than many other areas as Emilio explains : " 100 % of the people have electricity here plus drinking water and gas to cook on ; 80 % have a telephone .
In a nearby community of about 3,000 people there is one telephone . "
There is a waiting list to live here and plans to build another hotel and community to provide jobs and income and satisfy the insatiable demand for beds at Moka .
I wish I could persuade Copenhagen 's decision makers to book some of those beds and have a look round this pioneering community .
And I wish that the world leaders who are flogging their forests instead of transforming them into places like Las Terrazas would come here too .
It is an eloquent political statement : an exquisite destination providing a future for the Cuban people .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
The Obama Justice Department is having problems prosecuting terrorist cases because top department attorneys have conflicts of interest .
According to documents obtained exclusively by The Washington Times , Associate Attorney General Thomas J. Perrelli , No. 3 official in the Justice Department , had to recuse himself on at least 13 active detainee cases and at least 26 cases listed as either closed or mooted .
Sen. Charles E. Grassley , Iowa Republican , made waves Nov. 18 when he demanded that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. provide a list of all the suspected - terrorist detainee cases from which current Justice Department political appointees have had to recuse themselves .
The extent of the conflicts at the department is still unclear .
Mr. Perrelli ’s recusals presumably stem from the work that either he or his former firm , Jenner & Block LLP , did on behalf of detainees while Mr. Perrelli served on the firm ’s management committee and on its appellate and Supreme Court practice groups .
And Mr. Perrelli is just one official ; a number of other Justice Department officials apparently did private - sector work on detainee cases .
This is an important topic .
Even if each official who did prior work on detainee cases has indeed properly recused himself from those cases while at the Justice Department , there could be such a large number of affected officials that the department ’s prevailing ethos could be tilted strongly in the detainees ’ favor .
Mr. Grassley ’s inquiry is pressing because it could ferret out any instance in which a department official should have been recused but was n’t .
When the senator publicly requested information from Mr. Holder , the attorney general merely promised to “ consider ” the request .
After some hemming and hawing and dodging , Mr. Holder eventually said he needed to make sure there was no “ attorney - client privilege ” involved before disclosing the list of recusals .
This is absurd .
Attorney - client privilege may extend to the substance of lawyers ’ discussions with detainees , but not to the mere question of whether the lawyers are doing such work .
While the rest of the list of recusals has yet to be provided to the senator , The Washington Times secured the Perrelli recusal list , which previously had been distributed widely within the Justice Department .
Herewith , consider this list of names of detainees whose cases are listed as “ active ” on the Perrelli recusal list :
Saad Al Qahtani .
Mohammed Zahrani .
Achraf Salim ( “ Sultan ” ) Abdessalam .
Abdul Rahman Abdul Abu Ghityh Sulayman .
Musaab Omar Al Madhwani .
Jawad Jabbar Sadkhan ( Al Sahlani ) .
Majid Khan .
Also listed as active are the cases of Anam v. Bush , Jabbarov v. Bush , Bronte v. Department of Defense , Al Odah et. al. v. USA , Boumediene v. Bush , and Rumsfeld v. Padilla .
None of this is to say that Mr. Perrelli did anything wrong .
His recusals are proper , but the extent of the recusals raises questions about whether the attorney general has enough unbiased advisers around him to have made good judgments about how to try Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and other detainees .
He certainly did seem terribly ill - informed when asked basic questions at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday about how Miranda rights for detainees would be treated in civil courts and if any enemy combatant from a foreign battlefield had ever been tried in American civil courts .
Columnist Charles Krauthammer justly called Mr. Holder ’s responses “ utterly incoherent . ”
If the incoherence stems from an inherent bias among President Obama ’s appointees at the Justice Department , senators and the American public have the right to know it .

Is this what a spaceship sounds like ?

As electric vehicles ( EVs ) become part of our lives – both Nissan and Mitsubishi will have models on sale here within the next year , and charging points are being installed by local authorities around the country – one safety issue is becoming urgent .
Unlike , say , an electric milk float , EVs are astonishingly silent , with just the wheel rumble and an occasional electric whine to alert you to their approach .
The Royal National Institute of Blind People has been raising awareness of the risk ; legislation is likely to follow soon .
All this is wonderful news for Lotus Engineering , which has been working for two years on a system to mimic engine noises .
With the help of Harman International – which specialises in car sound systems – it came up with an electronic device that is wired into the engine and follows the revs to produce a synthetic engine noise .
So how does it sound ?
In the end Harman synthesised a number of alternatives , including a Prius in petrol - powered mode , the purring of an Aston Martin 's supercharged V8 , the tiger 's roar of a Ferrari V12 engine , and the four - cylinder boxer engine you might find in an Alfa Romeo .
And just for good measure , they added two spaceship sounds : rising and gently descending .
Tony Harberman , director of sales , lets slip the fact that these sounds were inspired by spaceships in well - known sci- fi films .
As we float gently through the streets of London , a construction worker does a double take ; an entire column of schoolboys , coming out of Regent 's Park , nudge each other and point .
Which film ?
It 's definitely not Star Wars , I 'll tell you that much .
Race row as black stars are left out of Couples Retreat film poster
Omitted : Kali Hawk is removed from the ' simplified ' British poster
The makers of a hit Hollywood film are at the centre of a race controversy after removing two black actors from a poster being used to promote it in Britain .
The American advert for Couples Retreat , a comedy starring Vince Vaughn and Kristin Davis , show all eight principal actors – six of whom are white and two black .
But the poster in Britain , where the film is on general release , omits actors Faizon Love and Kali Hawk .
Couples Retreat , about four couples who go on holiday together and receive therapy to improve their relationships , has taken more than £ 70 million at the box office worldwide since it opened last month .
A spokesman for makers Universal Pictures confirmed the poster had been changed to ‘ simplify ’ it for the UK and international market outside America .
The studio said it regretted causing offence and has abandoned plans to use the revised poster in other countries .
Mail on Sunday film critic Jason Solomons said : ‘ We do n’t cater much for the black cinema - going audience in this country , which is a great shame , so it seems strange that when there are black stars in a major feature film this fact is n’t promoted .
And , in terms of business decisions , this seems a pretty counter - productive one . ’
Caspar Salmon , a 29 - year - old translator from London who has seen the film , has complained to Universal .
He said in a letter to the film company : ‘ My hackles are up .
I would like to ask what the thinking was behind this move to gaz - ump [ Love and Hawk ] from the promotional material . ’
The American version of the poster , which includes black actors Faizon Love and Kali Hawk
The British version of the poster does not include the couple , however
Vivienne Pattison , director of Mediawatch - UK , said : ‘ I think this was an ill - conceived move .
We celebrate diversity in Britain and we could have coped with seeing the same poster used in America . ’
Last month black British actress Thandie Newton spoke of racism in the film industry .
She said : ‘ I ’ve experienced racism in Hollywood , but not as conflict or in a threatening way , just the ignorance of people . ’
A Universal spokesman said the revised advert aimed ‘ to simplify the poster to actors who are most recognisable in international markets ’.

Saturday , November 21st , 8:49 am : Good morning .
I am about to read Sarah Palin .
But I want to say something first about the dust jacket .
Going Rogue has a remarkable dust jacket .
After the jump I have posted two images for your consideration .
The Memoir that Began the Decade .
The Memoir that Ended the Decade .
So .
What we have here on the dust jacket of the last best - selling memoir of the decade is a photograph of Sarah Palin .
She is wearing a red zipper jacket ( of some unknowable fabric blend ) and a tri-color flag pin ( from some unknowable metal alloy ) .
She is gazing left and beaming brightly ( and something bright is beaming back at her , illuminating her face with a soft and unnatural glow ) .
The photographer must have been crouching when this photograph was snapped , must have been aiming the camera upward at Palin , because the horizon behind Palin is low in the frame , which makes Palin seem to tower down from blue and optimistic heavens .
The effect is worshipful .
Or , the effect is mock - worshipful :
The last memoir to feature this much gaudy red fabric , this many maudlin blue clouds , was A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius .
And so , before even opening the book , I am wondering whether Palin is being lampooned .
HarperCollins , her publisher , is headquartered at 10 East 53rd Street , New York , New York .
This means that the editors and designers and publicists who have spent the last dozen Monday mornings ushering Going Rogue into print have also spent the last dozen Saturdays walking the variegated streets of Brooklyn and shopping the encyclopedic stores of Manhattan , have spent the last dozen Sundays reading only pertinent magazines and eating only well - researched meals .
In other words ?
In other words , these people at HarperCollins - even the dullest of them - are not unsophisticated .
They are versed in the national semiotics , are familiar with the elements of portraiture .
They know that this photo of Palin is mocking .
They know this photo will make half the world recoil , or snort .
And yet no one at HarperCollins stopped Sarah Palin from being made a laughingstock by her own dust jacket .
. . .
9:09 am : Not half an hour in , and I have realized that I am in journalistic trouble .
HarperCollins ?
Who publishes Palin ?
Um , so , they also publish me .
I must now eat breakfast .
I feel duty - bound not to begin reading until 10:00 am .
. . .
9:28 am .
But , so , the first thing in this book is a map .
It appears on the page before the title page : a map of the northern hemisphere , centered on the Artic Sea .
Lines of longitude all converge from every corner , coming together at the North Pole , which is right at the center of the map .
“ The View from the Top of the World , ” the map says .
Russia , upside - down , stretches across the upper part of the map , from about 9 o’clock to about 2 o’clock , and Greenland and Canada , right - side - up , stretch along the lower parts , from about 3 o’clock to 8 o’clock .
Between 8 and 9 o’clock , printed in a darker shade of gray than any other landmass , labeled in a font to indicate that it is not a state but a nation , is Alaska .
This map effectively re-emphasizes something I learned at age seven .
From an international military perspective , Alaska is our only defense against armies in Kamchatka and Irkutsk .
. . .
10:03 am : Have begun reading .
Here is the first syntax in the book :
Dedicated to all Patriots who share my love of the United States of America .
And particularly to our women and men in uniform , past and present - God bless the fight for freedom .
No comment .
. . .
10:10 am : I am on page three , and already I feel the need to type out some more block quotes .
Please be patient .
. . .
10:11 am : So .
When the book opens , it is August of 2008 and Governor Sarah Palin is at the Alaska State Fair .
My guess is that by page ten she will receive the amazing & incredible phone call telling her that she has been chose as John McCain ’s running mate .
( My guess is also that receiving that amazing & incredible phone call will serve as a cliffhanger ending to Chapter 1 ; my guess is also that the narrative will skip thirty years into the past at the beginning of Chapter 2 , so that Palin can recount the amazing & incredible voyage that brought her to the Alaska State Fair , as the Governor , in August of 2008 . )
But as I said , I am only on page 3 :
Years before , I had seen out state speeding toward an economic train wreck .
Since construction began in 1975 on what would become Alaska ’s economic lifeline , the Trans - Alaska Pipeline , it had grown increasingly obvious to everyday Alaskans that many of their public servants were not necessarily serving the public .
Instead they had climbed into bed with Big Oil .
Meanwhile , in a young state where people clung to America ’s original pioneering and independent spirit , government was growing as fast as fireweed in July .
This prose is only averagely bad .
It is plain from the first that Palin writes carelessly , and the reader adjusts .
The phrase “ an economic train wreck ” ?
It does n’t evoke any railroad images , it is just a poorly engineered synonym for the noun “ disaster . ”
“ Climb into bed ” ?
A sleepy variant for the verb “ accommodate . ”
If she were not deaf to connotation , she would not use the verb “ cling ” ( as in “ they cling to guns and religion ” ) without irony ; if she were not deaf to music , she would avoid the repetition of “ lifeline ” and “ Pipeline . ”
But , again , in terms of vice - presidential memoirs , this is only averagely bad .
At least it still makes sense .
Continuing :
It did n’t make sense .
It seemed that true public service , crafting policies that were good for the people , had become increasingly derailed by politics and its infernal machines .
And so the prose goes to hell .
One paragraph earlier , the train was the economy , and it was speeding toward a wreck .
In this paragraph , the train is public service , and it has been derailed .
In fact , the train is “ increasingly derailed . ”
Never mind that , in English , a train cannot become “ increasingly derailed , ” any more than a fetus can be “ increasingly aborted , ” or than Christ Our Savior can be “ increasingly born ” - we already knew that no wreck and no derailment could stop this particular vice - presidential locomotive :
But I had a drive to help , an interest in government and current events since I was a little kid , and I had become aware of the impact of common sense public policy during the presidency of Ronald Reagan .
I was intrigued by political science in college and studied journalism because of my passion for the power of words .
I want to say that this final sentence is evidence , just like the dust jacket , of the editorial dereliction at HarperCollins ; I want to say that letting Sarah Palin put in print that she has a “ passion for the power of words ” is tantamount to letting her put in print that she is an fool .
But perhaps not .
Perhaps the employees of HarperCollins did warn her ; perhaps Palin was just too arrogant to take heed .
. . .
10:52 am : Fifty - two minutes , and I ’ve read three pages .
. . .
10:57 am : Shit , folks , no foolin’ .
On page 6 , while still at the Alaska State Fair , she gets a phone call .
“ It was Senator John McCain , asking if I wanted to help him change history . ”
And then Chapter 1 ends .
And then Chapter 2 begins on page 7 , and “ From Sandpoint , Idaho , where I was born , via Juneau , Alaska , I touched down in the windy , remote frontier town of Skagway cradled in my mother ’s arms . ”
If you ever write a vice - presidential memoir , make certain to begin in media res .
. . .
11:38 am : I am on page 38 , having finished Chapter 6 , which begins with the following sentence :
By my senior year of high - school , I had been praying that God would n’t have in mind for my future one of the local boys I ’d grown up with .
And ends with the following sentence :
My young , crushed spirit learned a lesson about guys that day : even the good ones can act like jerks .
The year is 1981 , and Sarah Heath has met Todd Palin .
It is a fine chapter .
We hear about Van Halen cassette tapes , and L.A. Lakers sweatshirts and how , barred from long conversations on the family phone , Sarah would contact Todd from her backporch , using the handheld VHF radio off his fishingboats .
It is , in fact , the liveliest chapter about vice - presidential childhood ever written .
Ed Muskie tried the same thing , and came off sounding platitudinous .
He came off sounding presidential .
Sarah Palin actually sounds like someone trying her Christian & autodidactic best to write a first book .
. . .
11:49 am .
It is , after all , an autodidact ’s book .
Oh , she graduated high school , she graduated college .
But when Palin remembers her school years , she remembers sports .
When she remembers the classroom , she remembers a television being rolled in to show a movie of the moon landing .
Her memories of learning to spell are set in church where , during a sermon , she realizes she knows how to spell the word “ different . ”
She has an autodidact ’s eclecticism .
She has assembled a magpie philosophy , and she can tell you the national origin of every piece of it :
Mom found a depth of spirituality she had been seeking , the filling of what the French writer Blaise Pascal called “ the god - shaped vacuum ” in every human heart
And she also has this autodidactic tic : Page 3 : “ My passion for the power of words . ”
Page 15 : “ I developed a love of reading and writing early on . ”
Page 15 : “ She found clever ways to encourage my love of the written word . ”
Page 28 : “ My passion for both sports and the written word . ”
. . .
12:19 pm : Palin wants to convince the reader , or herself , that she is a great lover and protector of the Alaskan wild .
And so , for example , on pages 34 and 35 she waxes on about Alaska ’s bountiful salmon , pictured here :
One fish .
It is worth nothing that , in 2008 , when Alaskans were called to voted on a measure asking whether or not humanity ought to preserve what the New York Times called “ one of the world ’s last great runs of Pacific salmon , ” Alaskans decided that humanity should not .
A major factor in the defeat of the measure in question was , I gather , the opposition of Alaska ’s governor , Sarah Palin .
( If anyone knows the latest on this story , by the way , I ’d be curious to hear about it in the comments . )
. . .
12:33 pm . Page 44 .
Chapter 7 . Palin recounts how she began entering the Miss America Scholarship Pageant to help pay for her college tuition .
She excerpts an exchange , captured on video tape , between herself and one of the judges .
The judge , mentioning that Geraldine Ferraro has just become the first female vice - presidential candidate , asks : “ Would you vote for a vice presidential or presidential candidate just because she was a woman ? ”
Pageant contestant Sarah Heath answers , unsurprisingly : “ No , I would not vote for someone just because they were a woman .
I would vote her the candidate that reflected my political beliefs and had strong character and family values . ”
Fine , fine .
What is fascinating is what Palin has to say about this exchange now , in 2009 .
It is the most revealing moment thus far in the memoir .
It expresses , in a single breath , Palin ’s two most outstanding characteristics , her giant self - regard and her stunted self - reflection :
That exchange , a quarter century ago , now seems either strangely coincidental or a Providential signpost pointing forward my future .
And I do n’t believe in coincidences .
. . .
12:51 pm : Pardon my silence for an hour .
I must eat and read .
. . .
1:32 pm .
While eating a cheese sandwich , I read Palin ’s descriptions of motherhood .
( These passages are the most saccharine of Americana ; they are mom-tastic ; they deserve an essay themselves , something in fiery Menkenese .
Later , later . )
So let me cite one small example .
On page 57 , Bristol Palin has just been born .
“ Her shock of black hair , chubby cheeks , and dark , lively eyes showed off her Native heritage . ”
And what was the child like ? :
As she grew she manifested her little mama ’s heart by nurturing her siblings and cousins and always begging to babysit .
How Sarah Palin , knowing what she knows in 2009 , could write with pride that Bristol Palin always had a “ little mama ’s heart , ” is beyond my power to explain .
It was enough to make me put down my cheese sandwich .
It is enough to make me spend twenty minutes away from my lunch , hunched over my laptop , trying to find words .
. . .
2:18 pm : There are likable moments :
While I served in [ the Wasilla ] council , a local politician asked me to cut a radio ad for his campaign .
I liked his conservative message and said I ’d help .
Into the KMBQ radio station I brought my hungry , grumpy baby in a Snugli , and the only way to calm Willow was to inconspicuously nurse her while we rolled tape .
I acted like I did n’t see the shocked look on the politician ’s face as he turned red and pretended it did n’t bother him at all .
That said , “ turning red and pretending it does n’t bother her at all ” is a nice summary of what this book has become , by page 77 .
Palin is recounting her tenure as mayor of Wasilla , which is to say , recounting some of the incidents of her early political life that would be revisted in 2008 .
Palin explains , for example , her famous run-ins with the town librarian .
Red in the face , she pretends that the national media ’s portrayal of her a small - town censor does n’t bother her at all .
. . .
2:32 pm : Page 80 : “ As Napoleon said , ‘ Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake . ’ ”
. . .
2:32 pm : Page 84 : This memoir is reminiscent of Dan Quayle ’s , in its incoherence .
( In Quayle ’s case it seemed calculated ; in Palin ’s case , less so . )
Of her first campaign for statewide office in Alaska , Palin says :
The campaign was also my first opportunity to introduce my fiscal philosophy to all Alaskans .
In national politics , some feel that Big Business is always opposed to the Little Guy .
Some people seem to think a profit motive is inherently greedy and evil , and that what ’s good for business is bad for people .
Of course , among the people who “ seem to think ” that “ what ’s good for business is bad for people ” is Palin herself , as reflected in that passage from Page 3 that I quoted above , “ public servants not necessarily serving the public , ” “ climbed into bed with Big Oil , ” etc .
It ’s inadvertent , of course .
Palin speaks only in rhetoric ; which is to say , she speaks only in words she heard somewhere else ; which is to say coherence cannot be expected .
Hence the quotes from Pascal , from Napoleon .
. . .
3:00 pm : And from Lou Holtz .
Page 79 :
I have a bulletin board filled with coffee - stained , dog - eared quotes tacked up along with family photos that has followed me from office to office since 1992 .
One of my favorite quotes comes from author and former football coach Lou Holtz , on how to build your team : “ Motivation is simple .
You eliminate those who are not motivated . ”
Speaking of motivation : Reading this book is like walking through a snowbank .
I am up to my icy loins in the whitest cliche .
. . .
3:24 pm : What happens when a clean - mouthed & mom-tastic writer has the perfect clichÃƒ Â© to express a sentiment , but the clichÃƒ Â© involves mild vulgarity ?
Page 98 :
Then the strained peas hit the fan .
. . .
3:34 pm .
This book is 413 pages long , divided into five long parts , each consisting of half a dozen sub-chapters .
I have just reached the end of the second part , which occurs on page 104 .
It is now the Winter of 2004 .
Sarah Palin has lost a race for Lieutenant Governor .
She is caring for her newest child , Piper , and is going for long runs , and is saying long prayers , and is beginning to feel “ a sense of purpose hovering just beyond my vision . ”
Obviously , God is about to instruct Sarah Palin to seek the governorship .
The third part of the book begins on page 105 .
I see that it is titled “ Drill , Baby , Drill . ”
It is 100 pages long .
I will read it before I go to sleep tonight .
But pardon me for a couple of hours while I go for a long run and say some long prayers .
I ’ll be back on - line by 6 pm in Brooklyn .
. . .
5:23 pm : While I ran , I sensed something hovering just beyond my vision .
I sensed it was the Spirit of Sarah .
And I realized that the same dynamic that , in 2008 , doomed her candidacy for Vice President now , in 2009 , dooms her project as a memoirist .
As a candidate , Palin believed her appeal lay in her populism ; in her speech and in her manner , she comported herself as though she were unspoiled by any worldly refinements ; she was a “ hockey mom , ” she was “ from Main Street , not Wall Street ; ” Sarah Palin , we were told , was one of us .
But America was at an undemocratic moment in 2008 ; Americans did not want a government of the normal and of the everyday , a government of the averagely bad ; Americans wanted a government of superior people ; Americans wanted , in other words , competence .
Similarly so , as a memoirist , Palin believes her appeal lays in her common tongue .
She ventures no opinions we have not heard before , from all our neighbors and friends ; she formulates no thoughts that could n’t be expressed by a high school coach , or by the master of ceremonies at a state fair .
And so her book is devoid of psychology , or subtlety .
The sublime hatreds , the wafting regret , the recurrent dreaming , the stuff of human life : they are absent from this book .
She is willing to talk about her labor pains when she had her first child , she is willing to tell us about her fights with her husband - but only in the peppy and off - handed tone that co-workers and causal acquaintances use when they want to discourage further questions .
She sounds like one of us , and so fails to justify consuming our attention .
Readers want a literature to be superior company .
But , as I was saying , while I ran , I sensed something hovering just beyond my vision .
. . .
5:44 pm : And , as I said , I sensed it was the Spirit of Sarah .
Here is a quote from page 86 , where Palin described her losing bid to be Alaska ’s Lieutenant Governor :
“ I ’m going one step forward and two steps back , ” I wrote in my journal .
“ And this is my laughable attempt at running ? ”
My campaign theme was “ New Energy , ” but , unfortunately , I did not run an energetic campaign .
I had always burned with purpose , but this time I was stretched so thin that there was just no room for another log on the fire .
What there is always room for , in Palin ’s memoir , is another metaphor in the mix , another proverb in the paragraph .
I thought about this paragraph while I was on my run .
My run took me around Prospect Park in Brooklyn .
And , as I came to the bend at the bottom of the hill , as I turned the corner at the far end of the lake , I finally caught sight of that thing that had been hovering just beyond my vision .
It was the Spirit of Sarah .
And I recognized who she was .
Sarah Palin was Sancho Panza .
. . .
. . .
6:00 pm : One hundred pages to go before I sleep .
. . .
6:21 pm : Page 114 .
Palin is describing her bid to be Governor .
She and Todd drive deep into the countryside to deliver a yard sign :
These good folks were exactly the type of Alaskans who supported us : hardworking , unpretentious , patriotic , and ready for honest leadership .
As opposed to the lazy , effete , seditious crooks who opposed Palin .
Anyway :
They treated us to slices of homemade rhubarb pie , then gave us a whole blueberry pie that we shared with friends after our 800 - mile , 40 - hour round - trip , driven to the sound of the Black Eyed Peas and and old LL Cool J remix we found in the glove box .
Please , please , in the comments , can someone explain to me :
What is it with the Black Eyed Peas ?
. . .
6:59 pm : Good governance may be tedious and inglorious ; but can nothing be done to liven it up , when it later is recorded in prose ?
From pages 124 and 125 :
I knew if I kept my campaign promise of overhauling the state in the areas of resource development , fiscal restraint , and ethical government , I would also be able to turn attention to equally urgent issues such as education , services for special needs and the elderly , job training , unemployment , and social ills in rural Alaska .
We ’d be able to do so with reprioritized funding to help the private sector provide opportunities in a way that would help Alaskans stand tall and independent .
I read this , and I realized : Jesus shit , Sarah Palin actually thinks there is a chance I may someday vote for her .
. . .
7:26 pm : Page 146 :
As Thomas Paine said in 1776 : “ If there must be trouble , let it be in my day , that my children may have peace . ”
And then , between Page 146 and 147 come eight pages of full - color photos of Heath and Palin family life from the 1960s through the 1990s .
About these I will say nothing except that they are gamey .
. . .
7:45 pm . Page 153 .
The gamey photos are over .
There is a section about Alaskan energy policy .
There is a section about the Alaskan budget process .
Yes , yes , it seems that this entire one - hundred - page - long section , “ Drill , Baby , Drill , ” is going to consist exclusively of Palin bragging about the twenty months she spent as Governor of Alaska before getting that amazing & incredible phone call from John McCain .
It is now 7:48 pm .
In twelve minutes , I start drinking .
. . .
7:55 pm : I mean seven minutes .
. . .
8:03 pm : Page 153 : “ … one of my first priorities was to establish the Petroleum Systems Integrity Office ( PSIO ) … ” Page 155 : “ … the ethics supervisor over AOGCC … “ Page 157 : “ … what would become the landmark Alaska Gasline Inducement Act , or AGIA … “
This is dark .
To cry “ Speak , Memory ! ” and to hear Memory answer in acronyms ?
Very dark .
. . .
8:30 pm : Page 171 .
Palin is recounting some memories of her oldest child , Track .
He played hockey , suffered some injuries .
One injury , from when he was 17 , sent him to a hospital where the silly nurses - anxious to leave his stomach empty should he need surgery , reluctant to proceed medically without his parents ’ consent - declined to give the boy a drink of water .
This provides occasion for Palin to reflect :
I even wondered out loud why this big , strapping nearly grown man who was overcome with pain could n’t even get a drink of water without parental consent , yet a thirteen - year - old girl could undergo a painful , invasive , and scary abortion and no parent even had to be notified .
So maybe Palin does have a sense of irony .
Or maybe not .
Two pages later , Palin watches while Track enlists as an Army infantry man .
( The Army was happy to have him as a soldier , despite his hockey injuries ; they needed boots on the ground in Iraq . )
He takes the oath on September 11 , 2007 .
Palin reflects :
These are just kids !
I thought .
Yet they ’re doing all they can to protect and serve the greatest country on earth .
Are the rest of us doing as much ?
That sentiment concludes sub- chapter 8 .
Sub - chapter nine begins with Palin reporting what she did to match her son ’s commitment :
Two weeks later , I flew to New Orleans to keynote an oil and gas conference .
. . .
8:54 pm : If you are in a bookstore , if you have five minutes to spare , read pages 171 through 180 of Palin ’s memoir , where she recounts the days when she learned that her fifth child would be born with Down syndrome .
For this atheist , at this hour of night , admiration mixed with pity .
Here is a woman whose first thought is always , This is the work of God .
. . .
9:06 pm : I shall make only one more remark tonight .
. . .
9:58 pm : And that is that I have reached page 208 , the end of Part 3 .
Track has shipped off ;
Trig has been born ; John McCain is about to call Sarah Palin , and the plunge into the narrative past that began on page 7 has finally come to a close .
Part 4 , which begins on page 209 , is titled “ Going Rogue . ”
I will begin reading that as soon as I am awake in the morning .
For tonight , I leave you with this , from a description of the Iron Dog race :
Trailbreakers move through to mark the trail before the racers take off .
A couple of years ago one of them was caught in an avalanche .
It took ten days to find the guy ’s body buried in the snow .
We ’ve lost a few friends that way .
How true , Sarah .
How true .
. . .
Part two of Reading Sarah Palin commences here .

Senna beat Michael Schumacher and Juan Manuel Fangio to top spot in the unique poll , which is the most comprehensive survey of F1 drivers ever conducted .
The voters had a combined total of 9194 starts and 270 wins , and included starters from all but 10 world championship grands prix ( the 11 world championship Indianapolis 500s were excluded from the poll ) .
Among the voters were Michael Schumacher , statistically the most successful F1 driver in history , Jose Froilan Gonzalez , the earliest surviving grand prix winner , Paul Pietsch , at 98 the oldest living driver , reigning world champion Jenson Button and much of the current F1 grid .
AUTOSPORT asked each voter to submit their top 10 ' greatest ' F1 drivers , and left the definition of ' greatest ' open to interpretation .
" This is an amazing poll that has never been tried before , " said AUTOSPORT editor Andrew van de Burgt .
" Obviously , it has thrown up some interesting and unexpected results , but you can't argue with how the top 10 has worked out , or the integrity of the poll . "

The Bubble and M52
Credit & Copyright : Tony Hallas
Explanation :
To the eye , this cosmic composition nicely balances the Bubble Nebula at the upper right with open star cluster M52 .
The pair would be lopsided on other scales , though .
Embedded in a complex of interstellar dust and gas and blown by the winds from a single , massive O - type star , the Bubble Nebula ( aka NGC 7635 ) is a mere 10 light - years wide .
On the other hand , M52 is a rich open cluster of around a thousand stars .
The cluster is about 25 light - years across .
Seen toward the northern boundary of Cassiopeia , distance estimates for the Bubble Nebula and associated cloud complex are around 11,000 light - years , while star cluster M52 lies nearly 5,000 light - years away .
The WISE spacecraft sits under its protective covering after its arrival at Vandenberg Air Force Base , where it will launch from this winter .
WASHINGTON ?
NASA 's new asteroid - hunting spacecraft willroll out to the pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base , Calif. , Friday inpreparation for launch next month .
The spacecraft is due to launch Dec. 9 aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta 2 rocket .
Known as the Wide - field Infrared Survey Explorer ( WISE ) , thespacecraft will spend the next 10 months circling the Earth over the poles , scanning the complete sky at infrared wavelengths to uncoverhidden cosmic objects , including cool stars , dark asteroids and luminousgalaxies .
" You can kind of think of it as the Google Map of theuniverse , " said Amy Mainzer , NASA ?s deputy project scientist for WISE , explaining that the instrument will take repeated exposures of the same swathof sky , creating overlapping images as the telescope progresses through its skyscan .
The stars and galaxies will appear fixed on the sky in each exposure , butasteroids will move over short amounts of time .
" WISE is going to be finding about 100,000 new asteroids inthe main asteroid belt , " Mainzer said during a Nov. 17 news conference at NASAheadquarters here .
" And we expect it ? s going to find several hundred newasteroids that getclose to Earth orbits .
These are asteroids and comets whose orbits takethem close to Earth ?s orbit . "
The $ 320 million project , managed by NASA 's Jet PropulsionLaboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , was competitively selected under NASA 'sExplorers Program , managed by the agency 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md . The science instrument was built by the Space Dynamics Laboratory in Logan , Utah , and the spacecraft was built by Boulder , Colo . - based Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp .
WISE principal investigator Edward " Ned " Wright of the University of So uthern California , Los Angeles , said the instrument will provide a vastimprovement over past infrared sky surveys .
" We will find millions of objects that have never been seenbefore , " he said during the news conference .
In addition to near Earth objects , WISE will find coolstars , known as browndwarfs , which glow feebly like chunks of heated coal .
By studying browndwarfs , astronomers can learn more about star formation , as well as theatmospheres of planets orbiting stars beyond the sun .
" WISE is going to survey the whole sky and find thesenearest neighbors and transform our view of the solar neighborhood , " said PeterEisenhardt , WISE project scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
" It 'spossible that one of these nearby brown dwarfs is even closer to the sun thanany star that we now know of . "
The mission also will spot dusty nests of stars , swirlingplanet - forming disks and evolving galaxies .
" WISE has been designed so that it can detect thesecataclysmic dusty forming galaxies out to a distance of 10 billion light yearsover the entire sky , " said Eisenhardt .
" So we 're going to find the mostsuper - duper , hyper - ultra luminous forming galaxies in the universe , and we 'llsee just how extreme this galaxy forming process can get . "
The mission will map the entire sky at four infraredwavelengths with sensitivity hundreds to hundreds of thousands of times greaterthan its predecessors , cataloging hundreds of millions of objects .
The datawill serve as a navigation chart of sorts for other missions , pointing them tothe most interesting targets .
NASA 's Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes , the European Space Agency 's Herschel Space Observatory , and NASA 's upcoming Sofia and James Webb Space Telescope will follow up on WISE finds .
" This is an exciting time for space telescopes , " said JonMorse , Astrophysics Division director at NASA headquarters here .
" Many of thetelescopes will work together , each contributing different pieces to some ofthe most intriguing puzzles in our universe . "
Abdallah Abu Rahmah ( far right ) with Ela Bhatt , Desmond Tutu , Jimmy Carter , Fernando Cardoso , Mary Robinson and Gro Brundtland of the Elders visiting the grave of a Bil ’in resident who was shot dead by the Israeli military during a protest .
From the Popular Struggle Coordination Committee , a new coordination body of many of the popular committees in the West Bank :
At exactly 2 AM last night , seven Israeli military jeeps pulled over at Abdallah Abu Rahmah ’s residence in the city of Ramallah .
Soldiers raided the house and arrested Abu Rahmah from his bed in the presence of his wife and children .
Abu Rahmah is a high school teacher in the Latin Patriarchate school in Birzeit near Ramallah and is the coordinator of the Bil ’in Popular Committee against the Wall and Settlements .
A previous raid targeting Abu Rahmah was executed with such exceptional violence on 15 September 2009 that a soldier was subsequently indicted for assault .
Abu Rahmah ’s arrest is part of an escalation in Israeli military ’s attempts to break the spirit of the people of Bil’in , their popular leadership , and the popular struggle as a whole – aimed at crushing demonstrations against the Wall .
Recently , Adv. Gaby Lasky , who represents many of Bil ’in ’s detainees , was informed by the military prosecution that the army intends to use legal measures as a means of ending the demonstrations .
Following Abu Rahmah ’s arrest , Adv. Lasky , stated that " My client ’s arrest is another blatant illustration of the Israeli authorities ’ application of legal procedures for the political persecution of Bil ’in residents .
The Bil ’in demonstrators are being systemically targeted while it is the State that is in contempt of a High Court of Justice ruling ; a ruling which affirmed that the protesters have justice on their side and instructed 2 years ago that the route of the Wall in the area be changed , which has not been implemented to date . "
Since 23 June 2009 , 31 residents of Bil ’in have been detained by the military .
The Army has pursued Popular Committee members in its arrest operation , but all three detained members were released for lack of evidence .
In the case of another member , Mohammed Khatib , the court even found some of the presented evidence to be falsified .
In addition to committee members , a leading Bil ’in activist , Adeeb Abu Rahmah , who has been detained for over five months , is not suspected of committing any violence , but was indicted with a blanket charge of “ incitement ” , which was very liberally interpreted in this case to include the organizing of grassroots demonstrations .
Monkeys are back at NASA ( Image : NASA )
Late last month , NASA announced the winners of 12 awards for studying the biological effects of radiation .
Topping the list is a $ 1.75 million project to irradiate up to 18 squirrel monkeys in an effort to find out what space radiation does to the central nervous system .
If it goes ahead , the experiment will be the first NASA - funded primate project to begin in more than 30 years .
What will the experiment do and what does NASA hope to learn ?
New Scientist investigates .
What will this new experiment entail ?
Advertisement
A group at Harvard Medical School ’s McLean Hospital in Belmont , Massachusetts , will expose the monkeys to a single dose of radiation that will be equivalent to the total amount of radiation astronauts will absorb during a three - year - long Mars mission .
The monkeys ’ performance before and after exposure will be tested by measuring how they respond to visual cues on a computer touch screen .
The experiment is designed to investigate the effects of solar flares and galactic cosmic rays : both will bombard astronauts with charged particles in greater numbers once they leave the protection of Earth ’s magnetosphere .
Why does NASA want to do this experiment ?
Since 2004 , the US has been following a plan to return astronauts to the moon , with the eventual aim of going to Mars .
There are hints that space radiation affects the brain , but it is still unclear how much of a risk it poses to deep - space explorers .
NASA says it wants to find out what is needed to protect them .
How is this different from the radiation research NASA has done before ?
The agency ’s last research project on primates began in the early 1970s , when NASA and the US air force studied the effect of radiation on cataract formation in rhesus monkeys .
But NASA has been examining the neurological effects of radiation for some time .
In 2007 , a helmet covered with particle counters and an electroencephalograph were sent to the International Space Station to assess how astronaut brain activity changes in real time in response to radiation .
To date , the only animal research on the neurological effects of space radiation has been done in rodents .
What has the animal research shown so far ?
Experiments on mice and rats have shown that irradiation can affect learning and memory .
Rats , for example , have a difficult time navigating mazes and seem less interested in novel objects if they have been exposed to radiation .
They also have a harder time learning to press a lever for more food and experience more anxiety in stressful situations .
In many experiments , the effects are similar to those seen in older rats .
The cause of the damage is still poorly understood , but radiation is known to create highly reactive oxygen - containing molecules in the body .
Such molecules are also suspected to contribute to the effects of ageing .
Why extend the study to primates ?
“ The data we have now , I think , is a basis for concern , ” says Bernard Rabin of the University of Maryland , Baltimore County , who has received support from NASA to study radiation effects on rodents .
“ There is a potential for cognitive deficits for astronauts within the dose range that NASA expects they would experience on a Mars mission . ”
But rat behaviour is too distant from human behaviour to allow straightforward predictions of how radiation will affect astronaut performance and brain function .
To make a solid comparison with humans , a primate model is essential .
When will the experiment begin ?
It ’s not yet clear .
The research proposal is still awaiting approval by the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton , New York , where the irradiation would take place .
Zachary brought in the set to use to eat his lunch
A six - year - old American schoolboy will be suspended after bringing his favourite camping cutlery to school .
Zachary Christie took out the combination knife , fork and spoon at lunch , in violation of the school policy of not bringing in knives .
The school had originally said Zachary should spend 45 days at an alternative school for troublemakers .
But after a meeting , the board voted instead to suspend Zachary for between three and five days .
Downes Elementary School , in Newark , Delaware , operates a zero tolerance policy on knives , banning them as dangerous instruments .
Officials said they were forced to act regardless of Zachary 's age or what he planned to do with the knife , the Associated Press reported .
" Politically , zero tolerance is what everybody clamours for , until we start to realise how harsh zero tolerance can be , " School board member John Mackenzie told AP ahead of the vote .
But the seven - member board voted unanimously to reduce the punishment for the school 's youngest students .
In other cases school officials have ignored the policy and Mr Mackenzie said he was surprised this had not happened in Zachary 's case .
Zachary and his mother supported the policy but were unhappy with its implementation , saying the punishment had been too harsh .

Calculated Risk had an interesting post last Saturday about Refinancing with Negative Equity .
His post refers to an article written by David Streitfeld from the NY Times Interest Rates Are Low , but Banks Balk at Refinancing citing among other things the plights of Mark Belvedere who owes $ 235,000 on a condo that would sell for barely half that today , and Andrew Knapp who has tried twice to refinance and failed .
From the Times ...
Mr. Belvedere said he would be willing to live with all that lost equity if he could refinance his loan from a variable rate , which could eventually go as high as 12 percent , into a 30 - year fixed term .
His lender said no , citing the diminished value of the property .
“ It makes no sense and is so frustrating , ” Mr. Belvedere said .
“ I ’m ready and willing to pay the mortgage for the next 30 years , but they act like they ’d rather have me walk away . ”
Andrew Knapp , a sales executive in Bartlett , Ill. , has tried twice to refinance , which would save his family several hundred sorely needed dollars every month .
Lenders said the house had lost value and the Knapps had too much debt .
“ There was no urgency for them to do anything , ” Mr. Knapp said .
He has given up on the possibility of refinancing and is trying for a loan modification .
If that does not work , there is one more solution : walking away from his home .
“ We ’re a flight risk , ” he said .
Not So Fast
Unfortunately David Streitfeld does n't provide any further information on Belvedere 's loan .
If the loan was held by a bank , then it might make sense for the bank to refinance the loan ( this lowers the bank 's risk of default ) .
However Belvedere's " lender " might be a servicing company and the loan may have been securitized .
Then it is impossible to refinance because the current holders of the note would be paid off , and no new lender would make a loan greater than the value of the collateral .
Securitization Clues
The loan was an adjustable rate loan , one that could go as high as 12 % .
That smacks of subprime .
Most adjustable rate mortgages from 2005 should have long ago adjusted dramatically lower automatically unless he was a high risk ( subprime ) borrower with a huge spread over the loan index .
Nearly all subprime loans were securitized
Adverse Selection ( cherry picking ) affected Prime Loans
Securitizations , Cherry Picking , and Default Rates
The academic literature , the popular press , and policymakers have all debated
securitization ’s contribution to the poor performance of mortgages originated in the run-up to the current crisis .
Theoretical arguments have been advanced on both sides , but the lack of suitable data has made it difficult to assess them empirically .
We examine this issue by using a loan - level data set from LPS Analytics , covering approximately three - quarters of the mortgage market from 2003 - 2007 , and including both securitized and non-securitized loans .
We find evidence that privately securitized loans do indeed perform worse than similar , non-securitized loans .
Moreover , this effect is concentrated in prime mortgage markets .
For example , a typical prime ARM loan originated in 2006 becomes delinquent at a 20 percent higher rate if it is privately securitized , ceteris paribus .
By contrast , subprime loan performance does not seem to be worse for most classes of securitized loans .
Conclusions
Using a data set that covers approximately 75 percent of loan originations from the years 2003 - 2007 , and that includes private securitized , GSE , and mortgages held in portfolio , we have shown that prime private securitized loans originated at the peak of the bubble performed significantly worse than similar , non-securitized , loans .
The results are particularly striking for markets such as prime ARMs , in which issuers held non-negligible amounts of loans in portfolio .
This suggests that adverse selection may have been present in the prime mortgage market , and that it may have contributed to a deterioration in underwriting standards .

Substantial Losses Coming
Banks will need to take “ substantial ” writedowns on home - equity loans to enable loan modifications that will allow the U.S. housing market to recover , according to Amherst Securities Group LP .
The government ’s mortgage - modification program will fail to avert many of the 9 million to 10 million looming foreclosures because it does n’t reduce principal for borrowers , about a quarter of whom owe more than the current values of their houses , Laurie Goodman , a New York - based mortgage - bond analyst at Amherst , said today in a Bloomberg Radio interview .
“ It ’s important to realize the largest second - lien holders are the largest banks , and there ’s going to have to be some very substantial writedowns if you go to a principal - reduction program , ” Goodman said .
“ And this is going to have to be addressed head - on . ”
Bond investors such as BlackRock Inc. and Fortress Investment Group LLC have criticized the treatment of home - equity loans under the Obama administration ’s $ 75 billion Home Affordable program , citing in part the potential conflicts of interest that banks such as Wells Fargo & Co. and Bank of America Corp .
have in acting as both first - mortgage servicers and owners of second - lien debt .
Through November , U.S. lenders permanently modified 31,382 of as many as 4 million mortgages targeted by the Home Affordable program , the Treasury said Dec. 10 .
As many as half of “ at - risk ” homeowners have second mortgages , the department said in April .
U.S. banks held $ 855 billion of home - equity debt , including closed - end second mortgages and amounts drawn from revolving credit lines , as of Sept. 30 , according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data .

Trigonometric Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem
Elisha Loomis , myself and no doubt many others believed and still believe that no trigonometric proof of the Pythagorean theorem is possible .
This belief stems from the assumption that any such proof would rely on the most fundamental of trigonometric identities sin²α + cos²α = 1 which is nothing but a reformulation of the Pythagorean theorem proper .
Thus , as the common argument goes , relying on it would lead inevitably to the vicious circle of circular reasoning .
Now , Jason Zimba has showed that the theorem can be derived from the subtraction formulas for sine and cosine without a recourse to sin²α + cos²α = 1 .
I happily admit to being in the wrong .
Here are the two subtraction formulas that J. Zimba employs in his derivation of the Pythagorean theorem :
cos ( α - β) = cos α cos β + sin α sin β,
sin ( α - β) = sin α cos β - cos α sin β.
Note that the common definitions of sine and cosine as well as the proofs of the two identities always restrict α and β to the positive values less than 90° .
For this reason , simply setting α = β in the first of these leads to cos 0 = cos²α + sin²α .
However , the fact that cos 0 = 1 is not a consequence of more basic trigonometry but a definition by convenience .
As such , it could not be reasonably used in a proof of such a fundamental result as the Pythagorean theorem .
Instead , assume that 0 < y < x < 90° .
This makes 0 < x - y < 90° .
Then
cos y = cos ( x - ( x - y ) ) = cos x cos(x - y ) + sin x sin(x - y ) = cos x ( cos x cos y + sin x sin y ) + sin x ( sin x cos y - cos x sin y ) = ( cos²x + sin²x ) cos y ,
which implies sin²x + cos²x = 1 since , by the definition , cos y , being the ratio of a leg of a right triangle to its hypotenuse , is never zero .
( As was already mentioned , the base definition of the trigonometric functions always assumes that the argument is a positive angle less than 90° . )

UPDATE :
This afternoon the Farmboyz and I traveled to the working - class neighborhood of College Point , Queens , far past the end of subway service , to attend the march and rally in support of gay bashing victim Jack Price .
We were a bit concerned that the 90 + minute trek from Manhattan might hamper a strong show of support , but were very pleased to arrive and find about 300 LGBT activists , allies , and supportive locals already on the street near the site of the attack .
After a 15 - minute march down College Point Boulevard to the sullen or unknowing stares of locals , we were shocked to find a group of 20 or so counter - protesters , PRO gay bashers , already in a pen perilously close to the park where the rally was to take place .
Leading the pro-bashers was Mr. Leviticus Tattoo himself .
He and his co-thugs wore stickers in support of the jailed cowards as they shouted " Free Daniel Rodriquez ! " and " No hate crime ! "
Among their signs was " Daniel does n't hate gays ! "
Riiiight .
Fortunately , there was a huge NYPD presence on hand and the two groups were not permitted to get closer than shouting distance .
Speakers at the rally included the usual folks that show up at these things , something I hate knowing , but do because I 've now attended so fucking many .
We heard from the Queens borough president , City Council Speaker Christine Quinn , Queens activist Brendan Fey , Congressman Anthony Weiner , and City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Bill Thompson , just to name a few .
During lulls as the microphone changed hands , the thug pen across the street would take advantage of the momentary silence to renew their chants .
During the speeches , I sought out some locals .
One mother pointed her cigarette at the miscreants across the street and rasped , " Them there 's all the troublemakers in this neighborhood , my daughter knows she 's not to associate wit' a single one of 'em . "
An elderly man in a Vietnam - era flight jacket pointed at the hoodlums and told me , " This neighborhood has gone down the toilet because of them there .
You just get them punks down in the basement of my VFW , my boys and I will take care of 'em real good .
You folks from the city wo n't never have to hear from 'em again .
" Another woman spoke to me and Andy Humm of , and on the condition of confidentiality , revealed that more young people from College Point would have been at the rally , but feared relataliation from the supporters of the attackers .
She also said that the attackers and their friends had been the ones writing the lewd graffitti messages supposedly from Jack Price .
" It 's them .
I know it 's them .
It 's all the same handwriting with the same Sharpie . "
I 'll have Andy 's accounting of his interviews with the thugs as soon aspublishes .
Below is a slideshow of the afternoon , including some shots of the thug pen .
I 've never seen counter - protesters at an anti-bashing rally .
I do n't know what it means .
It worries me .

Tournaments of poker in Mirande : Very close supervision by the police
Not less than 200 poker players of the Toulouse area were foreseen to clash in Mirande .
But the tournament was suddenly cancelled by the Regional police crime squad of Toulouse .
The preparation went good before this great disappointment .
The members of Astarac Gers Poker , a poker club of the city of Mirande , were summoned by the gendarmes of the regional crime squad ( SRPJ ) not to organize the tournament of poker .
According to one of the members of the organizing team , the too important value of the trophy and the risk to create an addiction inside participants were the reason of this interruption .
The club of Mirande is not at its first attempt as regards to organization of poker tournament .
Previously the club had already set up two other tournaments of poker in the same context .
For the inscription at the event , players should be owners of a valid licence or to discharge the 30 euros semi-annual contribution .
The winner will gain a package of a value of 900 euros for a big tournament in Deauville .
The finalists gained a television , a trip to Spain , a portable computer In France tournaments of poker as well as other gambling are prone to many restrictions .
The law of July the 12th , 1983 stipulates that the organizer of a tournament of poker with money incurs up to six months of prison closes and a fine of 7,500 euros .
But this law does not touch belote , bridge or tarot , which are regarded as plays of address , which is not the case of poker .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel warned the Palestinians Monday that declaring a state without concluding a peace agreement would lead to Israeli counter - measures that could include annexation of more of the occupied West Bank .
“ If the Palestinians take such a unilateral line , Israel should also consider ... passing a law to annex some of the settlements , ” Environment Minister Gilad Erdan , a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , told Israel Radio .
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman , speaking to reporters , declined to specify what action Israel might take .
But he said : “ It is clear any such step by the Palestinians would not pass without an Israeli response . ”
Without setting a timeframe , Palestinian officials said on Sunday the Palestinians planned to go to the U.N. Security Council in an effort to secure international support for an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
Palestinians attributed the move to frustration at the lack of progress in peace talks , which have been stalled for a year .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said negotiations cannot resume until Israel halts settlement expansion .
U.S. senators visiting the Middle East said Washington would veto a Palestinian declaration of statehood in the United Nations Security Council .
They said it would go nowhere and urged Arab states to stop it .
“ It would be D.O.A. - dead on arrival , ” said Democratic Party Senator Ted Kaufman ( DE ) “ It ’s a waste of time . ”
State Department spokesman Ian Kelly would not say if the United States would veto any such Palestinian declaration .
“ I ca n’t say we ’re going to veto something we have n’t seen or has n’t even been proposed yet ... we support a Palestinian state that arises as a result of a process between the two parties . ”
Diplomats deferred comment , saying it was not immediately obvious by what means the Palestinians might pursue a declaration of statehood , or how international law might apply .
Recent examples suggest they might take the same route as Israel ’s founders in 1947 and simply seek U.N. support for a resolution calling for statehood , which is what East Timor did to become the first new state of the 21st century in 2002 .
Or they might declare independence without going to the U.N. as Kosovo did when it became the world ’s newest state in 2008 , knowing it could not win Security Council endorsement because of a threatened Russian veto , but would receive quick recognition by most NATO and European Union governments .
NETANYAHU WARNING
The Palestinian remarks on possible unilateral steps prompted a warning from Netanyahu .
He said in a speech Sunday only peace talks with Israel would secure a Palestinian state .
“ There is no substitute for negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority and any unilateral path will only unravel the framework of agreements between us and will only bring unilateral steps from Israel ’s side , ” Netanyahu said .
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said that the aim of the initiative was not to declare statehood but was meant to preserve the two - state option and to formalize international support for the nation the Palestinians want to establish .
“ Heading to the Security Council to issue a resolution recognizing an independent Palestinian state ... differs entirely from a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state .
The PLO is not proposing the option of declaring a state unilaterally , ” Erekat said in a statement .
Erdan , in the radio interview , discussed other sanctions open to Israel , which captured the West Bank in a 1967 war and annexed some of the territory along with Arab East Jerusalem .
“ Everything is open ... it could begin at stopping the transfer of money that the Israeli government currently transfers to the Palestinian Authority , ” he said , referring to tax payments Israel collects on the Authority ’s behalf under interim peace deals .
Erdan said Israel might also consider tightening recently loosened travel restrictions on Palestinians in the West Bank .
Scientists have found “ significant ” amounts of water in a crater at the moon ’s south pole , a major discovery that will dramatically revise the characterization of the moon as a dead world and likely make it a more attractive destination for future human space missions .
“ The moon is alive , ” declared Anthony Colaprete , the chief scientist for the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite mission .
That mission used a rocket Oct. 9 to punch a hole about 100 feet across in the moon ’s surface , then measured about 25 gallons of water in the form of vapor and ice .
While that ’s not even enough to swim in , it could indicate sufficient water in permanently shaded craters at the poles for future astronauts to live off the land .
NASA ’s plans , currently under review by the Obama administration , call for a return to the moon at the end of the next decade , and construction of a lunar base in which astronauts could live and work for months at a time .

The presence of large quantities of water would make that plan more practical , since water could be used for drinking , breathing and even making rocket fuel .
A resource - rich moon could also serve as the perfect low - gravity launchpad for missions that would carry astronauts and their families elsewhere in the solar system , fulfilling the dreams of generations of science - fiction writers and visionaries .
“ This is painting a surprising new picture of the moon .
This is not your father ’s moon , ” said Greg Delory , a space scientist at UC Berkeley .
After the Apollo missions of the 1960s and ‘ 70s , the moon was regarded as a dead , forbidding place with little to offer future explorers .

“ What ’s really exciting is we ’ve only hit one spot , ” said Peter Schultz , a geology professor at Brown University and a co-investigator on the mission .
“ It ’s kind of like when you ’re drilling for oil .
Once you find it in one place , there ’s a greater chance you ’ll find more nearby . ”
The $ 79 - million lunar crater mission was launched in June to try to uncover the source of large quantities of hydrogen that had been measured in lunar craters at the poles .
If there was water on the moon , scientists reasoned , it would be in these shadowed craters , which have n’t seen sunlight in billions of years .
The satellite targeted the Cabeus crater at the south pole , first steering its companion Centaur rocket into the surface .
Then the satellite flew through the cloud of debris and dust kicked up by Centaur , using its near - infrared and visible light spectrometers , along with other instruments , to read the contents of the debris cloud .
Spectrometers identify compounds by analyzing the light they emit or absorb .

No cloud showed up at first , causing some scientists to worry that the Centaur had hit rock .
But members of the scientific team became excited when they started looking at the data transmitted back to Earth just before the satellite crashed as planned a short distance from Centaur .
The “ eureka ” moment came in recent weeks when the team realized that a strong signature for water had been picked up by more than one instrument .
“ It ’s a pretty tight fit for water vapor and ice , ” Colaprete said in a briefing at Ames Research Center in Mountain View , Calif. , which managed the mission .
This is not the first discovery of water on the moon .
Several weeks ago , India ’s Chandrayaan 1 spacecraft found clear signs of a microscopic film of water mixed in with lunar soils over large areas of the moon .
But those amounts were so insignificant that it is unlikely the water would be useful to future colonists .
Advertisement
This latest discovery , however , is a potentially significant source of water , the scientists said .
It ’s unlikely the water , at least at this site , is in the form of an ice sheet , Colaprete said .
It ’s more likely to be mixed in with the soil .
The question now is , where did the water come from ?
Possible sources include comets and asteroids , which are considered likely sources of the water on Earth .
It ’s also possible the hydrogen was delivered by solar wind to the lunar surface , where it was converted to water .
In shadowed craters , the water could be stored as ice for billions of years .

Polar craters on the moon are some of the coldest places in the solar system , dipping below minus - 360 degrees .
The scientists hinted that other surprises may be coming in the next few months .
“ The full understanding of the LCROSS data may take some time .
The data is that rich , ” Colaprete said .
This new picture of a dynamic moon comes as the Obama administration is reconsidering the future of the human space flight program .
The Vision for Space Exploration announced by the Bush administration in 2004 called for a return to the moon by 2020 and the eventual colonization of Mars .
But the Augustine Commission , appointed by Obama to review those plans , reported just weeks ago that NASA will not get back to the moon anytime soon unless it gets a lot more money , at least $ 3 billion a year .

The commission also questioned whether the moon is a worthy goal , citing the “ been there , done that ” factor .
These new discoveries could be game changers , since they raise the possibility that a colony on the moon could be virtually self - sustaining .
Obama has given no indication yet as to what he intends to do .

Music A- World Painted Blood Artist Slayer Label American
Longevity can be a trap for any musician , but it ’s especially tricky in populist genres like metal .
Fans often want a band to keep cranking out the same sound that made them famous , even if it ’s two decades old ; critics are usually unsatisfied if the band does n’t come up with something new .
This burden weighs particularly heavy on bands that made their reps with intensity and innovation ; Slayer , in particular , was perceived as wandering in the wilderness during the years Paul Bostaph sat behind the drum kit , and expectations were high for the group , on this year ’s follow - up to the innovative Christ Illusion album , to produce something that would satisfy longtime fans and keep the band relevant and interested through what they claim will be the first of their final three albums .
Advertisement
World Painted Blood is a resounding success in that regard :
It ’s eclectic , but never self - consciously so .
It rarely flags in intensity , and it ’s good enough that if it were inserted in Slayer ’s discography right after Seasons In The Abyss — the record it most resembles — it would be an almost seamless transition .
Greg Fidelman does a better production job here than he did on Metallica ’s Death Magnetic , perhaps due to oversight by Rick Rubin , who produced Slayer ’s best work .
And the clunky “ Americon ” is the only dud track on the album .
World alternates between two modes :
There ’s the blistering , crowd - pleasing stuff like the thrashtastic “ Unit 731 , ” the minimalist “ Hate Worldwide , ” and the searing “ Beauty Through Order . ”
On the other hand are more innovative tracks like “ Snuff , ” with its uncharacteristically British - sounding dual - guitar attack , and the downright freaky “ Human Strain . ”
It ’s hard to move forward while holding your ground , but managing that is a big reason why Slayer is Slayer .
Some strobes ( and infrared strobe triggers ) use high voltages in the trigger circuit .
For mechanical cameras , this is fine  but many newer , electronically - driven cameras ( especially electronic 35 mm SLRs like the EOS or digicams  or for that matter , EOS digicams , like the 300D ) can be damaged by excessive strobe voltages .
How much is too much ?
What voltage might my own strobe generate ?
This page tries to help answer those questions .
It contains a table of strobe trigger voltages , a few measured by myself but most contributed by readers of this site .
It also contains some information about specific camera makes and the strobes that light them .
Canon US has verified ( to me , and here ) that the Powershot G does n't like voltages over 6V .
Similarly , Nikon has specified 12V for their speedlight circuits ... ( though reader Steve Francesoni called Nikon.uk to check , and their tech rep said that his N80 was good to 250V  so there may be more complexity to this story ) .
I 've heard some rumours that some Coolpix models have been restricted to 5 V !
( see below for more details )
Marco Fortin- Metzgen checked with Olympus Europe on his C4040  that digicam has a trigger voltage of 10V , so Olympus too recommends strobe triggering in the 3V to 6V range .
Pentax users may want to read this related story from Gene Poon .
Ron Alexander claims his Fuji is astonishingly tolerant of high voltages ... interesting ( This has since been verified by Rob Scrimgeour of the FujiGroup . net forum  their members got a message from Fuji also stating the 400V center pin limit ) .
( According to some opinions , high voltages can even endanger mechanical cameras , albeit after years of use )
The ISO 10330 specification ( " Photography -- Synchronizers , ignition circuits and connectors for cameras and photoflash units -- Electrical characteristics and test methods , " 1992 ) says that all ISO - compliant cameras should be able to accept trigger voltages up to 24V .
Though a Canon engineer is the nominal head of the ISO workgroup , for some reason Canon continues to insist that their cameras tolerate no more than 6V ( make that Canon USA  an email from Canon Canada says : " There is not a maximum voltage requirement for the hot shoe terminal on the PowerShot G1 . "
Go fig ! ) .
For that reason I 've tagged strobes that trigger at voltages between 6V and 24V as " your call . "
Depending upon who you ask  the camera or strobe manufacturers  those strobes are acceptable or they are not .
The ISO spec does n't really seem to hold a lot of weight !
The following list is based on either manufacturer specs or direct measurements ( To measure the trigger voltage of your own strobe , follow the instructions here ) .
If you can add to this list , please post a message or mail me your numbers , along with a description of how you obtained them ( measurement , from the web , from the manufacturer , etc ) .
I may be slow in getting your data into the list ( just check the journal ) , but I do follow - through eventually !

From an ex-field sales / support survivor :
I used to work in a computer store and one day we had a gentleman call in with a smoking power supply .
The service rep was having a bit of trouble convincing this guy that he had a hardware problem .
The pirate stock market is booming
Those following the pirate lairs of Somalia have long known that the assailants who hijack ships and terrorize the seas are more organized than they appear ( Credit here goes to FP contributor and pirate watcher J. Peter Pham ) .
Far from the sailboat - driving kids they might look like , the pirates are serious business .
And business is exactly what they ’re into .
The business of ‘ stocks , ’ to be precise .
Reuters reports that the pirates have set up an exchange in Haradheere , the main port used by the buccaneers , where shares are traded in a whopping 72 pirate outfits .
The profits have so far bought countless SUVs , other luxury goodies , and even a slice of revenue for the local government programs .
Says the pirate interviewed for the piece :
“ The shares are open to all and everybody can take part , whether personally at sea or on land by providing cash , weapons or useful materials … we ’ve made piracy a community activity . ”
Well no wonder piracy wo n’t go away .
Given the options ( poverty , militancy , theft ) , who would n’t become a pirate ?
Besides , one would n’t want to disappoint the shareholders .
As I argued earlier this year , piracy is becoming increasingly like drug trafficking : it ’s not the little guys who you want to go after .
It ’s the big financial gurus who are making bank .
In that vein , news of a ‘ stock market ’ of sorts might just be good news .
That money must be being laundered somewhere … meaning there ’s a chance financial sanctions could cut deep .
It ’s pirates ’ pockets that are their Achilles heels .

Robert Prechter The FDIC Anaesthesia Is Wearing Off
The following article is an excerpt from Robert Prechter 's Elliott Wave Theorist .
For more information from Robert Prechter on bank safety , download his free report , Discover the Top 100 Safest U.S. Banks .
Perhaps the single greatest reason for the unbridled expansion of credit over the past 50 years is the existence of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , another government - sponsored enterprise created by Congress .
The coming rush of bank failures is an outcome made inevitable the very day that Congress created the FDIC .
The reason is that the creation of the FDIC allowed savers to believe that their deposits at banks are “ insured ” against loss .
But the FDIC is not really an insurance company .
No enterprise , absent fraud , could possibly insure all the banking deposits in a nation .
Nor does the FDIC do so , despite its claims .
The FDIC is like AIG , the company that sold too many credit - default swaps .
It contracted for more insurance than it could pay upon .
Because depositors believe the sticker on the door of the bank , they have abdicated their responsibility to make sure that their banks ’ officers handle their deposits prudently .
This abdication allowed banks to lend with impunity for decades until they became saturated with unpayable debts .
Today , most banks are insolvent , and the FDIC is broke .
This condition is deflationary for three reasons : ( 1 ) Banks are coming to realize that the FDIC cannot bail them out in a systemic crisis , so they have become highly conservative in their lending policies , as described above .
( 2 ) The main way that the FDIC gets its money is to dun marginally healthy banks for more “ premiums ” ( meaning transfer payments ) to bail out their disastrously run competitors .
The more money the FDIC sucks out of marginally healthy banks , the less money those banks have on hand to lend , which is deflationary .
( 3 ) The banks that have to cough up all this money will become more impoverished at the margin , so banks that otherwise might have survived a credit crunch will be thrown even closer to the brink of failure .
This is another deflationary risk .
A friend of mine whose family owns a bank told me that the FDIC recently raised its 6 - month assessment from $ 17,000 to $ 600,000 .
In the FDIC ’s latest announcement , it is considering requiring banks to pre-pay three years ’ worth of “ premiums , ” i.e. triple the normal annual fee in a single year .
It will be a miracle if the money lasts through 2010 .
When these funds are gone , the FDIC will have two more options : to issue its own bonds and pressure banks to buy them ; and to tap its “ credit line ” of up to half a trillion dollars with the U.S. Treasury .
It ’s the same old solution : take on more new debt to back up failing old debt .
More debt will not cure the debt crisis .
Meanwhile , the FDIC is contributing to the deflationary trend .
It has “ tightened rules on required capital levels , ” which forces banks ’ loan ratios to fall ; and it has “ extended its extra monitoring of new banks from the first three years of operation to seven years ” ( AJC , 11/19 ) , meaning that banks will now have to wait four additional years before they can go crazy with loans .

24 Nov 09 , 12:38 Rothschild - PORTAL Alliance - Nasdaq
I was wondering if you have heard anything about the Nasdaq 's " PORTAL Alliance " ?
This consortium of Rothschild - influenced banks was created in November of 2007 , but there has been a complete media blackout regarding any of its activities since it was created .
When you look at the list of financial institutions and banks that are " members " , everything that has happened in the financial markets since November 07 ( a fascist coup ) starts to make one uneasy ...
From Forbes.com : ( 1744-1812 ) Meyer Amschel Rothschild : Meyer Amschel Rothschild helped invent modern banking by introducing concepts such as diversification , rapid communication , confidentiality and high volume .
The superlatively discreet foreign - exchange banker diversified from the very beginning , selling antiques and procuring loans .
Remarkably , Rothschild was willing to cut into his own profits in order to secure future business .
And , earlier than most , he understood that time and information meant money , and he pulled out all the stops to remain in constant contact with associates across Europe .
That network came in handy when he helped finance England 's war effort during the Napoleonic Wars .
Rothschild institutionalized his bank with a far - sighted will that ensured the continuation of his business .
Considered a founding father of international finance , his banking empire -- thanks to his five sons -- had expanded to London , Paris , Vienna and Naples at the time of his death .
Corporate Heirs : Merrill Lynch ( nyse : MER ) , Lehman Bros. ( nyse : LEH ) , Bear Stearns ( nyse : BSC ) , Goldman Sachs ( nyse : GS )...

We ’re all born late .
We ’re born into history that is well under way .
We ’re born into cultures , nations and languages that we did n’t choose .
On top of that , we ’re born with certain brain chemicals and genetic predispositions that we can’t control .
We ’re thrust into social conditions that we detest .
Often , we react in ways we regret even while we ’re doing them .
But unlike the other animals , people do have a drive to seek coherence and meaning .
We have a need to tell ourselves stories that explain it all .
We use these stories to supply the metaphysics , without which life seems pointless and empty .
Among all the things we do n’t control , we do have some control over our stories .
We do have a conscious say in selecting the narrative we will use to make sense of the world .
Individual responsibility is contained in the act of selecting and constantly revising the master narrative we tell about ourselves .
The stories we select help us , in turn , to interpret the world .
They guide us to pay attention to certain things and ignore other things .
They lead us to see certain things as sacred and other things as disgusting .
They are the frameworks that shape our desires and goals .
So while story selection may seem vague and intellectual , it ’s actually very powerful .
The most important power we have is the power to help select the lens through which we see reality .
George B. Dantzig , operations research professor , dies at 90
George Bernard Dantzig
George Bernard Dantzig , professor emeritus of operations research and of computer science who devised the " simplex method " and invented linear programming ( which is not related to computer programming ) , died May 13 at his Stanford home of complications from diabetes and cardiovascular disease .
He was 90 years old .
A funeral service has been held .
" George B. Dantzig is regarded by most experts as having been the initiator of and leading figure in the revolutionary scientific development of mathematical programming as a powerful method for optimally managing resources in literally thousands of applications in industry and government in the last three decades , " said Arthur F. Veinott Jr. , professor of management science and engineering .
" So pervasive is the influence of Dantzig 's simplex method that experts have estimated that from 10 percent to 25 percent of all scientific computation is devoted to it .
Indeed , that method is probably the single most widely used algorithm originated in the last six decades . "
In 1947 , Dantzig devised the simplex method , an important tool for solving linear programming problems in diverse applications , such as allocating resources , scheduling production and workers , planning investment portfolios and formulating marketing and military strategies .
" It is one of the great algorithms of the 20th century , " said Gene Golub , the Fletcher Jones Professor of Computer Science .
" Indeed , [ Dantzig ] actually created a field in devising the simplex method , namely mathematical programming . "
Dantzig explained his methods in Linear Programming and Extensions , a classic work published in 1963 .
Nobel Prize winner Kenneth J. Arrow , the Joan Kenney Professor of Economics and Professor of Operations Research , Emeritus , described the methods in a nutshell : " Linear programming is a way of choosing interdependent activities , with inputs and outputs , so as to achieve an optimum in some dimension ( e.g. , profits or some index of welfare ) .
The simplex method starts with a guess at a set of activities which are run in some measure .
Then a set of prices are chosen to make the activities operate at zero profit .
If none of the unchosen activities are profitable at these prices , then the initial set is optimum .
If one is profitable , it is chosen , and one of the previously chosen ones is eliminated .
The process is then repeated .
In the end , the optimal set of activities will be arrived at . "
Today , most large firms use linear programming to price products and manage supply chains .
Transportation firms use it to choose the cheapest way to consolidate , coordinate and route shipments of many products from globally distributed suppliers to distant markets subject to capacity constraints .
The petroleum industry uses it for exploration , blending , production scheduling and distribution .
The iron and steel industry uses it to evaluate iron ores , explore the addition of coke ovens and select products .
Paper mills use it to reduce trim loss .
Governments use it to evaluate policy alternatives .
Other applications include scheduling construction projects , refuse collection and nurses ; controlling water and air pollution ; selecting advertising media and compensation policies ; assigning personnel to jobs ; racially balancing schools ; targeting weapons ; rotating crops ; developing bidding strategies ; and designing structures .
" Practical applications often involve hundreds of thousands of variables and tens of thousands of equations , " Veinott said .
" The virtually simultaneous development of linear programming and computers led to an explosion of applications , especially in the industrial sector . "
Linear programming and the simplex algorithm together " enabled mankind for the first time to structure and solve extremely complex optimal allocation and resource problems , " said collaborator Mukund Thapa .
" Since World War II , there has been no individual whose work has had a greater impact on the mathematical sciences — and especially its applications to concrete problems — than George B. Dantzig , " said Veinott .
Indeed , Tjalling C. Koopmans , who shared the Nobel Prize in economics with Leonid Kantorovich for contributions to the theory of optimum allocation of resources , was so upset that Dantzig was not included in the 1975 award that he considered turning down the honor , according to many published accounts .
Career pathDantzig was born in Portland , Ore. , on Nov. 8 , 1914 , to mathematician Tobias Dantzig and translator Anja Ourisson .
He received his bachelor 's degree in mathematics and physics from the University of Maryland in 1936 , the year he married Anne S. Shmuner .
In 1938 , he received his master 's degree from the University of Michigan .
He served as a junior statistician for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics from 1937 to 1939 .
During his first year as a doctoral student at the University of California - Berkeley , Dantzig arrived late to the class of Jerzy Neyman , one of the great founders of modern statistics .
On the blackboard were two problems that Dantzig assumed to be homework .
" A few days later I apologized to Neyman for taking so long to do the homework — the problems seemed harder to do than usual , " Dantzig once recalled .
It turned out the conundrums , which Dantzig solved , were two famous unsolved problems in statistics .
Dantzig served as chief of the combat analysis branch of the Army Air Forces from 1941 to 1946 , the year he received his doctorate in mathematics from UC - Berkeley .
He was a mathematical adviser to the military ( 1946 -1952 ) , a research mathematician at the RAND Corp. ( 1952 -1960 ) and chair and professor of the Operations Research Center at UC - Berkeley ( 1960 - 1966 ) .
" About 1963 , I proposed to the [ Stanford ] administration an interdepartmental program in operations research , which they backed , although gingerly , " Arrow said in an e-mail interview .
" Although there was considerable talent in different departments , there was no senior committed scholar .
I spoke to George and got some encouragement .
[ Gerald ]
Lieberman , the chair of the Operations Research program ( later provost ) , and I managed , with some difficulty , to get the university to make a good offer , which was accepted .
The program became a department , perhaps the best in the country .
( It has now been absorbed in the Department of Management Science and Engineering . ) "
Dantzig came to Stanford in 1966 , serving on the faculty of the departments of Operations Research and Computer Science .
In 1973 , he was appointed the C. A. Criley Professor of Transportation Sciences .
His research focused on optimization of large - scale systems and the development of energy and economic planning models .
In 1975 , President Gerald Ford awarded Dantzig a National Medal of Science " for inventing Linear Programming and for discovering the Simplex Algorithm that led to wide - scale scientific and technical applications to important problems in logistics , scheduling and network optimization , and to the use of computers in making efficient use of the mathematical theory . "
His other awards included the War Department Exceptional Civilian Service Medal , the John von Neumann Theory Prize , the National Academy of Sciences Award in Applied Mathematics and Numerical Analysis , the Harvey Prize , the Silver Medal of the Operational Research Society ( U.K. ) , the Alfred Coors American Ingenuity Award and a Fellows Award from the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences ( INFORMS ) .
Dantzig was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow of the Econometric Society , the Institute of Mathematical Statistics , the American Association for the Advancement of Science , the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Operations Research Society of America .
He was a president of the Institute of Management Science and first chair of the Mathematical Programming Society .
He received honorary doctorates from at least eight universities and wrote at least 120 technical articles .
With Thomas L. Saaty , he wrote the book Compact City : A Plan for a Livable Urban Environment .
After his retirement in 1997 , he co-wrote Linear Programming 1 : Introduction and Linear Programming 2 : Theory and Extensions .
At the time of his death he was working on a science fiction novel titled In His Own Image .
Said Arrow : " Some great scholars cast deep shadows , so that nothing grows in their neighborhood .
George was just the opposite .
He shortly attracted a group who flourished in his appreciation of their work and who rapidly showed wider and wider degrees of application . "
Dantzig shepherded more than 50 graduate students to their doctorates .
" George Dantzig had a kindly personality , free of conceit or condescension , " said Richard W. Cottle , professor emeritus of management science and engineering .
" For a man with such an impressive scientific reputation , he had a magical way of putting people at ease .
This was especially effective with doctoral students and junior faculty , many of whom he generously supported .
He was , at once , gentle , attentive to their ideas — however naïve — and eager to welcome them into one of his many spheres of activity .
He found just the right way to nurture the potential within them , to further their development and to incorporate their accomplishments into the goals of his large research program . "
Dantzig is survived by his wife , Anne S. Dantzig ; sons David and Paul Dantzig and daughter Jessica Klass ; grandchildren Audra Zelvy and Aron and Jeremy Dantzig ; and great - grandchildren Ivy and Brian Zelvy .

The session on " Omar : Ethics , Power and Performativity " was about to begin , but Josine Opmeer , sitting at a low table in the lobby of Leeds town hall , had decided to give it a miss .
Opmeer is the manager of the centre for research on socio-cultural change ( Cresc ) at the University of Manchester , which was co-hosting the event , but by the standards of this gathering , she was an outsider , an ingènue .
She 's only watched up to the end of season three .
" I finished it last night .
I thought I 'd better at least do that , but someone suggested there might be some spoilers in the presentation . "
It was a reasonable assumption .
For two days , more than 100 sociologists , criminologists , historians and cultural theorists from Britain and abroad came together in Leeds this week to discuss and debate a subject which had united them across sometimes jealously - guarded faculty and disciplinary borders : the HBO series The Wire .
Was the programme social science fiction or genre TV ?
Had it succeeded in its distillation of the US polity ?
Could Bourdieu 's theoretical technologies help us in understanding its significance ?
In this gathering , mention of an obscure line of dialogue from an unremarkable incident in an early episode would meet with sage nods .
Giving away what happens to McNulty , it is fair to say , was not their principal concern .
The Baltimore - based cop drama created by former local journalist David Simon , which ran for five seasons between 2002 and 2008 , inspires an often unblinking devotion among its admirers – including , it has been argued once or twice , those at this newspaper .
While the assembled academics may have taken a more minutely critical interest than many ( " in examining Simon 's phrase ' true citizens of the city ' , the word I want to focus on is ' the '. " ) , there were plenty of passionate devotees among their number , giving the gathering the air of an impeccably - mannered fan convention , as much as an academic meeting .
" I 'm just here as a geek , a massive fan , " confessed Nilam McGrath , whose work at the University of Leeds focuses on media and the environment .
" I started watching it during my final year of my PhD and I used to treat myself to an episode if I 'd done 2,000 words of my thesis .
Then it got to two episodes a night , then three .
I know all the actors ' backgrounds , I look for them in other films .
I 'm just completely obsessed with it . "
Kersten Mueller from the University of London , Goldsmiths , having presented her paper arguing that the streets of Baltimore present the homosexual thief Omar with a canvas on which his performative identity can be projected , said season four was her favourite .
" That one broke my heart .
But you can't ignore season one because that 's the initial connection you have .
It 's like a mother , the first bond . "
For Peter Moskos , a former Baltimore police officer the programme 's appeal is based partly on sentiment – " I policed those corners , I love that city " – but he also credited it as being about 75 % realistic , " which is good .
And about 50 % more realistic than any other cop show ever made . "
For the record : the police jargon is spot on ; the Baltimore accents are atrocious ; Hamsterdam , an area of the city in which drug - dealing is , briefly , decriminalised , an impossible fiction .
Being true academics , however , the gathering was nothing if not self - aware , returning to a theme referred to as " the fetishised currency of The Wire within the left - liberal discourse " , but which might equally be summed up as " let 's all remember it 's not actually real , OK ? "

The first thing you should do when trying to help other people stay away from porn is to stop being judgmental .
Do not see or portray the situation in a way that makes them bad for what they do .
Sexuality is very normal and human .
Even most religions teach that it is not anyone 's place to judge their fellow man ( but is instead the job of the Creator ) .
It 's also bad to judge people because it tends to turn them off from what you 're trying to do .
Many people that might be open to change will become defensive if you judge them and become even more set in their ways .
The best place to start is to talk to the person you 're concerned about .
Tell them why you 're concerned .
Sometimes , people might not realize that they even have a problem or how their problem might affect other people .
If you 're open and honest , you 'll be much better able to reach them and connect with things that they can understand .
Talk to them about the negative effects of pornography .
Make sure to use lots of different types of evidence and reasoning though Use real - world evidence , logical arguments , emotional arguments , and whatever else you can .
Using a combination of argument types will be best if you do n't know how the person will think about the problem .
Just remember to avoid making them feel guilty .
They may already be dealing with shame , and you want to ultimately build an environment of support , not make things worse .
Using a new behavior or a new activity is the best way to stop an old behavior in its tracks .
If you want to help someone to stop looking at porn , give them something else to do instead .
You can try :
Plan for failure .
This is a difficult behavior to overcome and it may take time and a few mess ups before things feel right .
You need to plan for failure so that both you and the person you 're trying to help do n't become disappointed with the events that happen .
Disappointment can lead to harsh feelings and judgement , which might derail the whole effort .
Expect that it will take some work and that a change wo n't happen overnight .
Enlist the help of others to keep you accountable when you do n't feel strong enough on your own .
6
Release your feelings of responsibility .
Realize that at the end of the day , you can't be responsible for everything that someone else does .
Whoever you 're trying to help , they 're either already an adult or they 're getting to the point where they really just have to make decisions on their own .
This is a part of the world that they 'll be exposed to one way or the other and they 'll need to find their own way to cope with it .
You can't control other people and it's not your responsibility to .
If they feel negative consequences after you 've done what you can to help them , that 's their responsibility .
You did what you were capable of and no one can ask anything more from you .
Regular readers will be familiar with Blawg Review , which encapsulates the blawgosphere ’s best posts over the previous week ( and which I hosted earlier this year ) .
In a similar vein is the Carnival of Trust , the brainchild of Charles Green of Trust Matters , which highlights the best posts about trust in the business and professional workspace over the previous month .
Charles invited me to host the November 2009 edition of the Carnival , and I was more than happy to accept .
Trust lies at the heart of successful lawyer - client relationships .
The term “ trusted advisor , ” made famous by the title of one of legal consulting ’s best - known books ( written by Charles and co-authors David Maister and Robert Galford ) , remains the gold standard that lawyers and law firms want to achieve for themselves .
I ’ve written about trust here at Law21 on a few occasions , and you ’ll probably find this edition of the Carnival to be perhaps a little more lawyer - heavy than some past versions .
But there was no shortage of good candidates from numerous fields this month , and it was n’t easy whittling them down to this final list of ten .
In no particular order , here we go :
Adam Smith Esq. , “ The billable hour debate is not about the billable hour . ”
I ’m cheating a little on the first entry , since this post by Bruce MacEwen appeared in September and is therefore outside the range of this Carnival .
But the post was so appropriate that I think it demands inclusion here .
Bruce discusses the storms raging around the question of how lawyers bill clients , specifically the age - old practice of selling legal services by the hour , and reaches this apt conclusion :
Sadly , for too many of us , clients do n’t trust us with their money and we do n’t trust them to reward us fairly .
If you hark back to those old - fashioned typewritten bills “ for professional services rendered , ” did n’t they positively reek of a close , trusting relationship ?
The lawyer would no more exploit the client than the client would expect ( hope ? ) the lawyer would price representation at bargain - basement levels .
This seems to me to be the enormous unspoken issue in today ’s debate over the billable hour .
If you do n’t trust someone , you want something quantifiable .
And you want the “ most favored nation ” rate and 10 % discount on top of that .
If you do n’t trust someone , it ’s all perfectly understandable .
And uneconomic .
Is this what we ’ve come to ?
So perhaps more than anything else , I find the seemingly perpetual debate about the billable hour sad .
Because I ca n’t think about it without thinking about forfeited trust .
Legal Business Development , “ An AmLaw 100 senior executive talks about the implications of alternative fees . ”
Continuing this theme is consultant Jim Hassett , who is compiling an unprecedented survey of law firm leaders on the subject of alternative fees .
If hourly billing is a substitute for trust , then shifting to predictable , fixed , or value - based billing systems necessitates the development of trust — and that starts with transparency and a willingness to engage in actual conversation .
Here ’s what one managing partner had to say on the subject :
[ When we are ] able to sit down in a very open dialogue with our clients regarding their needs , what works best for them , and what works best for us – including how staffing impacts our economics and how we focus on trying to put the right person on the right task at the right cost – we believe that we can tailor a fee arrangement that will work for our clients and will work for us .
Legal Ease Blog , “ Are you alienating your best potential clients ? ”
The theme of honest communication also runs through this post by Allison Shields , who reminds lawyers that trumped - up claims , fear - mongering tactics and generally aggressive marketing can undermine efforts to build business .
Accidentally or otherwise , over - promising — either from overconfidence or insecurity , both of which are not uncommon in lawyers — can have disastrous results .
[ T ]he essence of the lawyer - client relationship is one of trust .
If the client feels that your marketing efforts amount to a bait and switch , or if you ’re hiding behind what your potential clients feel are ‘ fake ’ offers or false promises ( whether that ’s your intention or not ) , that trust will be lost – and trust lost is difficult , if not impossible , to repair .
The Greatest American Lawyer , “ What ’s wrong with the merits ?
How gamesmanship has taken over the courtroom . ”
If there ’s anything more important than a client ’s trust in his or her lawyer , it ’s the citizen ’s degree of trust in the institutions of justice .
Although this does n’t get a lot of attention in the blawgosphere , the whole idea of “ access to justice , ” which lawyers prize so highly , assumes the reality and trustworthiness of both access and justice .
Here are two posts that address this issue .
The first , by Enrico Schaefer , is direct and to the point :
Except for the contingency fee lawyer who may choose to represent a person without any financial means , America ’s civil courtrooms are dominated by wealthy Americans and wealthy companies .
If that were not bad enough , many lawyers simply get paid to play games in court .
Their goal is to keep cases from reaching the merits of the action , even when they ’re the plaintiff .
In many instances , the courtroom is simply another business tool to exert economic leverage over a competitor .
Private arbitration has not proved to be much competition to the near - monopoly that federal and state courts have over dispute resolution .
Until true alternatives to the courtroom become available , civil justice will remain a constitutional right primarily for the rich .
What About Clients ? , “ Is that an elected judge in your pocket ? ”
The other post , by Dan Hull , raises an issue that has long puzzled many of us in the Canadian legal system : the election of American judges .
A fundamental right upon which many people rely is “ their day in court , ” when they can present their case before an impartial judge who will decide the matter before her on the merits .
But can you trust the judge ’s impartiality ?
Although there ’s plenty to question in a strict appointment system too , Dan points out the flaws of making judges run for office :
The popular election of state judges–permitted in some aspect in a clear majority of the states–gives the appearance of justice being “ for sale . ”
Elected judges can be especially “ bad ” for good clients who do business all over the U.S. and the world .
Even when elected judges are “ good ” –and , to be fair , there are some great ones–state systems of popularly - elected judiciary will never inspire much confidence .
Elected jurists who hear and decide business disputes are steeped in a taint .
The point : Judges should not have “ constituents , ” i.e. law firms , and their clients , who make campaign contributions .
Right now , in most American states , they do .
And there is no way to dress that up .
Simple Justice , “ The meaning of referral . ”
Scott Greenfield is a criminal defence lawyer who ’s never reluctant to challenge the justice system ’s institutional failures .
But this month , he touched on a topic that every lawyer can relate to and that goes directly to matters of trust : referrals .
Enormous numbers of clients , having no other way to find a lawyer , request referrals from other lawyers .
This is a tricky business , Scott writes , one that poses difficulties for the lawyer who receives the request :
When I refer someone to a lawyer , it ’s a personal endorsement .
I am saying to that person that I vouch for the competency and ethics of the person whose name I give them .
It means something to me , and I feel responsible .
Sure , I ’m not my brother ’s keeper and ca n’t do the other lawyer ’s work myself .
Sometimes things go wrong .
Sometimes things just do n’t work out well , or the fit is n’t there .
But I cannot , and do not , send clients to just a name .
Names are easy to come by .
I can get you a name pretty much anywhere , but getting a name means nothing .
…
I would require far , far more to have the requisite faith to entrust them with a client .
Buzz Machine , “ The collaboration economy . ”
Shifting gears slightly brings us to my former profession , journalism .
Jeff Jarvis , crusader for new and better approaches to news coverage , focuses on the myths that struggling news media leaders tell themselves and others about how journalism “ ought to ” work .
In a collaboration economy , Jeff says , traditional scarcity disappears and new relationships develop among crowd - sourced reporters and their readers .
Not surprisingly , trust is at the heart of these relationships :
All those “ extra ” people add new value and efficiency – if you see the opportunity in it and enable them to .
They ’re us .
That ’s how Google sees us , capturing our links and clicks to discover the value of those million – no , trillion – flying pages .
That ’s how Wikipedia and Craigslist created their value , dealing in trust and membership as a new currency .
That ’s how I want next - generation news organizations to look at us , as the people who will create news while the news orgs add value to it : vetting , correcting , organizing , training , promoting , selling .
The news orgs and their journalists then become so much more efficient because they work collaboratively with the public .
That ’s how they become sustainable and profitable again .
But this happens only if you trust and value the others and understand the economics of collaboration .
Innovation Tools ,
“ The critical connection between trust , collaboration and innovation . ”
Another topic I ’ll never tire of discussing is innovation , something lawyers are still grappling with but that other professionals have long since recognized the value of and adopted .
Put innovation together with collaboration and you have my full attention , as does this post by Ruth Ann Hattori , which draws the connections between trust and innovation .
How would these questions be answered in your office ?
The first step toward high collaboration is trust - building . …
But what does that really look like in your workplace ?
Who can you trust and how do you know it ?
Will your colleagues “ have your back , ” no matter what ( short of something criminal or unethical ) ?
Does management give credit where due ?
Who can be relied on 100 % ?
Do you keep / manage your promises ?
Are people really competent or faking it ?
Do your colleagues truly care if you are successful ?
Are you happy or jealous or envious for their success ?
Does everyone truly keep confidences … even when it does n’t matter anymore ?
How open and honest is competition for promotion ?
Who is trying to gain favor of others ?
Do people admit what they do n’t know ?
Do people ask for help without insecurity ?
A - List Bloggers Network , “ Starting with trust . ”
None of the articles I ’ve highlighted so far , nor indeed any of the candidates for this Carnival , suggest that trust is a bad thing .
Obviously , we proceed in any discussion of trust on the basis that it ’s a virtuous and beneficial thing .
But that ’s not to say it ’s easy .
Trust , in fact , is hard , and that ’s an important point that does n’t get noted often enough .
This post does us a service by reminding us of the risks of trust :
If you start from a position of trust , you are starting from a position of risk .
There is no trust without risk .
When you trust someone , you are putting your interests in their control .
They have the ability to muck things up for you , and you are trusting them to take care of you ( think about it : if they ca n’t really do anything that affects you negatively , then it ’s not really trust ) .
So it ’s not just starting with the belief that your people want to do the right thing .
That ’s too easy .
It ’s easy to assume people have good intentions .
Trust is about counting on them to behave in a way that is consistent with your interests , intention or not .
There is , of course , a huge benefit to this kind of trust … .
But it ’s hard work for people in authority to give up that kind of control and accept that kind of risk .
Heavy Machinery Agency , “ The case for basic instinct : why trust counts for more than contracts . ”
The editor in me likes to start an article with a good anecdote , but in this case , I think I ’ll use a good anecdote to finish this post .
Jonathan Weber ’s small - business blog makes the case for trust in business , and uses a small but powerful success story to make a very important point : trust works .
When we started NewWest , the domain name NewWest.com was owned by a furniture store in Wyoming , and the owner was not inclined to sell it .
We worked out an informal arrangement where he would put a link to NewWest .
Net on his site , and we would run advertising for his store .
We checked in every now and again and had a few glitches with the link not appearing properly , but it was all friendly , and neither of us worried too much about the exact value of the trade .
A few months ago , the owner of the store got in touch and said the domain name might be for sale , as he was closing the company .
He said he ’d sell it to us if I made a reasonable offer .
I made an offer , he countered , we agreed on a price , and then his wife transferred the domain name to us , and we put a check in the mail .
I hesitated briefly on this — should we have some kind of escrow arrangement ?— but decided that , based on our previous dealings , I trusted these folks , and they felt the same .
Frankly , I think if we had not had this kind of friendly , informal business relationship , we might not have been able to acquire the domain so readily .
So there you have it — ten excellent blog posts about trust from the last 30 days .
But if those entries are n’t enough , here are ten more that will reward further reading :
– Build A Solo Practice @ SPU , “ Social media platforms becoming the new content portal – lawyers included . ”
– Cultivating Creativity , “ Whole - hearted leadership . ”

Battered booksellers , especially independent ones , have so far withstood the punishing shock - and - awe offensive of Internet Age marauders like Amazon .
Now , they have a secret weapon that they hope will continue to lure customers into their stores : would you believe it 's a machine that can print up a fresh new paperback copy from a menu of 3.6 million books ?
Harvard Book Store cleared out space behind its History , Politics , and Religion sections to make room for the three - foot - by - six - foot - by - four - foot robot retailer , called the Espresso Book Machine .
In a public unveiling slated for September 29 , the Harvard Book Store will become only the second US merchant to install such an apparatus , which prints , binds , and trims perfect - bound books — complete with full - color covers and black - and - white guts — in about four minutes .
" Books will be produced on a massively decentralized way , " promises Dane Neller , CEO of On Demand Books , the manufacturer of the machines that will let customers select from millions of titles in less time than it takes to comb the teetering stacks of a used bookstore .
" The life of the book will be infinite . "
Says Harvard Book Store owner Jeffrey Mayersohn , " I had developed a notion that the ability to produce books in stores was an important part of the future of bookselling . "
So is having access to an inventory that rivals the depths of the Amazons .
With the machine comes a deal inked this month between Google and On Demand Books , which gives patrons access to more than two million public - domain and out - of - print titles in Google 's digital coffers , coupled with 1.6 million others .
" We 're moving steadily toward the goal of any book , ever written , in your hands , in a moment , " says Mayersohn .
With production and order fulfillment gone local ( and Harvard adding its own bicycle - delivery twist ) , this could be a leaner , meaner , and greener economic model than centralized book production and distribution with the biggies — but only if enough readers demand sufficient obscure titles , at $ 8 a pop , to pay for the $ 100,000 machine .
" I personally do n't know how far this is going to go and how much the economics are going to work for the booksellers , " says Tom Hallock , associate publisher and sales and marketing director of Boston 's Beacon Press .
Nonetheless , he says it 's important for brick - and - mortar stores to stay in the game : " I applaud the Harvard Book Store for bringing in the machine and seeing what they brew up with it , " even if in - store printing competes with trade publishers like his .
Perhaps the model 's savior will be self - publishing : folks who want their poems , grandma 's recipes , or Great American Novel printed in a professional package .
Would - be authors can print a few copies , see how they sell , and produce more , making small press runs feasible .
Not that printing is the same as publishing with an editor and ISBN .
But Mayersohn says the self - published wo n't be ghettoized .
" We have n't ruled out the possibility that you print your book with us and we 'll put the book on our shelves , " he says .
And with that , a hint of immortality .
" Once a book is printed , it will be in print forever . "

THE DEPROLIFERATOR
“ We have reached the point where the senior military generals responsible for nuclear forces are advocating , more vocally , more vehemently , than our politicians , to get down to lower and lower weapons . ”
— General Eugene Habiger ( Ret. ) , former head of U.S. nuclear forces , in 2000
Not exactly the kind of talk we ’re used to hearing from a high - ranking member of the military , is it ?
Nor was this , four years earlier , by Gen. Charles Horner , who commanded the aerial forces of the United States and its allies during the first Gulf War :
I came to the realization that nuclear weapons had very little utility during the Gulf War , when I realized that even if Saddam Hussein used a nuclear weapon on us , we would have to retaliate on a conventional basis .
And then later , when I became the owner , so to speak , of the land - based ICBM force , and I saw the vast amount of money and resource that was involved in maintaining the large Cold War level of nuclear weapons , I said there ’s got to be a better way .
Then , in June of last year , renowned national security analyst and one - time assistant secretary of defense Lawrence Korb echoed the comments of Generals Habiger and Horner in an article for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and expanded on them :
From its creation as a separate service at the end of World War II until the end of the Cold War , the U.S. Air Force was first among equals amid the nation ’s. . . four armed services .
[ It ’s ] dominance was due primarily to its leading role in developing and deploying strategic nuclear weapons , which were deemed key to the country ’s survival .
But after the collapse of the Soviet Union :
Strategic nuclear deterrence was no longer seen as central to U.S. security and the attention and resources of the policy makers in general and the air force in particular began to shift .
… toward traditional air missions .
Rather than the Bomber Barons , the air force in the post - Cold War era was led by the Fighter Mafia . …
Only when current Defense Secretary Robert Gates proposed stopping production of the F - 22 at 182 planes did the air force roll out its propaganda machine [ to object ] .
Still , it ’s not as if the air force and the military are actually lobbying for an end to nuclear weapons .
I ’ve yet to be able to find more instances of contemporary military brass venting about nuclear weapons as a white elephant they ’re stuck with .
In fact , at Wired ’s Danger Room , Nathan Hodge recently wrote : Speaking Tuesday on Capitol Hill , Gen. Kevin Chilton , the head of U.S. Strategic Command , said : “ When looking into the future a basic question is … will we still need nuclear weapons 40 years from now ?
I believe the answer to that question is yes . ”
Interviewed by Melanie Kirkpatrick in the Wall Street Journal , the general said that nuclear weapons were , “ designed for about a 15 - to 20 - year life ” which worked fine when “ we had a very robust infrastructure . . . that replenished those families of weapons at regular intervals . ”
But now , “ they ’re all older than 20 years . . . .
The analogy would be trying to extend the life of your ’ 57 Chevrolet into the 21st century . ”
Travis Sharp works on defense spending , among other things , for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation .
We asked him for his reaction .
Gen .
Chilton has repeatedly made comments that blur the line between responsible execution of the nuclear mission and questionable advocacy on behalf of nuclear modernization .
I would n’t take Gen.
Chilton ’s statements as being representative of the Air Force ’s or U.S. military ’s broader attitudes toward nuclear weapons .
After all , Gen. Chilton ’s role at STRATCOM gives him a strong bureaucratic interest in maintaining , or even enhancing , the U.S. nuclear arsenal .
Hans M. Kristensen , the director of the Federation of American Scientists ’s Nuclear Information Project , responded as well .
There ’s a difference between the belief in nuclear weapons at the top level and the management level ; the first tends to say they ’re really important while the second group is less interested because nuclear weapons are useless for the kind of operations the military are involved in on a day - by - day basis .
The second group might accept that nukes are needed for now , but they tend to see them as competition for funding and personnel and not very relevant to their priorities .
He then points out the irony in Gen. Chilton ’s 40 - year timeframe :
Chilton ’s remark is interesting because he used to say , just one year ago , that we needed nuclear weapons throughout this century .
By that standard he has come considerably closer to president Obama ’s message .
Steve Hynd of Newshoggers adds :
No branch of the services ever cared about costs or ease of use .
The true war is the one between departments and agencies for budget share and bureaucratic power .
Control of the nuke arsenal is an essential part of the Air Force ’s “ clout ” in that war .
Independent nuclear scholar Ward Wilson pointed out to us that it ’s been decades since the likes of Gen. Curtis LeMay openly advocated advocated nuclear war .
Starting in the Johnson Administration , there just are no examples of military men who are so gung ho for nukes that it makes your hair stand on end .
When Reagan wanted to get rid of all the nuclear weapons in Iceland .
. . it was n’t military men that prevented the deal from going through .
There were n’t members of the Joint Chiefs stepping forward saying , “ Mr. President , this is an essential weapon and you ca n’t think of getting rid of it . ”
The voices of caution come from Weinberger and Shultz .
It ’s the Sherlock Holmes thing about the dog that did n’t bark in the night .
As well , Gen . Chilton seems oblivious to the likelihood that , in an interim as lengthy as the 40 years to which he referred , nuclear weapons would most likely have been used in an act of war or detonated by accident .
The latter , like Chernobyl , might have kick - started disarmament ; the former may have blasted the political landscape — not to mention the earth ’s — into something unrecognizable .
Nature Abhors a Vacuum
Meanwhile , at Foreign Policy in Focus , under the category of Watch Out What You Wish For , Frida Berrigan writes ( emphasis added ) :
Congress gave $ 68 million to the Boeing Corporation to accelerate the purchase and development of 10 - 12 “ massive ordnance penetrators [ MOPs ] . ” …
These 30,000 pound bombs carry 6,000 pounds of high explosives .
The MOP . … replaces a nuclear weapon that Congress was unwilling to fund over the past few years — the robust nuclear earth penetrator [ intended ] to burrow deep into enemy lairs and deliver a nuclear wallop .
[ In other words , who needs ] nuclear weapons to deliver massive destruction . …
As we begin to reduce our nuclear capabilities , watch out for a lot of pressure to ramp up conventional weapons procurement .
If you ’ve ever watched Antiques Roadshow , you know that collectible toys which remain packed in their boxes greatly surpass in value those that have been removed and used for play .
Like those toys , nuclear weapons sit , neatly wrapped , on a shelf .
Some generals cast covetous eyes at them ; others just want toys that they can play with .

As one might have guessed , there were plenty of fireworks Tuesday night during a debate between former Bush adviser Karl Rove and former DNC chair Howard Dean held at Penn State .
Pennsylvania ’s Centre Daily reports ,
There was little agreement , but a good bit of name calling , during the event which ranged in tone from heated to humorous .
“ That ’s a made up statistic , Karl Rove .
… For the first time tonight , I ’m calling you on it , ” said Dean , a medical physician and the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee .
“ You made that up . ”
Rove had said that Medicare rejects claims twice as often as the overall health insurance industry , and he promised to put the proof in his Wall Street Journal column next week .
“ And I would appreciate it if you did n’t question my integrity .
.. Mr. Dean , you just called me a liar and I do n’t appreciate it , ” replied Rove , former deputy chief of staff and senior adviser to George W. Bush and a Fox News contributor .
Later , Rove called Dean “ adolescent ” after the former Democratic National Committee chairman interrupted one of his answers .

An Associated Press article adds ,
“ Liar ! Liar ! , ” some in a crowd of mainly students yelled at Rove toward the end of the night , when the former deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush brought up the No Child Left Behind education legislation as an example of an issue that could attract bipartisanship .
“ These people must be from Michigan — or they must be from Ohio State , I do n’t know , ” Rove quipped , referring to Penn State ’s biggest football rivals .
A recent poll shows more Americans identify themselves as conservative than moderate or liberal .
Gallup reports :
Conservatives continue to outnumber moderates and liberals in the American populace in 2009 , confirming a finding that Gallup first noted in June .
Forty percent of Americans describe their political views as conservative , 36 % as moderate , and 20 % as liberal .
This marks a shift from 2005 through 2008 , when moderates were tied with conservatives as the most prevalent group .

Governor Dean says polls like this do n’t mean anything .
But Karl Rove says its shows the people feel deceived by the President .
Because he says President Obama campaigned as a centrist and is more liberal in his presidency .
Some people in the audience were n’t surprised to hear the poll results , but some people are skeptical of the numbers .

• Italian court convicts Robert Lady and 23 others in absentia • First prosecution for US abduction of suspects to torture states
Twenty - three Americans were tonight convicted of kidnapping by an Italian court at the end of the first trial anywhere in the world involving the CIA 's " extraordinary rendition " programme for abducting terrorist suspects .
The former head of the CIA in Milan Robert Lady was given an eight - year jail sentence for his part in the seizure of Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr , known as Abu Omar , who claimed that he was subsequently tortured in Egypt .
Lady 's superior , Jeff Castelli , the then head of the CIA in Italy , and two other Americans were acquitted on the grounds that they enjoyed diplomatic immunity .
But another 21 alleged CIA operatives and a US air force officer were each sentenced to five years in jail .
All were tried in absentia and those who were convicted will be regarded as fugitives under Italian law .
Extraordinary rendition , which has been criticised as " torture by proxy ' , involves the snatching of suspects and their forcible transfer for interrogation to third countries – often those states where torture is routinely employed .
The judge ruled that neither the former head of Italy 's military intelligence service Nicolo Pollari nor his deputy could be convicted because the evidence against them was subject to official secrecy restrictions .
But two other Italian intelligence officials were each given three - year prison terms .
Successive Italian governments refused or ignored prosecutors ' extradition requests to the US for the 26 Americans .
All the defendants , apart from two , had lawyers appointed by the court who had no contact with their clients .
Estimates put the number of suspects subjected to extraordinary renditions at just over 100 to thousands .
A European parliament - approved report in 2007 concluded that the CIA had operated more than 1,000 rendition flights over Europe alone in the previous six years .
The practice was first authorised in 1986 by the then US president , Ronald Reagan , and developed in the 1990s under the Clinton administration as a way of tackling Islamism .
Its use is thought to have been extended after George Bush Jr declared his " war on terror " following the 9/11 attacks in 2001 .
Some suspects are alleged to have been transferred to " black sites " , secret prisons operated by the CIA outside US legal jurisdiction .
According to testimony of witnesses , Omar was bundled into a van after being stopped , apparently by Italian police , on a Milan street in February 2003 .
The prosecution said that he was driven to the US airbase at Aviano , near Venice , and then transferred to another American military facility , at Ramstein in Germany .
He was allegedly flown from there to Egypt .
Four years later he was released without charge .
He said he had been reduced to a " human wreck " by torture he had undergone in a Cairo jail .
The prosecution alleged that the Americans enjoyed co-operation from the Italian authorities .
The head of the government when Omar was kidnapped was Silvio Berlusconi , who was voted back into office last year .
More than two years after the trial opened , the judge , Oscar Magi , heard final submissions from the prosecution and defence before retiring to consider his verdict .
He told the court : " This was not an easy trial and the mere fact of its having been held is a significant event . "
The CIA has declined to comment on the case .
Successive Italian governments have denied involvement .
To build their case , the prosecutors ordered police to tap operatives ' telephones and seize documents from intelligence service archives .
Earlier this year , Italy 's constitutional court dealt the prosecution a heavy blow when it ruled that much of the evidence it had gathered was protected by under Italy 's official secrecy laws and could not therefore be used in court .
Magi ruled that the trial should continue regardless .
In a reference to the two senior Italian intelligence officials , the lead prosecutor , Armando Spataro , told the court today that the defendants included those who " by kidnapping Abu Omar compromised , rather than safeguarded , national security " .
Before he was abducted Italian investigators had been tapping the Muslim cleric 's phone calls over alleged links with Islamists .
The prosecution contended that his seizure not only violated Italian sovereignty but also aborted an important anti-terrorist investigation .
The judge awarded him € 1 m ( £ 900,000 ) and his wife € 500,000 in damages .

Four Israeli soldiers have been disciplined for protesting against the evacuation of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank .
The men received sentences ranging from three weeks in jail to confinement to their base for hanging an anti-eviction banner at their barracks near Hebron .
It is the latest in a series of anti-evacuation protests by some soldiers .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said armed personnel refusing orders put the country at risk .
' Fundamentally wrong '
Of the four disciplined , the squad commander was sentenced to 20 days in military prison and barred from any command position in the defence forces , while another soldier received a 14 - day jail sentence .
The other two will be confined to their base for 28 days .
If you promote disobedience , you will bring about the downfall of the state
Benjamin Netanyahu
They displayed the banner after two of their colleagues returned to the barracks after refusing an order to evacuate a settlement that had been built without an Israeli government permit .
Mr Netanyahu said that Israel 's security and existence depended its soldiers carrying out instructions .
" If you promote disobedience , you will bring about the downfall of the state .
There is no place for disobedience , " he said .
A military statement described the protest as " fundamentally wrong " .
The BBC's Middle East correspondent Katya Adler says some high - ranking officials in Israel 's army are concerned at the increasing number of religious Jewish soldiers who have refused to take part in the planned evacuation of some Jewish settlements in the West Bank .
Our correspondent says religious Jews see the West Bank as part of the Holy Land , given to them by God .
Last week 25 Israeli reservists signed a petition requesting exemption from Jewish settlement evacuations .
In October a group of soldiers disrupted their swearing - in ceremony in Jerusalem , calling for continued Jewish settlement in the West Bank .
Land grab
All settlements built on land occupied by Israel since 1967 are illegal under international law .
Some West Bank outposts do not have Israeli government permits Close to 500,000 Jews live in more than 100 settlements built on occupied territory since 1967 .
Israel does not recognise international rulings in this regard , but does deem those settlements built without Israeli government permits as illegal and instructs it soldiers and military police to evacuate them .
The settlement whose evacuation the four soldiers protested against did not have a government permit .
Palestinians see the ongoing building of settlements on occupied territory as a land grab that would reduce the size of a future Palestinian state .
The impasse in recent American - brokered negotiations between the two sides centres on Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas ' insistence , and Israeli refusal , that Jewish settlement construction be halted immediately .

Canada is doing very well in broadband availability , speeds and affordability as compared to other countries , according to a new study funded by the country 's largest internet service providers .
The report , commissioned by Bell , Bell Aliant , Rogers , Cogeco , Telus , Shaw and SaskTel and prepared by telecommunications consultant Mark Goldberg , found that Canadians are well served in broadband , contrary to the findings of other international reports .
" Canadians have access to some of the most affordable services , while also benefiting from some of the world 's fastest connection speeds for both wireline and wireless broadband services , " says the report , published Wednesday .
" Canada continues to lead all G8 countries in terms of adoption of internet services , and ranks in the top 10 for most international comparisons on broadband penetration . "
The report criticizes the findings of other studies , particularly regular statistics independently published by the Paris - based Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development , which have found Canadian broadband to be slower , less advanced and more expensive than in other developed countries .
Other studies have focused too narrowly on fibre - based services when measuring the availability of next - generation networks and have used inconsistent sampling in different countries , Goldberg 's report says .
They have also used unweighted averages to compare prices and speeds and have measured broadband usage by population rather than household .
Broadband is available to 100 per cent of Canadians through four different technologies — phone lines , cable , wireless and satellite — which is a claim few other countries can make , the report affirms .
And cable providers have begun offering services at up to 100 megabits per second , ranking Canada at the top of the international speed heap , while prices are actually lower than what the OECD has found , the report adds .
Mystery endures
About 30 per cent of households still have not chosen to take up broadband , a phenomenon that the report says cannot be fully explained as of yet .
" Affordability is likely an issue for some households , particularly those who might have to pay more in rural and remote Canada , and also among lower - income groups in urban centres , " the report says .
" For urban non-adopters who have lower - priced broadband options available to them , it may be that they do no see sufficient value ....
This may be because of a lack of digital literacy , or perhaps their ability to use the internet at work is sufficient such that they do not feel the need to buy it for home . "
The report also runs counter to an international broadband quality study released last week by Oxford University and sponsored by network builder Cisco .
That study 's comparisons found that Canadian broadband networks are barely coping with current internet usage and are poorly positioned to handle future applications such as high - definition video .
The ISP - sponsored report criticizes the Oxford study as well for not revealing more details about how it came to its conclusions .
A number of prominent technology leaders — including University of Waterloo president David Johnston , University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist and Bill St. Arnaud , chief research officer for CANARIE , Canada 's government - sponsored advanced internet organization — have said Canada 's broadband situation is in crisis .
Over 100 cyclists gathered last night at Governmenet Center to participate in a very special Critical Mass ride .
The group was joined by the family & friends of Rodolfo Rojo , a teen who was struck and killed by a speeding car on October 30th .
Memorial t- shirts courtesy of his friends & family were given to the attendees before the start of the ride .
An image of Rodolfo was on the front of the shirt with the message " Live life to the fullest " , a bicycle and " Share the Road " was on the back .
Shortly after 7 pm the group took to the streets , we started in downtown Miami and traversed north on Biscayne Blvd to 114th street to pay tribute .
A Ghost Bike was placed just a few yards from where Rodolfo was struck and killed .
Bradley Kelly , one of Rojo 's best friends who was riding with him and witnessed the tragedy that night set up the memorial .
At the memorial site we were awaited by more family & friends of Rojo .
Cyclists converged to pay their respects and placed white roses on the ghost bike , the group then released balloons in unison celebrating the life of Rodolfo Rojo .
It was a chilly and at moments somber ride last night .
I believe everyone invoved was quite touched by the whole experience .
Below is a video from the memorial celebration .
You can read a bit more about Rodolfo Rojo and the organization he was a part of here .
It 's obvious he had a very bright future ahead of him .
Though Rodolfo 's untimely death received little to no media attention soon after the tragedy , it now appears to be finally getting the recognition it deserves .
Local Spanish news station América TeVé 41 was present , their news story aired last night and can be seen below .
The Miami Herald ( Friday 11/27 edition ) also covered Rodolfo's death & the Critical Mass ride in his honor .
The piece can be read in it 's entirety by clicking on the image below .
I hope passerby 's see the Ghost Bike and are reminded that a young man lost his life here because of someone 's recklessness .

If you use Safari then you can Command + Click the Title of any website window in Safari and you can pull up a nice navigable drop - down list of the websites directory paths .
This is really handy if you ’re deep in some archive or if you ’re looking at an image and want to cut down to the parent directory .
Note this particular trick only applies to versions of Safari on Mac where the title bar is visible on of a website , which is generally on older versions of Safari for older versions of Mac OS X. Modern Mac OS versions have simplified the Safari interface to show the URL and search bar within the title , and instead page titles are part of tabs or in a tab bar , where command + clicking does not do anything on those versions .
There may be a way around that , if you know if it share with us in the comments of course .
Regardless of whether or not a particular Safari version supports this trick , this tip also works in a similar way in the Finder of Mac OS X too and that applies to basically every version of Mac OS released , so try it there too !

Well , it 's official .
Suspicion of criticizing the 2010 Olympics gets you on a watch list at the Canadian border .
Want to come to Canada and discuss the environmental shame that is the tar sands ?
Go ahead .
Want to meddle in Canadian military policy in Afghanistan ?
Fill your boots .
Want to criticize the Government 's position on Global Warming ?
Whatever , dude .
But if you cross the border and you 've got that look on your face that says “ The ice on the luge track might be a bit slushy if El Niño makes its way through , ” then watch out !
The Canadian Border Services Agency will not tolerate any Olympic dissent !
On Wednesday night , American Journalist Amy Goodman , host of the independent radio show , Democracy Now , was crossing into Canada .
She was scheduled to speak in Vancouver and Victoria , while on a tour promoting her new book Breaking the Sound Barrier , on the subjects of Iraq , Afghanistan , Medicare , and global warming – all sensitive issues that might make a patriotic border guard give pause .
So when Goodman told the border guards why she was coming to Canada , she was asked to pull over , brought inside and questioned for an hour and a half .
Known for being bold and forthright , she was honest about the subject matter she'd be covering .
When she said she'd be discussing Afghanistan , they said “ What else ? ”
" Global warming . "
“ What else ? ”
" Medicare . "
“ What Else ? ”
It must have made her wonder if she was at the Canadian border crossing , or a on a game show trying to guess the secret word .
So Goodman had to just come straight out and ask , “ Like what , ' what else ? ' ”
And they said , “ Will you be talking about the Olympics ? ” Being American , the only Olympics currently on her radar was the failed bid for Chicago and President Obama 's participation .
The guards said , " No , will you be speaking about the Olympics in Vancouver ? "
( Editor 's note : Nice to know the Canadian border guards are doing their job .
How brilliant !
Give North America 's top left - wing journalist the idea to " start talking about the Olympics on one of the most listened to radio programmes .
I sense an award in the offing . " )
I 'd love to see the memo that came down instructing this new policy .
“ Dirty bombs and child pornography are no longer priorities for border officials .
When questioning people entering the country , ask them what they think about the speed skating oval .
If response is anything less than enthusiastic ( “ I never really thought about it ” is not an acceptable answer . ) then begin stage two interrogation .
Ask them if they , or anyone they know , has ever been a member of a bronze medal match .
Keep them busy until reinforcements can be dispatched . ”
At this moment , sniffer dogs are being trained to smell anxiety caused by ambivalence toward the torch relay .
This is a blight that Canadians will not tolerate .

‘ Most of the time , Elvis never even knew I took his picture , ” says Alfred Wertheimer , whose intimate and unaffected photographs of the young Elvis Presley on the threshold of superstardom , in 1956 , including the unforgettable backstage shot The Kiss , are the subject of a major exhibition opening this month at the Grammy Museum , in Los Angeles .
“ Elvis was almost laser - focused on whatever he did .
So I would wait till he was involved — and Elvis was the kind of person who would be involved every 15 minutes in something else .
Whether he ’s combing his hair , or buying a ring , or in rehearsal ; whether he ’s talking to his father about why the plumbing is n’t working and the swimming pool is n’t full , or reassuring his mother that it ’s O.K. to take a ride around the block on his motorcycle , or posing with some girls to take snaps by other girls , his life was full of activity . ”
After Los Angeles , “ Elvis at 21 , ” as the exhibition is called , will embark on a three - year , nine - city tour sponsored by the History Channel , including stops at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington ; the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts , in Richmond ; the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum , in Abilene , Kansas ; and the William J. Clinton Presidential Library and Museum , in Little Rock , Arkansas .
Developed by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service with Wertheimer ’s longtime dealer , Christopher Murray , of Washington ’s Govinda Gallery , the show comprises 56 digital pigment prints , a medium perfected by David Adamson , who also works with Robert Frank , Chuck Close , William Wegman , and Annie Leibovitz .
The opening , on January 8 , is timed to coincide with what would have been the King of Rock ‘ n ’ Roll ’s 75th birthday .
According to a 2002 Harris Poll , 84 percent of Americans “ have had their lives touched by Elvis Presley in some way . ”
Graceland , his home at 3764 Elvis Presley Boulevard , in Memphis , attracts 600,000 visitors annually and has been made a National Historic Landmark , a designation it shares with Mount Vernon , the Alamo , and Pearl Harbor Naval Base .
Elvis has sold more than one billion record units worldwide and has headed Forbes ’s list of Top - Earning Dead Celebrities every year but two since its inception , in 2001 .
The Elvis Presley Trust earned $ 52 million in 2008 , beating the estate of its closest competitor , “ Peanuts ” creator Charles Schulz , by almost $ 20 million ; indeed , the deceased King even out - earned the living Madonna by some $ 12 million .
Andy Warhol ’s 1963 Elvis ( Eight Times ) , a 12 - foot - long , black - and - silver , full - figure portrait of the star flashing a pistol , was reportedly offered for sale privately for $ 150 million at the height of the pre-recession art boom .
In his eerily prophetic way , Warhol , who never met Presley but did dozens of paintings of him in the early 60s , based on that same publicity still from the movie Flaming Star , may have been the first to intuit that Elvis , like Marilyn , Liz , and Jackie , would become an icon in the true sense of that overused word , an object of worship , a holy saint for a secular culture .
“ Elvis who ? ” was Al Wertheimer ’s reaction when RCA publicist Anne Fulchino asked him to photograph a fast - rising singer from Memphis who would be making his fifth appearance on Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey ’s Stage Show , a half - hour variety program produced by Jackie Gleason and broadcast live from the CBS studio in New York every Saturday night , preceding The Honeymooners .
“ Anne Fulchino was my friend , ” Wertheimer says .
“ And besides , I worked cheap , and she had a limited budget .
She said , ‘ Al , can you go down to the Dorsey brothers ’ show this Saturday and photograph for me ? ’
So I said , ‘ Tommy Dorsey is one of my heroes !
Benny Goodman .
Big band .
Terrific !’
She said , ‘ No , I want you to photograph Elvis Presley . ’
Thirty seconds of silence .
I ’d never heard of an Elvis , let alone an Elvis Presley .
I said , ‘ Yeah , Anne , sure , if that ’s what you want .
You know , I ’m willing to work under any condition . ’
I needed the rent money . ”
Young and Hungry
Wertheimer , a German émigré , had begun his career only a year before , having graduated from Cooper Union School of the Arts in 1951 and served two years in the U.S. Army .
He had recently bought two black Nikon S2 split rangefinders , the updated version of the camera that his idol , the photojournalist David Douglas Duncan , had used for his Korean War coverage in Life magazine .
“ All the lenses were black , ” Wertheimer explained .
“ I said to myself , If I get the same type of camera , not only will I become invisible , I may become as good as Duncan . ”
These were the cameras , equipped with 35 - mm . and 105 - mm. lenses , that Wertheimer used to shoot 3,800 photographs over the course of seven days spent in close proximity to Presley in March , June , and July of 1956 — the year “ the Memphis Flash ” became “ Elvis the Pelvis , ” going from regional sensation to national phenomenon and , through a combination of shock and seduction , shaking up America ’s long - standing inhibitions about race , gender , and sex .
By that August , a month after Wertheimer photographed Elvis recording “ Do n’t Be Cruel ” and “ Hound Dog ” for RCA in New York , the 45 - r.p.m. record of the songs had become the first to top all three Billboard charts : Pop , Country , and Rhythm & Blues .

A tiny amount of blood is drawn through the chip into a single channel Researchers have demonstrated a tiny chip based on silicon that could be used to diagnose dozens of diseases .
A tiny drop of blood is drawn through the chip , where disease markers are caught and show up under light .
The device uses the tendency of a fluid to travel through small channels under its own force , instead of using pumps .
The design is simpler , requires less blood be taken , and works more quickly than existing " lab on a chip " designs , the team report in Lab on a Chip .
It has a flexible design so that it could be used for a wide range of diagnostics .
Much research in recent years has focused on the chemical and medical possibilities of so - called microfluidic devices at the heart of lab - on - a - chip designs .
These microfluidics contain between dozens and thousands of tiny channels through which fluids can flow , and as micro-manufacturing methods have advanced , so has the potential complexity of microfluidics .
Now , scientists at IBM 's research labs in Zurich have developed a cheap lab - on - a- chip that has the potential to diagnose dozens of diseases .
Bind and shine
The device relies on an array of antibody molecules that are designed to latch on to the protein - based molecular markers of disease in blood .
The antibodies are chemically connected to molecules that emit light of a specific colour when illuminated - but only when they have bound to the disease markers .
" There are devices that have been developed in microfluidics to do analysis of proteins , but most of them use active pumping and electrical components , " said Luc Gervais , a co-author on the study .
" They 're very complex systems ; this makes them less easy to use by non-trained personnel - and it makes them a lot more expensive to manufacture , " Dr Gervais told BBC News .
... and the design of the " capillary pump " affects how fast blood moves Instead , the new device exploits capillary action , the tendency of fluids to climb through narrow channels - the same phenomenon that drives water into a sponge placed on a wet surface .
The speed with which blood is drawn through the chip can be controlled by the design of the micro-channels on the device .
Those channels can be designed with incredible precision on a silicon chip - something with which IBM has significant experience .
The microchannel - patterned chip is then sealed with a special polymer called polydimethylsiloxane , to which the " detector " antibodies easily bond .
Different antibodies can be placed in a number of distinct channels , making it possible to diagnose a range of different diseases simultaneously .
Such wide - ranging studies can be done in large analysers , found in the central laboratories of hospitals .
" Typically you 'll take a couple of millilitres of blood , send it to the central lab and it can take up to an hour or even more to get the results , " Dr Gervais said .
" In our case you can get a quantitative analysis of the patient 's blood within just a few minutes at the bedside of the patient . "
What is more , it can be done with just a few microlitres of blood - a thousand times less - an amount that could be collected with a prick of a finger instead of a syringe .
While the approach will make diagnosis cheaper , co-author Emmanuel Delamarche said the key aspect of the approach is its speed .
" We are giving back precious minutes to doctors so they can make informed and accurate decisions right at the time they need them most to save lives . "

Someday soon Bertrand Piccard is going to throw the switches on his Solar Impulse Foundation aircraft , tug back on the stick and pull it into the air .
Then he ’ll fly it right around the world .
The impressive technology demonstrator ’s just about to take its maiden flight .
Let ’s hope it ’s not cloudy .
The Solar Impulse Foundation , cofounded by Piccard , has some loft goals about promoting research and innovative exploitations of renewable energy use in the aeronautics industry , getting the information and news about inventions out to the public , and promoting sustainable development .
One route to doing this is to tackle the tricky challenge of flying around the world in a solar - powered aircraft , and that ’s exactly what the SIF set out to do in 2003 – with building starting in 2007 .
Several weeks ago the impressive - looking vehicle , dotted with 12,000 individual photovoltaic solar cells underwent some initial engine power tests , and last week it rolled down the runway in Switzerland under its own power in some low - and high - speed taxi tests to test out controls , handling , and the delicate undercarriage .
Under a test - pilots command , ground speed reached 10 miles an hour , and conditions were almost right for a first flight .
Instead the team played it safe , and that flight should happen some time this week , if all goes well .
Playing it safe sounds particularly sensible when you learn that the Solar Impulse is the size of an Airbus , but weighs about as much as a mid-sized car .
Of course solar - powered aircraft are nothing particularly new : NASA ’s Pathfinder aircraft has been in the news for several years , and QinetiQ ’s Zephyr aircraft broke some world records when it was demonstrated to the U.S. Air Force last year .
But both of those aircraft are designed for specific tasks–mainly loitering around a specific location at very high altitude for defense or communications - node purposes–and they ’re unmanned , which frees up their design to be very , very light .
Piccard ’s vehicle is important because when it flies , it ’ll be a very potent demonstration of how far solar - power technology has come :
It ’s efficient enough to fly a person into the air under power , and then fly that pilot around the world .
Of course Piccard is n’t envisioning a future where we all hop into our solar sail - planes for the journey to work , pseudo - Jetsons - style .
Instead it ’s supposed to act as a symbol , “ almost a provocation ” as the Web site puts it , that solar technology could have a valuable role in aviation , an industry that many finger as being a serious eco - threat , with its almost exclusive reliance on fossil fuel .
Fingers crossed then that the first flight–and more important the first landing –goes well this week , since Piccard ’s six - year effort as resulted in just a single fragile airframe .

QCon SF 2009 : Max Ross , Mapping Relational Data Patterns to the App Engine Datastore Stefan Tilkov , Nov 19 , 2009
These are my unedited notes from Max Ross 's talk about Mapping Relational Data Patterns to the App Engine Datastore at QCon SF 2009 .
Datastore is transactional , natively partitioned , hierarchical , schema-less , based on BigTable – not a relational database
Goals : Simplify storage by simplifying development , management
Even though Datastore is based on the ridiculously scalable BigTable , you do n't need to have scalability problems to benefit from it
Scale always matters - the problem is not in the second step , it 's the first step
Free to get started ( not only for the first 30 days ) , pay only for what you need
Let someone else manage upgrades , redundancy , connectivity
Let someone else handle problems
Detailed post - mortem of GAE downtime available somewhere
Scale automatically to any point on the scale curve
Trying to get people out of the business of managing their database in production
Basic entity : Kind , Entity group , key , age , + any number of properties
Datastore is schemaless - soft schema model .
Much of the stuff available in the DB ( constraints , type checking , schema ) needs to move up to the app layer ( but is usually replicated there anyway )
primary benefit of the schemaless datastore : much faster iterations
soft schemas can give you type safety despite using a simple key / value store underneath
JPA annotations provide soft schema - even though targeted at creating DB information , GAE can benefit from it
JPA annotations are a data definition language ( proof : relational DB schema can be created from annotations )
Primary key in the datastore contains the kind and are hierarchical , e.g. / Person :13 / Pet:Ernie
Analogy : Hierarchical datastore keys are similar to composite primary keys
Surrogate keys are harder to move - dropping is often not an option .
Mapping options : 1 ) make surrogate part of the key a property 2 ) make surrogate key primary key , put rest into property Transations : transactions in the Datastore apply to a single Entity Group
Entities in the same Entity Group share the same root part of the key
This makes Entity Group selection a critical design choice , with obvious effects on transactions
Too coarse hurts througput , too fine limits usefulness of transactions
Datastore does optimistic concurrency checks at the Entity Group level
[ Strong relationship between data modeling and transaction processing – reminds me of the old debate on EJB 2.0 pre-final entity beans and dependent objects ]
Unreleased new feature : Transactional tasks can update multiple entity groups , a task in a queue can participate in a DB transaction
Example : Deferred , transactional , async balance update ( eventual consistency ) as well as synchronous
Two - phase commit protocol algorithm implemented at Berkely , implemented by a Google developer ( Erick Armbrust ) Relationships Letting a framework manage relationships can simplify code for RDBMS , but especially for App Engine Datastore
Goal : make handling relationships with JPA as easy as possible
Google 's JPA implementatin has some sensible defaults : Ownership implies entites are placed in the same Entity Group
E.g. Person with a @ OneToMay to Pet ( with a back reference of @ ManyToOne ) makes both part of the same Entity Group Queries Testing set membership – requires a join table with an RDBMS , can use a multi-value property in the GAE datastore ( select from User where hobbies = ' yoga ' )
Other than that , no joins supported
Conflict : Google promises that query performance scales linearly with the size of the result set ; not possible when cross products are needed to fulfill queries
Making good progress with a subset for join progress , not releases yet - nowhere near ready for production
RDBMS encourage cheap writes and expensive reads ; datastore encourage expensive writes and cheap reads .
Denormalization enouraged where it makes sense
Obvious problems with denormalized data
Taking code somewhere else App engine is in general more restrictive
Suggestion : Decide early whether or not portability matters to you
Shows examples of portable code - somewhat ugly
Congratulations , you have already sharded your data model Key takeaways App engine datastore simplifies persistence
JPA adds typical RDBMS features to the datastore
Important to understand how the datastore is different
Easier to move apps off than on
If portability is important , plan for it
http://gae-java-persistence.blogspot.com
Q&A Q. Does the shown transaction example really solve the problem ?
A . No , not to the full extent .
lot of Google 's billing software is built without multi-row transactions
Q. Is JPA a good model when starting from scratch ?
A . Many people like the low - level API , then start building an ORM on top of it … possibly better to start using an existing one .
Q. What kind of apps are on GAE ?
A . Not really known , many backend applications for iPhone apps , Facebook , … Obama virtal town hall meeting peaked at 700 req/s
Q. Export features ?
A . Some bulk import / export , but there should be more
Q. Caching ?
A . No direct support for JPA caching using memcached , but should be pluggable
Q. Is Python going to be replaced by Java ?
A. Absolutely not , the Java team rather has to fight to be accepted as an equal citizen
Q. Restrictions on some JDK features relevant ?
A. No .
Q. Staging area ?
A . No , not yet .
Q. JDO ?
A. GAE supports both , datanucleus supports both ; JPA was chosen randomly for this talk today .
Q. Can apps be run offline ?
A . You can run the app SDK locally , but it wo n't scale ; but stub implementations are pluggble and they could be replaced .
Russia is weighing changes to its military doctrine that would allow for a " preventive " nuclear strike against its enemies – even those armed only with conventional weapons .
The news comes just as American diplomats are trying to get Russia to cut down its nuclear stockpile , and put the squeeze on Iran 's suspect nuclear program .
In an interview published today in Izvestia , Nikolai Patrushev , the secretary of the Kremlin 's security council , said the new doctrine offers " different options to allow the use of nuclear weapons , depending on a certain situation and intentions of a would - be enemy .
In critical national security situations , one should also not exclude a preventive nuclear strike against the aggressor . "
What 's more , Patrushev said , Russia is revising the rules for the employment of nukes to repel conventionally armed attackers , " not only in large - scale , but also in a regional and even a local war . "
Gulp .
If I were in Georgia – or in any other country Russia considers part of its sphere of influence – that formulation would make me pretty anxious .
The Russian Federation is considering the " first strike " option as part of a larger overhaul of military doctrine .
The new doctrine , which is supposed to be presented to President Dmitry Medvedev later this year , is supposed to provide " flexible and timely " responses to national security threats .
The United States and Russia may prepping to negotiate a new strategic arms reduction treaty after President Obama declared a " reset " in relations between Moscow and Russia .
But Patrushev , apparently , did n't get the memo .
In the interview , he takes a swipe at the United States and NATO , saying that the alliance " continues to press for the admission of new members to NATO , the military activities of the bloc are intensifying , and U.S. strategic forces are conducting intensive exercises to improve the management of strategic nuclear weapons . "
In other words , Moscow is holding to a hard line , precisely at a time when Washington is trying to play nice .
The administration wants the Kremlin's help – to pressure Iran , to revive the arms - control process – but the bear still needs to brandish nukes .

* Strauss - Kahn : stronger yuan would boost domestic demand
* Dollar to remain dominant for at least a decade
* Warns world policymakers against early exit from stimulus
BEIJING , Nov 16 ( Reuters ) - A stronger yuan is part of the policy mix that Beijing needs to increase domestic consumption and help ease global imbalances , the head of the International Monetary Fund said on Monday .
The comments by Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the IMF ’s managing director , add to a drumbeat of demands that China scrap its currency ’s peg to the dollar , reinstated 16 months ago to help the country ’s exporters weather the global recession .
“ A stronger currency is part of the package of necessary reforms , ” he said .
“ Allowing the renminbi and other Asian currencies to rise would help increase the purchasing power of households , raise the labour share of income , and provide the right incentives to reorient investment . ”
Strauss - Kahn ’s remarks coincided with a visit to China by U.S. President Barack Obama , who has pledged to raise the exchange rate of the yuan , also known as the renminbi , as part of discussions on how to put the world economy on a more - even keel .
[ ID : nSP327252 ]
Strauss - Kahn noted that China was already taking steps , including wider healthcare coverage , to boost household spending by reducing people ’s need to save for a rainy day .
“ But more can be done to secure a lasting , structural shift towards consumption , by expanding the scope of social policies , moving ahead on financial sector reform , and undertaking corporate governance reforms , ” he said .
Conversely , countries with large current account deficits need to increase savings .
And for many of them , including the United States , reducing budget deficits must take priority , he said .
DOLLAR TO STAY CURRENCY KING
Overall , the global economy appears to have turned a corner , Strauss - Kahn said , and the biggest risk to the outlook was a premature withdrawal of the massive monetary and fiscal stimulus to which governments have resorted to prop up demand .
“ While it is prudent to plan for so - called ‘ exit strategies , ’ policymakers should keep supportive measures in place until a recovery is firmly established , and particularly until conditions are in place for unemployment to decline , ” he said .
Despite problems , the current international monetary system was still working reasonably well , the IMF chief said .
Speaking later to students at Tsinghua University , Strauss - Kahn said the dollar ’s supremacy might come under attack from the euro , the yen and even the yuan in the long term , but it would remain the dominant global currency for at least a decade .
“ If you are talking about 10 years , I think it wo n’t change very much .
The dollar will still be the most important international currency , just for one reason : that is that the U.S. economy will still be the biggest economy in the world . ”
Strauss - Kahn said he favoured a bigger international role over time for the Special Drawing Right , the IMF ’s in - house unit of account .
Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan proposed in March a beefed - up role for the SDR , which is a basket of four major currencies , saying it could eventually replace the dollar as the dominant global reserve currency .
“ It ’s not going to happen tomorrow morning , but it may happen in 10 years , in 15 years , ” Strauss - Kahn said .
“ The idea of creating a basket of currencies which would be the currency used for global trade , rather than using the currency of one country , meaning the U.S. , giving this country a special advantage over others , that idea is a good one . ” ( Editing by Alan Wheatley and Toby Chopra )
A woman traveling to Israel is questioned by security officers who are suspicious of her bag .
So they take it out the back and shoot it , killing her MacBook .
Amazingly , the hard drive survived .
“ The Israeli security ’s decision to shoot my laptop was nonsensical on multiple levels – unprovoked , unduly aggressive , a waste of government funds , etc. ” the woman , Lilly Sussman , wrote on her blog .
Someone in the comments added : “ These guys shoot every day at unarmed people , even children .
Why so much surprise about a simple laptop ? ”

Day twelve of the trial between anti-piracy group AFACT and Aussie ISP iiNet. iiNet CEO Michael Malone was questioned by AFACT barrister Tony Bannon for the fourth consecutive day , this time about the world 's largest tracker , The Pirate Bay , and any actions the ISP had taken to block customer access to it .
It ’s day twelve in the copyright infringement case of AFACT – representing several Hollywood studios – and Aussie ISP iiNet ( earlier coverage of day one , day two , day three , day four , day five , day six , day seven , day eight , day nine , day ten , day eleven .
The case continued Thursday in the Federal Court , with iiNet CEO Michael Malone taking the stand for the fourth consecutive day , and possibly his last .
Not unusually for a copyright trial involving BitTorrent , the issue of The Pirate Bay was raised .
Yesterday AFACT barrister Tony Bannon incorrectly suggested that iiNet ’s very own BitTorrent tracker ’s functionality had been taken down , later to discover that in fact the court ’s network blocked BitTorrent transfers .
Bannon indicated that he would like to be able to give a courtroom demonstration of The Pirate Bay Thursday , and the judge agreed that it would be possible to lift the block so he could do so .
According to ITNews , Bannon was today true to his word .
After the demo , Bannon enquired of Malone whether iiNet had a desire for its subscribers to be able to access the world ’s largest tracker , “ … when the only purpose it serves is providing a way to download unauthorized copies of films ? ”
This question was met with objection from iiNet barrister Richard Cobden , who argued that customer “ desire ” was irrelevant to the case .
The judge , Justice Cowdroy , was also keen to discover the relevance .
Bannon then became the latest in a long line of movie and music industry lawyers to reveal that should his clients win the case , they will take legal action to have not only the world ’s largest tracker blocked from iiNet ’s customers , but other similar sites .
He also revealed that around 50 % of the alleged copyright infringements in the case came courtesy of The Pirate Bay .
Then Bannon attempted to show that by allowing its customers to access The Pirate Bay , iiNet effectively sanctioned and authorized their infringing activities .
“ We seek Mr Malone ’s position as to whether or not his customers should have access to sites such as this , ” said Bannon .
However , after legal argument , Bannon withdrew the question .
Malone did , however , concede that iiNet had taken no steps to block The Pirate Bay , but qualified this by indicating that the company did n’t possess the means to do so .
Bannon asked if it was technically possible and Malone replied that he could achieve a primitive block with additional equipment , but even that could be easily circumvented
“ To completely and conclusively block access to The Pirate Bay , I believe it to be beyond our technical capability or of any ISP , ” replied Malone .
Asked by Cobden if iiNet had ever blocked any web sites , Malone said the company had not .
This technical inability led to iiNet pulling out of the Australian government ’s filtering trials , reports ComputerWorld .
Malone has been an outspoken critic of the filtering scheme , labeling it “ fundamentally flawed ” and saying his company would only participate in the trials to prove that filtering would fail .
The case continues .
The Inter - American Court of Justice has delivered a sharp rebuke to the Mexican government , accusing it of inaction in preventing , investigating and prosecuting the murders of young women in the border state of Chihuahua .
In a ruling released this week in the case of three young women whose bodies were found in a cotton field in Ciudad Juárez in 2001 , the court ordered Mexico to solve those cases and to overhaul its procedures for investigating the murders .
Rights groups say as many as 500 women have been killed since 1993 .

A few weeks ago , we posted images from a fan sketchbook with a " Calvin and Hobbes " theme , where various indie comics artists had drawn their own versions of the inseparable boy and tiger duo .
Since that time we have discovered or been pointed to a plethora of other artists with their own take on the great and much - missed comic strip , and thought perhaps another roundup was in order .
Although many of the commenters on the previous post saw any new or different versions of the characters as sacrilegious -- in part because of creator Bill Watterson 's fierce resistance to merchandising -- I would suggest that while these are certainly not works of art on the same scale as the original comic , they are mostly heartfelt tributes from a generation of artists that grew up loving " Calvin and Hobbes , " and want to express either the spirit of the comic or their affection for it in their own way .
As a dedicated , lifelong fan to whom " Calvin and Hobbes " is the holiest of holies in newspaper strips , I can certainly think of fan art that I find disrespectful , creepy , or incredibly sad .
But if I became that quick to condemn creative reinterpretations of deeply revered works simply for daring to exist , I 'm not sure I 'd be particularly different from these guys .
And so : A " realistic " Calvin and Hobbes by Nina Matsumoto a.k.a.

Elsewhere on the web :
Most stories about creativity are stories about the 1 % .
We hear about the moment of inspiration – Archimedes leaping from his bath , Coleridge hallucinating “ Kubla Khan ” in an opium reverie .
We do n’t hear so much about the years of perspiration – Archimedes plugging away at failed experiments , Coleridge learning his craft by writing notebooks full of dull poetry .
Most of us do n’t like to think about the labor involved in creativity .
It takes away the glamour and the magic .
But real creators know different .
They know that creative work is n’t particularly glamorous .
It requires discipline , routine , and a nitpicky attention to detail .
But they also know that none of that takes away the magic .
We often talk about “ the creative process , ” but it ’s really several interlocking processes .
The magic happens at the point where they intersect .
Here are three core processes you need to coordinate in your work as a creative professional :
1. ROUTINES
Many creative people lead apparently boring working lives , sticking to the same routine every day .
They do this because they understand instinctively what neuroscience has now confirmed – routine is a key that unlocks creative inspiration .
Circadian rhythms of arousal and mental alertness mean that certain times of day are especially conducive to focused creative work .
The effect is magnified when familiar objects , surroundings , and other stimuli ( coffee , background music ) become associative triggers for creative states of mind .
Here ’s how it works for Stephen King :
“ There are certain things I do if I sit down to write .
I have a glass of water or a cup of tea .
There ’s a certain time I sit down , from 8:00 to 8:30 , somewhere within that half hour every morning .
I have my vitamin pill and my music , sit in the same seat , and the papers are all arranged in the same places .
The cumulative purpose of doing these things the same way every day seems to be a way of saying to the mind , you ’re going to be dreaming soon . ” - via Daily Routines
Takeaway : Notice what time (s ) of day you are most alert and creative .
Dedicate that time to focused creative work .
Use the same tools , in the same surroundings , even the same background music , so that they become triggers for your “ creative zone . ”
2. SYSTEMS
A rock - solid productivity system performs a dual function for your creativity : ( 1 ) It ensures that all ideas and action steps are captured , so that nothing slips through the cracks , in your own work and within your team , and ( 2 ) When you are confident that everything important has been captured , you are free to focus fully on the task in hand .
Systems are different from routines , since they are not dependent on circumstances .
Major events can play havoc with your routine .
When this happens , a good system acts as a safety net .
I discovered this over the summer , when I became a father and my daily routine went out the window for a couple of months .
But having a decent productivity system in place meant that nothing important was forgotten and it all got done ( eventually ! ) .
Takeaway :
Take a few moments to review how you spend your time .
Study productivity systems and experiment to see what works for you .
( Behance ’s Action Method is one of the many tools available to streamline your workflow . )
3. SPONTANEITY
Real creativity involves spontaneity and surprise , whether a simple “ Aha ! ” moment or the lightning bolt of inspiration .
Paradoxically , the harder you work at routines and systems , the more likely you are to experience that bolt from the blue .
Archimedes would n’t have had his bathtub revelation if he had n’t been working hard on problems of volume and density .
Coleridge ’s notebooks show that much of the groundwork for “ Kubla Khan ” had been done in the months leading up to his famous opium trip .
But nose - to - the - grindstone productivity wo n’t get you very far unless you take a break , relax in the bath , have a beer with friends , browse the internet or a bookshop , or go for a walk and “ wander lonely as a cloud , ” as Coleridge ’s friend Wordsworth put it .
( Probably best to draw the line at opium though . )
One of the best things about being a creative professional is that all of this stuff technically counts as work !
Takeaway : Take breaks from the usual routine .
Be open to new people , places , and experiences .
Welcome the thoughts that appear from nowhere .
Have a notebook or phone handy to capture them .

What role do routines and systems play in your creative work ?
How do you leave room for spontaneity ?
Iranian troops have entered southern Iraqi territory and taken control of an oil well , reports say .
An Iraqi official played down the incident , saying the area was abandoned and right on a disputed border section .
Iranian soldiers crossed the border and raised an Iranian flag over the Fakkah oil field , a US military spokesman told the AFP news agency .
But an Iranian oil company spokesman denied the accusation , saying no troops had taken control of any oil well .
" The company denies Iranian soldiers taking control of any oil well inside Iraqi territory , " the National Iranian Oil Company spokesman was quoted as saying by Iranian media .
Confirmation
Iraq 's Deputy Interior Minister confirmed the Iranians stayed in Iraq and were in control of the well .
We are awaiting orders from our leader
Ahmed Ali al - Khafaji
Deputy Interior Minister
Earlier it was reported that they had withdrawn back across the border .
Deputy Interior Minister Ahmed Ali al - Khafaji initially told the Reuters news agency the reports of the Iranian incursion were not true .
But Mr Khafaji later confirmed the incursion had taken place , and said 11 Iranians had dug - in at the oil well and had not left .
" At 3:30 this afternoon , 11 Iranian soldiers infiltrated the Iran - Iraq border and took control of the oil well .
They raised the Iranian flag , and they are still there until this moment , " he told the Reuters news agency .
He said there had been no military response from Iraqi forces ..
" We are awaiting orders from our leader , " he said .
The incursion is one of several that have occurred in the last few days , he said .
The well is about 500 m from an Iranian border fort and about 1 km from an Iraqi fort , US Colonel Peter Newell told AFP .

Anyone who has used news feeds or Twitter / Facebook knows that the torrent of updates quickly becomes saturated with noise and is impossible to manage .
What we need are information aggregation services that can automatically customize filters for our personal interests .
For example , I might generally prefer to receive updates from certain " good " friends on Facebook , but could n't care less about the numerous mundane updates from my other " friends . "
But I also might want to know that an old acquaintance from high school is having a baby , or that my second cousin has posted a bootlegged sneak preview of an upcoming Star Trek movie .
A useful aggregation service should be able to automatically learn to surface only results that are interesting ( to me ) and suppress the uninteresting majority , despite collecting from hundreds or thousands of data sources .
Imagine a world where all computer programs can automatically learn to adapt and customize to our personal information needs .
We all want to make informed decisions about how to spend our time and money , but there are simply too many options or too much information for us to efficiently process .
The tools to help us deal with this information overload are called information retrieval and recommendation systems .
Information retrieval tasks can be categorized into a sliding scale between two extremes .
At one end , we have passive browsing , which typically starts at news or aggregation services such as customized blog feeds , news sites , Digg , Twitter , and Facebook .
At the other end , we have keyword search such as via Google , which is driven by specific information needs .
Filling out the middle are various recommendation scenarios covering the whole range of passive to active user intents ( e.g. , targeted banner ads on the NY Times , or product recommendations on Amazon ) .
As we become ever more dependent on the internet , we are faced with a two - pronged problem : an increasing variety of retrieval tasks coupled with digital content that is growing at an alarming rate .
Current techniques for designing retrieval systems cannot scale with growing demand .
While most existing systems are highly flexible and can be reconfigured in a number of ways ( many of which might be good fits for new retrieval domains and tasks ) , finding the best configuration is still a labor intensive process that requires substantial hands - on human expertise .
The key observation is that information retrieval systems do not exist in a vacuum ; they must interact with users .
The information we search for , the web pages we browse , the emails we send , the Twitter tweets we post , the items we purchase on Amazon -- they all leave digital footprints that reflect the fine grained dynamics of our online activities .
These interactions are plentiful and can be harvested at virtually no cost .
As such , one can easily imagine developing systems that can adaptively reconfigure themselves in new environments by learning from user interactions .
The idea of designing self - improving systems has long been a topic of great interest in the artificial intelligence and machine learning communities .
The basic premise is simple : a software application that learns to reconfigure or adapt itself to new or changing inputs ( e.g. , discovering the best results for search engine queries ) .
The current state of technology presents a tremendous opportunity .
Not only can we make exciting new progress in this area , but such progress can also substantially impact the foreseeable technologies of the future .
By developing automatic and adaptive algorithms , we might soon see an explosion of new applications that drastically improve the efficiency with which we make informed decisions in every phase of our lives .
In this rapidly growing research area , two technical challenges emerge to the foreground .
First , we must accurately interpret user interactions ; this is a challenging problem even for humans .
Second , since we typically only receive feedback for a limited number of results ( e.g. , the top 10 results returned by a search engine ) , we must also actively explore alternatives to present to users , so that we can observe their interactions with the alternatives .
Otherwise we might never discover the best configurations for that particular retrieval domain .
Furthermore , solutions to these challenges must be prescriptive and precise , so that they can be programmed to run automatically .
Before we can properly design programs that adapt to user feedback , we must first derive useful feedback from user interactions .
Although data is plentiful , it remains a challenge to understand what can be learned from observed user behavior .
Clicks ( e.g. , on search results ) are the most plentiful form of user interactions .
But what can we really interpret from them ?
The biggest known issue is called the position bias effect , where user attention tends to gravitate towards the top few results regardless of usefulness .
In a controlled study , Joachims et al . [ 1 ] examined search behavior on Google via an eye tracking study .
From the figure above ( copyright Joachims et al. ) , we see that not only do users rarely click on lower ranked results , but they often do n't even look at them .
When the users were presented with reversed rankings ( using an http proxy that shuffles the results but preserves the presentation layout of Google ) , the story remains largely the same .
In fact , rather than question the performance of Google , users often lamented at their inability to formulate the proper search keywords .
This leads to a second issue : the vast majority of user interactions provides only implicit feedback .
A clicked result need not be a good result .
As a simple thought experiment , consider two rankings , where one has good results and the other mediocre results .
Which ranking would you expect to receive more clicks ?
On one hand , all the results in the first ranking are good .
But users might click around more in the second ranking due to greater dissatisfaction .
Such questions must be resolved in order for computers systems to tease out useful information from observed behavior .
Most studies focus primarily on click behavior in search engines or online advertising , since that is where user interaction data is most readily accessible .
But one can easily imagine applying similar approaches to other forms of user interactions and retrieval scenarios .
The most straightforward approach is to use only pre-existing interaction logs .
Recently , Chapelle & Zhang [ 2 ] developed a probabilistic model of dynamic user behavior that uses click logs to simulate users browsing search results .
From such simulations , one can makeprobabilistic predictions about which clicks indicate user satisfaction ( e.g. , this clicked result has a 70 % chance of satisfying the user , or many users clicked on this result and then immediately backed out so it 's probably bad , or this unclicked result had a 80 % chance of being examined by the user so it 's probably not useful ) .
Another approach is to gather more explicit feedback from users .
The challenge lies in devising informative methods that encourages user participation , as well as in effectively combining this data with the more abundant implicit feedback .
Recently , El - Arini et al . [ 3 ] developed a blog filtering system that includes simple mechanisms for liking or disliking blog posts .
A screen snippet of their service , Turn Down the Noise in the Blogosphere , is shown above .
By providing convenient ways to indicate like or dislike , this system can learn to personalize , as well as reduce redundancy of topics shown .
Many other existing services also employ methods for gathering more explicit feedback , such as personalization options on Google and ratings on Amazon and Netflix .
A third approach is to use online experimentation to directly elicit more meaningful implicit feedback .
Historically , market researchers have relied heavily on side - by - side or A/B testing methods to measure preferences .
Recently , Radlinski et al . [ 4 ] showed how to conduct similar experiments for search results by interleaving the rankings produced by two search systems .
The figure above shows an example scenario .
Whenever a user issues a query , we can show the user an interleaving of rankings from two competing systems .
This approach deals with position bias by guaranteeing both rankings to have equal contribution at the top of the interleaved ranking .
One can then use click counts to measure relative preference .
Using the Physics E - Print ArXiv as an experimental testbed , Radlinski et al. showed that interleaving experiments can derive very meaningful implicit feedback .
Interleaving approaches can be used to run side - by - side tests at unprecedented scales .
Active learning is also crucial for future progress .
User interactions are largely limited to the top few options or recommendations .
So even with perfect feedback , we might never learnabout superior alternatives if we do n't explore new results to try out .
The goal then is to design intelligent methods for exploring alternatives ( such as which Facebook stories to surface ) that incur low cognitive cost and annoyance for the users .
One danger to under - exploring comes from rich get richer effects such as information cascades .
Most news aggregation sites such as Digg have " top article " rankings .
Since users typically only look at the top results , these top articles will then receive increasingly more clicks and ratings so that they become disproportionately popular even if they 're not more interesting than many alternatives .
The real tragedy arises when results picked up by information cascades are much worse than the best alternatives .
Suppose you are a scientist who likes to browse a weekly digest on recently published papers .
Of course , certain papers will be more popular ( with many disproportionately so ) .
What if that perfect idea to compliment your research happens to be contained in the 50th ranked paper , but you stopped browsing at the 25th and called it a day ?
Instead of making a connection that would dramatically speed up your own work , it might instead take you extra months or even years .
The challenge lies in understanding the fundamental tradeoff between exploration versus exploitation .
It could be that superior alternatives exist .
But all the unexplored alternatives could also all be garbage .
Should we try to explore more or just make do with what we have ?
If we over - explore , will that hurt our performance too much ?
The theoretical framework used to analyze this type of tradeoff is called the multi-armed bandit problem .
In the classical setting , we are given a fixed set of strategies or options without foreknowledge of their value , and must devise an algorithm to automatically pick strategies to play ( e.g. , choosing which banner ad to show on the NY Times ) .
Our algorithm receives feedback after each step ( e.g. , whether the banner ad was clicked on ) .
The goal then is to maximize the total payoff ( e.g. , total number of clicks ) .
This framework is very general and can be applied to almost any setting where we must make a sequence of decisions and only observe feedback on the choices we made .
The widespread applicability of the multi-armed bandit framework beckons for natural extensions that better reflect real world scenarios .
There is also a rising need to empirically evaluate proposed algorithmic solutions .
Such empirical evaluations can also inform future theoretical work by bringing to light disagreements between known theoretical guarantees and empirical results .
This is a wide open and exciting area of machine learning research .
The classical bandit setting is extremely simple and assumes all strategies to have fixed expected value and be always available .
It also does not consider side information ( or context ) , and defines feedback only as an absolute measure ( e.g. , between 0 and 1 ) .
Not surprisingly , recent theoretical extensions include introducing contextual information ( e.g. , the best strategy might depend on the query ) [ 5 ] , accounting for the fact that some strategies might be unavailable [ 6,7 ] , strategies with drifting rewards ( e.g. , user interests changing over time ) [ 8 ] , and feedback that only describes the relative value between pairs of strategies ( e.g. , if we used side - by - side interleaving tests ) [ 9,10 ] .
It is now also possible to develop online experimental testbeds .
For example , the aforementioned blog filtering service , Turn Down the Noise in the Blogosphere , can support experimentation .
Here at Cornell , we have a wonderful collaboration with ArXiv more information ) .
These collaborations will push the state - of - the - art in machine learning , and also provide valuable services to the general public .
And as for the big internet search companies , one can only guess what they 're cooking up in order to gain an edge over the competition .
Unfortunately , relatively few research groups currently have direct access to online services to use for evaluation .
The easiest thing to acquire are search logs , but it 's tricky to use them for evaluation in multi-armed bandit settings .
The issue here is that clicks are only logged for results chosen by the pre-existing system .
This becomes problematic when evaluating a new algorithm that chooses new results with no click records .
Given a large enough dataset , Langford et al . [ 11 ] have developed an approach to simulate how different algorithms might perform using pre-existing click logs .
The techniques under development will impact us beyond just progress towards self - improving information retrieval systems .
Stated differently , information services can aid us in every aspect of our lives , even those we do n't currently view as being information constrained .
In reality , many everyday tasks are already automated using computers ( e.g. , spam detection ) .
But our growing number of systems and services are becoming ever more difficult to maintain and configure .
This line of research can provide a layer of more general automation to set the stage for an incredible future to come .

Instead of using ordinary buttons and pins to stitch up clothes , Korean - born artist Ran Hwang creates amazingly large installations of birds and cherry blossom trees .
When you look up close , the amount of individual buttons is somewhat overwhelming , but from afar , the installation transforms into one breathtaking image .
“ My immense wall installations are extremely time consuming and repetitive manual work , ” says Hwang .
“ This is a form of meditative practice that helps me find my inner peace .
Pins are used to hold buttons onto the surface to form a silhouetted image , or to disintegrate such image .
No adhesive is used so the buttons are free to stay and move , which implies the genetic human tendency to be irresolute .
I use buttons because they are common and ordinary , like the existence of human beings . ”
“ By hammering thousands of pins onto a wall , I discover significance of existence , ” she adds .
“ Like the monks practicing Zen facing the wall , my work is a form of performance that leads to finding oneself . ”

A special task force that investigated and charged a squad of Toronto police narcotics officers for allegedly shaking down drug dealers also suspected another drug squad of corruption , but then - chief Julian Fantino ignored the suspicions , a lawyer claimed in court this week .
The lawyer for Milos Markovic – a suspected drug dealer who alleges the squad led by Det.
Dan Ross stole from his safety deposit boxes – claimed in a pre-trial motion hearing that Toronto police brass failed to properly investigate concerns raised about the Ross squad .
Lawyer Julian Falconer said police “ unplugged ” the investigation of the Markovic matter as part of a damage control campaign at the time the notorious Det. John Schertzer crew was making headlines .
“ When Chief Fantino declared there were only a few bad apples , he did not deliver the straight goods , ” Falconer said in court .
Fantino , now the head of the Ontario Provincial Police , was not available for comment .
Lawyers for the Police Services Board note in a factum presented in court that Fantino is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit , and claim the special task force never concluded the Ross team committed any crimes .
The police lawyers also suggest it was Markovic who stymied the investigation by not co-operating .
None of Falconer ’s allegations have been proven in court .
Ross , now in a position of leadership at the police officers ’ union , did not return phone calls .
His lawyer , Gary Clewley , said , “ ( The Ross crew ) was investigated and as far as I ’m concerned , cleared .
Everybody who looked at it … said there were no grounds to charge . ”
Markovic is suing the police force in civil court , claiming officers stole more than $ 200,000 in cash and valuables that belonged to him .
His lawyer says he obtained new documents that show police force inaction .
Whether Falconer will be allowed to include his cover - up claims in the lawsuit is before the court .
Falconer contends the alleged cover - up contributed to his client ’s mental distress .
Police force spokesman Mark Pugash said Falconer ’s documents represent only a small portion of all the available paperwork , which contains contradictory statements and offers little clarity to the issue .
Meanwhile , the charges against Schertzer and his crew , after being tossed last year due to prosecutorial delays , is back on after an appeals court ruled several weeks ago that the delays were reasonable and the officers should stand trial .
At the time of the Schertzer scandal , Fantino said the allegations , while “ regrettable , ” were “ isolated and confined .
The investigation has been independent , extremely exhaustive and thorough . ”
After the Markovic hearing this week , Falconer suggested otherwise in an interview with the CBC as part of an ongoing Star - CBC probe of the matter .
“ The only problem is that the investigation in relation to my client ’s matters was unplugged .
Unplugged before Mr. Markovic could be interviewed . …
A final report we never see until years later states that the conduct of these ( drug squad ) officers is `a hair ’s breadth from being criminal . ’
“ What if the officers are innocent ?
Clear them .
Vindicate them . …
You make sure one way or the other the truth is told . ”
Documents filed by his lawyer show Markovic was arrested , stripped and searched , and charged , but the charges were later stayed .
In 2001 , Fantino , then the newly appointed chief , struck the task force to investigate what had become the biggest corruption scandal to hit Toronto police , and he tapped RCMP Superintendent John Neily to run the probe .
The alleged thefts of drug dealer money took place in the late 1990s , before Fantino was chief .
The probe was to centre on Schertzer ’s crew but the task force soon widened its focus to include other officers .
In the end , the costly effort – which spanned three years and involved interviewing hundreds of witnesses , executing dozens of search warrants , obtaining three wiretaps and analyzing suspect officers ’ finances – resulted in charges laid against Schertzer and his crew .
Further explaining his arguments in court , Falconer said in the interview “ that there was a deliberate element of concealment of the true nature of the problems they found on the drug squads .
“ The words used by Chief Superintendent Neily were that serious criminal thefts and drug possession go beyond the Schertzer team into the Ross team ” and that the matter justified an undercover investigation and financial audit of the officers .
“ None of that happened , ” Falconer said .
Neily declined to comment .

Toronto drug officers face more corruption accusations
by CBC News
“ A few bad apples . ”
That ’s how former Toronto police chief Julian Fantino described the force ’s problems when six former officers were charged with conspiring to beat and rob drug dealers of hundreds of thousands of dollars .
The officers , all members of Team 3 of the Toronto Police Service ’s Central Field Command drug squad , are still awaiting trial after almost six years .
“ I am deeply saddened and disappointed , ” Fantino told a news conference in January 2004 , commenting about the charges against the six .
“ I can , however , tell you that the allegations are isolated and confined . ”
His comments came at the conclusion of an internal probe headed by RCMP Chief Supt .
John Neily into the allegations or wrongdoing , which led to 40 criminal charges against the officers .
But police documents that surfaced for the first time this week in a Toronto lawsuit show anti-corruption investigators repeatedly briefed Fantino about similar allegations against other drug officers .
These warnings came several months before Fantino made public assurances that alleged wrongdoing was isolated to Team 3 of the drug squad .
A joint CBC News / Toronto Star investigation has found that Toronto police did not allow Neily and his team to complete their investigation into those allegations .
‘ There was a thief on that team ’
The TPS documents were unearthed as part of a move to expand a lawsuit against the force this week .
They show another drug squad was being scrutinized by Neily ’s investigative unit — dubbed the Special Task Force ( STF ) — for offences similar to the ones Team 3 was accused of .
In the late 1990s , nine separate drug dealers accused members of Team 2 , led by Det. Danny Ross and Const .
Mike Abbott , of stealing more than $ 600,000 in cash from them .
One of the documents shows that Neily briefed Fantino about those allegations against Team 2 .
“ These cases are unsubstantiated [ without interviews with the drug suspects ] , ” Neily wrote in a confidential briefing note to Fantino in May 2002 .
“ I temper that … however , by telling you that there is very good reason to suspect someone on that team is a thief . ”
Neily first assigned two investigators to focus on Team 2 in late 2001 .
They uncovered troubling questions over the officers ’ handling of drug money seized during searches at banks .
STF investigators wrote in internal documents in late 2001 that in three separate cases , Team 2 officers did not follow standard procedures when seizing money from safe deposit boxes .
The investigators reported members of the team repeatedly asked bank staff to leave when seizing cash from safe deposit boxes , leaving no second witness to count the cash , counter to bank policy .
They found that team members delayed handing over seized cash and improperly stored the cash .
There were also discrepancies between the amount of seized cash reported by the officers and the amount of cash the defendants said they possessed .
Neily , however , could n’t continue the probe as none of the alleged drug dealers would come forward to file an official complaint , fearing what they said about the officers could be used against them in a legal setting .
The stalemate led Neily to concede that the probe into Team 2 was stalled .
But in a July 2002 note to Fantino , he said his suspicions still were n’t allayed .
“ While I have ordered the nine cases of interest [ to be ] no longer investigated involving the team of Danny Ross , as reported to you in May there is no doubt in my mind that there was a thief on that team and it is my belief so far that it could have been one or both of [ Team 2 officer ] DC Mark Denton and / or Mike Abbott , ” Neily wrote .
None of the Team 2 officers named in the ongoing lawsuit by Milos Markovic , a formerly accused drug dealer , would agree to an interview .
Their lawyer , Gary Clewley , denies any theft and says the STF uncovered only sloppy police work .
“ They do thousands of these cases and , at the end of the day , we have a handful of people who claim that they were ripped off .
And when you ’re doing thousands of cases , mistakes get made , ” Clewley told CBC News in a recent interview .
“ Documents do n’t get filled out properly .
Things do n’t get put where they ’re supposed to .
That does n’t amount to theft unless you start the investigation , working from the assumption that they are thieves and set out to prove it .
I think that ’s what happened . ”
Renewed interest in 2003
Neily and his task force renewed their interest in Team 2 in early 2003 , after getting Markovic to file an official complaint .
Before then , Markovic had repeatedly refusing repeated requests from the STF to complain about Team 2 .
He relented after striking a deal that any statements he gave to the STF would not be used against him later , either in criminal court or in a lawsuit he filed against the police service .
Markovic was arrested in Oct. 28 , 1999 , by the Ross / Abbott crew and charged with dealing cocaine .
Those charges were eventually dropped .
Markovic and his wife , Natasha , filed a suit in 2000 against : nine Team 2 officers who searched their home ; the Toronto Police Service ; its board and former TPS chief David Boothby .
The TPS internal documents that surfaced this week were a result of a court motion in Markovic ’s suit .
The Markovics claimed the nine officers beat him in his pizza shop and later robbed him of close to more than $ 361,000 in cash and valuables .
They sought $ 1.3 million in damages .
STF investigator Det. Neal Ward said in a report about the Markovic case that “ the work of the Central Field Command Drug Squad was sloppy at best and a hair ’s - width away from being criminal . ”
Neily had set dates in early 2003 to meet Markovic to take his statement of complaint .
But that meeting — and the probe into Team 2 — was suddenly called off .
CBC News has learned that in March 2003 , Fantino met with Neily , other STF investigators and TPS chief financial officer Frank Chen .
According to sources who requested anonymity , Fantino threatened to cut off all funding for forensic audits on officers suspected of wrongdoing .
Probe moved to Internal Affairs
The sources said Fantino cited financial pressures and the need for Toronto police to be prepared for a potential “ terrorist attack ” as reasons for the STF to wrap up its work , closing the door on any further probe of Team 2 officers .
“ I was shocked , ” Peter Biro , Markovic ’s lawyer at the time , told CBC News .
“ Chief Supt .
Neily called sheepishly and apologetically and told me the interview was cancelled … that the investigation into the Markovics ’ complaints was at an end , [ and ] would not continue . ”
“ Chief Supt .
Neily said on at least one occasion in that telephone call that it was not his decision .
The explanation ?
A lack of resources and a need to wrap up the task force .
That was the official reason given to me , ” Biro said in a recent interview .
Neily , now retired from the RCMP , told CBC News that “ given our resourcing limitations and our focus on Team 3 , ” the STF had no choice but to hand the case back to TPS Internal Affairs .
“ It was a Toronto Police Service decision , ” Neily told CBC News when asked why the STF did n’t handle it or do financial checks on officers on the other suspect team .
Neily recommended in a November 2002 document he titled , “ Notes From the Wall : We Are Not Done Yet , ” that someone should interview Markovic and begin an undercover operation to try to get to the bottom of the allegations against Team 2 .
Fantino , now commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police , refused to be interviewed for this story .
Markovic now learning details
TPS Internal Affairs did eventually take a statement from Markovic in the summer of 2003 , but closed the file , concluding he was not a credible witness and too much time had passed .
TPS conducted no further probe of the officers or their personal finances .
Markovic claims he ’s been kept in the dark about the internal investigations for years .
After repeated attempts , Markovic ’s legal team — now headed by high - profile Toronto lawyer Julian Falconer — secured a court order in December 2008 compelling the TPS to hand over hundreds of pages of documents , including the confidential briefing notes to Fantino about the Team 2 officers .
In February , the Toronto Police Service handed over the documents .
Falconer , after reviewing the documents , decided to effectively rewrite the lawsuit Markovic had filed in 2000 .
Falconer has now filed a motion in civil court that seeks to expand the lawsuit , claiming that beyond theft and assault by officers , the TPS failed to properly investigate the corruption allegations .
“ It was deliberately covered up , ” Falconer told a Toronto court at a Wednesday hearing .
“ They pulled the plug . ”
In an interview with CBC News , Falconer brushed aside suggestions that the STF ’s mandate was limited to an investigation of Team 3 and it had to end at some point .
“ Why not tell the Canadian public the truth ?
Pure and simple , ” he said .
“ Why not acknowledge that they had concerns about members of Team 2 ?
Why say the allegations are confined and isolated , when in fact the concerns were the opposite ?
Why not acknowledge that the investigation is being unplugged for a lack of resources ? ”
Falconer said he fears the failure to let the STF fully investigate Team 2 was all part of a plan set in motion back in 2001 when Fantino set up the internal probe .
He pointed toward an internal TPS recommendation that the STF probe could “ avert a public inquiry ” and “ provide some assurance that it was just this one team . ”
A Toronto judge has reserved decision on whether he ’ll allow an expanded suit to go to trial .
STF findings of irregularities in 1999 drug case :
* On March 19 , 1999 , officers Mike Abbott and Darren Cox told a bank manager to leave the room while they counted and seized cash from a safety deposit box in connection with a criminal investigation of Roman Paryniuk .
* The manager was to step outside in case there were harmful substances in the box , but the officers themselves took no protective steps .
* The two took an hour to return to the station , stopping for a sandwich on the way , despite carrying hundreds of thousands of dollars in their cruiser .
* The money was placed in a safe in the detective ’s office , and the money bags were not sealed .
The money was not formally counted until March 25 , almost a week after the seizure .
* The officers reported counting $ 664,000 .
But Paryniuk reported $ 200,000 was missing from the box .
* The probe in this case was dropped when Paryniuk refused to complain formally .

When a person ’s actions are restricted to what can be defined as self - defense , the assailant controls many of the variables they face .
Time ; place ; daylight ; dark ; cold or hot are many of the variables one must consider .
Therefore , the variables that we can control must be mastered if we are to have a chance for survival if ever faced with a do - or - die situation .
Those who own firearms and practice with them enough to be considered proficient in their use , most likely choose good weather in which to practice ; light conditions are optimal and a good comfort level is maintained .
Sure , you can hit that silhouette at 25 ft with both hands the majority of the time with optimal conditions with your favorite handgun .
You can also hit that target at 300 yards with your battle rifle , sometimes putting all your shots in a small group when conditions are great ; fine indeed if your attack occurs only during the daylight with no wind and the temperature hovering around 72 .
How many know how they will perform these tasks when faced with darkness , heavy wind , freezing temperatures or blowing snow ?
Better yet , how many know how their equipment will perform in less than ideal conditions ?
If you can be 100 % certain you will only be faced with a life - or - death self - defense situation when conditions are ideal , stop reading now ; the following will be of no interest to you .
The Farnam Method of D... John S. Farnam Best Price : $ 8.55 Buy New $ 20.51 ( as of 08:25 EST - Details )
Monday and Tuesday here in the Rockies witnessed blizzard conditions with 1 — 2 feet of snow , blowing winds sometimes reaching 50 mph and temperatures near zero .
While most folks thought this the best time to hunker down with a good book or movie , I got together all of the firearms , ammo and equipment that I might have to use to defend my life and / or the life of my family and headed for the range .
I ’m sure any who witnessed me entering the range that day were comforted in the thought that I was totally insane .
When the 5 - hour session was over , I was very cold and miserable , but I knew how both my equipment and I would function in that environment .
I viewed the experience as a variable somewhat mastered .
The things that can be learned about ones firearms and equipment in terrible conditions could be the edge one needs to stay alive at some point in time and most useful when it becomes necessary to provide food for the table .
Calculating for point of impact with projectiles down range in a 50 mph wind with numb fingers and blinding snow presented a real challenge .
Then , to try all of the tactical sights on targets at less than 100 yards was quite an experience .
Which ones work and which ones do not was a question that was answered for me along with what reticle performs best in blizzard conditions .
Which action on what rifle actually froze up and would not function at all ?
What firearms lubricants held up in those conditions ?
What trigger guards were of adequate size to handle a gloved finger ?
All questions I had answered for me that would not have occurred had I not taken the time to train in those conditions .

Some time back I spent equal time in training in the desert around Tucson Arizona in the month of June .
Again , not everything performs as advertised in a 100 - degree plus environment , most of all the owner of the equipment .
Taking the necessary time to train in all environs in which one could possibly find themselves is vital .
Equipment , physics , physiology and how they relate to your ability to function in a stressful situation are invaluable pieces of knowledge .
Once you possess this knowledge , you increase your confidence to deal with any situation ten fold .
Confidence and mental preparation will see one through many situations where the ignorant will fail to survive .
Training with your chosen equipment in optimal conditions is fine and should be done on a regular basis to become as proficient as possible and to understand exactly how your equipment functions .
This should include being able to make adjustments and repairs as might be required and assembly and disassembly of your chosen firearm .
Having necessary spare parts is also a must .
Say you have a bent charging handle on your AR platform ; do you know how to replace it ?
What about replacing a broken firing pin ?
Equally important is knowing and understanding how you and your equipment function in extreme environments .
Once you understand how everything works , take it all out during extreme cold and heat ; try them in a pouring rain and windy conditions ; disassemble and assemble in low - light situations without giving away your position .
All of the above could be the determining factors in whether you and your family are able to survive an attack or able are to provide food for survival if / when the situation demands .
The Best of Michael Gaddy

How will the boom in Americans claiming " no religion " — 25 percent of the country will fit into that category in 20 years , according to a Trinity College survey out today — alter national politics ?
I see four big ways :
1. Secular voters will become an increasingly important component of the Democratic base .
In the 1990s , so - called religious nones comprised 6 percent of the Democratic Party and 6 percent of the GOP .
Today , there are two and a half times as many nones — 34 million Americans , or 15 percent of the country — and they account for 16 percent of Democrats , compared with just 8 percent of Republicans .
Three in four of them voted for Barack Obama in the last election .
Every indication is that these political trends will continue .
Even as the Democratic Party has seriously stepped up its faith outreach , then , the fact that the fastest - growing religious group in the United States is those with no religious affiliation — and that members of that group are leaning dramatically in the Democratic direction — will make the Dems pay closer attention to them .
2. American politics will become more polarized .
As more Americans leave religion , the ones left in the pews are those most committed to their faith .
In a nation where church attendance is one of the best predictors of voting behavior — the more often you attend , the more likely you are to vote Republican — this polarization of religious life will spill over into the political arena , setting off more culture - war battles .
3 . Republicans will have to choose between becoming a more overtly religious party and reaching out more seriously to the growing secular middle .
Secular voters once constituted an important part of the GOP coalition , but fewer than 10 percent of religious nones under age 30 are Republican .
" Republican nones are getting older and continue to show an affinity to the GOP , " says Juhen Navarro - Rivera , a Trinity College research fellow who helped compile the new report .
" But they 're not making new Republican nones . "
Navarro - Rivera is still running the numbers , but his hunch is that the new generation of religious nones has been scared away from the Republican Party because of its ties to the Christian right .
Does the GOP continue to embrace that movement or move more to the middle ?
Call it the Sarah Palin option versus the John McCain option .
( Though opposition to healthcare reform , it should be noted , is helping bring the two camps together . )
4 . If secular voters become more aggressively antireligious , the Democrats ' newfound faithiness faces big challenges .
If religious nones congeal into a coherent voting bloc with their own issues , Democrats will have to pay more attention to their political agenda .
Most religious nones are n't hostile to religion ; few are atheists .
" They 're aligning with the Democrats because the party has lots of religious people , but they 're not pushy about it , " says Navarro - Rivera .
At the same time , religious nones are n't crazy about a huge role for religion in government and politics .
And as their numbers grow , some expect them to turn more overtly antireligious .
Will they continue to tolerate a party leader who invites Rick Warren to his inauguration and who refuses to decide whether religious groups can hire based on religion with government funds ?
Doubtful .
See President Obama 's top faith moments .

Linn will stop making CD players , but not turntables for vinyl A manufacturer of hi- fi systems has sounded what it said could be the death knell of the compact disc player .
Linn Products has become the first manufacturer to announce it will give up on CDs from the start of next year .
Instead , the niche company , based in East Renfrewshire , will focus on producing digital streaming equipment .
The firm , which makes systems costing from £ 2,500 to more than £ 100,000 , said discerning customers recognised the superior quality of digital streaming .
Yet it continues to make turntables for vinyl records , as there remains a demand for the quality of sound compression offered by older record technology .
Linn , which has its own small record label , foresees a move to what it calls Studio Master Quality material , available for download .
Digital players
The shift from CD players to digital music streamers has been very recent .
It was only during 2009 that the digital players outsold Linn 's CD players .
The newer technology allows digital streaming through other operating systems , including home computers and networking throughout homes .
Gilad Tiefenbrun , managing director of Linn Products , said : " Our customers have fast recognised the limitations of CD players and in the age of home networking , people now want better control of their music and the ability to enjoy it in any room of their home .
" CD players no longer belong in the specialist domain . "
The company reckons that the CD format will continue to be useful as a way of recording and storing music .
It claims that a CD recorded onto a hard disk can achieve a higher quality than one played on a CD player .
Falling CD sales Compact discs began commercial music sales in 1982 , replacing the cassette tape as well as vinyl records .
The shift from compact discs to digital downloading is again changing the music market .
BPI , representing the British recorded music industry , announced last month that 2009 had already broken last year 's record number of legally downloaded single and individual track sales .
Of 117 million sales , nearly 99 % were digital downloads .
But there is a different market for album sales .
CD sales continue to dominate , but their share of the market is sliding .
In 2006 , there were 154 million album sales , of which CDs accounted for 151 m , and digital for 2.7 m .
In 2007 , with 138 m sales , 131 m were CDs and 6.2 m were digital .
In 2008 , there were 137 m album sales , with 123 m CDs and 10.3 m digital downloads .
Vinyl records , cassettes and other formats accounted for around 300,000 .

Not since the days of Ron Hextall have Flyers fans felt confident in their netminder for more than a few months .
Martin Biron had a great playoff run in the spring of ' 08 , Robert Esche seemed capable enough in ' 04 , Roman Cechmanek was calming for a few games ( and able for a little while ) , and everyone remembers Brian Boucher in 2000 .
But it 's been a long time since the team has found one guy who can patrol the Flyers crease for more than a passing phase .
Maybe that 's Ray Emery , maybe it's Johan Backlund , Nic Riopel , Adam Morrison , or maybe it 's Jacob De Serres .
The Flyers drafted De Serres in the third round , 84th overall , in 2008 .
He was coming off his best season , posting a 20 - 11 - 1 record for the Seattle Thunderbirds of the WHL , with a 2.28 GAA and .922 S % .
Since then , he had his worst season to date last year , and started this season off 0 - 3 - 0 with a 5.00 GAA and .851 S % before being traded to the Brandon Wheat Kings .
Since De Serres was drafted , the Flyers have picked three more goalies - Joacim Eriksson ( 2008 , 7th round ) , Adam Morrison ( 2009 , 3rd round ) , and Nicola Riopel ( 2009 , 5th round ) - in an attempt to find a starting NHL goalie from within .
Yesterday , Broad Street Hockey got an exclusive interview ( seriously , I just wanted to say that and feel special ) with Flyers goaltending prospect Jacob De Serres .
Much appreciation is due to Derek Zona of The Copper & Blue for putting us in touch with Matt McNish of the Brandon Wheat Kings , and allowing us to interview De Serres .
Thank you .
Follow after the jump for the complete transcript .
Broad Street Hockey : [ Wednesday ] night , you got the win for Brandon in a 7 - 3 game , and one of Prince George 's goals came on the power play .
Were you happy with your performance ?
Jacob De Serres : Fairly happy .
I think I 'd like to have the first two back .
Well , the first one I 'd like to have back since it was a bad rebound on a 2 - on - 1 and the guy had an empty net .
The second was a fairly bad bounce .
If I was a little more patient , I could have had it .
After that , I battled the rest of the game and did really well .
The third goal , it was a big save and they got the rebound in .
BSH : Has controlling the rebounds been a problem for you ?
De Serres : Not a regular thing .
It 's not recurring in every game at least , it just seemed like it last night .
BSH : I noticed you did n't get off to a great start this year .
Was any of that lingering from last year 's groin injury ?
De Serres :
It could have been .
Definitely , and I 'm not going to blame anything , but I think the fact that I was out of the net for so long , the last time I played a game was the very beginning of February .
So I think it was just a comfort level , needing to get used to game mode .
BSH : Here in Philly , we 're used to going injuries , from Gagne to Briere , and even to Niittymaki last year .
Did you feel any lingering effects this year , or is it 100 % ?
De Serres :
It 's felt 100 % now , strong again , and I 've slowly built myself back up to 100 % .
BSH : On that note as well , last year was statistically your worst one in the WHL and included the season - ending injury even after you lost your starting job .
How has that experience helped you out and how have you rebounded mentally ?
De Serres : First , I do n't think I lost my starting job .
I think , I do n't know why people say that .
It may have looked like that because by the end of the year , [ Calvin Pickard ] had way more minutes .
But I was also out for the last two months of the season .
I think from Christmas until I got hurt I was playing awesome .
I was feeling good again , so it was just terrible timing for my injury to happen .
It was n't the best year , but I think I 've learned a lot from it and in the end , it will make me better .
[ Ed. note : From December 27th to February 7th , DeSerres compiled a 7 - 8 - 0 record , witha 2.89 GAA and a .902 S % ]
BSH : Entering this year , you had three games back in Seattle and then you got traded to Brandon .
Since then , things have started to turn around - your stats are obviously much better in Brandon than they were in Seattle for the first three games .
I know it 's a small sample size , but what do you attribute the turn - around to ?
De Serres :
It was a much needed change .
In my head I really needed to get out of there .
It just was n't the right place for me any more .
I needed a change , a change of scenery , and I think it was mostly all in my head .
I needed a fresh start and Brandon 's a lot better .
Good guys , a lot of positive players , and a good atmosphere to be around .
I 'm happy with it here and could n't have asked for more .
BSH : Along that subject , Andrew Hayes - the other goaltender with you out in Brandon - has been playing well in net so far this year .
Do you look at that as a competition , do you look at his as someone you can learn from , and do you think you 'll be able to take starts away from him or just split time evenly ?
How are you trying to approach that this year ?
De Serres : I think all of it .
I think I can learn from him like I can from any goalie .
I believe in myself , I think I 'm a very talented player .
When I get going , I think I can get really going .
Just going to play the best I can , and I think [ General Manager and Head Coach Kelly McCrimmon ] , later on in the year , will just play who 's playing best .
I just have to make sure I 'm that guy .
BSH : Talk about your experience in training camp this year in Philadelphia .
What was it like - I 'm assuming this was your first camp where you got to participate rather than just being the new draft choice - so either correct me if I 'm wrong , or explain what that experience was like .
De Serres :
It was actually my second camp .
The year after I got drafted it was a pretty good experience .
The rookies stayed around longer .
The first year I stayed out quite awhile , and I even missed the start of the season in Seattle .
Every experience has been great .
I guess the second time around , I knew more what to expect - I knew a bunch of the guys .
Less nerve - racking too .
Both experiences were great and different in their own way .
BSH : I actually got a chance to watch you during the rookie game against Washington this year in training camp , and you only gave up one goal on fifteen shots .
I remember that goal was pretty much a 4 - on - none after a bad line change .
I thought you played well in that game , but what did you take out of that game specifically ?
De Serres : I thought I played great too .
I thought I battled hard and made some big saves and felt comfortable too .
I always have thrived on playing at a higher level .
I felt god out there and hope that next year , I 'll be at that level .
BSH : Speaking of next year , where do you expect to be playing ?
DeSerres : Personally , I plan on playing for the Phantoms next year .
BSH : What aspect of your game are you trying to work the most on , that you think needs the most improvement so far ?
De Serres :
It 's tough to pick out one specific thing .
You 're constantly working on something .
You see a few things in a couple of games and you work hard at it at practice , fix it a bit , and then there 's always something new coming back .
You know , there 's never really been one specific thing that I just can't fix .
BSH : With the Flyers organization , you were drafted in the third round .
At the time , it was the highest the team had selected a goalie since 1999 .
Since then , they have drafted three more .
What makes you stand out among the many goalie prospects within the organization ?
De Serres : I do n't think I need to look at all the other guys .
I just have to focus on myself , play really well , and it will all take care of itself .
If I 'm playing well and stopping all the pucks , then that 's all that really matters .
BSH : Lastly , in doing the research about you , I came across an interview in which you listed your favorite television series as One Tree Hill .
Is that accurate , was it a joke , or is it a guilty pleasure ?
De Serres : ( Laughs ) I really do like that show .
I think it 's kind of a thing in Junior hockey , because I think , in Seattle and also in Brandon , half the guys love that show too .
Surprisingly , you 'd be amazed how many guys love that .
Not everyone may be able to admit it though . "
Thanks again to Derek , Matt , and Jacob for allowing this to happen .
Here 's the .mp3 if you want to listen .
Just forgive my awkwardness at the end .
De Serres Interview
It is one of four initiatives circulating that aim to legalize marijuana use .
The initiative would also allow cities and counties to adopt their own laws to allow marijuana to be grown and sold , and the localities could impose taxes on any aspect of marijuana production and sales .
It would make it legal for adults over 21 years old to possess up to an ounce of marijuana and to grow it in a 25 - square - foot area for personal use .
" It was so easy to get them , " Lee said .
" People were so eager to sign . "
The petition drive , which was run by a professional signature - gathering firm , collected more than 680,000 signatures , 57 % more than the 433,971 valid signatures needed to put it on the ballot , said Richard Lee , the measure 's main proponent .
Supporters of an initiative that would legalize marijuana in California say they have collected enough signatures to ensure that it will be on the November 2010 ballot .
Lee , who owns Coffeeshop Blue Sky , Oaksterdam University and other pot-related businesses , said he has spent at least $ 1.1 million so far to put the measure before California voters .
He said he expects the campaign to cost between $ 7 million and $ 20 million , depending on how much opponents spend .
He said he hopes to raise most of that from marijuana legalization supporters across the country and he has already set up an Internet fundraising operation .
" We feel like we 've done our part , " he said .
Polls have shown that a majority of California voters support legalization .
A Field Poll taken in mid-April found that 56 % of voters in the state and 60 % in Los Angeles County want to make legalize and tax pot as a way to help solve the state 's fiscal crisis .
In October , a poll taken by a nonpartisan firm for the Marijuana Policy Project found 54 % support in the county .
A poll taken for the initiative 's proponents by EMC Research , an opinion research firm in Seattle , found that 51 % of likely voters supported it based on language similar to what will be on the ballot , but support increased to 54 % when they were read a more general synopsis .
Some marijuana legalization advocates initially criticized Lee for moving forward with his measure , arguing that they would have a better chance in 2012 , a presidential election year .
" I think things have turned our way so much that we have a good chance of winning without having to wait to 2012 , " Lee said .
" This is the time to bring up the issue and talk about it .
Who knows what will be going on in 2012 ? "
Lee said that the increasing acceptance of medical marijuana has changed the political dynamic .
Since the Obama administration announced it would not prosecute medical marijuana providers or users who follow state law , hundreds of dispensaries have opened in California .
" Medical marijuana in California has been accepted as legalization in some ways by a lot of the population , " he said , noting the widespread awareness that it is easy to get a doctor 's recommendation to use it .
" To me this is codifying what it happening . "
Lee said he did not think that the backlash against dispensaries , which in many cases have flouted local laws by opening in neighborhoods , would have much effect on his campaign .
" It 's tough to say whether it 's more good or bad , " he said .
" On one hand , you have your bad apples , on the other hand , it shows the need for better regulation . "

Daniel Lieberman , PhD , a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard University , studies and periodically practices barefoot running .
His academic work focuses in part on how early man survived by evolving the ability to lope for long distances after prey , well before the advent of Nike shoes .
There “ is good evidence that humans have been running long distances for millions of years , ” he says , “ and most of that was probably done barefoot . ”
For his own part , “ I run a lot , ” he says , “ and at least once a week , I run about three to five miles on the streets of Cambridge , completely barefoot .
I can attest to the fact that it ’s a lot of fun . ”
Barefoot running recently has become as trendy as any millenia - old activity can be .
The bestselling new book “ Born to Run : A Hidden Tribe , Superathletes , and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen ” gave the movement legs , with its depiction of the Tarahumara Indians of Mexico striding effortlessly for hours without shoes or in lightweight sandals .
The book also quoted Lieberman extensively .
Today , you can find dozens of websites evangelizing for barefoot running , with proponents promising that it ’s a more ‘ natural ’ way to run , will reduce the chances of injury , and may well make you faster .
But is there persuasive scientific proof for the claims about the benefits of barefoot running ?
Read the scant available scientific literature and talk to the researchers who know the field best and it ’s clear that the answer , at least as of now , is ‘ no . ’
“ On the one hand , no one has yet published a study on whether barefoot running is better for you — the evidence is all anecdotal , ” Lieberman says .
“ On the other hand , no one has ever published a study showing that running shoes prevent injury . ”
Other researchers are more blunt .
“ The whole campaign ” of unshod running “ has gained a kind of cult following , with the science chasing it from behind , ” says Ross Tucker , PhD , a South African exercise physiologist and the author of the recently published book “ Runner ’s World : The Runner ’s Body . ”
A “ great deal of practical advice has been given out without a solid understanding of its implications , ” he says .
The practical advice has been especially loud around the issue of running injuries .
Barefoot proponents point to an article , published more than 20 years ago but widely quoted by barefoot runners , which showed that in Haiti , locals who wore shoes were more likely to wind up with leg injuries than those who ran barefoot .
They also note that the percentage of runners sidelined each year by an injury has remained steady , even as shoe companies have come out with supposedly more advanced , protective shoes .
But such arguments are , most experts say , specious .
“ There is no direct evidence that running shoes cause injury or that barefoot running reduces injury , ” says Benno Nigg , a professor of biomechanics at the University of Calgary and a well - respected footwear researcher .
As for the anecdotal evidence , it ’s mostly flimsy or flawed , he says .
The article about Haitians , for instance , did not account for the fact that shoeless runners , most of whom were poor , probably would n’t go to the doctor if they were injured .
So , too , looking at the percentages of runners injured over the years is unhelpful , Tucker says , since not only has shoe technology changed , so have runners .
“ In the 1970s , the only guys who ran seriously were lightweight , efficient , built - to - last individuals , ” he says .
“ Now , because of the running boom , you get all sorts running — overweight , leg length discrepancies , muscle weaknesses ” and so on .
“ The fact that these people can run at all is amazing , so when 40 percent of them get injuries , perhaps we should n’t be surprised . ”
No one doubts , however , that tossing off your shoes and running with free and naked feet changes how you run .
According to biomechanics studies by Nigg and others , barefoot runners tend to strike the ground further up on the foot .
In shoes , most people are heel strikers ; the back of their foot contacts the ground first .
Barefoot runners , Nigg and other say , strike the ground closer to the front of the foot , near the toes , and are in contact with the ground for less time .
Does that matter ?
“ Not really , ” Nigg says .
Although many people believe that striking the ground closer to the front of the foot makes you faster , the evidence does n’t support that idea .
In one of the few studies to capture foot strike positions among elite runners in action , researchers at the 2004 Sapporo International Half Marathon in Japan photographed 283 runners about midway through the race .
Seventy - five percent of the racers were landing on their heels .
Another 24 percent landed at about mid-foot , meaning near the arch of their shoe .
Only four of the 283 runners landed on their forefeet , and they were n’t the four fastest .
The debate about whether barefoot running is somehow better underestimates the main player in the whole argument .
“ The body is quite smart and adaptable , ” Nigg says .
In complex biomechanics studies that he ’s undertaken recently in his laboratory , he ’s found that people ’s leg muscles adjust , rather smoothly , to changes in their footwear .
If you run barefoot and land near the front of your foot , he says , the impact moves up your leg along a different pathway than if you wear shoes .
But your body can sense that difference , he says , and , as a result , different muscles fire , while other relax — without any conscious volition on your part — and the overall impact on the leg ’s various tissues remains about the same .
A study published last year in the British Journal of Sports Medicine reinforces Nigg ’s findings .
In it , researchers from the University of Texas at El Paso studied what happens to landing patterns as runners ’ shoes wear out and flatten , becoming more barefoot - like .
They found that , after 200 miles of training , even as “ shoe cushioning capability decreases , runners modify their patterns to maintain constant external loads . ”
“ The body learns very quickly to compensate , ” he says .
So , Nigg concludes , if you like your shoes , “ stick with them . ”
If you want to try running barefoot , Ross Tucker says , be judicious .
“ Many years of wearing shoes condition the muscle , tendons , and skeleton and a sudden shift to barefoot running ” could , at least in the short term , be painful , he says .
Start by running barefoot perhaps once a week , he suggests .
That remains Lieberman ’s approach .
“ I disagree with the notion that somehow modern runners are biomechanically disadvantaged and require fancy , expensive shoes , ” the evolutionist says .
“ But I also reject the notion that we should return to life in the Stone Age .
If you want to wear shoes , that ’s fine , but if you want to try barefoot or in a minimal shoe running , you might really enjoy it . ”

In the quest to produce nuclear fusion energy , researchers from the DIII - D National Fusion Facility have recently confirmed long - standing theoretical predictions that performance , efficiency and reliability are simultaneously obtained in tokamaks , the leading magnetic confinement fusion device , operating at their performance limits .
Experiments designed to test these predictions have successfully demonstrated the interaction of these conditions .
These new findings will be presented at the American Physical Society -- Division of Plasma Physics 51st annual meeting , November 2 - 6 , at the Atlanta Hyatt Regency Hotel .
Nuclear fusion energy has kept the sun burning for billions of years .
When nuclear fusion occurs in a laboratory , power performance is determined by the temperature and density achieved by plasma , an ionized gas formed when hydrogen isotopes are heated to temperatures of over 10 million degrees Celsius .
Because of these extreme temperatures , the hot plasma is confined by magnetic fields in a " tokamak " , a donut - shaped device surrounded by powerful electromagnets .
Over the past decade , scientists have made tremendous progress toward realizing high pressures for increasingly long periods .
A key element of recent experiments is the confirmation of theoretical predictions that one can rely on the walls of the tokamak chamber to improve plasma stability at high pressure .
Once plasma becomes sufficiently hot and dense , fusion occurs , producing large quantities of high - energy helium ions ( known as alpha particles ) .
For optimal efficiency , this self - generated heat must be well contained within the tokamak 's " magnetic bottle . "
Models have predicted that the heat loss from the tokamak due to turbulence is quite sensitive to the exact details of the magnetic field configurations .
Researchers recently found that turbulence is minimized in the same configuration necessary for achieving the highest pressures .
Hence , performance and efficiency can be synergistic .
Interestingly , turbulent eddies in the plasma can also affect plasma heating by high - energy helium nuclei formed by the fusion of hydrogen atoms .
Recent theoretical work suggests that these energetic particles not only feel turbulence differently , but can also stir up large eddies of their own .
While these fine - scale turbulent eddies are predicted to cause negligibly small transport of energetic alpha particles , the new large eddies can increase this transport substantially .
As the alpha particles cool , their transport becomes similar to the background level .
For high reliability , a tokamak needs to sustain the hot and dense plasma for as long as possible .
Recent work has shown that tokamak plasmas can be induced to exhibit the following relationships : higher pressure => more self - generated electrical currents that help control the plasma => less reliance on external controls => longer pulse ( including potentially steady - state ) operation => higher reliability .
After decades of effort to improve the behavior and output of fusion plasmas , scientists are discovering that nature may actually be so kind as to simultaneously allow high performance ( lots of electricity ! ) , optimal efficiency ( affordable ! ) , and high reliability ( the electrical outlet will always work ! ) in the design of future power plants .

The apocalypse is not scheduled for December 21 , 2012 , according to NASA .
Scientists at the US space agency are taking an unusual swipe at doomsday crackpottery this week in an online campaign designed to address fears fueled by the end of a cycle in the ancient Mayan calendar , a Hollywood movie , and a fresh wave of pseudo - science wankers .
" Nothing bad will happen to the Earth in 2012 , " NASA states * in a new FAQ web page set up for the occasion .
" Our planet has been getting along just fine for more than 4 billion years , and credible scientists know of no threat associated with 2012 . "
The space boffins are taking aim at a popular end - of - days scenario given credence on various center - justified websites ( the crazy man 's calling card ) that a planet called Nibiru or Planet X will collide with Earth during the 2012 holiday season , wreaking havoc and devastation on an unparalleled scale .
The story goes that NASA has been secretly tracking this rogue planet since 1983 but has suppressed all news of its existence across the world in the name of " global security . "
NASA says this tale is factually untrue .
Of course , that 's just what you 'd expect them to say ...
" The story started with claims that Nibiru , a supposed planet discovered by the Sumerians , is headed toward Earth , " NASA said .
" This catastrophe was initially predicted for May 2003 , but when nothing happened the doomsday date was moved forward to December 2012 . "
The December date was fingered because it coincides with the end of end of the Mayan long - count calendar at the winter solstice in 2012 , which already has a doomsday following .
It 's further pumped by an upcoming Hollywood disaster flick based on global destruction in 2012 .
NASA calls such tales of Nibiru and other hushed - up wayward planets nothing more than an " internet hoax . "
" There is no factual basis for these claims , If Nibiru or Planet X were real and headed for an encounter with the Earth in 2012 , astronomers would have been tracking it for at least the past decade , and it would be visible by now to the naked eye .
Obviously , it does not exist . "
NASA also rejects the " polar shift theory " for the date , where the Earth 's crust makes a 180 - degree rotation around the core in a matter of days or hours .
" A reversal in the rotation of Earth is impossible .
There are slow movements of the continents ( for example Antarctica was near the equator hundreds of millions of years ago ) , but that is irrelevant to claims of reversal of the rotational poles , " NASA said .
It claims that many of the disaster websites " pull a bait - and - shift to fool people , " claiming there 's relationship between the rotation of the magnetic polarity of Earth ( which does change irregularly ) with a magnetic reversal ( which occurs once every 400,000 years or so ) .
" As far as we know , such a magnetic reversal does n't cause any harm to life on Earth , " NASA said .
" A magnetic reversal is very unlikely to happen in the next few millennia , anyway . "
The space agency furthermore dismisses that its hiding news of any massive meteors making a touch - down on Earth , saying NEO Program Office website keeps a record of any discoveries for public viewing .
" For any claims of disaster or dramatic changes in 2012 , where is the science ?
Where is the evidence ?
There is none , and for all the fictional assertions , whether they are made in books , movies , documentaries or over the internet , we can not change that simple fact .
There is no credible evidence for any of the assertions made in support of unusual events taking place in December 2012 , " NASA said .
But then , if Quetzalcoatl does rise from the ruins to destroy us all , nobody will be left to say " I told you so . "
They 'll win either way .
You can catch additional 2012 doomsday skepticism from NASA here . ®
* That statement does seem a tad far - reaching , though .
But maybe we 're too literal .
A leading astrophysicist who has worked on space missions claims that he and his colleagues are in contact with extraterrestrials who are " living among us . "
And they do n't like what they see .
Latchezar Filipov , head of the Space Research Institute at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences , is causing global ripples after researching crop circles around the world .
" We sent ( the aliens ) 30 questions about global problems , " said Filipov , who was vague about how he actually conveyed the queries .
" And now we have some answers . "
The " answers " came in the form of pictograms in crop circles .
Filipov says the aliens are here , observing us , but unobservable by us for some reason .
" I feel that ... some kind of information is being taught , that they 'd like to be in contact with us , " Filipov said Friday in halting English from his office in Sofia .
Filipov asked the aliens about the SETI , the broad umbrella project searching for alien life , and the supposed end of the world in 2012 , when the Mayan calendar expires .
He told the Star that the aliens have told him SETI does n't work , owing to a confusion about communication through " magnetic fields . "
They also said there is some truth in the 2012 predictions , having something to do with volcanoes in Mexico .
Further , more prosaic revelations include that the aliens are angry about global warming , disagree with in - vitro fertilization and do n't like cosmetics .
Apparently , Filipov 's aliens are grumpy Republicans .
This work is only beginning , Filipov cautioned , and he is still open to the fact that he could be mistaken – " I do n't yet believe that this is absolutely true information . "
Filipov is no garden - variety crank .
He sports an impressive CV : graduate work at Moscow State University , a variety of high - level positions studying astrophysics , work on a MIR spacecraft mission .
However , his latest preoccupation has caught his international contemporaries by surprise .
" I 'm not aware of this work , " said Ian Corbett , general secretary of the executive committee of the Paris - based International Astronomical Union .
" But it is very hard to take seriously . "
The IAU website shows Filipov as an active member .
Filipov 's colleagues inside Bulgaria are more peevish .
There is a move afoot to force his resignation from the Space Research Institute .

" In Bulgaria now , we have a very strange reaction to my research , " Filipov said .
" The people in Bulgaria are frightened , they do n't understand this .
" You must understand that this is a very complicated situation . "
Borrowers will face mortgage affordability tests under plans for " more intrusive " regulation of the sector proposed by the City watchdog today .
The Financial Services Authority is also calling for a ban on self - certification mortgages and loans which combine high - risk lending characteristics .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The regulator also wants to bring buy - to - let lending and second - charge mortgages , which enable people to take out loans secured on their property , under its scope .
The FSA said the measures were part of a shift to a " more intrusive and interventionist " style of regulation .
But its chief executive Hector Sants admitted the move would mean some people who were able to obtain mortgages during the boom years would no longer be able to do so .
Under the proposals , lenders would be ultimately responsible for assessing a consumer 's ability to repay their loan , taking into account their monthly disposable income .
There would also be a ban on mortgages that contained " toxic combinations " , such as lending a high proportion of a property 's value to people with impaired credit histories .
But the regulator stopped short of putting forward an outright ban on mortgages with high loan - to - value ratios or ones which lent high multiples of borrowers ' income .
It said this would be a " blunt approach " for tackling the problems in the mortgage market , while there was no evidence that borrowers taking on a mortgage with only one of these characteristics suffered higher levels of arrears .
However , it warned that it had not ruled out imposing caps if its initial proposals did not have sufficient effect on the market .
Firms will also have to verify all borrowers ' income , under the proposals , putting an end to both self - certification mortgages , which were aimed at self - employed people with irregular incomes , and fast - track mortgages , under which people did not have to prove their income .
Self - certification mortgages were initially introduced as a niche product , but at their peak during the lending boom they accounted for just under half of all advances .
However , the proposed ban is likely to have only a limited impact on the market , as the majority of lenders have withdrawn from the sector since the credit crunch struck , and there is currently only one firm offering the deals .
The review of the mortgage market comes after the FSA blamed the rapid expansion of mortgage lending in the UK for being a key factor in triggering the current financial crisis .
Tighter controls on lending practices should also help the housing market avoid the booms and busts seen in the past , when lax lending practices helped to inflate house prices .
Britons currently owe £ 1.23 trillion in mortgage debt , with mortgage lending accounting for 70 % of all credit .
At the height of the mortgage boom there were more than 15,000 different mortgage products available , including a vast range of products for people with impaired credit histories and those unable to prove their income .
Mr Sants told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " In the past , the prevailing regulatory philosophy - and one the FSA was operating - was definitely based on the idea that banks would behave properly and not put themselves at risk and not put consumers at risk .
" We just have to recognise that both firms and consumers do n't always make the best decisions .
" They do n't always act in their best interests or indeed in the collective interest of society , so we need a new approach to regulation , which is what the FSA is carrying through . "
But any changes to mortgage regulation are not expected to be introduced quickly , as firms have until January 30 to comment on the proposals , with an FSA feedback statement due in March , which could be followed by further consultation papers .
The regulator said it would be publishing specific proposals toughening up the rules on the way firms handled customers who were in arrears in January .
But it said these would include a ban on administrative charges for borrowers who were on a repayment plan to ensure that firms did not profit from people in arrears .
It added that five mortgage firms had been referred to enforcement for the way they handled people who have fallen behind with their mortgage and for levying excessive arrears charges .
The FSA 's proposals received a broad welcome from the mortgage industry , charities and consumer groups .
But there were concerns about how the measures would be implemented , and the impact of a ban on self - certified mortgages on people who were self - employed and had irregular incomes .
Paul Broadhead , head of mortgage policy at the Building Societies Association , said : " While much of the detail in the paper is sensible , we have significant reservations about the possible unintended consequences of some of the ideas expressed .
" We need a sensible balance between appropriate regulation and allowing people to buy their own home when they can afford to do so . "
Consumer groups also called for the changes to be introduced as quickly as possible to protect consumers from over - borrowing .
Peter Vicary - Smith , chief executive of consumer group Which ? , said : " We 're pleased that the FSA is looking to take a more robust approach to regulating the mortgage market , although we would like to see tougher measures such as a ban on mortgages over 100 % and the naming of lenders that mistreat their customers .
" Mortgage providers are already responsible for assessing affordability , so why is the FSA only getting tough on it now ?
Many borrowers are suffering the consequences of irresponsible lending . "
The National Landlords Association expressed concern that the regulation of buy - to - let mortgages would mean increases in the costs of borrowing for landlords .
It said that although increased protection for smaller , less experienced landlords may be welcome , professional landlords who treated their lettings as a business did not require the same level of protection .
Peter Bolton King , chief executive of the National Association of Estate Agents , said : " Much of the extreme lending being done pre the credit crunch , was clearly not sensible .
" However , with the market picking up alongside a shortage of lending we need to be careful not to deter consumers nor give banks an excuse not to lend money .
" We are unsure on how these new procedures will roll out , yet in light of the demise of the stamp duty holiday and the inevitable rise in VAT we must take a sensible interpretation of these guidelines and find the right balance .
" If these guidelines take us to the opposite end of the spectrum they could do untold damage to the housing market , which is currently showing promising signs of recovery . "
Atlanta , Georgia ( CNN ) --
A suburban Atlanta high school teacher has been accused of pursuing a " hit " on a 16 - year - old student last month , and the case is under investigation by local authorities .
Randolph Forde -- who teaches at Mundy 's Mill High School in Clayton County -- has been charged with making terroristic threats and was released on bond .
He is currently on administrative leave from his job with pay and faces an employment hearing in early December , Charles White , a school district spokesman , said Tuesday .
A Clayton County Police report says the incident occurred October 9 .
The suspect took a student off a school bus and told him he " would pay him to kill the victim , " the report says .
When the student asked who the target would be , the suspect said he'd write the name on a note , it says .
" The teacher held a piece of paper up with the victim 's name on it , " said Officer Otis Willis III of the Clayton police .
Attorney Terance Madden , who represents alleged target and his family , issued a statement saying that problems between the boy and the teacher go back to " on or about September 29 , " when " Forde allegedly called my client outside the class and asked him if he is gay . "
Then " on or about September 30 , " the two had an argument in class and Forde threatened " to hit him in his ' effin mouth , " Madden 's statement said .
" Not only did my client report the verbal altercation and verbal threat to the vice principal of Mundy 's Mill HS , he also reported that Mr. Forde asked him outside the classroom for the inappropriate question of whether he was gay , " the statement said .
" Apparently nothing was done by the school administration to either Mr. Forde or my client , because Mr. Forde was back in the classroom on October 1 , as was my client . "
Madden said the school did n't take any action until after a police report was filed on October 12 about the incident .
" This forced my client 's mother to have to remove my client from the high school , depriving him of his education because of fear for my client 's safety at Mundy 's Mill HS , " Madden said in the statement .
" Finally Mr. Forde was allegedly removed from the school after the police report was filed and my client was able to return to school .
An arrest was made on or about Oct. 14 .
Mr. Forde bonded out on $ 10,000 bond and waived his preliminary hearing , " Madden said .
Charles
White , the school district 's spokesman , said the district had no comment on the allegations because the issue is a personnel matter and is under review .
He said it would be " inappropriate " for the district to release any information about the case .
" Attorneys can say anything they want , " he said , but he added that " there are definitely multiple sides to any story . "
Forde 's attorney initially could not be reached by CNN .
The attorney was quoted by CNN affiliate WSB - TV as saying that Forde had been joking and did n't supply a name to anybody .
White says there was to be an employment hearing Tuesday , but it had to be postponed because there had to be proper prior notice of a scheduled session under the state 's open meetings law .
District officials are aiming for a hearing in early December , he said .
Madden calls the school district 's reason for the postponement " bunk " and said it " does n't even pass the smell test . "
He said the hearing was postponed because media coverage about the case had begun .
The most powerful supercomputer in the world , the Cray XT5 – aka ' Jaguar ' – is a computing monster with the ability to clock 1.759 petaflops ( 1,759 trillion calculations per second ) .
So just what exactly is inside this machine ?
About 37,376 AMD processors , to begin with .
The Jaguar has 255,584 processing cores and is built using AMD six - core Istanbul Opteron chips running at 2.6 gigahertz .
That 's a step up from the four - core AMD chips that the computer used to have .
" The most interesting thing about the Jaguar is that they have actually upgraded an existing supercomputer , " says John Fruehe , director of Opteron product marketing for AMD .
" And they have managed to double its speed . "
Engineers replaced quad - core AMD processors with six - core chips ( see below for a video showing the upgrade process ) .
The nearly $ 20 million upgrade has created a high - performance computing system that is now deployed by the Department of Energy and housed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory .
Jaguar beat IBM's " Roadrunner " supercomputer to the top list , according to a ranking of the top 500 supercomputers in the world that will be unveiled Tuesday at a conference .
What will the world 's fastest supercomputer be used for ?
Check out Wired Science for more about how the supercomputer shatters the nuke simulator ’s speed record
The Jaguar has a system memory of 362 terabytes , which is almost three times that of the second largest system .
It can read and write files at 284 gigabytes per second and uses a 10 - petabyte shared file system .
Most of those components remain unchanged from the earlier versions of Jaguar .
" That 's the beauty of Cray 's architecture , " says Fruehe .
" Nothing else needs to be replaced . "
Upgrading the 37,376 processors inside the Jaguar took just about a week , explains Fruehe .
Eight chips are housed on a board along with heat sinks .
Once the heat sinks are removed , the processors are unclipped and the upgraded chips are fit in .
" It takes about five minutes to upgrade each board , " says Fruehe of the 4670 boards that the system has .
" The boards are mounted in individual cabinets and they take sections offline to upgrade them . "
AMD shipped out the first batch of six - core processors in June .
To see the process up , close and personal , check out a video that shows a Cray technician upgrading the Kraken , another Cray XT5 system .
The Kraken currently ranks third on the top 500 supercomputers list .
AMD says it will offer the first eight - core and 12 - core x86 processors for high performance computers early next year .

I have dealt with Matt for a few years for a couple of matters for myself and for my mother - in - law .
Matt has always been a man of his word ; anything he said he would do was done as expected .
He provided timely and accurate advice when requested .
Matt never pushed services that were not required and at certain times he recommended less costly services that would achieve the same results .
I highly recommend him as very honest and ethical .
He always disclosed fees in advance and there were never any " surprise " fees .

John McCain says his close friends Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham are ' going nowhere ' on climate change bill .
McCain slams ' horrendous ' climate bill
Sens . Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman have been working overtime to craft a climate bill that can attract significant GOP support .
But they are n’t exactly scoring points with their mutual best friend in the Senate , John McCain .
“ Their start has been horrendous , ” McCain said Thursday .
“ Obviously , they ’re going nowhere . ”

McCain has emerged as a vocal opponent of the climate bill — a major reversal for the self - proclaimed maverick who once made defying his party on global warming a signature issue of his career .
Now the Arizona Republican is more likely to repeat GOP talking points on cap and trade than to help usher the bill through the thorny politics of the Senate .
McCain refers to the bill as “ cap and tax , ” calls the climate legislation that passed the House in June “ a 1,400 - page monstrosity ” and dismisses a cap - and - trade proposal included in the White House budget as “ a government slush fund . ”
Former aides are mystified by what they see as a retreat on the issue , given McCain ’s long history of leadership on climate legislation .
McCain and Lieberman authored their first climate bill in 2003 and reintroduced the legislation in 2005 and 2007 .
“ The only reason we are debating climate legislation in the Senate right now is because of the leadership he showed three Congresses ago , ” said Tim Profeta , a former staffer for the Connecticut independent on climate issues who is now a professor at Duke University .
“ I would n’t be here on this issue without him , ” said Graham , a South Carolina Republican who spent much of last fall campaigning for McCain .
“ He ’s the guy that introduced me to the climate problem . ”
McCain first began moving away from his support for cap and trade during his 2008 presidential campaign , when he insisted that reporters not describe the program as a “ mandatory ” cap on greenhouse gas emissions .
He also infuriated the environmental community by picking Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate and standing by as she questioned global warming science .
Lobbyists who ’ve met with McCain say he feels that the White House has failed to pour enough political capital into the issue for him to feel comfortable breaking with his party .
“ This really has n’t been done in a bipartisan fashion , ” said McCain spokesman Brooke Buchanan .
Current and former aides suggest that staff changes since the campaign could also have something to do with the change in tone .
Several of McCain ’s longtime staffers , including top aide Mark Salter , left the office after the campaign .
And Floyd DesChamps , a Commerce Committee aide who worked closely on the McCain - Lieberman climate bill , left Capitol Hill after McCain gave up his longtime seat on the committee last January .
The staff that remains , say former aides , lacks the institutional history on the issue and the ability to steer McCain toward productive solutions .
McCain aides dismissed the idea that those changes have had an effect on his position , saying that the senator — not the staff — drives policy positions .
Arizona politics could be another factor .
Republicans hope to use the cap - and - trade bill to attack Democrats on economic issues by saying it will raise electricity costs for businesses and spike electric bills .
Those attacks could resonate in Arizona , which has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
“ His view is probably [ that ] , in the middle of a recession , when we have 10 percent unemployment , [ it ] is not the time to be putting a huge new energy tax on our economy , ” said Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - Tenn . ) , who opposes an economy - wide cap - and - trade bill .
McCain says he is discussing the climate issue with Lieberman but does not see Sen.
John Kerry ( D - Mass. ) , who introduced a climate bill earlier this fall , or the Obama administration as willing to negotiate with him .
“ What they ’ve done so far is not only a nonstarter , but it ’s a contradiction to everything I ’ve tried to do on cap and trade , ” he said .
“ I see no support for what they are trying to do . ”
McCain has laid out a series of proposals that could help win his vote — but most likely at the cost of Democratic votes .
An ardent believer in free trade , McCain would like to strip a provision out of the legislation that would levy a border tax on imports from China , India and other developing countries if they do not sign on to an international climate treaty .
“ That ’s blatant protectionism ; that ’s insulting to everything I believe in , ” he said .
But dropping the border tax would lose votes from Rust Belt Democrats , who fear the legislation will hurt the manufacturing industry .
And he ’d like to open Nevada ’s Yucca Mountain as a repository for nuclear waste — a highly controversial issue that would inflame the climate debate .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) has spent decades lobbying against the project .
Earlier this year , the Obama administration stripped funding for the facility in its 2010 budget .
“ They ’re shutting down Yucca Mountain because of the power and influence of Sen. Reid , ” McCain said .
“ They can do that , but that does n’t mean that somehow they get me to agree to it . ”

CHERNOBYL , Ukraine–
The three babushkas clink shot glasses and toss back overproof vodka .
They are 75 , 80 and 81 years old , a trio of cackling crones who assure me – rheumy eyes crinkling with amusement – that vodka is the best antidote for radiation sickness .
They ought to know : Survivors of the worst nuclear accident in history – 400 times more radioactive fallout than the atomic bombing of Hiroshima – and living all these years since in the shadow of the sinister Chernobyl reactors , illegals in their own condemned homes .
The resettlers , they 're called , reverse migrants who defied the state to take up residence again in the crumbling cottages of " black villages " located within the 30 - km exclusion zone around Chernobyl , ground zero .
On their own , without a guest to impress , the ladies would be drinking samogon , a belly - burning moonshine made from fermented sugar , yeast and potatoes .
But for company , they break out the good stuff , served with platters of cheese , cold cuts and dark brown bread .
The meat is from slaughtered pigs that snuffle in earth still so infused with toxins that nothing grown in this soil is permitted to be sold outside the exclusion zone , even 23 years after an accident that remains the single Level 7 incident on the International Nuclear Event Scale .
Yet the cottage gardens are lush with fruits and vegetables and flowers ablaze with colour , almost monstrous in size and vividness .
For the locals , only mushrooms are considered too poisonous to be edible .
Well , maybe one or two in the soup pot is okay .
" In Ukraine , it is customary to have at least three glasses of vodka , " explains Valentina Kovtunko , setting her crutch aside to top everybody up for another round .
Olga Zahovna , who is stone - deaf , gasps when the visitor takes a stool at the corner of the kitchen table .
" No , no , single girls are not allowed to sit in the corner chair .
That means you will never marry . "
Perish the thought .
Maria Shovkuta takes the guest 's face in her clawlike hands and mumbles : " You remind me of someone , from long ago . "
They have little beyond their memories and yet they endure , surrounded by framed photographs of children and grandchildren on the wall – relatives who are allowed to visit only one day a year because of the continuing radioactivity – their connection to the outside world a bulky radio - phone provided by the state , a bus that comes once a week for shopping trips to the bazaar in the closest " clean " town , and , jarringly in this rustic home , the flat - screen TV purchased by Kovtunko 's daughter .
The ladies sit around it on most evenings to watch their favourite shows while they knit .
" My children lived in Pripyat but of course they left and did n't come back , " says Kovtunko , referring to the model town that the Soviets built to house workers at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant , now an eerie modern - day Pompeii overrun with foliage , a tangle of trees and underbrush choking the concrete and brick , as nature reclaims its territory .
" I'm not lonely , " insists Kovtunko , a former Chernobyl cleaning lady who was born nearby and moved into this house upon marriage .
" I have my friends and my garden .
There 's so much work to do .
I do n't have time to get bored . "
She looks fondly at her friends .
" We were young together . "
They are all widows .
Kovtunko's husband actually died before the nuclear accident and she was loathe to leave his grave untended , just one more reason for returning ; that , and her discomfort with the three - room high - rise flat outside Kyiv where authorities had placed her afterwards , a space shared with other evacuees .
" Oh , the noise !
I could n't sleep .
And we did n't even have a proper stove to cook on . "
Upwards of 400,000 Ukrainians from around Chernobyl were evacuated and relocated in the year after the accident .
Better to come back here , Kovtunko decided , after a year living away , reunited with about 80 other elderly citizens who likewise returned to this village , Opachichi , authorities relenting because the optics of forcibly removing stubborn old folks was even worse .
" I believe that it 's clean here , " continues Kovtunko .
" I do n't think we should have ever been made to leave .
Look at me – I 've never been sick a day . "
Officially , these villagers do n't even exist .
And only 14 of them are left – 13 women and one man – in Opachichi .
Another nearby black village has one sole occupant , a cranky sort who achieved fame when he met with Ukraine 's President Viktor Yushchenko and elicited a promise that he'd never be harassed by officials again .
What none of the Opachichi residents own is a dosimeter , the hand - held ticking Geiger counters that measure radioactivity .
" Bah , who needs it ? " scoffs Kovtunko .
" I 'm an old lady .
The radiation has n't killed me yet .
And when I die , that wo n't be the reason . "
Her fear , an illogical paranoia , is that authorities are eyeing the region with the idea of establishing a hunting and fishing preserve , since the ecology of this contaminated environment has sprung back of its own accord , a weird post - apocalyptic biosphere rife with undisturbed wildlife : boar and lynx , the white - tailed eagle ( a total newcomer ) , Przewalski horses , an estimated 300 wolves , birds and voles , mutantly large catfish in the Pripyat River .
Some of these species had not been seen for decades .
( The only " mutants " identified in Chernobyl lands have been barn swallows with partly albino faces instead of the species ' typical red chins . )
While hunting and fishing are forbidden , poachers are known to bag game and sell it to restaurants in Minsk and Kyiv .
The Ukrainian government designated the exclusion zone a wildlife sanctuary in 2000 , despite radiation levels up to 100 times higher than acceptable " background levels " in some hot spot locations , not all of them marked by diamond - shaped warning signs that loom like scarecrows .
A lethal exposure of radiation ranges from 300 to 500 roentgens an hour and levels around the exclusion zone vary from 15 to several hundred microroentgens .
( A microroentgen is one - millionth of a roentgen . )
The risk is in long - term exposure , which is why those who continue to work at Chernobyl – including the maintenance crew at the reactor plant , officially shut down in 2000 due to international pressure – are on two - week shifts , after which they must stay outside the zone for the following two weeks .
Most plant personnel live in Slavutych , built after the disaster some 50 kilometres away , arriving on a train that weaves back and forth across the Ukrainian / Belarusian border .
This district is alive with cesium , strontium , plutonium , ruthenium , hundreds of different isotopes no larger than a microdot , spewed into the atmosphere on April 26 , 1986 , the eruption of Reactor No. 4 caused by poor design combined with errors made by control room personnel during a testing procedure .
Further explosions sent a plume of highly radioactive fallout drifting over an extensive geographical area , 130,000 square kilometres contaminated to some extent .
The 12 square kilometres of evergreen woodlands that stood directly in the path of the deadliest debris immediately turned red and died .
That 's the " Red Forest , " of which only a small portion remains , the rest buried .
Two people were killed in the initial steam explosion .
According to a 2005 report by the Chernobyl Forum , 56 deaths were directly attributable to the event ( 47 accident workers and nine children with thyroid cancer ) .
The World Health Organization estimates some 4,000 subsequent deaths have occurred or will arise from it , from among 600,000 people most highly exposed to the radiation .
Greenpeace predicts an eventual death total of 93,000 .
Cancer rates around Chernobyl are unusually high , 65 times normal according to some reports .
Upwards of 4,400 Ukrainian children and adolescents have already undergone operations for thyroid cancer , the most common consequence of radiation .
In neighbouring Belarus , health officials say 20 per cent of the country 's 10 million people are suffering from radiation - linked ailments .
Nearly a quarter century later in this poisoned realm , the microscopic particles still adhere underfoot , which is why visitors are directed to avoid stepping on mossy patches of ground or brushing up against branches .
Because dust explodes with every step , Ukraine does n't allow any plowing or building in the zone either .
No burials have been permitted in the zone since the accident and the cemeteries that were already there are sinking into wildness – sad remnants of a lost civilization .
A heart - wrenching sight is a child 's grave decorated with Dinky cars , now overrun with weeds .
Before they knew what they were actually doing – the wrongness of it – officials ordered much of the zone plowed under , including entire villages within the 10 kilometre radius .
Equipment used in the massive cleanup operation was also interred – but not deeply – because it was too radioactive dirty to be brought out , though scavengers chopped up helicopters , trucks and construction vehicles for parts that were sold as far away as Moscow .
Decontamination , rain and the passage of time have washed off much of the radioactive grime that coated Chernobyl , though plutonium has a half - life of 25,000 years .
What did n't blow away has sunk into the soil , been absorbed by plants , in turn eaten by animals , and moved on up the food chain to be part of the biological continuum .

Yet this most blighted part of the planet is so very far from a dead zone these days .
With humans withdrawing , animals roam at will and the plant life is more dramatic , even if some trees have sprung strangely .
As one researcher put it : " Those trees have a terrible time knowing which way is up . "
Few predicted this kind of resurgence in so short a span of time .
It 's all still contaminated but it 's abundant in the absence of human habitation , reinforcing the belief that the greatest threat to nature is man .
Left to its own devices , nature finds a way to survive and thrive .
The debate about Chernobyl as Paradise Rediscovered is raging on the pages of scientific journals because the experts can't agree on what 's happening and why .
Biologist Robert Baker , of Texas Tech University , was among the first to report that Chernobyl had become a wildlife haven .
He has taken research teams to the region more than 30 times since the early 1990s .
" It 's a fascinating and gorgeous place , " Baker says in an interview .
" I refer to it as a kind of aquarium for animals and plant life .
" We 're of the opinion that there are , within both the 10 - km and 30 - km zones , more rats and mice and pigs and moose and horses and endangered species than there are outside of the zone .
It 's evident that human behaviour is more dangerous for that environment than radiation . "
An acute radiation dose , obviously , is lethal ; it kills off mammals with red blood cells .
" But a chronic low dose does n't have the same effect , " Baker notes , basing his view largely on mice and rodents that , he says , have shown a remarkable tolerance for elevated radiation levels .
This not only contradicts scientists , but is heresy to the wider constituency of doomsayers who oppose nuclear energy on the grounds it is a profound safety risk and intrinsically unsound ecologically .
Baker thinks organisms can cope with the destructive effects of radiation , at least to a point , after which the damage becomes irreparable and the species might die out , with domino impacts .
A strong argument was also made for nature in balance with radiation by journalist Mary Mycio in her authoritative book , Wormwood Forest : A Natural History of Chernobyl .
During her research , she made a complete U - turn on both the value of nuclear power and the assessment of Chernobyl .
" Contrary to the myths and imagery , Chernobyl 's lands had become a unique , new ecosystem , " she wrote .
" Defying the gloomiest predictions , it had come back to life as Europe 's largest nature sanctuary , teeming with wildlife .
Like the forests , fields and swamps of their unexpectedly inviting habitat , the animals are all radioactive .
To the astonishment of just about everyone , they are also thriving . "
A starkly different view is put forth by the likes of Timothy Mousseau , a Canadian - trained biologist at the University of South Carolina .
He has called Chernobyl a " sink , " where animals migrate because there are so few humans around but then struggle to build new populations , rapidly dying off .
A high proportion of the birds he and his colleagues examined suffer from radiation - induced sickness and genetic damage .
Mousseau 's study , published in March , said populations of bumblebees , butterflies , spiders , grasshoppers and other invertebrates were low in the most contaminated areas and barn swallows – only a third of which are reproducing – have a high rate of genetic abnormalities .
Scientists worry mutated birds will pass on their abnormal genes to the global population .
Mousseau has now started work on a long - term study of humans who live in the area , a study involving more than 11,000 adults and 2,000 children .
Back at Chernobyl , Reactor No. 4 is now buttressed and entombed in 10 storeys of lead - and - steel shielding , known as the sarcophagus , soon to be replaced with an even sturdier protective shell .
From the Bridge of Death – its clear sightlines drew residents to watch the fireworks the night of the accident , exposing them to an uninterrupted stream of radiation – plant workers now toss bread crumbs to giant catfish in the Pripyat River .
Near to the quartet of reactors is a spent fuel processing plant built by a French company and never used because control rods from the Chernobyl reactors do n't fit into the machinery .
Spent fuel is hot and there 's no safe way to get rid of it .
Close by , but a world away from all the controversy and conflicting research , the women of Opachichi get on with their small , tranquil lives , a very particular species that 's also dying off .
But then Kovtunko tells the story of Maria , the only child born in Chernobyl since the disaster , her parents the youngest of the returnees .
When the couple later divorced , Maria and her mother stayed put .
Now 12 years old , Maria lives at a boarding school outside Kyiv but comes back on weekends , happily visiting with elders , bringing a child 's laughter to these eerily quiet villages .
Says Kovtunko : " She belongs to all of us . "
A 71 - year - old grandmother has admitted assaulting a teenager after she poked him in the chest for throwing stones at her house .
Renate Bowling , who has osteoporosis , curvature of the spine and diabetes , was given a conditional discharge at Blackpool Magistrates ' Court .
She admitted assaulting the 17 - year - old outside her home in Thornton Cleveleys , but said she was " sick of abuse " .
The mother - of - three was also fined £ 50 for the offence .
Speaking after the hearing , Mrs Bowling expressed " disgust " at her prosecution .
' Many atrocities '
" I was treated like a criminal and thrown into the back of a police van , " she said .
" I have been terrorised for many months and I just can't take it anymore .
" I did not injure him , I had just had enough and I wanted to see who he was .
" Stones and rocks have been hurled at my windows , I have been called a German whore and I feel scared in my own home .
" My husband has passed away and I live alone , without my children and my grandchildren I would despair . "
The pensioner , who left Germany in 1945 , brought her family up in Lancashire .
" I have seen so many atrocities , dealt with so much pain .
I have brought up three strapping men who have fought for this country .
" I do not need this kind of abuse . "
Looks like our How to Make a Baby video has gone viral .
It ’s been on Boing Boing , Neatorama , Geekologie , Cartoon Brew , MSN.com , and about a zillion other blogs .
In the mainstream media , it ’s been on Canal Plus , Metro ( UK ) , Epoca , Glamour , and ESPN of all places .
As of today , our original video has been watched over 400,000 times .
( I ’m still trying to figure out how much popcorn that would mean if all those people had to go see it in a movie theater . )
Meanwhile , an unofficial copy on YouTube has garnered another quarter of a million views ( although for some reason my “ official ” YouTube copy has a scant 10,000 … go figure ! )
And I guess the lack of dialog gives the short some kind of global appeal , because it ’s been blogged in Catalan , Chinese , Croatian , Czech , Danish , Dutch , French , German , Hebrew , Hungarian , Italian , Japanese , Korean , Latvian , Lithuanian , Malay , Norwegian , Polish , Portuguese , Romanian , Russian , Spanish , Swedish , Thai , and Turkish .
Whew !
Here are some of the best comments I ’ve seen so far ( in English , anyway … )
“ The pope was right – condoms ARE useless .
Rubber gloves , however ! ”
“ Excellent !
I played it for my 5 year old daughter and her 5 year old cousin before they left for school .
I ’m sure it ’ll make for an interesting day for their teachers : ) ”
“ Scientifically inaccurate – fails to show the crucial contribution made by the stork . ”
“ Now that is dedication !
I ’m watching this on the set of a stop - motion film , and it certainly puts our long waiting times between takes into perspective . ”
“ Adoption is much easier and less stressful on the lungs / stomach . ”
“ That is exactly how my wife and I did it .
By the way , NEVER blow on two fingers at once .
Yep … twins ! ”
“ My girlfriend is inflatable , too .
God , I ’m so lonely . ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Sooner or later , office buildings and other commercial real estate financed during the credit bubble will generate hurricane - scale losses for banks .
Banks in recent years have been hammered by losses on home mortgages , buyouts and corporate defaults .
Now , lenders face big losses from loans backed by commercial real estate , where a stagnant economy will eventually take its toll , financial services executives told the Reuters Global Finance Summit .
“ The commercial real estate business still has not been marked down .
It ’s not been marked to market , ” Cantor Fitzgerald LP Chief Executive Howard Lutnick said .
“ The economy can ’t , in my opinion , grow fast enough that the tenants are going to go out and start hiring and growing and building and take up all these rents at $ 60 a foot .
It ’s nonsense . ”
U.S. banks held $ 1.65 trillion of commercial real estate loans on their balance sheets as of November 4 , according to the Federal Reserve .
Total assets were $ 11.8 trillion .
Yet banks have postponed their day of reckoning , extending loans in hopes the economy will improve and demand for space will rebound .
Banks have resisted selling assets , or taking them away from underwater borrowers , in fear of setting a new and lower market price .
It is a strategy neatly summarized as “ a rolling loan gathers no loss , ” Lutnick quipped .
Lutnick , whose firm is now building out a real estate restructuring business , noted the equity invested in almost every transaction during the peak bubble years of 2005 through early 2007 has been wiped out .
Lenders are under deep stress , because the value of their collateral has fallen .
FRIENDLY FED
But there is a limit to how long landlords can hold out for the old pre-recession rents .
And once one building is marked down to reflect lower rents , neighboring buildings also should fall in value .
Lutnick added most commercial loans come in the form of five - year balloon loans , so a wave of 2005 - vintage assets will test creditors next year .
“ When you ’re in the eye of the hurricane , it sure feels good until you look at the TV screen and then you say , ‘ look , the hurricane is all around you , ’” Lutnick said .
Banks do have a few things going in their favor .
Chief among them is a friendly Federal Reserve , whose policy of free money lets banks reap windfall lending profits .
" The Fed has pushed interest rates down to nothing .
The spreads on portfolios and securities are generating a huge amount of net interest income , " Broadpoint Gleacher Securities Group BPSG .O Chief Executive Lee Fensterstock said at the Summit .
" That will enable them to resolve some of their commercial real estate positions . "
The commercial real estate problem also pales in size next to the previous waves of mortgage , leveraged loan , credit card and other consumer loan losses .
FBR Capital Markets analyst Paul Miller , while generally negative on banks , on Wednesday played down the danger of commercial real estate losses .
“ There ’s a lot of structural forbearance built into the commercial real estate market , ” Miller said , meaning it is easier for borrowers to postpone and amend their terms .
Even so , the combination of poorly underwritten loans and a slowing economy will lead to many landlords walking away and handing over the keys .
Individual credits , meanwhile , are much larger .
“ There ’s going to be a lot of empty buildings coming back to banks ’ balance sheets , ” Miller said .
I have to admit , I ’ve never tasted lobster .
I ’ve been a vegetarian since I was 16 - years - old , and I grew up in the Midwest .
I do remember my dad bringing home live lobsters from Maine and watching them be boiled alive in our kitchen .
As a child , I wondered if this was humane and thus would not even taste the cooked lobster .
Now , a British entrepreneur has invented a new machine to kill lobsters via electrocution in an effort to be more humane .

Traditionally , live lobsters are cooked in boiling water for 15 minutes , although they die after three minutes .
If a dead lobster is boiled , the meat may not cook the whole way .
Steaming the lobster is an alternative cooking method , in which the lobster “ does not feel pain and will be dead in 10 seconds , ” according to lobsterhelp.com .
The site goes on to say :
One of the largest debates is whether or not a lobster can feel pain .
The answer is the brain of a lobster is about the same as a grasshopper , which is not complex enough to feel pain .
If you can kill a bug , than you should be able to kill a lobster .
Does the size of one ’s brain really determine whether pain is felt ?
Simon Buckhaven of Studham Technologies is concerned lobsters do feel pain , so he has invented the CrustaStun .
The Telegraph reports , “ The machine , which can also be used to kill crabs and other crustacea , can end a lobster ’s life in just 0.3 seconds , ” but even electrocution causes suffering .
According to Discovery News , shellfish do “ feel pain and stress ” and cite a study involving hermit crabs :
Elwood and Appel gave small electric shocks to some of the crabs within their shells .
When the researchers provided vacant shells , some crabs — but only the ones that had been shocked — left their old shells and entered the new ones , showing stress - related behaviors like grooming of the abdomen or rapping of the abdomen against the empty shell .
It was previously thought that a neocortex was needed to feel pain , but researchers believe shellfish have “ a suitable central nervous system and receptors . ”
They further explain lobsters can see without having a visual cortex like is needed for human vision .
Obviously , this vegetarian feels there is no humane way to kill a lobster , but I imagine a quick death is better than a slow one .
NEWTON , Massachusetts ( CNN ) -- For Laura Geraghty , April 1 , 2009 , started out just as any other day .
It was sunny but cool , she remembers .
Laura Geraghty was shocked 21 times before she came back from cardiac arrest with tales of the afterlife .
The mother of two , also a grandmother , was at her job , driving a school bus for the Newton Public School District in suburban Boston , Massachusetts .
Her passengers , special - needs children , were wheelchair - bound .
Seemingly in good health and in good spirits , Geraghty was finishing up her late - morning run , transporting a student and teacher back to Newton South High School , when she realized she was in trouble .
As she was pulling into the school parking lot , she began having sharp stomach pains .
She was able to park her bus , but she kept feeling worse .
The pain " went right up my arm and into my chest , and I said , ' Uh - oh , I 'm having a heart attack , ' " she said .
The teacher ran from the bus to get help .
Newton South 's nurse , Gail Kramer , and CPR instructor Michelle Coppola arrived moments later with the school 's new automated external defibrillator .
Geraghty , barely conscious , was fading fast .
She was weak and having trouble breathing .
And then she went into full cardiac arrest .
" Her eyes were wide , and all of a sudden she stopped talking to us , " Coppola said .
" I grabbed the two pads , stuck them on her , started it up , and I 'd say within 20 seconds , she had her first shock . "
Coppola and Kramer performed CPR while they waited for paramedics .
See an expert give a quick lesson in CPR »
At that point , Geraghty says , her body died .
She remembers watching the scene unfold -- as if from above .
" I floated right out of my body .
My body was here , and I just floated away .
I looked back at it once , and it was there . "
Geraghty says she saw deceased loved ones , her mother and her ex-husband .

" It was very peaceful and light and beautiful .
And I remember like , when you see someone you have n't seen in a while , you want to hug them , and I remember trying to reach out to my ex-husband , and he would not take my hand .
And then they floated away . "
Next , she says , she was overwhelmed by " massive energy , powerful , very powerful energy . "
" When that was happening , there were pictures of my son and my daughter and my granddaughter , and every second , their pictures flashed in my mind , and then I came back . "
What Geraghty had was a near - death experience , fairly common in people who go into sudden cardiac arrest .
Geraghty was down for 57 minutes .
No blood pressure , no pulse , no oxygen , no blood flow .
She was shocked 21 times before she finally came back with tales of the afterlife .
According to the Near Death Experience Research Foundation , nearly 800 near - death experiences happen every day in the United States .
Dr. Kevin Nelson , a neurologist in Lexington , Kentucky , studies near - death experiences and says they 're not imagined .
The explanation , he says , lies in the brain itself .
" These are real experiences .
And they 're experiences that happen at a time of medical crisis and danger , " Nelson said .
Humans have a lot of reflexes that help keep us alive , part of the " fight or flight " response that arises when we 're confronted with danger .
Nelson thinks that near - death experiences are part of the dream mechanism and that the person having the experience is in a REM , or " rapid eye movement , " state .
" Part of our ' fight or flight ' reflexes to keep us alive includes the switch into the REM state of consciousness , " he said .
During REM sleep , there is increased brain activity and visual stimulation .
Intense dreaming occurs as a result .
And the bright light so many people claim to see ?
" The activation of the visual system caused by REM is causing the bright lights , " Nelson said .
And the tunnel people speak of , he says , is lack of blood flow to the eye .
" The eye , the retina of the eye , is one of the most exquisitely sensitive tissues to a loss of blood flow .
So when blood flow does not reach the eye , vision fails , and darkness ensues from the periphery to the center .
And that is very likely causing the tunnel effect . "
Nelson is doing studies now to prove that the same effect results from fainting .
" The most common cause of near - death experience in my research group is fainting .
Upwards of 100 million Americans have fainted .
That means probably tens of millions of Americans have had these unusual experiences . "
But Geraghty says this was no dream .
" I know I went someplace else .
I know I went someplace else other than here . "
Dr. Bill O'Callahan , the emergency room doctor who shocked her back to life , agrees .
" Cynics out there would say and agnostics would say that 's phenomenon that comes from a dying brain .
I think that 's hogwash .
I firmly believe that people experience these events . "
Cheating Death : Back from the dead
Bob Schriever , co-founder of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Association , was refereeing a high school football game seven years ago when he went into cardiac arrest , died and was revived .
He , too , questions the dream explanation .
" Why are so many people dreaming the same thing ?
How can so many people , and there 's hundreds of thousands of people who have experienced this , how can we all be dreaming the same thing and describe the exact same thing ? "
Schriever says these experiences are so profound that only someone who has gone through them can truly understand .
Seven years later , he is still consumed with his own near - death experience .
" I think about that every morning when I wake up , first thing , during the day , I do n't know how many times and every night before I fall asleep .
I think about that .
People do not understand or appreciate what we go through . "
Scientist uses poison gas to suspend life
For Geraghty , it 's a daily struggle to put the pieces back together again .
" I 've been someplace that not everybody can go , and there 's not a lot of people you can sit down and have that conversation with , " Geraghty said .
" My own daughter tells me , ' It 's freaky , Mom . '
I 've literally lost friends over this the minute they hear it . "
Tweet your own experience and you could win a copy of " Cheating Death "
Geraghty says she became depressed once she left the hospital because her perspective on her entire life changed .
She still gets depressed , she says , and is on medication .
" I actually went to my doctor and said to her , ' I think I 'm losing my mind .
This can't be really happening , ' you know , and she said it 's OK , it 's very hard to understand when you 've been through an experience like that . "
Geraghty has joined the cardiac arrest group , hoping that connecting with others who understand what she 's been through will allow her to come to terms with what happened to her that cool spring day six months ago .
And allow her to heal and move on .
MADISON -- A Holmdel man was charged with driving while intoxicated after police found him lying on the grass near his parked car , police said today .
Devin R. McQuade , 23 , was also charged with careless driving , Madison police spokesman Lt. Darren Dachisen said .
Officer Paul Papamarkos was on patrol around 4:15 a.m. Friday when he found McQuade 's car parked on Loantaka Way , near a walking path .
As he was checking out the vehicle , a 9 - 1 - 1 caller reported a man lying in the grass a short distance away .
After a brief search , Papamarkos found McQuade lying on his face in the grass .
He was found to be highly intoxicated and arrested , Dachisen said .
The driver was later released pending a court appearance .
The incompetence of American diplomacy reached a new nadir yesterday in an incident vershadowed by the elections in the US .
Hillary Clinton told Al - Jazeera in an interview that the US wants to see an Israeli capital in East Jerusalem .
Apparently , the chief diplomat of the United States and the woman who ran on her experience in foreign affairs did not remember that East Jerusalem is primarily Palestinian :
Egypt and other Arab nations reacted with strong concern to remarks Clinton made in Jerusalem on Saturday .
She caused a stir when she said with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at her side that his government ’s offer to restrain — but not stop — settlement activity in Palestinian areas was unprecedented .
And in a new twist Tuesday , Clinton made what appeared to be an inadvertent slip of the tongue in a television interview with the al - Jazeera network , referring to the goal of “ an Israeli capital in east Jerusalem . ”
It has not been U.S. policy to favor including east Jerusalem in an Israeli capital ; the Palestinians claim it as their capital , and the issue is one of the most important and delicate points that would have to be settled in any final peace deal between the two parties .
Two Clinton aides monitoring the interview alerted her to the mistake and that portion of the interview was retaped so she could correct herself .
Anyone who has bothered to read the newspapers on Israel knows that East Jerusalem is part of the disputed territory .
While American Presidents have talked for decades about Jerusalem as the capital of Israel , not one has insisted on East Jerusalem .
It ’s so incompetent that one has to wonder if Hillary has any real understanding of the conflict at all .
There are some who think that Hillary could disconnect herself from a bumbling Obama administration and make a credible run at the Democratic nomination in 2012 .
Unfortunately , Hillary herself has been a large part of the bumbling of this White House .
She has been an embarrassment on the world stage , with the “ reset ” button for Russia that was mistranslated , and written in Latin characters rather than Cyrillic , intended as a stunt to insult the outgoing Bush administration .
There was also Hillary ’s highly undiplomatic opinion offered publicly that European democracy was incomprehensible , as well as a Johnny - come - lately compared to the US , which shows an ignorance of history as well as diplomacy .
Just another example of “ smart power . ”
On Steam , with numerous PC - centric features
Gearbox 's post - apocalyptic FPS - ARPG Borderlands is coming to town at the end of October .
The game will be making an appearance on the PC , Xbox 360 , and the PS3 .
Fans of downloading their game instead of buying it will be happy to hear that the PC version has now been confirmed to be coming to Steam -- so says Gearbox 's Twitter .
All too often , when games get simultaneously released for consoles and the PC , the three versions of the game are virtually the same .
It is a fairly common thing , for example , to see menus in the PC version of the game instructing you to hit ' B ' or ' X ' to select something .
But Gearbox has made some recent comments outlining features showing a strong PC - focus .
For starters , you 'll be able to export any images of your sweet looking gear into a JPG file .
So now bragging is easier than ever .
Borderlands PC will also have a built - in time demo feature , that can be used for benchmarking -- which is great news , for people like myself , who benchmark video cards .
And finally , the game 's UI will be designed with the mouse in mind , for PC players .
The inventory system should be a little bit easier to navigate with a mouse , instead of console controls .
Borderlands is coming October 20th for the Xbox 360 and PS3 , and on the 26th for the PC .
I was very excited last week to learn that WordPress has been awarded the Overall Best Open Source CMS Award in the 2009 Open Source CMS Awards .
This is a landmark for us , as it is the first time we ’ve won this award , and it marks a shift in the public perception of WordPress , from blog software to full - featured CMS .
No small contest , the Open Source CMS Awards received over 12,000 nominations and more than 23,000 votes across five categories .
As Hiro Nakamura said when he first bent time and space to land in Times Square : “ Yatta ! ”
In addition to winning in the Overall Best Open Source CMS category , WordPress was named first runner - up in the Best Open Source PHP CMS category .
This is significant because we were n’t even in the top 5 last year , and now we ’re # 2 , ahead of Joomla !
As is stated on the Award site , “ WordPress made its way into the top five for the first time .
The fact that it was outranked by Drupal by a very slight margin indicates how popular it has become with users as well as developers over the past year . ”
Every day thousands of new people are embracing WordPress to power not just their blogs but entire sites and communities without compromising on usability or scalability ( as would be the case with a legacy CMS ) .
Every member of the WordPress community , from core developer to beginning user , should be proud to be part of this momentum : congratulations to us all !

In the post - war decades , the hegemony of cow juice went unchallenged .
In an aptly bovine manner we drank from the cup provided by the Milk Marketing Board and others , drinking in the stuff about calcium gain and nutrients .
Then came the backlash .
An article by Anne Karpf in 2003 started with the immortal line " Does God 's own PR company handle the account for milk ? " , before exposing alleged trumped - up health benefits , allergies , intolerances and animal exploitation .
But is the sacred cow now returning in a greener colour ?
Last week there was much celebrating of the fact that dairy farmers are well on the way to meeting the goals of the Milk Roadmap l and even ahead of environmental targets for 2010 .
Then Dairy UK announced it is chumming up with the Carbon Trust so that in no time at all you 'll be able to buy a pint with a carbon footprint label on the bottle .
Actually it feels good to give this industry praise for a change , given that it's as if the word " beleaguered " was invented to precede " dairy farmer " .
Despite various initiatives to raise farm gate milk prices , they remain at around 1983 levels .
A few months ago the independent milk co-op , the Dairy Farmers of Britain , filed for administration .
Farmers are still leaving the industry , milk production is declining , the national herd is shrinking .
Why should this bother me ?
Because I live in fear of being left reliant on disgusting UHT milk .
A now - forgotten government proposal from 2007 suggested that 90 % of fresh milk production switch to UHT in the name of fewer emissions .
Despite the fact that UHT is an acronym for Ultra Heat Treated , the energy expended during this treatment is nothing compared to the production of conventional milk with its processing , refrigeration and carting around the country .
Cutting the greenhouse gas emissions of conventional fresh milk is no mean feat .
If you compare the ratios of global warming potential ( GWP ) to primary energy consumed , producing a cow comes in about 50 % higher than a pig or chicken .
And the methane cows emit remains in the atmosphere 21 - 23 times more effectively than CO2 .
However , as Peter Griffith , the director of Farming Online pointed out to me , it 's worth considering that the amount of methane a herd emits depends on the breed and what it eats — different diets can result in less methane .
Fortunately , dairy farmers have a vested interest in going green : they want to cut emissions if only to lower their electricity bills .
Research in Ireland found that it takes 3.59 to 6.7kWh of electricity week to milk each dairy cow because of the milking , the cooling of the milk , and the heating of the water to hot wash the machines .
But there 's more to dairy milk 's impact than electricity and methane .
Conventional dairy farming depletes nutrients in the ground and uses huge quantities of fertilisers — fertilisers account for roughly 1 % of the world 's total energy consumption — which is why some people argue the green route is to go for organic milk .
OMSCo , a co-op of 300 UK organic dairy farmers , also argues that the clover - based pastures used by organic farmers " fix " nitrogen ( a natural fertiliser ) .
It adds that organic herds forage more than conventional dairy farmers , suggesting less feed - including soya - needs to be imported for organic milk .
What about packaging ?
Reader Ann
Gee emailed me to say she 's switched to organic milkbut it comes in a plastic carton as opposed to her old glass milk bottle .
And the mere mention of milk bottle reminds me of the plastic pouch and jug brought out in 2007 by Welsh organic milk cooperative , Calon Wen .
Does anybody still have that plastic jug in their fridge ?
When I asked around at the time of the plastic jug launch , packaging expert Rob Holdway warned that a niche product would have problems making a big impact .
Ann , I think that now applies to the good old glass milk bottle .
It has been eclipsed by the HDPE plastic bottle where the collection and recycling system has become quite efficient : about 35 % of HDPE is now recycled into new bottles .
Josh Brooks , editor of Packaging News , also emailed to remind me that the Milk Roadmap sets targets for using recycled content in milk bottle packaging - 10 % by 2010 , 30 % by 2015 , 50 % by 2020 .
Finally , several readers have asked me about the environmental impact of non-dairy alternatives .
Ultimately , the relative impacts of non dairy milk – hemp , soya , oats , rice , almonds etc – are probably lower than the environmental footprints of dairy milk , but there are n't any conclusive evaluations to back this up yet .
User SerenAur reminds me that if I 'm going to do a " comparison with soya milk , please bear in mind that a litre of dairy milk may use more soya in production than a litre of soya milk .
So do n't forget the impact of the cattle feed . "
It 's a good point , but as I 've written previously , do n't forget soya has its own problems with processing chemicals .
As a consumer , I 'm a bit of a non dairy novice – although I 've ordered a " Hemp Milk Maker " and will report back on how it goes – so I 'd love to hear your recommendations in the comments below for the best non-dairy alternatives .
Here 's what Lucy wrote when asking for your help on 7 August :

But what about the other eight lives ?
ONE of the most famous unperformed experiments in science is Schrödinger 's cat .
In 1935 Erwin Schrödinger ( pictured ) , who was one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics , imagined putting a cat , a flask of Prussic acid , a radioactive atom , a Geiger counter , an electric relay and a hammer in a sealed box .
If the atom decays , the Geiger counter detects the radiation and sends a signal that trips the relay , which releases the hammer , which smashes the flask and poisons the cat .
The point of the experiment is that radioactive decay is a quantum process .
The chance of the atom decaying in any given period is known .
Whether it has actually decayed ( and thus whether the cat is alive or dead ) is not — at least until the box is opened .
The animal exists , in the argot of the subject , in a “ superposition ” in which it is both alive and dead at the same time .
Schrödinger 's intention was to illuminate the paradoxes of the quantum world .
But superposition ( the existence of a thing in two or more quantum states simultaneously ) is real and is , for example , the basis of quantum computing .
A pair of researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Garching , Germany , now propose to do what Schrödinger could not , and put a living organism into a state of quantum superposition .
The organism Ignacio Cirac and Oriol Romero - Isart have in mind is the flu virus .
Pedants might object that viruses are not truly alive , but that is a philosophical rather than a naturalistic argument , for they have genes and are capable of reproduction — a capability they lose if they are damaged .
The reason for choosing a virus is that it is small .
Actual superposition ( as opposed to the cat - in - a - box sort ) is easiest with small objects , for which there are fewer pathways along which the superposition can break down .
Physicists have already put photons , electrons , atoms and even entire molecules into such a state and measured the outcome .
In the view of Dr Cirac and Dr Romero - Isart , a virus is just a particularly large molecule , so existing techniques should work on it .
The other thing that helps maintain superposition is low temperature .
The less something jiggles about because of heat - induced vibration , the longer it can remain superposed .
Dr Cirac and Dr Romero - Isart therefore propose putting the virus inside a microscopic cavity and cooling it down to its state of lowest energy ( ground state , in physics parlance ) using a piece of apparatus known as a laser trap .
This ingenious technique — which won its inventors , one of whom was Steven Chu , now America 's energy secretary , a Nobel prize — works by bombarding an object with laser light at a frequency just below that which it would readily absorb and re-emit if it were stationary .
This slows down the movement , and hence the temperature , of its atoms to a fraction of a degree above absolute zero .
Once that is done , another laser pulse will jostle the virus from its ground state into an excited state , just as a single atom is excited by moving one of its electrons from a lower to a higher orbital .
By properly applying this pulse , Dr Cirac believes it will be possible to leave the virus in a superposition of the ground and excited states .
For that to work , however , the virus will need to have certain physical properties .
It will have to be an insulator and to be transparent to the relevant laser light .
And it will have to be able to survive in a vacuum .
Such viruses do exist .
The influenza virus is one example .
Its resilience is legendary .
It can survive exposure to a vacuum , and it seems to be an insulator — which is why the researchers have chosen it .
And if the experiment works on a virus , they hope to move on to something that is indisputably alive : a tardigrade .
Tardigrades are tiny but resilient arthropods .
They can survive in vacuums and at very low temperatures .
And , although the difference between ground state and an excited state is not quite the difference between life and death , Schrödinger would no doubt have been amused that his 70 - year - old jeu d'esprit has provoked such an earnest following .
AFTER Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announced in March that he would end the Bush administration practice of frequently raiding medical marijuana dispensaries , the dispensaries have been growing , appropriately enough , like weeds .
Among the 14 states with medical marijuana laws , Colorado has experienced particularly brisk growth in the stores .
From fewer than two dozen dispensaries in the state in January , there are now more than 60 just in Denver and nearby Boulder , and more than 10,000 registered medical marijuana patients statewide , according to reports in Westword , a Denver alternative weekly .
When Westword announced recently that it would hire a registered patient to write reviews of the dispensaries ( for a column called “ Mile Highs and Lows ” ) , it received 400 applications , according to Patricia Calhoun , its editor .
And dispensary owners  called ganjapreneurs in a recent headline in the weekly  are placing ads , accounting for nearly seven pages of advertising in a recent 92 - page issue .
Now a business that has nothing to do with cannabis is aiming its ads at medical marijuana patients .
A new print ad  by TDA Advertising and Design of Boulder  for Hapa Sushi , a restaurant chain based in Boulder , features a map of Denver and Boulder with 63 dots .
Four dots are red , representing the four Hapa locations , and the remaining 59 are blue , representing medical marijuana dispensaries , some of which , it turns out , are just a stone ’s throw from the restaurants .
The ad was to appear Thursday in the Denver / Boulder edition of The Onion and in Westword later in the month .
The Nobel Peace Prize committee gave its highest honor to President Barack Obama on Friday for his efforts to bring nations together and repair the damage wrought by the Bush administration .
In part , the award is an attempt to smooth the way for Obama ’s agenda internationally .
But the committee may have made his task more difficult by raising expectations and giving ammunition to his critics .
The award unfortunately emphasizes one of the biggest criticisms of Obama : that he gives lovely speeches but has no record of accomplishment .
The condemnation he faced Friday was swift and largely ungracious , much like a week earlier , when Republicans reacted with glee after the United States lost its bid to host the 2016 Olympics .
But even liberals were surprised , which should tell the Nobel committee something .
While Obama has changed the tone of foreign affairs , he has yet to change the substance — and he continues to fight two wars .
Obama is sensitive to these perceptions .
“ I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments , ” he said Friday of the award , “ but rather as an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people of all nations . ”
There ’s no denying , however , that his work has transformed international relations .
Said 1994 peace prize winner Shimon Peres : “ Very few leaders “… were able to change the mood of the entire world in such a short while with such a profound impact . ”
And a recent survey in Europe showed skyrocketing approval for U.S. foreign policy .
Of course there is much more to be done .
But those who complain that the committee ’s award was too political fail to understand that that ’s precisely the point .
For good or ill , the committee is taking an aggressively activist stance , hoping it can lend clout to Obama ’s agenda .
Awarding an “ aspirational ” peace prize is not unprecedented .
The Nobel chairman cited Willy Brandt , then the chancellor of West Germany , who won in 1971 for beginning the policy of reconciliation that ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall , and Mikhail Gorbachev , who won in 1990 for launching perestroika .
It will take years to assess whether Obama ’s name belongs in that pantheon .
In the meantime , the pressure will be on to prove the prize was warranted .
And the committee — perhaps lacking an understanding of the nuances of American politics — has added fuel to the vitriolic atmosphere of debate .
Rush Limbaugh was predictably outraged , calling the award “ a greater embarrassment ” than losing the Olympics .
Said Republican Chairman Michael Steele in a fundraising letter : “ The Democrats and their international leftist allies want America made subservient to the agenda of global redistribution and control . ”
( Some Republicans , including John McCain , did congratulate Obama . )
In his comments Friday , the president shrewdly pivoted toward a discussion of the award as “ a call for all nations to confront the common challenges of the 21st century . ”
Unfortunately , Obama ’s critics prefer to focus on his “ Marxist ” agenda , not on ways to meet those challenges .
The Nobel committee just made it a lot easier for the critics .
* Senate committee drafting student loan bill - aide
* FFELP program would be killed under House bill
* Obama praises
House bill in university speech ( Adds White House comments )
WASHINGTON , Sept 17 ( Reuters ) -
The biggest change in U.S. higher education finance in 35 years was approved on Thursday by the House of Representatives , handing a defeat to major banks and student loan giant Sallie Mae SLM.N .
Lawmakers voted 253-171 in favor of legislation that would cut the banks and Sallie Mae out of a large slice of the $ 92 billion college student loan business , shifting most lending into a program run by the U.S. Education Department .
The bill , supported by the White House , will go next to the Senate for further consideration .
The Senate education committee is drafting a bill similar to the House measure and hopes to take action on it within weeks , said a Senate Democratic aide .
Democrats praised the House bill , saying it represents a victory for students over banks .
“ Today the House made a clear choice to stop funneling vital taxpayer dollars through boardrooms and start sending them directly to dorm rooms , ” said Democratic Representative George Miller , chief sponsor of the measure .
With six Republicans supporting the House measure on final passage , the White House claimed it as a bipartisan victory .
Some Republicans criticized the bill as a government takeover of an industry that has served students well .
“ This bill is an expansion of the government ... a government takeover of an industry , ” said Representative John Kline , the education committee ’s top Republican .
“ We see the passage of this legislation as being one of the key pillars of the president ’s reform agenda being moved , ” Melody Barnes , director of the White House Domestic Policy Council , said at a White House news briefing .
If approved by the Senate and signed into law , as expected , by President Barack Obama , the legislation would kill the 1970s - era Federal Family Education Loan Program ( FFELP ) , the backbone of a once highly lucrative business model .
Enactment would also mark a step forward for the Obama administration in its broad effort to tighten regulation of banks and capital markets following the worst financial crisis in generations and in a nation mired in recession .
SALLIE SHARES SLUMP
Shares in Sallie Mae were down 1.5 percent to $ 9.10 in late New York Stock Exchange trading after the House vote .
Just two years ago , the company ’s stock traded for over $ 48 per share .
The fall of Sallie Mae ’s share price has traced the decline of FFELP .
For decades not only Sallie Mae , but many banks made big profits from FFELP subsidies they were paid by Washington to make cut-rate , government - guaranteed loans to students .
FFELP lenders were embarrassed by a 2007 scandal in which some were found to have given money and gifts to college financial aid officers to drum up business .
Then they took a heavy blow in mid-2008 when the secondary market for student loans froze up in a case of collateral damage from a credit crunch that shook economies worldwide .
The crisis left many U.S. students wondering if they would be able to pay for school in the 2008 - 2009 academic year and forced the government to mount a taxpayer - funded rescue .
That stabilized the market and produced a political opening for Democrats who had long wanted to kill FFELP .
Ending the program to protect students and stopping the subsidies it pays to lenders would save taxpayers some $ 80 billion over 10 years , said backers of the legislation .
Obama plugged the bill at a healthcare reform rally at the University of Maryland .
“ This plan would end the billions upon billions of dollars in unwarranted subsidies that we hand out to banks and financial institutions . ”

Maddow : " The Stupak amendment . . . is the biggest restriction on abortion funding since the Hyde Amendment , it 's the biggest restriction on abortion access in this country in a generation , if it took a Democratic President 60 % majorities in the House and Senate are Democrats to get that I think you can expect Democratic women to sit on their hands at least , if not revolt if that does n't get taken out in conference . "
Editorial Note : I HATE Meet The Press , and the only reason I suject myself to it , or you , my dear readers , is for moments like these whn someone actually makes sense instead of echoing the " Dems are losing / The GOP is gonna win " talking points .
Simply put , if women 's rights are restricted by a Democratic Majority in Congress and a Democratic President in the White House , the women who make up the Democratic base will either sit n their hands in 2010 or hold a massive revolt which will cripple the Democrtaic party in future elections .
Rachel Maddow is THE best journalist in American politics today , in my humble opinion , and I think she deserves a pulitzer prize for her reporting on the astroturf protests of the last year .
Not only should she be a regular on Meet The Press , she should have David Gregory 's job .
But Rachel made two very salient points on the show today , and those were that Creigh Deeds lost in Virginia because he ran to the right of our President and his overwhelming popular agenda of reform , and that the more that Democrats legislate like Conservative Republicans , the less motivated their base will be in supporting them in elections in the future .
As valuable as Independant voters are appealing to them should NOT trump keeping your base satisfied with the direction that your party is going in , and that means being LESS like your political opponents , not MORE like them .
The bigger point , which ties into the first , is that Democrats can NOT continue to betray their base and expect them to support them , and that is proven by the Stupak - Pitts Amendment that was passed last night .
If Democrats do something Republicans have not been able to for decades , which is to limit the rights of women 's choice , there will , and SHOULD , be massive blowback .
Women and Democrats did NOT hand Democrats huge majorities in order to legislate like Republicans , who are tremendously unpopular for a reason .
This goes for LGBT rights , Torture Accountability , Wall St reforms and many , many other issues .
The political reality is that Democrats who win elections by narrow decisions BECAUSE of strong suppport from their bases , be it financial support , volunteer support and GOTV efforts .
Those individual Democratic officials that spurn those bases WILL lose , because an energized Democrtaic base is what motivates undecided voters and independant voters to join our side .
Without that motivation , Republicans WILL win those elections based on the fact that thrie hard core base ( which is all that they have left ) NEVER miss elections .
In elections , often the difference comes down to which base wants to win more .
By turning away the Democratic base and voting like Republicans , the Democrtaic party is shooting it 's hunting partner in the face .
The easiest way for Democrtas to LOSE elections is to not use the power given to them by their voters to enact policies that they run on .
Let every Democrat in Congress beware on Stupak - Pitts , hell hath no fury like a woman scorned .

A couple of years ago I saw a play in which a violent act was committed in the first scene .
Or at least I thought I witnessed a violent act .
By the end of the play I was not so sure .
I seem to remember that the play was one of Alan Ayckbourn 's later works , staged in Scarborough .
The device was certainly typical of his stagecraft , highlighting that what you see on the stage is not always what is actually happening .
Or perhaps what you saw did happen , but does not make much sense in the light of subsequent events and therefore you conclude you did not see it at all .
The same phenomenon applies to politics .
Quite often what we see is not what is in front of our eyes .
When William Hague wore a baseball cap as Tory leader most voters saw a buffoon .
Take a look at the photos now .
He looked fine .
Now he is more highly rated that would be a common verdict .
When Brown was photographed on holiday the summer before last , we saw an awkward and out of touch leader wearing an old fashioned jacket .
He was way behind in the polls by then .
The same summer , Cameron looked cool in denim on a beach in Cornwall .
If we had seen the same photos the year before when Brown was on his brief honeymoon we would have seen someone with a serious , business - like demeanour and noted Cameron 's casual shallowness .
Cameron 's leadership was being called into question at the time .
We choose what we want to see .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
What do we see now ?
Largely we see a modernised Conservative party striding towards inevitable victory and a backward - looking Government limping towards chaotic defeat .
That is the narrative and nothing is allowed to get in the way of it .
What is actually happening is more complicated , as today 's Queen 's Speech will demonstrate if we look carefully enough .
The problem with Queen 's Speeches is that there is never anything new in them .
By the time a proposal is included in a legislative programme it has been announced several times before , at a party conference , in interviews and newspaper articles .
Brown has made matters more familiar by announcing virtually the same programme twice , once in the summer in his so - called pre-legislative report and again in the autumn .
The idea was based on the pre-budget report , in which Brown got to deliver two budgets each year .
It has not worked as well in relation to the Queen 's Speech .
Today 's address was previewed last July and any additions were announced during the space in between , not least in Brown 's party conference speech , which was punctuated with so many proposals – most of them forgotten – that it sounded at times like a combination of a Queen 's Speech and one of his longer budgets .
As a result the Queen 's Speech tends each year to be a curious mix of the glitzy and anti-climactic .
Today 's rituals will almost certainly lead the TV bulletins tonight and the opening shots will convey a sense of regal grandeur as the Queen arrives to deliver the wooden prose .
But already weariness accompanies the limited anticipation .
On top of the familiarity of the ritual and the contents , the Government 's opponents ask " What 's the point ? " , a mood captured effectively by Nick Clegg in The Independent on Monday when he called for a constitutional revolution rather than an artificial event from a Government that faces an election next year .
For nearly all commentators , and indeed most Labour MPs , a Conservative government is a certainty , indeed taken as an inevitability , and so they regard today 's exercise as even more irrelevant than Clegg .
The event and what it signifies are being downplayed too much .
There will not be new policies , but there will be an assortment of measures , some of them significant .
This means that briefly at least the focus will be on policy , something of a novelty in itself .
It is widely underestimated how important robust policies are in the run-up to elections .
If anything the dynamic of British elections place a disproportionate focus on minute policy detail , as journalists seek weak points in a thousand press conferences and interviews .
If there are televised leadership debates during the election the winner will have the most robust policies , and those that withstand the most intense scrutiny .
Most of the time policy does not get much of a look in , but it will between now and the election .
On this basis the seemingly doomed Government has more of a case than is perceived .
Today 's package has a theme of sorts , a belief that government can make a positive difference to the elderly , the environment , the banking system , housing and the NHS .
" Smart government , not bigger government " is how ministers describe it , neurotically fearful of any talk about the state , although with Cameron arguing for a much smaller state the divide is pretty clear .
It is an important division too , more interesting and honest than the one that has marked recent elections which in the end came down to " competence versus incompetence " , a meaningless debate about the managerial qualities of either side .
If we try to see what is happening in politics at the moment , rather than what we think is happening , we get another baseball cap moment .
No one would argue that of itself today 's measures will lead to celebratory street parties around the land or deserve to do so , but a few of the policies are measurably more radical than any of those put forward in 1997 when the partying went on for months .
I suspect most voters will welcome guarantees in relation to hospital treatments , even if in theory they oppose targets in the NHS .
Targets sound sinister .
Guarantees are more reassuring and convey a sense of a contract between government , tax payer and patient over how resources are deployed .
The Conservatives will be living dangerously if they lift targets too quickly .
Similarly today 's proposals for elderly social care are more courageous than they seem in that most will pay more to help those on low incomes .
When the proposal was first mooted Brown was terrified about " stealth tax " headlines .
At least he still went ahead in the end even though the headlines came as predicted .
Similarly the plans for climate change , while not as zealous as some environmentalists would wish , are more daring than seemed likely two years ago .
Perhaps none of the proposals will be implemented by the election .
Maybe they will all turn into dust , but they mark a departure from cautious incremental approaches usually adopted by the Government .
The Conservatives ' equivalent proposals have an echo with the mid 1990s , while their Euro - scepticism takes us further back , and their plans for spending cuts to 1981 .
Yet it is the Conservatives who are the party of change and today 's proposals from the Government will probably be dismissed as backward looking .
We see what we choose to see .
I have just phoned one of the friends who saw the play with me at Scarborough to ask if she could remember the title .
She could not even recall the scene or the theatrical device .
Perhaps it never happened and maybe Hague and Brown did look ridiculous in those photos .
But I am sure they did not .
At least I think I am sure .

( CNN ) --
On the steep , dusty slopes of the Chacaltaya mountains , thousands of meters above sea level in the Bolivian Andes , the hardy farmers tending root crops or herding llamas have no need of scientists or climatologists to measure the impact of global warming .
For as long as anyone can remember , communities such as the village of Botijlaca have relied on melting ice flowing down from the Chacaltaya glacier as a source of drinking water , to irrigate their crops and water their animals .
Now the 18,000 - year - old glacier -- once home to the world 's highest ski resort -- has almost disappeared , reduced to a slither of snow and ice in the space of a few decades .
Researchers say Chacaltaya has lost around 80 percent of its volume in just 20 years .
" There is less water now , " says Leucadia Quispe , a 60 - year - old mother , grandmother and potato farmer .
Seven of her eight children have left the region , she says , because there is no way for them to make a living .
Most of the men of the village have also gone , heading to the conjoined urban sprawl of nearby La Paz and El Alto in search of work , returning just once or twice a month to see their wives and families .
Each day Quispe spends hours hauling two five - litre containers of water by hand from a nearby river .
" We used to be able to get water for irrigation from the streams that came down from the glacier .
But the streams are no longer there , so now we supplement the water from a river further up in the valley , " she explains .
Jaime Nadal , the United Nations Population Fund's ( UNFPA ) representative in Bolivia , said that Quispe 's situation was far from unusual .
" Young people tend to leave these areas .
Old women are typically left in the community having to perform harder and harder tasks to keep up the household .
We already see mostly old women in many of these communities . "
In a report released on Wednesday , UNFPA warns that it is women in the developing world such as Quispe who are bearing the brunt of the worsening and accelerating impact of climate change .
" Women are on the front lines of many societies buffeted by climate change -- and research indicates they tend to be more vulnerable to these impacts , " said the report 's lead author , Robert Engelman .
According to the report , women in poorer societies are most at risk because they make up a larger share of the agricultural workforce and have fewer income - earning opportunities .
They also shoulder the burden of caring for other family members and household management , limiting their mobility and trapping them in a cycle of deprivation , poverty and inequality .
" For many people , especially poor women in poor countries , climate change is here and now , " said UNFPA Executive Director Thoraya Ahmed Obaid .
" Poor women in poor countries are among the hardest hit by climate change even though they contributed the least to it . "
Quispe and women like her may be at the sharp end of environmental change but they will not be suffering in isolation for long .
In Bolivia , the disappearance of the glaciers -- the mountain's " white ponchos " in the words of President Evo Morales -- has profound implications for the Andean nation water and energy supplies .
Glacial melt provides 15 percent of La Paz 's drinking water and 40 percent of the country 's energy comes from hydroelectric sources , according to an Oxfam report released earlier this month .
Yet in 2000 , South America 's poorest country contributed just 0.35 percent of the world 's carbon emissions , Oxfam said .
" We are losing something that is a human right , a source of life -- water for drinking , for food , for the animals , for electricity , " said Bolivian climate change expert Jose Gutierrez .
But if the world 's poor -- and women in particular -- are already paying a disproportionate price for the vast quantities of carbon pumped into the atmosphere by industrialized societies , UNFPA argues that they can also play an important role in helping to mitigate the potentially " catastrophic " consequences of global warming .
According to the report , universal access to reproductive healthcare and family planning -- a UNFPA goal since 1994 -- in combination with improved education of girls and gender equality would lead to significant declines in fertility , stabilizing the population of the planet at a level far below estimates commonly used in scientific models of future climate change .
In turn , the argument goes , carbon emissions would also fall , reducing the risk of global warming reaching a " tipping point " and running out of control .
" Helping women to make their own decisions about family size would protect their health , make their lives easier , help put their countries on a sustainable path towards development -- and ensure lower greenhouse - gas emissions in the long run , " said Obaid .
But critics said that conflating population control with efforts to tackle climate change was overly simplistic .
Caroline Boin , an analyst at London - based think tank International Policy Network , also said the report was patronizing to women in the developing world .
" Whatever the problem , UNFPA repeats the same old mantra -- the culprit is population and the solution is condoms , " she said .
" Food scarcity , water shortages , and health problems in poor countries truly are threats for women .
Population and climate control policies are not the solution , and if anything , will give governments an excuse to remain complacent in addressing poverty . "
But Obaid said the debate over tackling climate change needed to take into consideration " how individual behavior can undermine or contribute to the global effort to cool our warming world , " especially in the run-up to December 's COP15 summit in Copenhagen .
" We cannot successfully confront climate change if we neglect the needs , rights and potential of half the people on our planet , " she said .
" Women should be part of any agreement on climate change -- not as an afterthought or because it 's politically correct , but because it 's the right thing to do .
Our future as humanity depends on unleashing the full potential of all human beings , and the full capacity of women , to bring about change . "

These fish were photographed at a depth of 7,560 m
The deepest living fish ever spotted in the southern hemisphere have been caught on camera .
The bizarre - looking pink creatures were photographed at a depth of 7,560 m ( 24,800 ft ) , swimming in the Kermadec Trench off the coast of New Zealand .
An international team has been studying this area using a submersible , built to withstand immense pressures .
Last year , the same team recorded another fish at 7,700 m ( 25,300 ft ) - the deepest ever filmed .
These were found in the Japan Trench , which is in the Pacific , north of the equator .
Both expeditions form part of the Hadeep project , which aims to expand our knowledge of life in the oceanic trenches , the deepest parts of the ocean floor .
Quite a catch
The deep - sea fish seen near New Zealand look remarkably similar to last year 's find : they are pale pink in colour , with bulbous bodies and long tails .
But they are in fact a different species .
The fish from both hemispheres look very similar The Kermadec Trench fish are a species known as Notoliparis kermadecensis , while the Japan Trench creatures are Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis .
Professor Monty Priede , director of the University of Aberdeen 's Oceanlab , which leads the Hadeep project , said : " The intriguing thing is that each of the trenches seems to have been colonised by these fish , despite being in different hemispheres .
" Presumably [ they evolved ] from some shallower , similar ancestor . "
He added : " These species are never found outside the trenches - they are very isolated .
You can think of the trenches a bit like islands . "

The fish were photographed using a camera - laden , deep - sea submersible , which was connected to a ship and controlled from its surface .
The submersible is designed to work at very high pressures
The probe was loaded with rotting fish , designed to lure deep - sea creatures , allowing them to be caught on camera and studied .
But , unlike in 2008 , this year the team was unable to capture footage of the fish .
The primary submersible carrying the video camera equipment was lost during an earlier descent .
Alan Jamieson from Oceanlab , who is leading this project , said he was devastated at the loss of the £ 150,000 piece of equipment .
He told the Natural Environment Research Council 's ( Nerc ) Planet Earth website that it was " the sum of nearly six years worth of planning and designing , and two - and - half years of operations " and that is was " now officially lost at sea " .
Deep questions
The subject of which fish are the deepest is a contentious one .
In 1960 , Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh descended to 10,910 m ( 35,790 ft ) in the Marianas Trench , which is the deepest place in the oceans .
DEEP SEA DIVISIONS Bathyal zone : 1,000 - 3,000 m ( 3,000 - 10,000ft ) Abyssal : 3,000 - 6,000 m ( 10,000 - 20,000ft ) Hadal : 6,000 m - 11,000 m ( 20,000 - 36,000ft )
In his book Seven Miles Down , Piccard wrote that he spotted a type of flatfish just before hitting the sea-bed , which would make this the deepest living fish ever seen .
But the official record for the deepest fish is held by Abyssobrotula galatheae , which was dredged from the bottom of the Puerto Rico Trench at a depth of more than 8,370 m ( 27,460 ft ) in 1970 .
However , it was dead by the time it reached the surface .
The Oceanlab team 's Japan Trench find holds the record for the deepest living fish .
Professor Priede said he expected that some fish would eventually be spotted at even greater depths .
The Hadeep project is funded by the Nippon Foundation and Nerc .
This research cruise involved Oceanlab , the University of Tokyo's Oceans Research Institute and New Zealand 's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research ( Niwa ) .

Left 4 Dead 2's " The Passing " is scheduled for release in " early spring " for the PC and Xbox 360 .
Pricing has not yet been announced .
Le Mouvement de résistance islamique ou le Hamas a pour principal objectif la destruction de l’Etat d’Israël .
Aussi , il prône l’instauration d’un Etat islamique palestinien sur les territoires d’Israël , de la Cisjordanie et de la bande de Gaza .
Selon ses leaders , le Hamas se base sur les principes du Coran et de l’Islam .
Le Mouvement de résistance islamique est réputé pour ses attentats suicides , ses tirs de missiles et de roquettes .
Le Hamas : une organisation terroriste à l’échelle internationale
Pour le Hamas , les anciennes terres palestiniennes doivent être occupées par les islamistes .
Depuis le retrait d’Israël , le Mouvement de résistance islamique est basé dans la bande de Gaza .
Face à la violence des attaques et aux crimes à l’encontre des civils , de nombreux Etats ont relégué le Hamas dans la liste des organisations terroristes .
C’est le cas du Canada , des Etats - Unis , de l ’Union Européennes , d’Israël , du Japon , de la Grande - Bretagne ou encore de l’Australie .
Le point sur les nouvelles résolutions du Hamas
Le Hamas ne reconnaît pas le droit d’exister de l’Etat d’Israël et incite au djihad ou la guerre sainte .
Néanmoins , afin d’être retiré de la liste des organisations terroristes , le Mouvement islamique est prêt à démanteler son groupe armé .
Dans la même optique , le Hamas projette de mettre fin à la contrebande d’armes .
Le Mouvement est même prêt à renoncer à ses roquettes et ses mortiers .
A noter que le Hamas affirme avoir obtenu le soutien secret de certains gouvernements de l’UE .
So this week , the Senate was supposed to start debating health care reform , but arcane Senate rules are allowing Republicans to bring the Senate to a grinding halt .
In fact , Senator Judd Gregg just sent out a memo to the Republicans with 15 parliamentary techniques that can be used to shut everything down .
The Republicans are n’t just obstructing the health care bill , they are obstructing the entire legislative process .
They are even delaying votes on their own amendments .
How can Republicans claim to be for health care reform when they wo n’t allow any debate at all to happen in the Senate ?
Their goal is to kill any reform at all , which is what the large insurance corporations want .
Remember back when the Democrats were in the minority , and the Republicans kept screaming that the Dems needed to allow an “ up or down vote ” on bills , including the Bush tax cuts in 2001 ?
Or remember when the Democrats objected to using the budget reconciliation process ( which only requires 51 votes ) to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling ?
Back then Gregg called their objections “ inappropriate ” and said “ We are using rules of the Senate here .
Is there something wrong with majority rules ?
I do n’t think so . ”
But now , Gregg is not so hot on “ majority rules ” .
His memo says “ We , the minority party , must use the tools we have under Senate rules to insist on a full , complete and fully informed debate on the health care legislation – as well as all legislation – coming before the Senate . ”
He even says that these parliamentary maneuvers are designed to “ impede — if not actually stop — health care legislation . ”
The “ parliamentary maneuvers ” Gregg is proposing include such obvious time wasters as requiring “ hard ” quorum calls , forcing the reading of legislation in its entirety , and offering “ unlimited number of amendments — germane or non-germane — on any subject . ”
At least it is now clear : if we do n’t get health care reform , and people keep dying ( 45,000 a year ) because of our horribly broken health insurance system , you know who to blame .
UPDATE : Majority Leader Harry Reid responds to Gregg ’s memo .
[ T ]he Republican plan we ’ve waited weeks and months to see [ is ] not even about health care at all .
The first and only plan Senate Republicans could be bothered to write up is an instruction manual on how to bring the Senate to a screeching halt .
New York City health officials have distributed small amounts of the swine flu vaccine to some major New York companies , including Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup , even as shortages continue .
Citigroup has received 1,200 doses , more than half of what it requested , health officials said , and in late October , Goldman received 200 of the 5,400 doses it asked for .
By contrast , Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center received 200 of the 27,400 doses that it requested for its patients , workers and volunteers , according to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene .
Jessica Scaperotti , a health department spokeswoman , said the priority was to get the vaccine to pediatricians , obstetricians , gynecologists , community health centers and public and private hospitals .
Private companies that have asked for the vaccine are also eligible to receive it , as long as it is distributed to people who are considered at risk .
Citigroup and Goldman Sachs said they had administered the vaccine to pregnant women and employees with serious health conditions .
News reports on Thursday that the two banks and other companies received doses of the vaccine led Dr. Thomas R. Frieden , the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a former New York City health commissioner , to send out a letter reminding officials nationwide to make sure the vaccine goes only to people in high priority groups .
Any decisions “ that appear to direct the vaccine to people outside the identified priority groups have the potential to undermine the credibility of the program , ” he said .
Michael T. Osterholm , the director of the Centers for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota , said the focus on the banks was a distraction .
“ They ’re not going to be giving it to the top bankers , ” he said .
“ There ’s no reason a high - risk person should get it at a public clinic instead of at work . ”
Text of agreement outlines plan for tax on all transactions in addition to 2 percent GDP tax , mandates globalist power grab on an “ unimaginable scale , ” by a “ sinister dictatorship , ” warns Monckton

Lord Christopher Monckton warns that the secretive draft version of the Copenhagen climate change treaty represents a global government power grab on an “ unimaginable scale , ” and mandates the creation of 700 new bureaucracies as well as a colossal raft of new taxes including 2 percent levies on both GDP and every international financial transaction .
Speaking with The Alex Jones Show , Monckton , who is in Copenhagen attending the UN climate summit , said that when he attempted to obtain a copy of the current draft of the negotiating text agreement , he was initially rebuffed before he threatened an international diplomatic incident unless the document was forthcoming .
“ I insisted and it took about 10 minutes and they consulted each other with three or four of them arguing over it – none of them would produce the document ….
I said I know this treaty exists because this is what the conference is all about , ” said Monckton .
Only after Monckton threatened repercussions was he handed the the current draft of the treaty , and the details it contained are perhaps a clue as to why the UN officials were so keen to keep it under wraps .
“ Once again they are desperately trying to conceal from everybody here the magnitude of what they ’re attempting to do – they really are attempting to set up a world government , ” said Monckton , adding that the word “ government ” was no longer used but the process of further centralization of power into global hands was clearly spelled out in the treaty .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Monckton said that the new world government outlined in the treaty would be handed powers to , “ Tax the American economy to the extent of 2 percent GDP , to impose a further tax of 2 percent on every financial transaction …. and to close down effectively the economies of the west , transfer your jobs to third world countries – all of that is still in the treaty draft . ”
As the leaked document out of Copenhagen reported on by the London Guardian revealed yesterday , this massive new system of global taxation will be paid not to the UN , but directly into the coffers of the World Bank .
“ The draft hands effective control of climate change finance to the World Bank ; would abandon the Kyoto protocol – the only legally binding treaty that the world has on emissions reductions ; and would make any money to help poor countries adapt to climate change dependent on them taking a range of actions , ” reported the Guardian .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Monckton illustrated the size of the new taxes being proposed by noting they amounted to at least half of the entire US defense budget .
“ This is how they are going to fund this vast new government they ’re setting up , ” said Monckton , adding that he counted around 700 new bureaucracies that would be created as a result of the treaty , which would be bankrolled by taxpayers even outside of the raft of new taxes the treaty would create .
Monckton outlined how the new taxes would be enforced , stating , “ They ’re going to auction allowances to emit greenhouse gases and if you do n’t buy an allowance to emit greenhouse gases , you wo n’t be allowed to emit them , ” adding that the text contained a provision for a “ uniform global levy of $ 2 dollars per ton of CO2 for all fossil fuel emissions , ” as well as an additional tax on every commercial plane journey , except ones that go in or out of poorer countries .
There would also be a “ global levy on international monetary transactions – that means every transfer of money across borders will be taxed , ” said Monckton , adding that this would be on top of the GDP tax .
The treaty outlines , “ Penalties or fines for non-compliance , ” in developed countries and the creation of an international police force to “ enforce its will by imposing unlimited financial penalties on any countries whose performance under this treaty they do n’t like , ” added Monckton , saying that it amounted to a total global government takeover on an “ unimaginable scale ” .
“ We ’re looking at a grab for absolute power and absolute financial control worldwide by the UN and its associated bureaucracies and 700 new bureaucratic bodies , ” said Monckton .
Speaking about how such draconian measures were being forced through despite the recent scandal surrounding how key IPCC - affiliated scientists conspired to “ hide the decline ” in global warming , Monckton emphasized how the climate change establishment were still ludicrously attempting to downplay the significance of the climategate emails by merely repeating their already discredited propaganda about global warming .
“ What has happened is that the mainstream media has done themselves terrible damage by signing up to this climate nonsense and then by servilely refusing to admit that climategate was happening , admit how serious it was and simply inform their readers of what was actually in these emails , ” said Monckton , “ Admissions that while they ’re telling us , as the Met Office did just today , that today is the warmest decade since records began 150 years ago , privately what they ’re saying in the climategate emails is ‘ hey look we ’ve got a temperature which has been falling and we ca n’t explain why and it ’s a travesty that we ca n’t explain why ’ – so they ’re saying one thing to us publicly to maintain the scare that ’s making them rich , and that ’s what ’s called fraud , it ’s criminal fraud , and on the other hand they ’re saying privately ‘ oh dear oh dear we ca n’t account for the fact that there ’s been no warming for the last 15 years ' ” .
Monckton said that the Copenhagen treaty meant America was in “ immediate peril ” of losing its freedom to a “ sinister dictatorship ” being formed under the contrived pretext of global warming .

So you 're a prosecutor in a county that has seen well more than its fair share of wrongful convictions over the years , including in several capital cases .
Many of those innocence cases were uncovered by a journalism class at a nearby university .
That class has just uncovered yet another possible wrongful conviction .
What do you do ?
If you 're Cook County , Illinois State 's Attorney Anita Alvarez , you harrass the journalism students .
After spending three years investigating the conviction of a Harvey man accused of killing a security guard with a shotgun blast in 1978 , journalism students at Northwestern University say they have uncovered new evidence that proves his innocence .
Their efforts helped win a new day in court for Anthony McKinney , who has spent 31 years in prison for the slaying .
But as they prepare for that crucial hearing , prosecutors seem to have focused on the students and teacher who led the investigation for the school 's internationally acclaimed Medill Innocence Project .
The Cook County state 's attorney subpoenaed the students ' grades , notes and recordings of witness interviews , the class syllabus and even e-mails they sent to each other and to professor David Protess of the university 's Medill School of Journalism .
Alvarez says she needs to know the students ' grades and snoop in their email in order to assess the credibility of the witnesses the students interviewed as part of their investigation .
Her chief of staff defended the action by arguing Alvarez 's office needs to know if the students are biased in their work .
Given the number of wrongful convictions in Cook County over the years , Alvarez should probably be more concerned about policing bias among the county 's prosecutors .
Enlarge Ford Motor Ford decided to improve the Mustang 's engine about two years ago .
DETROIT 
To those not steeped in Ford Mustang history , the news that the 2011 model will come with the option of a 5.0 - liter engine probably sounds like a big , " So what ? "
But for enthusiasts , the news conjures memories of the 1970s and ' 80s , when Ford souped up the Mustang with a big engine .
PHOTO GALLERY : Muscle car wars DRIVE ON : GM claims edge in Camaro vs. Mustang sales slapdown MORE CARS : Toyota launches new Sienna on bet minivans coming back
The news also signals a return to muscle car wars after the reintroduction of the Chevy Camaro earlier this year .
" The 5.0 carries with it a connotation of performance and an aura of street cred , " says Steve Turner , editor of 5.0 Mustang & Super Fords magazine .
" It harkens back to a day when the Mustang was regarded as a performance icon . "
Turner 's magazine , which is named after the 5.0 engine , is preparing a 19 - page spread on the engine for its March edition , due out in January .
" We 're sort of the lunatic fringe , I guess , " he says with a laugh .
The automaker decided to improve the Mustang 's engine about two years ago , and turned around the 5.0 - liter in record time .
DRIVE ON : American muscle will dominate next round of classic cars
For industry critics who say Ford should n't be wasting time developing engines that only enthusiasts will enjoy , the turnaround time marks a remarkable change in development pace .
" It 's a thoroughly modern engine for the times , delivering the performance and fun - to - drive factor that enthusiasts want , while improving fuel economy , " says Derrick Kuzak , group vice president for Ford global product development .
One of the technologies on the new engine , twin independent variable camshaft timing , or Ti-VCT , will be available on 90 % of Ford 's nameplates by 2013 , the company says .
The Ti-VCT makes the engine more responsive at a variety of speeds , so when you step on the gas at any point , the car should take off .
Plus , Ford says the 2011 Mustang GT will get 25 miles per gallon on the highway , even while delivering 412 horsepower .
" That 's pretty stunning , really , " says Dan Pund , senior editor at Edmunds.com 's InsideLine.com .
The 2011 Mustang will look the same on the outside , but the new engine might help sales .
The Mustang is falling behind the Chevrolet Camaro , which has been on sale since April .
In November , Ford sold just 3,627 Mustangs , while General Motors sold 6,867 Camaros .
And GM predicts the Camaro will outpace the Mustang in sales for all of 2009 .
That 's not entirely surprising , given that new models often do better than existing models .
GM is also boasting that the Camaro is snagging buyers new to the automaker , and that Camaro was the most searched car for 2009 , according to Yahoo .
Mustang was third .
" This is a rivalry that goes back to the late 1960s , " Pund says .
" And to have the Mustang again as a legitimate performance competitor at the top of the pony car segment will be important . "

Donald Harington , who created a surreal rural mini- world in more than a dozen novels set in the fictional Ozark hamlet of Stay More , Ark. , died Saturday in Springdale , Ark .
He was 73 and lived in Fayetteville , Ark .
The cause was complications of pneumonia , said his wife , Kim .
Mr. Harington , who never achieved popular success but attracted a devoted cult following , blended myth , dreamscape and sharply observed Ozark speech and manners to depict a rural society whose richness and eccentricity drew the inevitable comparisons to William Faulkner ’s Yoknapatawpha County .
He rebuffed attempts to classify him as a regional writer , telling The Arkansas Democrat - Gazette in 2000 : “ Regionalism is a term of opprobrium , condescension or contempt .
The term ‘ regionalist ’ does n’t really say anything about a writer except that the writer prefers writing about a specific place . ”
That place , Stay More , whose residents Mr. Harington called Stay Morons , turned out to be a strange one , populated by shrewd hillbillies , reclusive millionaires , an itinerant motion - picture projectionist , a candidate for governor who wants to abolish hospitals and schools , and , in “ The Cockroaches of Stay More , ” talking insects who constitute their own Ozark subsociety .
Mythical white stag found in the forests of Gloucestershire
Source : http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1233644/Pictured-Mythical-white-stag-forests-Gloucestershire.html
White stags have long been associated with mythology and legend , an elusive yet magnificent beast .
King Arthur was left frustrated by his attempts to capture one , as were the Kings and Queens of Narnia , who chased the creature through the woods and found themselves tumbling out of a wardrobe .
But photographer Ken Grindle has managed to get a little bit closer , taking this picture of the animal in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire .
Hungarian mythology includes the myths , legends , folk tales , fairy tales and gods of the Hungarians .
Many parts of it are thought to be lost , i.e. only some texts remained which can be classified as a myth .
However , a significant amount of Hungarian mythology was successfully recovered in the last hundred years .
The most important sources are :
* Folklore , as a lot of mythological persons remained in folk tales , folk songs , legends , also special traditions linked to special dates which are not known elsewhere
* Medieval chronicles , codexes
* Writings about Hungarians by non-Hungarian authors ( mostly before 850 )
* Archeology helped to assemble the religion .
The mythology in brief
The world is divided into three spheres : the first is the Upper World , the home of the gods ; the second is the Middle World where is the world we know , and finally the underworld ) .
In the center of the world , a tall tree is standing : the World Tree / Tree of Life / Life Tree .
Its foliage is the Upper World .
The Middle World is located at its trunk and the underworld is around its roots .
In some stories , the tree has fruits : these are the golden apples .
Upper World
The gods and the good souls live in the Upper World .
Gods have the same rank , although the most important figure of them is Isten ( meaning ' God ' in Hungarian ) .
He controls the world , shapes the fate of humans , observes the Middle World from the sky , and sometimes gives warning by lightning .
Isten created the world with the help of Ördög ( " the devil " Evil ) .
Other gods include : Istenanya ( ' Mother God ' ) , also known as Boldogasszony ( ' Blessed Lady ' ; later identified with the Virgin Mary ) , and Hadúr ( War Lord or Army Lord ) .
The major celestial bodies , ( the Sun and the Moon ) , are also located in the Upper World .
The sky was thought to be a big tent held up by the Tree of Life .
There are several holes on it : those are the stars .
The majestic wild animal - long associated with mystery and good luck - was filmed by the wildlife enthusiast .
Ken , 66 , has been filming and photographing wildlife in the area for the past six years - but had never seen a white stag .
' I was very surprised to see it , ' he said .
' I was camped in a shelter and was really fortunate .
It just strolled right in front of me and calmly wandered around .
' He is a beautiful creature and it 's really nice to be able to show people who perhaps can't make it into woodland what beautiful animals roam out there .
' I was lucky to be able to get some footage of it as well as the battery on my camera was running out .
' I was n't sure I 'd actually got it until I got home .
' I take the pictures to share with everyone as a lot of people can't get out into the woods to see this . '
The Forest of Dean is thought to be home to an array of unusual and wild creatures including wild boar , big cats and white stags .
Retired builder Ken added : ' There 's a lot of talk about big cats in the Forest and that really would be something to see .
' I managed to stand my ground when some wild boar came out into the path in front of me but it might be a bit different if I saw a big cat . '
Last year a white stag was spotted in the Scottish Highlands and was photographed by a member of a nature charity while she was on an expedition on the west coast .
Fran Lockhart , of the John Muir Trust , a charity which protects wild land , said she was " thrilled " to spot the majestic beast , which is closely identified with the unicorn .
In October 2007 , a wild white stag was shot by poachers on the border between Devon and Cornwall , where horrified locals had known it by the name Snowy .
It was decapitated and its 300 lb carcase found hanging from a tree in a yard .
It is thought the stag 's head , along with its antlers , had been claimed as a trophy and could be mounted and possibly sold for thousands of pounds .
White deer , closely identified with unicorns , have been potent figures in the mythology of many cultures .
It is said to be bad luck to kill one .
According to the Scots legend , in 1128 , David I , King of Scotland decided to go hunting on the Feast Day of the Holy Rood , against the wishes of his priest .
While hunting he saw a huge white stag , or " hart " , and while giving chase he was thrown from his horse .
The white hart charged forward to kill him , so David - son of Malcolm Canmore and St Margaret - called on God to save him .
As the king grasped the hart 's antlers , they miraculously turned in to a large cross , and the beast raised its head and vanished .
Inspired by his vision , King David built a shrine to the Holy Rood - meaning Holy Cross - on the spot where the miracle occurred .

U.S. President Barack Obama will not pressure Israel to disclose its nuclear arsenal to international inspection , as reported on Friday by The Washington Times .
The 40 - year - old covert agreement between the U.S. and Israel has allegedly permitted Israel to maintain an active nuclear facility without inspection that contains several hundred nuclear bombs .
The joint understanding was apparently reached during Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's visit to the White House in May this year .
The report also said that the senior officials who had confirmed these findings spoke on the condition that they would not be named .
Israel was nervous Obama would retract U.S. understanding of the secret treaty signed in September 1969 in a summit between former U.S. President Richard Nixon and the then Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir , the report added .
To date there is no official documentation of such an agreement nor has it ever been acknowledged by any U.S. or Israeli government .
The report follows a United Nations nuclear assembly resolution which urged Israel earlier this month to put all its atomic sites under the world body 's inspection and join the Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Israel deplored the measure for singling it out while many of its neighbors remained hostile to its existence , and said it would not cooperate with it .
The non-binding resolution , which passed for the first time in 18 years of attempts thanks to more developing nation votes , voiced concern about " Israeli nuclear capabilities " and urged the International Atomic Energy Agency to tackle the issue .
Israel is one of only three countries worldwide along with India and Pakistan outside the nuclear NPT and is widely assumed to have the Middle East 's only nuclear arsenal , though it has never confirmed or denied this .
UN Security Council members Russia and China also backed the resolution , which passed by 49 votes to 45 against in a floor vote at the IAEA 's annual member states conference .
The vote split along Western and developing nation lines .
There were 16 abstentions .
" Israel will not cooperate in any matter with this resolution which is only aiming at reinforcing political hostilities and lines of division in the Middle East region , " chief Israeli delegate David Danieli told the chamber .
Western states said it was unfair and counterproductive to isolate one member state .
They said an IAEA resolution passed on Thursday , urging all Middle East nations to foreswear atomic bombs , included Israel and made Friday 's proposal unnecessary .
Arab nations said Israel had brought the resolution on itself by having never signed the 40 - year - old NPT .
Before the vote , U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies said the resolution was " redundant ...
Such an approach is highly politicized and does not address the complexities at play regarding crucial nuclear - related issues in the Middle East . "
Calling the resolution " unbalanced " , Canada tried to block a vote on the floor with a " no-action motion " .
But the procedural maneuver lost by an eight - vote margin .
The same motion prevailed in 2007 and 2008 .
A senior diplomat from the non-aligned movement of developing nations said times had changed .
" People and countries are bolder now , willing to call a spade a spade .
You cannot hide or ignore the truth , the double standards , of Israel 's nuclear capability forever , " he said .
The plastic bag levy must be extended to the containers holding the 130 million litres of water we drink annually , writes JOHN GIBBONS
HERE ’S
A variation on the “ waiter , there ’s a fly in my soup ” gag .
The question is how would you persuade people to knowingly drink water from a bottle that contained a dead spider ?
Penn
Teller ’s satirical US documentary series decided to find out by taking over a posh restaurant and producing a phoney “ water menu ” of expensive and exotic - sounding bottles – all of which had been filled from the tap using an old garden hose .
One choice was enticingly labelled L’eau Du Robinet ( French for “ tap water ” ) , while the evening ’s speciality , complete with an enormous dead arachnid , was labelled Amazon .
The spider , they were told , was fresh from the rainforest , and added to its “ medicinal qualities ” .
The upmarket diners not only tried it , they were willing to shell out $ 7 a bottle for this tainted tap water .
With a little marketing to wash it down , some of us will literally swallow anything .
Irish people , on the other hand , would never be that gullible , right ?
Since last year , Superquinn has stocked Fiji Water , “ the brand selected by many A - list movie stars and celebrities ” , according to the blurb from its distributors .
Rather than insect parts , its secret ingredient is silica , “ which is what gives Fiji Water its soft - mouth feel ” .
Silica is more commonly known as sand .
Last year , BBC television ’s Panoramacurrent affairs programme investigated the high environmental cost of our strange love affair with bottled water .
Fiji Water is indeed sourced in Fiji , then shipped more than 10,000 miles to Europe and beyond .
Meanwhile , one in three Fijians does n’t have access to safe drinking water , and illnesses and deaths from typhus and other waterborne diseases are common on the island .
The extraction of huge amounts of water for export is draining the island ’s aquifers , putting even more pressure on supplies for the islanders .
Globally , as we ship billions of bottles of water from exotic - sounding locales to assuage our new - found thirst for water as a lifestyle accessory , 3,000 children die each day as a direct result of drinking contaminated water .
Globally , bottled water requires the production of about 300 billion plastic bottles a year , of which maybe one in five is recycled .
Transportation , packaging , distribution and dealing with the waste generates tens of millions of tonnes of carbon emissions – and for what exactly ?
About 40 per cent of all bottled water sold is simply municipal tap water put into plastic bottles by corporations such Pepsi ( Aquafina ) and Coca - Cola ( Dasani ) and then sold back to the public in plastic containers .
This is a peculiar form of double taxation for consumers .
First , they pay to have a safe , high - quality public water supply , then they pay again to drink the very water they have already paid to purify .
The difference is that , even with water charges , it ’s up to 10,000 times more expensive to drink bottled versus tap water .
There are small but encouraging signs of a gradual outbreak of common sense .
In the Australian town of Bundanoon , its population of 2,500 voted overwhelmingly this summer to ban the sale of bottled water .
Locals were furious when a bottled water company tried to tap their local aquifer and sell off the water .
Their stance received support from the premier of New South Wales , who ordered government departments to stop buying bottled water .
Across the US , cities from Chicago to Los Angeles have made it illegal to spend municipal money on bottled water .
London mayor Boris Johnson points to the absurdity of some bottled waters costing more per litre than petrol .
The city is now trialling public faucets to provide chilled tap water at 20 p a fill – just bring your reusable container .
“ It ’s killing our planet , and for no good reason , ” says Eric Olsen of the Natural Resources Defence Council .
Test after test has proven it does n’t taste better than tap water .
In fact , unpleasant chemicals actually leach from these plastic containers .
Plastic is one of the world ’s most chronic pollutants .
A colossal floating mass of waste trapped in the north Pacific gyre between Hawaii and Japan is estimated to contain more than 100 million tonnes of a floating soup of plastic , some of it there since the 1950s .
The contaminated area of ocean is larger than the continental United States .
Nor is this problem specific to the Pacific .
The UN Environment Programme calculates that every square mile of the world ’s oceans contains an average of 46,000 pieces of floating plastic .
More than one million sea birds a year die from ingesting plastic .
This toxic cocktail makes its journey full circle to humanity via contamination of the marine produce we in turn eat .
Ireland ’s plastic bag tax in 2002 effected a sea change in public behaviour , leading to drastic reductions in usage and waste , but this effect is starting to wear off .
Legislation passes through the Dáil this month to double this levy – which has raised € 120 million so far – to 44 cent a bag .
Given our generally excellent unmetered public water supply , there is a compelling argument to extend this levy to the containers that hold the 130 million litres of bottled water that we consume annually , as well as to the new scourge of packing fresh milk in indestructible plastic containers .
And the next time you ’re offered “ still or sparkling ” in a restaurant , try ordering L’eau Du Robinetinstead .

As anyone who has ever sat on the business end of a GM screen can tell you , running an adventure for a roleplaying game ( even adapting a pre-made adventure to your own group ) takes a lot of work .
I firmly believe that with enough time and preparation , just about anyone can run a D&D game .
But how do you create new stuff “ on the spot ” , under pressure , and when your players demand it ?
Sure , you can have a list of names , and a list of attributes for random NPCs , but what do you do when the players decide to negotiate instead of fight ?
When they surrender and try to trick the guards into capturing them ?
When they take your carefully planned series of adventures and throw it right out the window ?
You have to make stuff up .
But when you ask someone “ how ” they make stuff up , you ’ll usually get a response like , “ I dunno … I guess I just do it . ”
This does not help .

Hmm , not a whole lot in the dictionary , either …
Guess we ’ll have to dig a little deeper .
I was introduced to roleplaying games ( Dungeons & Dragons if you must know ) at the tender age of just 10 years old .
When I first started gaming , I was fascinated by my best friend Jeff ’s ability to weave stories and run this magical game – of course it was just for me , so they were all solo adventures – but knowing what I know now , that must have been harder , not easier .
As I got older , I became obsessed with acting and performing , and studied it in college , eventually moving out to Los Angeles to pursue it as a full - time career .
I knew that to get better at my craft ( acting ) , I needed to learn comedic timing …
It was one of my weak points – and I despise weak points .
I could memorize lines and recite them , but making up a scene off the top of your head ?
How was that even possible ?
So I started taking comedy classes .
Through my studies , I became interested in improv comedy , and how to be “ funny on demand ” .
Improv comedy scared the hell out of me , and , admittedly , it was a little ugly at first .
But the more I did it , the less fear held me back and the more excitement propelled me forward until I found myself auditioning for an improv troupe – and got in !
While pursuing acting and comedy , I never let my love of gaming completely fade away .
As I learned the “ rules ” for improv ( more on that later ) , I was amazed to find how much they directly corresponded to roleplaying games .
I ’ve performed on stage for live audiences for over 4 years with several different groups , and with a little technical know - how , I am confident I could run any game with exactly zero preparation and still make it fun – and have had to do so on more than one occasion .
There are 10 Rules of Improv .
I think … or is it 20 ?
Some lists have 8 .
Others insist on 11 .
Actually , every school has their own list , and there are a lot of schools of improv .
Suffice it to say that there are lots of “ rules ” for improv , but mostly they ’re supposed to help guide an actor towards making a positive contribution and telling a story .
That ’s all .
The rules are there to help you tell a better story , but mostly you need to learn them so you can forget about them ( not “ break ” them , necessarily ) and have a good time .
This is about having as much fun as possible , after all .
I ’m not going to cover every rule , as some of them simply do n’t apply to roleplaying games , but I will cover the big ones .
By the end of this article , I ’ll give you three things you can do immediately in your games to start having more fun and spend less time preparing .
YES , AND …
This might be the most frequently mentioned and most well - known “ rule ” of improvisation in the world .
You might already have heard of it .
The Dungeon Master ’s Guide mentions this rule by name .
The most important part of this rule , however , is the ellipsis .
( That ’s the three little dots after the word “ and ” . )
In improv , this means that someone , usually your scene partner , will start a scene with a statement of fact , like “ They closed the mall today . ”
Now , the most important thing an improviser can do at this point is to say “ Yes , and now I ’m out of a job . ”
( What you actually say is n’t that important , but that you agree is vital . )
This pattern of yes , and … exists to help the improvisers build a story by adding information .
So add something .
Anything .
A detail , another statement .
Whatever .
Applying this to gaming ( to use the example from the DM ’s Guide ) , when players ask if there is a wizards ’ guild in town , your job is to say “ Yes . ”
There are a lot of reasons to do this , not the least of which is that it makes your world seem bigger , it puts you back in control , and it makes the players feel as if you have prepared for every eventuality .
Now if , for whatever reason , you do n’t want your players meddling with the wizards just yet , there are ways to go about diverting them while still agreeing .
This rule is not to be confused with letting the players do whatever they like .
Down that road lies chaos and madness .
If you do n’t want them mucking about with the wizards guild , just say something like “ Yes , and they all seem to be diseased old lepers , drooling and muttering to themselves . ”
AGREE , ALREADY !
DON’T DENY
This is an extension of “ yes , and … ” , but it bears repeating as it is one of the most important rules of improv .
In an improv scene , the players are making up the world together , in the moment , right in front of the audience .
They do n’t have time to wonder “ is that right ? ” or “ what does that mean ? ”
They accept it as fact , and then move on to build their story around it .
Which is why , with talented improvisers , what is actually spontaneously created in that scene appears to be seamless and pre-planned .
When players make suggestions ( and if your players are anything like mine , they ’ll do so constantly ) , resist the impulse to deny them outright .
What if one of their suggestions is better than what you had planned ?
Do n’t worry about who came up with the idea , just use it .
They wo n’t remember who suggested what , they ’ll just remember that they had a great roleplaying session .
Then take credit for it .
After all , it ’s not your job to come up with the entire story .
Your players are there not just to fight the monsters you throw at them , but to help evolve the story into something you can all be proud of .
The real art of improv in gaming is using your players to fully develop your story .
DON ’T ASK ( LIMITED ) QUESTIONS
Questions in an improv scene are taboo .
( Well , depending on the school of comedy and where the improviser learned their craft . )
As a general rule , questions are frowned upon in scenes because , believe it or not , they do n’t actually help the actors tell a better story .
In improv , the scene partners do n’t need to ask .
They know already if it ’s hot outside or what the other person does for a living .
They make assumptions , and in this case , the assumptions are always true , because , as we learned before , it ’s the improviser ’s job to agree .
In gaming , there ’s a lot more give and take with the players , because they are both the performers and the audience .
The important thing is to avoid “ yes / no ” questions .
The reason behind this is simple — you do n’t want to limit your players , you want to enable them .
When you ask limited questions like “ Do you follow the orc ? ” or “ Do you want to negotiate ? “ , it ’s subtle , but it limits the players ’ options .
Instead , ask questions like this : “ The orc sneaks off through the alley .
What do you want to do ? ”
This kind of question allows them to decide their own course of action , even when you ’re pretty sure what that course of action is going to be .
Open - ended questions give the players some control ( or is it the illusion of control ? ) when determining their character ’s actions .
Players that feel that they ’re making positive contributions to the story are players that ca n’t wait for the next game session .
Some of my best gaming sessions have occurred when I had nothing planned and had no idea what to do .
If a player makes a suggestion , 99 % of the time there is something in there that can be useful to the story .
I always want to use it , or to use part of it , but I always agree because it involves the player in a way that ca n’t be measured .
The players are now part of the storytelling process , easing your workload and allowing you to enjoy the sessions more .
Watch what happens when you start letting the players make stuff up .

SAGINAW , Mich . ( AP )  Robert G. Heft , who is credited with designing and sewing the first 50 - star American flag , has died .
He was 67 .
Wakeman Funeral Home says Heft died Saturday at a hospital in Saginaw .
A cause of death was n't immediately available .
Heft made the flag in 1958 as part of a high school history project in Lancaster , Ohio .
He spent more than 12 hours sewing the design on his mother 's Singer sewing machine .
President Dwight D. Eisenhower chose
Heft 's design to replace the 48 - star flag .
Heft 's death was first reported by WSGW - AM in Saginaw .

Git fractals
On Tuesday November 10 , 2009 , I was at Café Mankind in Amsterdam with my colleague Fernando Vezzosi , talking about Git .
I do n't remember exactly how it started , but soon enough we were trying to create Sierpiński triangles using Git .
Since then , I 've tried to create different kinds of graphs using Git .
The repository that is the result of my attempts is here : fractals.git .
These fractal graphs look really ugly in gitk , even with the - - date - order option ( which requires 1 second sleeps between commit creation to ensure we can find out the proper chronological order ) , so I decided to use GraphViz to try and show something better .
I quickly whiped up a small script ( nicknamed git - dot ) as part of my test script :
#!/bin/sh # create a good looking graph with dot echo " digraph G { " git log -- pretty =format : " %h % p " $* \ | perl - lane ' print qq ( " $ F [ 0 ] " ; ) , map {qq ( " $ _ " - > " $ F[ 0 ] " ; ) } @ F [ 1..$ #F ] ' echo " } "
It takes the same options as git log ( a rev-list ) and turns the list of commits into a nice . dot graph source .
I used the output of this script ( or slight modifications of it ) to produce the graphs shown in these pages .
Fractals created with Git
Still sitting at our table , waiting for the dinner to arrive , I quickly managed to create a level 2 triangle by hand ( 6 connected commits ) .
We spent the rest of the evening doodling on paper to try and find out a way to do this automatically .
Back at my hotel room , I continued to try , and began to write a program to create such triangles recursively .
I did n't succeed that night , and have since then miserably failed at writing a program that would create a triangle of arbitrary depth .
The really hard part is creating the merge points .
Check the page dedicated to the Siepiński triangle for more details about what I 'm trying to achieve .
Disappointed with my failures at creating fractal triangles , I remembered another fractal that can be constructed in an iterative * way the Cayley graph of the free group on two generators ( also called F2 ) .
It took me less than an hour , during the night of Friday November 13 to correctly write the recursive function producing the expected commit graphs .
That was a relief , compared to the pains I suffered trying to produce a Sierpiński triangle !
The result is the branches cayley - 0 , cayley - 1 , cayley - 2 , cayley - 3 , cayley - 4 , cayley - 5 , cayley - 6 , in the fractals .
git repository .
Check the page dedicated to the Cayley graph of F2 for the Graphviz graphs of various iterations and source code .
* Iterative in this context means the actual fractal is what would be obtained after an infinite number of iterations ( even if the algorithm to create an " iteration " can itself be recursive ) .
As I expected when I started blogging about Git fractals , someone picked up the idea and beat me to it .
On November 20 , Jan Krüger uploaded the script and a rendered graph of the history to http://gg.jk.gs/git/sierp/.
While this proves one should n't talk about a sekrit project before it is completed , I am not disappointed at all .
After all , Jan told me
You 're right , it takes a bit of weird thinking to get it working , confirming that it was not just because of my stupidity that I have n't been able to do it yet .
Here 's a reduced version of Jan 's graph , by the way :
Jan Krüger 's Git Sierpiński graph
However , I 'm relieved that the graph he came up with is completely different from the one I 'm trying to produce . :-)
This means there 's room for several solutions , and I hope to update this page with my own , some time in the future .
It seems Amsterdam is good for my brain ( or motivation ) .
On December 1st , again in the same hotel room , I decided to try again , this time using a linear technique .
The page dedicated to the Sierpiński triangles has all the details .
Anyone for some Arctic roll ?
Mystery as spiral blue light display hovers above Norway
What 's blue and white , squiggly and suddenly appears in the sky ?
If you know the answer , pop it on a postcard and send it to the people of Norway , where this mysterious light display baffled residents yesterday .
Speculation was increasing today that the display was the result of an embarrassing failed test launch of a jinxed new Russian missile .
The Bulava missile was test - fired from the Dmitry Donskoi submarine in the White Sea early on Wednesday but failed at the third stage , say newspapers in Moscow today .
Strange spiral : Residents in northern Norway were left stunned after the lightshow , which almost looked computer - generated , appeared in the skies above them
[ caption ]
This emerged despite earlier reports denying a missile launch yesterday .
Even early today there was no formal confirmation from the Russian Defence Ministry .
The light appears to be unconnected with the aurora borealis , or northern lights , the natural magnetic phenomena that can often be viewed in that part of the world .
The mystery began when a blue light seemed to soar up from behind a mountain in the north of the country .
It stopped mid-air , then began to move in circles .
Within seconds a giant spiral had covered the entire sky .
Then a green - blue beam of light shot out from its centre - lasting for ten to 12 minutes before disappearing completely .
Onlookers describing it as ' like a big fireball that went around , with a great light around it ' and ' a shooting star that spun around and around ' .
Yesterday a Norwegian defence spokesman said the display was most likely from a failed Russian test launch .
[ caption ]
[ caption ]
Tromsō Geophysical Observatory researcher Truls Lynne Hansen agreed , saying the missile had likely veered out of control and exploded , and the spiral was light reflecting on the leaking fuel .
But last night Russia denied it had been conducting missile tests in the area .
A Moscow news outlet quoted the Russian Navy as denying any rocket launches from the White Sea area .
Norway should be informed of such launches under international agreements , it was stressed .
However this morning media reports claimed a missile had indeed been launched from the White Sea .
Test firings are usually made from the White Sea , close to the Norwegian Arctic region .
Kommersant newspaper reported today that a test - firing before dawn on Wednesday coincided with the light show in the northern sky .
It also emerged today that Russia last week formally notified Norway of a window when a missile test might be carried out .
What could it be ?
Astronomers say the spectacle did not appear to be connected to the Northern Lights
This included a seven hour period early on Wednesday at the time when the lights were seen .
The submarine Dmitry Donskoy went to sea on Monday , ahead of the test , and some reports suggest the vessel is now back in port .
A Russian military source said today that ' the third stage of the rocket did not work ' .
The Russian Defence Ministry , with characteristic secrecy , has so far been unavailable for comment .
[ caption ]
The Bulava , despite being crucial to Russia 's plans to revamp its weaponry , is becoming an embarrassment after nine failed launches in 13 tests , prompting calls for it to be scrapped .
In theory , it has a range of 5,000 miles and could carry up to ten nuclear weapons bound for separate targets .
A previous failure in July forced the resignation of Yury Solomonov , the director of the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology which is responsible for developing the missile .
However , he is now working as chief designer on the jinxed project .
The Norwegian Meteorological Institute was flooded with telephone calls after the light storm yesterday morning .
Totto Eriksen , from Tromsø , told VG Nett : ' It spun and exploded in the sky , '
He spotted the lights as he walked his daughter Amalie to school .
He said : ' We saw it from the Inner Harbor in Tromsø .
It was absolutely fantastic .
' It almost looked like a rocket that spun around and around and then went diagonally down the heavens .
' It looked like the moon was coming over the mountain , but then came something completely different . '
Celebrity astronomer Knut Jørgen Røed Ødegaard said he had never seen anything like the lights .
He said : ' My first thought was that it was a fireball meteor , but it has lasted far too long .
' It may have been a missile in Russia , but I can not guarantee that it is the answer . '
Air traffic control in Tromsō claimed the light show lasted ' far too long to be an astronomical phenomenon ' .
Mauricio Fernandez could have been forgiven for sounding triumphant when he announced that the drug boss who had threatened to assassinate him had been shot dead by police in Mexico City .
Fernandez , the mayor of San Pedro Garza Garcia , the country 's wealthiest municipality , was applauded when he revealed that Hector ' Black ' Saldaña , a cartel chief turned kidnapper , had been killed .
The announcement , however , was premature – according to Mexico City prosecutors , Saldaña 's blindfolded body was not found for another three hours , and was not identified until two days later .
Now Mexico , which often seems jaded by a steady stream of kidnappings , extortion and executions , is engrossed by the story of a murder foretold .
" I have just been informed that ' Black ' Saldaña , who was apparently asking for my head , is dead in Mexico City , " Fernandez said after his swearing - in as mayor last week .
" This is not a game for me , or for anybody .
This is a war – and we are going to win . "
Questioned by reporters over his apparent powers of premonition , the mayorsaid : " Sometimes there are coincidences in life … it 's better to look at it this way . "
But in a series of interviews this week , he was more vague , apparently willing to allow speculation that he had set up a paramilitary death squad to keep his town safe from kidnappers .
Fernandez said the information about Saldaña 's death came from an intelligence group he had set up to orientate the activities of a " cleansing group " intended to take on kidnappers and other criminals " by fair means or foul " .
Asked by one interviewer whether such a group would be acting outside the law , he said : " I do n't understand why I should respect all the laws when they [ the criminals ] respect none . "
He told another : " If these people want to kidnap and extort people [ in San Pedro ] , then they will get what is coming to them .
" I do n't see an alternative .
They have to understand that this is not a game . "
But although media commentators have expressed outrage at the prospect of wealthy communities setting up their own death squads , others seem to back the idea .
Beneath an online video showing Saldaña driving around San Pedro in a Lamborghini days before his death , one commentator wrote : " They should bring the mayor of San Pedro to the capital .
" The authorities here know who the criminals are , but they do n't do anything .
His decision to confront the criminals is definitive . "
The apparent popularity of such tactics may explain the silence of the government and politicians , who have largely avoided commenting on Fernandez 's apparent premonition .
Apart from death squads , the other main theory explaining the mystery is rooted in existing evidence that the mayor had at least contemplated making deals with drug barons whose families reportedly live in San Pedro .
Shortly before he was elected in July , Reporte Indigo , an investigative website , released a recording of Fernandez telling a small group of San Pedro residents that the presence of the Beltran Leyva cartel should help him implement his security plans .
" It is n't as complicated as I thought because the Beltran Leyva themselves are in agreement , " he says .
" The way I understand it is that they value living in peace , and we have to take advantage of that . "
Saldaña had reportedly worked for the Beltran Leyva 's smuggling organisation until the arrest of several local leaders left it severely weakened and he turned to kidnapping .
One note left beside his body read : " For kidnapping . "
It was signed by the Jefe de Jefes , the Boss of Bosses – a recent nickname used by the druglord Arturo Beltran Leyva .
Another note read : " Job 38:15 , " a reference to the biblical verse that says : " The wicked are denied their light , and their upraised arm is broken . "

KENT , Ohio -- A 23 - year - old Kent State University student died Saturday night , six days after being beaten unconscious near campus .
Two Shaker Heights High School graduates who attend the University of Akron -- Ronald Kelly , 20 , and Adrian Barker , 21 -- are in jail charged with felonious assault .
It was unclear Saturday whether those charges may change now that Christopher M. Kernich , 23 , of Fairborn , has died .
Kernich , who grew up in Fairborn in southwest Ohio , was pronounced dead at 4:30 p.m. at Akron City Hospital , Kent police said .
Details about what led up to Kernich 's injuries are somewhat murky .
Kernich and some of his KSU friends were out last Saturday night near campus .
Kelly , Barker and a friend left their off - campus housing in Akron to attend a fraternity party at nearby KSU .
Sometime after 2 a.m.
Sunday , the two groups ran into each other .
Kernich and his friends were walking on East Main Street .
And Kelly , Barker and their friend were in a car pulling out of a nearby parking lot and almost hit Kernich and his friends .
According to a Kent police report , the car Kelly , Barker and their friend were in pulled into a nearby drive and the three got out and attacked Kernich and two of his male friends .
The report called the attack an " unprovoked assault . "
Kelly and Barker were arrested .
Their friend was not .
Police have declined to elaborate .
Kernich was a standout athlete at Fairborn High School , graduating in 2005 , according to the Dayton Daily News .
Kernich played football , baseball and basketball .
His senior year he was listed as 6 foot 4 inches and 185 pounds , according to the Dayton Daily News .
Former players notified Fairborn football coach Roy Thobe of Kernich 's death , the paper said .
As a senior , the paper said , Kernich ' totaled 1,240 yards receiving and scored 21 touchdowns .
He broke his leg in the fourth quarter of the school 's season - ending game , which made him miss his senior year basketball season .
Kernich was a junior studying pre-business management at Kent State , according to a statement issued Saturday by Kent State University President Lester A. Lefton .
" Losing a loved one is never easy , particularly if it is a result of a senseless tragedy , " Lefton said .
" Chris ' death is a tragic reminder that violence , whether provoked or unprovoked -- regardless of the reason , is never the answer .
May we learn something from this incident , for our own sake and in Chris ' memory . "

Nick Heidfeld says he is confident he will be in Formula 1 next year , despite not having secured a contract for 2010 yet .
The German driver 's future was left facing uncertainty after BMW announced it will leave Formula 1 at the end of the season .
Although the financial future of the team has been secured with a buyout from a Swiss company , the Hinwil - based squad still has no place on the grid for next year , with some teams not willing to expand the grid even further .
Despite that , Heidfeld is " pretty certain " he will have a seat in F1 next season .
" I think it 's pretty certain that it 's going to be BMW Sauber 's last race .
I hope Sauber will be here next year , and I 'm pretty certain I will be here next year , " Heidfeld told reporters in Abu Dhabi .
" Obviously it 's special in terms of the emotions . "
When asked if he was confident he will be in F1 next year , he said : " Yes .
Nothing 's signed yet .
We are talking to a couple of teams and I wo n't say more than that . "
The BMW Sauber driver admitted it would be a " huge pity " if the team was absent from the championship in 2010 .
" Hopefully they will be , because obviously you can't really regard it as a new team .
I think Sauber will do a lot better than the other new teams in terms of how they will perform , " he added .
" I think that should be more important than having new teams in Formula 1 .
Obviously is good to bring new teams and more cars , but it would be a huge pity if the team was not there .
It would be difficult to understand . "
And although Heidfeld concedes the staff is having a tough time , he reckons everybody in the team is still focused on doing a good job .
" I think everybody is able to focus on the job when they have to do it .
It 's not an easy situation for a lot of the people not knowing what they will do next year , or if Sauber will do next year .
But I think it does n't influence the work they do on track . "
I am getting myself ready to drive to Montreal on Friday for Expozine !
We shall see if making a long drive on Friday the 13th is tempting fate just atoo much .
Anyway , provided I make it in one piece , you should come down to Expozine if you 're in town , it is free to come and visit !
Your friend and mine Ms Kate Beaton will be there , among so many others

BOULDER —
If you ’re caught walking around the University of Colorado at Boulder with a Nerf gun , you could be arrested .
Notices have been posted around the campus dorm buildings , warning students that Nerf - gun sightings will be treated like real - gun sightings .
The notices have gone up the same week that Colorado State University ’s student government voted to oppose a ban on real guns for those with concealed - weapons permits .
Nerf guns began popping up around CU this week , after some students started playing the popular game “ Humans vs. Zombies . ”
It ’s similar to the game of tag .

Collecting things is human nature .
The things we collect change over time , but the process never stops .
It was cuts and bruises when you were seven , cards when you were a teen and , although no one will admit it , those sweet wrappers with the free tattoos made an appearance somewhere too .
So , a moment of thought will likely conjure up a few collections that are still growing under your tender care .
Whether it 's books , movies , coins , cards , wine , or souvenirs from the fancy restaurants you 've been in , you 've probably got plenty of stuff but no structured record of it .
That 's where collection mangers come in .
These days , most are equipped with a slick GUI that can pull information from the internet to help you with cataloguing your collection .
Moreover , they 'll often enable you to tag the items in your collections , search through your stuff and even export the information to another system .
While you 're not exactly spoilt for choice , the tools available are split into two different camps .
There are expansive managers with veritable hordes of built - in templates and support for various types of collections , and their lightweight counterparts , which enable you to control the data fields that are associated with each different collection you enter .
However , a slick graphical interface does n't automatically make these programs any more efficient than a classic leather - bound ledger or a modern man 's text editor .
So which , if any , of these data collation apps can you trust with your collection of precious treasures ?
And what do they provide that a paper record can't ?
Tellico - this old timer still has what it takes
Written for KDE , but just as at home on your Gnome box , Tellico is perhaps the oldest collection manager that 's still going strong today .
It comes with built - in support for many different types of collections , such as books , movies , music , video games , comic books , coins , stamps , trading cards , wines , board games and more .
Yet instead of using databases to store all this data , Tellico relies on the XML format .
Tellico's website provides a detailed illustrated guide in addition to the extensive documentation , but the drawback to having extensive built - in support is the in - your - face interface that comes with it , although this is more than offset by the program 's features .
When filing our comic book collections , we honestly do n't want to enter the date we purchased the book , so we find it irritating that Tellico expects us to .
Even though you do n't have to fill in all , or even most , of the fields , the result is unappealing .
The dialog boxes you use to fill in the information for an item are crowded , but there are also all the ugly empty spaces from fields you did n't fill in .
Fortunately , then , despite this dodgy start point , you can control what fields are associated with each of the built - in collections .
You can also change the parameters for existing fields .
For instance , if you do n't want a Purchase Date field for any of the collections , you can individually edit them and delete that field .
Alternatively , you can add a new field to any of the templates if you notice something missing , such as a text box to write about the emotional value attached to an item .
Monitor loans
Tellico is also an effective way to keep tabs on your items , since it can record whether you 've loaned an item in a collection to someone .
You can quickly generate reports about item data too , which can then be printed or exported to HTML if you like , and there are various templates for the reports , including a Loan view .
Finally , Tellico supports many different internet sources that you can use to retrieve information about an item in your collection .
These include IMDB ; ISBNdb ( an online book database ) ; CrossRef for academic articles and bibliographic texts ; and the SRU servers , which many libraries use to provide access to their data catalogue .
As a bonus , external scripts can be used to search for data on other information sources .
Apart from a simple search , you can create filters based on any of the fields for the collection .
Once saved , these filters can then be used to list all items in a collection with a few mouse clicks .

LIEBERMAN WANTS TO USE HIS GAVEL … .
There were some key reasons why Senate Democrats allowed Joe Lieberman to keep his committee chairmanship — most notably , they did n’t want him caucusing with Republicans — but for those of who argued ( repeatedly ) that this was a bad idea , it feels like a we - told - you - so moment .
Hey , so guess who is mulling new legislation to solve the alleged problem of Obama ’s “ czars ” ?
Joe Lieberman !
He may even hold hearings on the czars , as the chair of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee .
Since this will confer legitimacy on an attack that has mostly emanated from Glenn Beck and the hothouse right , it could prompt an “ I told you so ” chorus from those who argued that Lieberman should be stripped of his committee slots .
Leslie Phillips , a spokesperson for Lieberman ’s committee , confirms by email that Lieberman ’s legislation is “ in the early conceptual stage . ”
She also said a hearing is in the works , with its schedule up the air until the committee can nail down witnesses .
Look , I know the right is all worked up about “ czars , ” but there ’s already been one pointless hearing on the “ issue . ”
The Judiciary Committee called together a bunch of experts , all of whom testified to what we already knew — there ’s nothing problematic about the president ’s team of advisors .
Why hold another hearing , unless the goal is to validate the paranoid fears of right - wing activists ?
But this is especially galling in light of Lieberman ’s record as head of the Senate committee on government affairs .
In 2006 , when running for re-election , Lieberman vowed to voters that he would use his committee chairmanship to hold the Bush administration accountable .
After the election , he changed his mind .
Over the course of the entire 110th Congress ( spanning 2006 and 2007 ) , Lieberman ’s most notable accomplishment with this committee had to do with seating arrangements .
I mean that literally — Lieberman made it so that senators sit D - R - D - R - D , instead of Dems on one side and Republicans on the other .
Other than this , the committee has precious little to show for the entire 110th Congress .
Despite the Bush / Cheney administration being among the most scandal - plagued in generations , Lieberman , who had oversight responsibilities , “ conducted zero proactive investigations into Bush administration malfeasance . ”
Instead of a Senate Committee on Government Affairs that functioned as it should , Lieberman just treaded water , using his gavel as a flotation device .
It was an embarrassing waste of what ’s supposed to be the Senate ’s watchdog committee , when the nation desperately needed lawmakers to hold Bush accountable .
But nine months into a Democratic administration , Lieberman has rediscovered his interest in oversight .
Bush had three dozen “ czars , ” but Lieberman did n’t care .
There ’s already been one pointless hearing on “ czars , ” but Lieberman does n’t care .
This is , of course , exactly what Lieberman ’s detractors predicted would happen .
A recording of the Cartwrights having sex was played in court A woman who was banned from making loud noises during sex has lost an appeal against her conviction .
Caroline and Steve Cartwright 's love - making was described as " murder " and " unnatural " at Newcastle Crown Court .
Neighbours , the local postman and a woman taking her child to school complained about the noise .
Mrs Cartwright , 48 , from Washington on Wearside , lost the appeal against a conviction for breaching a noise abatement notice .
She argued she had a right to " respect for her private and family life " under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act .
We are in no doubt whatsoever about the level of noise that can be heard in neighbouring properties , in the street and in the back lane .
Recorder Jeremy Freedman , Newcastle Crown Court But Recorder Jeremy Freedman , sitting with two magistrates , rejected her claim that she could not help making the loud noise during sex .
He said : " We are in no doubt whatsoever about the level of noise that can be heard in neighbouring properties , in the street and in the back lane .
" It certainly was intrusive and constituted a statutory nuisance .
It was clearly of a very disturbing nature and it was also compounded by the duration - this was not a one - off , it went on for hours at a time .
" It is further compounded by the frequency of the episode , virtually every night . "
' Shouting and screaming '
Next door neighbour Rachel O'Connor told the court she was frequently late for work because she overslept having been awake most of the night because of the noise .
She said : " The noise sounds like they are both in considerable pain .
I cannot describe the noise .
I have never ever heard anything like it . "
The court heard Sunderland City Council recorded levels of up 47 decibels .
Mrs Cartwright was appealing against the abatement notice , which was imposed in November 2007 , and a subsequent Asbo , banning the couple from " shouting , screaming or vocalisation at such a level as to be a statutory nuisance " .
She has since been accused of three counts of breaching the Asbo , but has denied the charges and will stand trial at Newcastle Crown Court on 14 December .

This is not so much meant to poke fun at the overweighted types and their choco - bar - stuffed pockets as the logical failure in the design .
Unless of course some factor is being forgotten ... stay tuned .

“ They tried to make these guys the poster children for the recession , ” said Thomas E. Peisch , a partner at the law firm of Conn Kavanaugh Rosenthal Peisch & Ford in Boston , who was not connected with the case .
“ The lesson is that the government has to be pretty careful in the future about the cases it selects to prosecute because they obviously did n’t even come close to selling it here . ”

In a statement , the United States attorney ’s office for the Eastern District of New York expressed disappointment with the outcome .
“ But the jurors have spoken , ” the statement said , “ and we accept their verdict .
Honesty and integrity are the principles upon which our financial markets function .
Enforcing and protecting those principles will continue to be one of the principal efforts of this office . ”
Mr. Cioffi was also found not guilty of insider trading charges on accusations that he moved $ 2 million he had invested in one of the failing funds to another less risky fund while telling investors he was adding to his position .
The verdict is expected to have wide - ranging implications for how the government approaches similar white - collar cases .
It has been closely watched by law enforcement and other prosecutors , especially in light of the recent contentions of insider trading centered around the billionaire Raj Rajaratnam .
“ These acquittals provide a cautionary tale for white - collar investigations premised on facially ‘ smoking gun ’ e-mails , ” said John Hueston , who prosecuted Enron ’s former top executives , Jeffrey K. Skilling and Kenneth L. Lay .
“ The texting , twittering , BlackBerry - toting jurors of today understand that an e-mail capturing a concern , doubt or momentary distress does not reflect thought over time , much less a vetted public statement . ”
One of the main documents in the case was an e-mail message that Mr. Tannin sent from his private Gmail account to the e-mail account of Mr. Cioffi ’s wife .
He wrote that the subprime market  the market to which the funds were tied  “ looked pretty damn ugly , ” and that if a recent report was correct , “ then the entire subprime market is toast . ”
Days later , during a conference call , Mr. Tannin told investors that “ we ’re very comfortable with exactly where we are . ”

" None who have always been free can understand the terrible fascinating power of the hope of freedom to those who are not free "
- Pearl S. Buck
During Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's four - day trip to China last week he was hit with a non -stop barrage of sanctimonious scolding and chiding about how he has unwisely undermined Canada 's relationship with China during his four years in power .
These public attacks came not just from the Chinese leadership and state - run media , but from the opposition parties back here in Canada as well , particularly the Liberals .
Now there 's not much I respect about Stephen Harper , but his stand on China has been one issue where I believe he really deserves some genuine praise .
While the rest of the western world has stumbled over itself to suck up to The People 's Republic for trade and business purposes , Canada has retained a certain sense of dignity .
Harper 's refusal to kiss China 's ass - when just about every other world leader has been doing nothing but - deserves some real respect in my books .
On just about every other issue , whether it be his shameful disregard for the environment or his abandonment of Canadian citizen Omar Khadr to torture and illegal imprisonment in America 's Guantanamo Bay gulag , Harper has consistently shown himself to be one hell of a lousy prime minister .
But not in this case .
The fact of the matter is when it comes to putting human rights above trade in this country 's relations with China , Harper has truly taken an admirable stand these past few years .
Standing up to China , openly criticizing their horrendous human rights record , speaking up for the oppressed Tibetans .
These are all worthy stands that every Canadian should be proud of .
Regardless of what some Canadians seem to believe , the sole purpose of a foreign policy is not simply to generate more trade .
Many of the same people who are outraged and disgusted by Harper 's lack of concern about the treatment of Omar Khadr ( as I myself have been ) seem to have little or no concern themselves when it comes to the thousands of political prisoners wasting away in Chinese " re-education " camps .
Or the many tortured and / or condemned to death for simply opposing the regime .
Or the vast numbers of religiously oppressed .
Or the prisoners used as unwilling organ donors .
Sadly , none of these people seem to matter all that much to many Canadians .
Sure lots of people in China are getting rich these days , but wealth creation does n't legitimize horrendous human rights abuses .
And millions of people in China are still living under constant oppression , particularly the Tibetans and the Turkic - speaking Uygers of Xinjiang province in the country 's far west .
During the 10 months I spent in China earlier this decade I made a lot of good friends and I heard many horrific and heartbreaking tales of injustice and abuse , particularly from Tibetan and Uyger friends , but also from many Han Chinese as well .
But you do n't need to have personally visited China to know about the Chinese government 's human rights record .
It 's all very well documented .
Ignoble Ignatieff
The most ridiculous thing this past week has been watching Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff lecturing Harper for not showing China enough respect over the past few years .
Is n't Ignatieff the same guy who supported the Iraq War because Iraq was a brutal dictatorship ?
When it comes to hypocritical hysterics , it does n't get much worse than this .
You get the feeling that Ignatieff and all these other business - before - all - else yahoos would be totally excited about close relations with North Korea and Burma too if they could only see a buck or two to be made there .
It would seem that to these people human rights are fine and all , but making some good dough is where it 's really at .
Deafening Silence
Harper 's insistence on speaking up on this issue has been especially noticeable - and heartening - due to the deafening silence from most other nations in recent years .
It seems everyone is so consumed with trade and business opportunities that China 's dismal human rights record has become almost irrelevant .
America , of course , is the most pathetically hypocritical of all when it comes to this whole issue , what with their constant condemnation and nearly - 50 - year - old embargo on Cuba and simultaneous newfound love of Communist China , as if it were some sort of bastion of civilized democracy and human rights , rather than the brutal dictatorship that it is .
Core Canadian Convictions
So , let me say it once again , no matter how much you may despise someone 's politics or policies , it 's only fair to applaud when they , no matter how infrequently , take the right path .
And , like with George W. Bush 's dramatic increase in foreign aid to Africa , largely to help fight HIV / AIDS , Harper deserves genuine praise for his non-ass kissing stance when it comes to China .
I mean , what do we believe in here in Canada anyway ?
Are we a nation that worships the almighty buck - or , in this case , the almighty yuan - or do we actually have some core Canadian values ?
We 've already sold our souls , sold out our environment and traded away our country 's reputation to Alberta 's oil sands in the name of " increased wealth and job creation above all else " .
Do we really want to trade in our belief in human rights as well ?
I 'm with Harper on this one .
Both morally and ethically , the ass - kissers and soul sellers are on their own .

BLOOD TYPES and COMPATIBILITY
BLOODBOOK.COM
BLOOD TYPE COMPATIBILITY ACROSS A RANGE OF BLOOD TYPES - ABO BLOOD TYPE MIXING AND RESULTS OF LATEST BLOOD RESEARCH AND COMPATIBLE BLOOD RESEARCH CHARTS .
TO HOME PAGE CLOSE WINDOW
Under the ABO Blood typing ( grouping ) scheme , there are two especially important antigens called A and B .
Every living human has either one or both or neither of the red Blood cells .
An individual with Blood group A is so because he has antigen A. Antigen B makes a person 's Blood group B .
If a person has both antigens , then they are in group AB .
If they have neither , the Blood group is O .
Antibodies against these two antigens are found in Blood plasma .
Some of the components of each Blood type act against other components .
For example , Blood groups A , B , AB and O have antigens A , B , A&B and ' none ' respectively .
The antibodies are anti B , anti A , ' none ' and anti A + anti B .

During the transfusion process , Blood matching must first be accurately done .
How is Blood matched ?
Exactly what is Blood compatability .
Why is my Blood compatible ?
For example if a person of Blood group A is given Blood from a donor from Blood group B , the anti B antibodies will stick to the B antigens on the donated red Blood cells entering their body .
This makes a reaction that can be fatal .
Therefore , exact matching is critical ; possibly the difference between life and death !
" .....
In the past , a person with blood type O negative blood was considered to be a universal donor .
It meant his or her blood could be given to anyone , regardless of blood type , without causing a transfusion reaction .
This is no longer a relevant concept because of a better understanding of the complex issues of immune reactions related to incompatible donor blood cells . "
- Mayo Clinic HealthOasis - Ask a Physician 08/09/2000 [ full text available HERE ]
Other than in extreme emergency conditions , donor Blood is checked for compatibility with the recipient 's Blood ( cross- matched ) before it is transfused , regardless of Blood type .
There are potentially important Blood cell factors other than the A , B , AB and O Blood groups and the Rh ( Rhesus ) factor that can lead to serious and in some cases , irreversible problems .
There are some good reasons for a husband to not donate Blood to his wife during her childbearing years .
During this time , a women who plans to become pregnant , receiving Blood from her husband may pose a small risk to the infants born of these pregnancies .
If , after the Blood transfusion the woman develops an antibody to an antigen on the father 's red Blood cells , and the subsequently born fetus inherits the father 's red cell antigen , the antibody from the mother may enter the Bloodstream of the fetus causing destruction of fetal red Blood cells .
This may cause serious anemia in the fetus and excessive jaundice in the infant after birth .
This is a known major cause of brain damage .
Special Blood transfusions , using selected red Blood cells that do not have the particular in - compatible and offending antigen , are available when this condition is pre-diagnosed .
Of course , we suggest autologous Blood donation for the mother .
However , for those mothers who are unable to make an autologous donation , the decision to select her husband as a donor should always take this risk under consideration , and specific consultation with your pediatrician on this subject is essential .
Having thoroughly confused the situation , study the following chart .
It is presented as a general guideline , and to help make the facts more clear .
The chart is correct , as a rule of thumb , barring anomalies

How easy it is to declare Iraq " turned around " while an ancient people face the swirling desert sands of their own extinction .
While it might sound a bit hyperbolic , there is no denying that the Christian minority in Iraq is slowly bleeding out , even as U.S. lawmakers justifying their support for the invasion of Iraq – such as Senators John McCain , Joseph Lieberman , and Lindsey Graham – insist the United States military made that country a better place to live .
Millions of Iraqis , including the Christians who have fled the country since the 2003 invasion or who have lost family members in targeted killings or kidnappings , probably disagree .
While their brethren in exile encounter unemployment , isolation , and even homelessness because of the worldwide economic crisis , the Christians who remain in Iraq are subject to ongoing intimidation and violence from Muslim fundamentalist militias and even the Kurds who once took them in under wartime duress .
" We are considered the weakest of the weak .
That is why we are targeted , because we do n’t have the means to fight back and our Christian teaching does not allow us to fight back , " insists Joseph Kassab , executive director of the Michigan - based Chaldean Federation of America , which advocates for the welfare of all Christian Iraqis .
Though numbers vary a bit , Kassab says there are approximately 400,000 Christian Iraqis left in the country , down from a pre-war population of about 1.4 million ( other estimates place the remaining number of Christians at between 500,000 and 600,000 , down from 1.2 million ) .
Nevertheless , says Kassab , " we are dealing with the issue of survival here , " and things are getting worse .
Many Christians – who as of 2003 accounted for about 3 percent of Iraq ’s population – fled to the northern Kurdish areas after being persecuted by militias in Baghdad and other urban centers after the invasion .
Now , according to news reports and a recent alert by Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) , they are struggling in the crossfire – along with other ethnic minorities like the Yazidi , Shabak , Turkmen , and Kakai communities – between the dominant Kurds and usurped Arabs , particularly in Nineveh province .
From the HRW report :
" Both Kurdish and Arab authorities lay claim to Nineveh ’s disputed territories , and since 2003 , the Kurdistan Regional Government has been in a position to reshape the reality on the ground through its extensive security and political presence .
To consolidate its grip , it has offered minorities financial and other inducements to win their support while simultaneously using repressive measures to keep them in line .
Kurdish forces have engaged in arbitrary arrests and detentions , intimidation , and in some cases low - level violence , against minorities who have challenged regional government control of the disputed territories . …
" Extremist elements in the Sunni Arab insurgency , for their part , view minority communities as ‘ crusaders ’ and ‘ infidels . ’
Some have carried out devastating attacks that have killed hundreds of civilians .
Nineveh ’s provincial capital , Mosul , has become a hotbed of the insurgency in part because the regional government ’s hegemony in the immediate area has alienated Sunni Arabs long accustomed to positions of privilege and power under previous governments . "
The recent uptick in violence against these Christians and other minorities follows years of persecution .
Baghdad is pretty much drained of any Christians , according to reports , and only 300 Christian families total are still living in the southern part of the country , declared Archbishop Louis Sako of Kirkuk , in a recent interview with Aid to the Church in Need .
" I feel more pessimistic now than ever before , " he said in September .
" We do not have the same hope that we had before .
In fact I am not seeing any signs of hope for the future .
Our whole future hangs in the balance . "
What Happened ?
One Man ’s Account
Kassab charts the apparent demise of his people , veering wildly from the predominant view in the U.S. that things are finally on the right path in Iraq .
" After the invasion of 2003 , people cheered up – mainly the members of the religious and ethnic minorities of Iraq , because they thought democracy was coming , " he says .
" I was in Iraq in 2004 , and everyone was cheery and happy .
The people in U.S. uniform were happy too .
It was n’t long after that we saw a dramatic change to things nobody had expected . "
" Many Iraqis became more sectarian than secular .
This did not help the minority people at all .
Then there was a significant brain drain in Iraq .
The intellectuals , the professors , the educated people became targeted by the fundamentalists and the militias , " according to Kassab .
" [ Christians ] were assassinated and put out of work , and they fled Iraq . "
Before the war , Christians were a learned , professional class that enjoyed civilian jobs and some deference from former dictator Saddam Hussein .
But like Kassab himself , many fled during the 1980s to avoid conscription into Saddam ’s Ba’ath Party , and the dictator ’s treatment of Christians became increasingly erratic and brutal as he became more paranoid and unstable through the 1990s .
" He prevented newborn babies to be given Biblical names , and [ he ] nationalized our institutions , " says Kassab .
But nothing could prepare his people for what was to come after Saddam fell .
Out - of - work Ba’ath soldiers became armed brigands .
Sunnis and Shi’ites roamed the streets , seeking scapegoats .
Churches were targeted .
Christians who had lived in relative harmony with their Muslim neighbors before were now branded traitors and accused of colluding with the Americans , of being " infidels " and " crusaders . "
" The whole situation in Iraq led very frail communities in Iraq , like the Christians , to be hurt first and foremost .
They do n’t have tribal people to help them , they are small .
People were kidnapped and killed right in front of their neighbors and families .
We ’ve had people crucified .
Some women have had acid tossed in their faces . "
And it all happened with seemingly little rhyme or reason , other than to punish arbitrarily – whether it be the Chaldean archbishop of Mosul , who was found in a shallow grave after he was kidnapped in March 2008 , or the 5 - year - old boy who was kidnapped and killed , his small body found partially eaten by wild dogs , in a small village outside Mosul in May of this year .
The Shia - dominated government in Iraq , led by Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , has made many promises to stop the violence , but so far , has not come through , says Kassab .
Meanwhile , with only two Christian members of parliament , it is extremely difficult to exert political pressure internally .
In November , one of the parliamentarians , Yonadam Kanna , called for a formal inquiry into the recent killings .
" We definitely get sweet words [ from the government ] , no doubt about it , and a lot of sympathy , " says Kassab , " but not all the action . "
Refugee Crisis
Many Christians have joined the 2.5 million internally displaced Iraqis and the more than 2 million who have fled the country , mostly to Jordan , Syria , Egypt , Lebanon , Iran , and Turkey .
Thanks to the efforts of groups like the Chaldean Federation , some Christians have been resettled in Europe and the U.S. in increasingly larger numbers .
After a political bottleneck in the U.S. ( the Bush administration had a hard time acknowledging publicly that anyone would want to leave Iraq after the invasion ) , upward of 35,000 Iraqis of all religious and ethnic backgrounds have been granted asylum in the U.S. since 2007 .
Reports indicate as many as half are Christian .
But hard economic times all over have led to disastrous outcomes for some of these refugees .
In Sweden , Iraqi Christians are actually being kicked out after courts declared the fighting in Iraq over .
" Some of the asylum - seekers are now forced into hiding to avoid being sent back to Iraq , " according to one investigation by the Swedish press .
In America , this is the worst possible time to be an immigrant .
For example , in 2008 , 2,415 Iraqis arrived in the greater Detroit area – which as of September had an unemployment rate of 17 percent – an increase of 1,565 percent over 2006 , according to a Georgetown University study released in October .
However , funding to the state to help refugees actually decreased during that period , according to the report .
" Across the United States , many resettled Iraqi refugees are wondering how , after fleeing persecution at home to seek refuge in a country that barely tolerated them , they have found themselves in ‘ the land of opportunity ’ with little hope of achieving a secure and decent life .
From Washington , D.C. , to Detroit to San Diego , recently resettled Iraqi refugees face odds so heavily stacked against them that most end up jobless , some even homeless . …
" The United States Refugee Admissions Program ( USRAP ) is unique in giving new life and opportunity to millions of refugees , accepting many times more than the rest of the world combined .
But this report finds that the United States is opening its gates to refugees and simply forgetting about them after they have arrived . "
Longtime residents and citizens are now competing more vigorously with recent immigrants for American jobs , heightening tensions and fueling the political demagoguery behind recent debates over immigration , illegal or otherwise .
This month , activists in the " tea party " movement attempted to turn the public ’s ire on immigrants , too , by joining up with anti-immigration forces for a series of Nov. 14 protests across the country .
The irony is that Iraqi Christians like the three men who attempted to cross the Rio Grande last summer after paying a hustler $ 20,000 each would not be in such a desperate place were it not for the U.S. invasion of their country .
Furthermore , Iraqi Christians have been largely ignored by one of the most powerful political movements in the U.S. – Christian conservatives – at a time when they could use a hand the most .
Because it ’s not " politically correct " for these Republican foot soldiers to talk about the plight of women , children , and refugees caused by the Bush administration ’s war policies , their efforts to address the issue have been minimal .
Though earnest champions like Rep. Anna Eshoo ( D - Calif. ) and Rep. Frank Wolf ( R - Va. ) have promised to advance their cause on Capitol Hill , Christian Iraqis must compete for crumbs in Washington ’s bread line against myriad organizations with more money and better lobbyists .
According to Kassab , Christians do n’t want to feed from the trough ; they want to return to Iraq .
These ancient Christians – Chaldeans , Assyrians , and Syriaks – descend from the earliest Christian communities in Greco - Roman antiquity .
They speak the original language of Christ – Aramaic – and claim Mesopotamia as their home .
" This is our ancestral line , " says Kassab .
These Christians do n’t want to resign themselves to the unmerciful sands of time , and certainly not to the backlash of struggling Americans who might resent them .
But first there must be safety and , yes , respect for and official recognition of Iraq ’s ethnic and religious minorities , says Kassab .
So far , contrary to what McCain , Lieberman , and Graham say about the " success " of U.S. military action in Iraq , this has not happened .
As Kassab puts it , " When the United States came to Iraq , it came with the assumption that democracy should take root , number one , and that all people of Iraq should be protected .
This is not happening – not the democracy , not the protection of the people . "
Here 's a sentence I never could 've guessed I 'd be writing : A publicity photo of a shirtless Taylor Lautner convinced me to read the entire " Twilight " saga .
I should probably elaborate on that , huh ?
A few months back , Summit Entertainment 's publicity machine made a big deal out of its first group shots of the " New Moon " werewolves .
In any other genre film , this would mean a " money shot " either of CGI creations or actors in extensive makeup appliances .
In " Twilight , " however , this means a handful of young male actors , uniformly bronze - skinned ( Twilight 's werewolves are all Native Americans ) and model - buff , standing around aloof and shirtless .
Just as uniform as their look was the reaction of male movie - geeks , including yours truly :
" Heh !
This looks like gay porn ! "
Now , for those of you who do n't speak " guy " fluently , " looks like gay porn " is sexually - insecure - straight - male for " I immediately recognize that this depiction of the masculine figure is intended to be arousing , and said recognition makes me uncomfortable . "
Thus , having caught myself in a less - uncharacteristic - than - I 'd - like - it - to - be moment of Tucker Max behavior , I found myself faced with a question : " Is this what women have been trying to tell me all this time ? "
Let me first explain :
There 's no getting around the fact that these visions of the Twilight werewolves are patently ridiculous , even more so when you consider the pretzel - logic behind their existence :
In " Twilight , " werewolves are humans who flash - morph into truck - sized canines , so they go about shirtless and in sweatpants so they can quick - strip and avoid having to constantly buy new clothes .
The question , of course , as to WHY this magical - transformation can't simply also explain the vanishing / reappearing of clothing ( it makes just as much sense as several hundred extra pounds of muscle and bone appearing out of nowhere after all ) need not be asked , as it is likely rather obvious :
The " Twilight " engine runs on ( heterosexual ) female lust , and having it work this way allows author Stephanie Meyer an in - plot excuse to send a whole team of tanned , toned boys galloping near - naked through the woods .
It 's fetishism and objectification ; nothing more , nothing less .
In other words , the same thing that the rest of " genre fiction " ( read : science - fiction , fantasy , horror , etc. ) has been doing to its female characters since the first cro-magnon stepped back from his cave - painting and , after a moment 's consideration , concluded , " Yeah , those could stand to be bigger . "
It was dawning on me , then , that myself and every other male geek currently rolling our eyes at the laughably - obvious , pandering sexual - objectification of these " Playgirl werewolves " had at many times throughout our geek - existence been confronted ( or , at least , needled ) by our she - geek female compatriots about the laughably - obvious , pandering sexual - objectification of ... well , damn near every depiction of the female form in geek culture .
And you know what ?
If we even tried to defend the point , we probably fell back on explanations and excuses every bit as shaky and transparent as " Twilight " 's nonsense about its wolf men 's limited wardrobe budget :
" In this future , spacesuit - polymers can be skin - tight and sufficiently - protective ! "
" Power Girl 's costume has what amounts to a cleavage - window because she 's still deciding on a logo ! "
" Female ninjas probably would use their sexuality as a weapon ! "
" Women in medieval - fantasy do n't need to armor anything but their nipples and crotch , cause their fighting - styles rely on flexibility !
Especially the Elven Wenches ! "

When the Berlin Wall came down November 9 , 1989 , the decades - long division of Europe was over .
But there was another event , just two weeks before , that also broke down barriers and changed the course of the Cold War .
In the last week of October , the director of the Soviet All - Union Institute of Ultra - Pure Biological Preparations , Vladimir Pasechnik , was on a business trip to France .
He used a phone booth in Paris to call the British Embassy and offered to defect .
The British Secret Intelligence Service responded with alacrity , and Pasechnik was soon on his way to London .
When the Berlin Wall came down November 9 , 1989 , the decades - long division of Europe was over .
But there was another event , just two weeks before , that also broke down barriers and changed the course of the Cold War .
In the last week of October , the director of the Soviet All - Union Institute of Ultra - Pure Biological Preparations , Vladimir Pasechnik , was on a business trip to France .
He used a phone booth in Paris to call the British Embassy and offered to defect .
The British Secret Intelligence Service responded with alacrity , and Pasechnik was soon on his way to London .
Over the course of several months , Pasechnik was debriefed at a safe house on the coast of England .
The British were astounded at what he told them .
Western intelligence agencies had long puzzled over whether the Soviets possessed a biological weapons program , but they lacked solid proof .
Moreover , for many years , there had been debate among policy and intelligence analysts in the West about whether biological weapons made sense in the nuclear age .
The thinking was that nuclear weapons were such an effective deterrent that germ warfare was n’t worth the investment .
President Richard Nixon reflected this outlook when he decided in 1969 to abandon the U.S. offensive germ warfare program .
“ We ’ll never use the damn germs , so what good is biological warfare as a deterrent ? ”
Nixon told his speechwriter William Safire .
“ If somebody uses germs on us , we ’ll nuke ’em . ”
The assumption was that the Soviet Union had reached a similar conclusion .
But Pasechnik disclosed over weeks of debriefings what some analysts had suspected for years :
The Soviet Union was working on pathogens as strategic weapons and had built a hidden archipelago of laboratories and industrial plants to create these agents despite signing on to the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention .
Specifically , Pasechnik revealed that the Soviet Union had weaponized classic pathogens and was seeking to create new antibiotic - resistant agents that would break down the defenses of the victims .
The Soviets also were working on vaccines that would shield their germ warfare operators from harm and developing detectors to warn of a possible attack .
Pasechnik noted that the Soviets had n’t yet achieved one of their primary goals –the creation of a new biological warfare agent completely resistant to treatment–but the effort was underway .
In addition , Pasechnik described the sprawling network of laboratories and production facilities hidden in a purportedly civilian enterprise known as Biopreparat that employed tens of thousands of scientists and support workers .
He revealed that the Soviets had created a system of false financial plans for the institutes , purporting to show they were working on innocent civilian biotechnology projects in order to cover up the military work .
Until they debriefed Pasechnik , the British had postulated that if the Soviets were doing anything , it was trying to create a sort of hybrid chemical - biological weapon that would emit toxins and would perhaps be used for close battlefield combat against troops .
But after speaking with Pasechnik , the British realized that the Soviet program was far more ambitious than the West had ever imagined .
This was evident from the moment he began talking about the pathogens he knew the most about –for example , Yersinia pestis , the agent that causes plague .
Pasechnik said that great emphasis had been placed on the perfection of pneumonic plague as a weapons agent by optimizing its production , storage , aerosol dissemination , and resistance to antibiotics .
At his institute in Leningrad , Pasechnik ’s job was to find ways to prepare and manufacture the pathogens so they could be weaponized without losing effectiveness and virulence .
One of the most chilling disclosures Pasechnik made was that the Soviet military had already weaponized plague and was pouring it into some kind of warhead that had to be refilled every few months .
In order to produce enough agent , the industrial capacity had been scaled up , reaching 2 metric tons per year .
He revealed that the Soviets had tested the plague agent on baboons on Vozrozhdeniye Island in the Aral Sea as recently as 1989 .
As the secrets spilled out , the mention of plague carried special weight :
It was evidence that the Soviets were considering bioweapons as a strategic means of killing entire populations .
Once Pasechnik broke down the mystery surrounding Biopreparat , his disclosures raised a host of new questions for the West .
Did Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze , the champions of “ new thinking ” and glasnost , know about the dangerous agents ?
And if they did , what had they done about it ?
Debriefers directed these and many related questions to Pasechnik .
The litany of queries about Gorbachev perplexed him .
Gorbachev must have known if Shevardnadze knew , he said .
That was how the system worked .
And Pasechnik was certain that Shevardnadze had attended some of the high - level meetings on the program .
( In fact , my own research showed that Shevardnadze had attended one such meeting just a few months before Pasechnik defected . )
If Gorbachev knew about the secret program , then the West might have had to revise its thinking about the Soviet leader .
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had declared Gorbachev as a man with whom she could do business .
Likewise , in Washington , after a policy “ pause ” in 1989 , President George H. W. Bush was planning his first summit with Gorbachev .
So could they do business with him , or was he the leader of a country and a system that created–and was still creating –the most destructive biological weapons humankind had ever known , and in violation of all treaty promises ?
Pasechnik ’s information also posed a difficult choice about how to approach Moscow .
Would it be better to confront the Soviet Union openly and make public the accusations of treaty violations , or would it be more effective to work the back channels ?
The decision was made to pursue quiet diplomacy and not challenge Gorbachev in public .
One reason was that , after the fall of the Berlin Wall , there were urgent new problems demanding attention : the future of German unification and the architecture of Europe , strategic arms reductions , and the fate of glasnost and perestroika in the Soviet Union .
All of it seemed to be hanging in the balance at once , and the United States did n’t want to risk a breach with Gorbachev at such a sensitive moment .
Plus , there was the threat of a conservative backlash in the U.S. Congress :
If it became known there was a massive Soviet program that had blatantly violated an international arms control treaty , then conservative Sen.
Jesse Helms , the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time and a staunch anti-Soviet voice , would certainly have made trouble for a future strategic arms accord .
Bush did n’t raise the germ warfare issue with Gorbachev at the Malta summit in December 1989 .
But by the following May , Britain and the United States had presented formal demarches about the biological weapons program to the Kremlin and the Soviet Foreign Ministry .
The day after these protests , Lev Zaikov , the Soviet Politburo member who oversaw the military - industrial complex , wrote to Gorbachev and Shevardnadze outlining some details of the program .
Among other things , Zaikov informed them , “ Any possible leak of information by Pasechnik , who is a narrow specialist , will not cause major damage in revealing our scientific and technical achievements in this field , but might prove a basis for Western countries to question the Soviet Union ’s compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention . ”
The letter is evidence that Gorbachev knew about the illicit Soviet germ warfare program , at least by May 1990 , if not sooner .
But Gorbachev did n’t apply the same glasnost to biological weapons as he had to so many other things .
Instead , the Kremlin continued to obfuscate .
When they needed to deflect questions about the program , Soviet officials claimed that they suspected the United States also had retained a hidden germ warfare effort and proposed an exchange of visits by experts .
After months of negotiations in late 1990 , the first U.S. and British specialists went secretly to the Soviet Union in January 1991 .
The Western experts came away with their suspicions only deepened .
( We now know the Soviets made every effort during the visit to hide the biological weapons program at several suspect facilities . )
The experts wrote in their report that the sheer size and scope of the program , the configuration of the facilities , the nature and extent of the work on pathogens , the guards and physical security and the large aerosol chambers for experiments pointed to an offensive biological weapons program far beyond what might be needed for civilian purposes .
Pasechnik , who died of a stroke in Wiltshire , England in November 2001 , had knocked down the walls and put the focus on the Soviet program .
But quiet diplomacy proved to be of limited effectiveness .
The Soviet Union collapsed without ever admitting its treaty violations or the true story of Biopreparat .
President Boris Yeltsin promised Bush in 1992 that he would shut down the program , but doubts persisted that Russia had actually done so .
In the 1990s , some of the key Soviet germ warfare facilities , such as the anthrax factory in Stepnogorsk , Kazakhstan , were discovered and destroyed .
During the same decade , Russia opened some of its institutes in Biopreparat for international cooperation and conversion to civilian purposes .
But in recent years , despite Moscow ’s assurances that Russia no longer has an offensive biological weapons program , outside experts have raised questions about the country ’s return to secrecy and decreasing willingness to cooperate with the West .
Thus , it seems the full history of Biopreparat and the Soviet germ warfare system–the pathogens , the people , and the weapons that were developed –remains to be told .
This is what the Bush administration has reduced me to :
The other day , I was rooting for a Ted Kennedy filibuster .
Of course , the Massachusetts senator and I had different reasons for opposing the Medicare bill championed by President Bush and Republican leaders .
Kennedy claimed the bill " cynically uses the elderly 's need for prescription drugs as a Trojan horse to reshape Medicare , " calling it " a calculated program to unravel Medicare , to privatize it and to force seniors into the cold arms of HMOs . "
I wish the Republicans were that smart .
If the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003 is a Trojan horse , it 's made of solid titanium , with a tiny opening through which the soldiers of reform are unlikely to escape .
The essence of the Medicare bill is a reckless expansion of a program that was bound for bankruptcy even before the Republicans decided to steal an issue from the Democrats by pushing a huge new prescription drug entitlement .
The official price tag for the law is $ 400 billion over 10 years , but it will ultimately cost far more .
To begin with , the estimate hinges on the number of Medicare recipients who enroll in the drug plan , which in turn depends on various assumptions .
The latest Congressional Budget Office estimate , for example , says 23 percent of retirees with employer - provided drug coverage will lose it once the Medicare benefit is available .
If the actual percentage is higher , the cost of the program will be too .
n The cost is also likely to rise because of demands to close the drug plan 's weird gap in coverage :
After a $ 250 deductible , it will pay 75 percent of prescription drug expenses , up to $ 2,250 a year ; but between $ 2,250 and $ 5,100 , the point at which the plan starts paying 95 percent of costs , there will be no coverage at all .
This " donut hole " will outrage retirees , and the AARP , whose endorsement of the bill was crucial to its passage , promises it will push Congress to close the gap .
And not to be rude , but what happens after the first 10 years ?
As a November 25 Washington Post editorial noted , " the director of the Congressional Budget Office recently told Congress that in its second decade , the measure could cost between $ 1.7 trillion and $ 2 trillion . "
Congress has a long history of dramatically underestimating Medicare costs .
" At its start , in 1966 , Medicare cost $ 3 billion , " wrote Steven Hayward and Erik Peterson in a 1993 Reason article .
" The House Ways and Means Committee estimated that Medicare would cost only about $ 12 billion by 1990 ( a figure that included an allowance for inflation ) .
This was supposedly a ' conservative ' estimate .
But in 1990 Medicare actually cost $ 107 billion . "
This fiscal year , a recent Cato Institute report notes , Medicare is expected to cost $ 244 billion ( $ 172 billion in 1990 dollars ) .
Not only are the real costs of Medicare constantly rising ; the ratio between the workers who pay for the program and the retirees who benefit from it is falling .
" The number of elderly will soar 116 percent by 2040 , " says the Cato study , " while the number of workers supporting them will grow just 22 percent . "
Economists Jagadeesh Gokhale and Kent Smetters estimate that the long - term imbalance between Medicare costs and revenues under existing law is something like $ 36 trillion , more than five times the current national debt .
Given a problem of this magnitude , the gestures toward reform in the Medicare bill — limited medical savings accounts , higher premiums for beneficiaries making more than $ 80,000 a year , and a six - city experiment with private competition that 's supposed to begin in 2010 — are pretty pathetic .
Especially since the price of getting these meager changes was a drug benefit that will add trillions to Medicare 's fiscal imbalance while taking from the poor and giving to the rich .
As the Heritage Foundation 's Robert Moffit notes , the drug plan " will guarantee that low - income working people pay the drug bills of rich retirees with six - figure incomes . "
Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) , one of the few Republicans who placed principle above politics by voting against the bill , called it " the largest tax increase that one generation has put on another generation in the history of the country . "
After the Senate approved the bill , President Bush bragged that " year after year the problems in the Medicare system were studied and debated , " and finally " we got something done . "
Sometimes nothing is better than something .
Boxing Day was on a Saturday , which helped sales Boxing Day sales attracted the highest number of shoppers since records began , according to retail analysts .
Up to 12 million people are thought to have been out looking for bargains some 24 hours after Christmas Day .
The total number of shoppers had risen by nearly 20 % compared to Boxing Day in 2008 , said Experian .
The rise is thought to be due to bargain hunting before the VAT rate returns to 17.5 % on 1 January and the fact Boxing Day fell on a weekend .
The BBC's Nick Cosgrove said : " The rush to the shops over the weekend has been remarkable . "
However , High Streets are braced for further tough times in 2010 , according to a survey by the British Retail Consortium ( BRC ) .
The BRC said four out of five retailers who responded to its survey said they expected sales would not improve on 2009 levels , dashing hopes of a consumer - led economic recovery .
Taxing times Chancellor Alistair Darling announced VAT would be cut to 15 % in his pre-Budget report last year in a bid to encourage consumers to spend more and boost the economy .
The sales tax rise is set to have the biggest effect on sales of expensive items such as furniture and so - called white goods , such as fridges and washing machines , as people seek the best bargains .
A spokesman for consultancy firm Planet Retail said : " The cold weather just before Christmas meant people were n't spending money as much .
" People on variable mortgages are still quite cash rich and now are thinking 'we want to take advantage of this before the VAT spike ' , particularly on big ticket items such as televisions and white goods . "

n an April 1 , 1997 profile in the New York Times Clarke speaks about his new book 3001 , the latest and perhaps final in the series of books beginning with 2001 :
In the world of 3001 Clarke envisions for the story , the writer of the piece , John F. Burns , says : " Perhaps most controversially , religions of all kinds have fallen under a strict taboo , with the citizenry looking back on the religious beliefs and practices of earlier ages as products of ignorance that caused untold strife and bloodshed .
But the concept of a God , known by the Latin word Deus , survives , a legacy of man 's continuing wonder at the universe .
" In this , Clarke is giving vent to one of the few things that seem to ruffle his equable nature .
Jon Stewart ’s comedy news show The Daily Show is reportedly under fire from pro-Israeli groups for giving airtime to two pro-Palestinian figures on Wednesday night .
Stewart hosted Palestinian democracy activist Mustafa Barghouti and human rights activist Anna Baltzer , author of A Witness in Palestine , who explained the Israeli - Palestinian conflict from the perspective of the Palestinian side .
ADVERTISEMENT
According to a letter reportedly written by Baltzer and circulated by blogger Eric Johnson , the show “ was overwhelmed with angry emails and phone calls prior to the appearance , and up until the last minute it seemed like they might cancel . ”
“ During the taping the show had its only heckler in 11 years , ” Baltzer wrote .
“ The entire staff were very nervous and may come to regret the monumental decision ( and not make it again ) as they will surely be inundated now that the show has aired . ”
At one point during the interview , Barghouti asserted : “ We [ Palestinians ] are struggling for liberty , we are struggling for justice .
It ’s Palestinians who have been subjected to the longest occupation in history and a system of segregation that is totally unjust . ”
At that point , a voice in the audience could be heard shouting : “ Liar ! ”
“ Apparently we have Joe Wilson with us tonight , ” Stewart quipped , referring the US House representative who yelled “ You lie ! ” during President Obama ’s address to Congress last month .
ADVERTISEMENT
The segment drew criticisms from a number of pro-Israeli activists and commenters .
“ Jon Stewart [ had ] a couple of disgraceful guests on his show on Wednesday night for a night of Israel bashing , ” wrote blogger Israel Matzav .
“ No , there ’s no pro-Israel counterpoint ( perhaps he will try to convince us that ISM activist Baltzer – who is Jewish – is meant to provide balance ) .
And I thought Stewart ’s was a comedy show .
What if no one watched him ? ”
Not all pro-Israeli voices were as critical .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It does n’t actually seem that groundbreaking , ” wrote Rafi G. “ He has a Palestinian talking about Palestinian rights and he has an Jewish leftist talking about Palestinian rights .
They are advocating a non-violent approach , both from a Palestinian point of view . ”
But the blogger noted that “ nobody said a word about Palestinian terror or their not accepting peace deals that were offered . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Baltzer is now urging Daily Show viewers to send letters of support to the show , in an effort to keep the show from being dissuaded from covering the Israeli - Palestinian conflict in the future .
And some commentators are praising Stewart for taking on the issue .
TalkingPointsMemo blogger M.J. Rosenberg credits Stewart with starting a “ sea change ” in American media ’s coverage of the Middle Eastern conflict .
Rosenberg wrote :

Not long ago , no mainstream media personality would ever allow himself to be associated with anyone who suggests that diplomacy , not war , is the way to solve the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Being thought of as not 100 % down with the government of Israel was a career killer .
And , if it was n’t , media and show business figures believed it was and that was the same thing .
That era ended with the rise of Jon Stewart , the most trusted television personality in America ( and the only one the kids pay attention to ) .
Stewart is the antithesis of the scared Jew .
The following video was broadcast on Comedy Central ’s The Daily Show , October 28 , 2009 .
Intellectual Property was - maybe - how investors be motivated to invest , and then protect their investment .
But , if this was ever the case , intellectual property ( IP ) , is much more an excuse for corporations to flex their muscles and intrude into our lives .
Property rights should empower us as individuals if they are worth having at all , but corporations are building fences inside our private lives .
While I do n't want to overstate it , Pirate Party Australia has policies that challenge these trends , and quite apart from whether you vote for us , we try to build up awareness about it both generally and politically .
Patents
Patents are a license to be the sole manufacturer - or licensee - of an invention .
Transfer of ownership has meant the price of epipens - used to treat allergic reactions - skyrocketed .
They were first developed for the US military so soldiers could administer nerve gas antidotes , but somewhere along the way owners were able to dramatically increase the price .
Notionally there were improvements , but it seems the profits were still extreme and the increases difficult to justify - perhaps you could have retained a cheaper basic version .
For all the criticisms of the US military , they gave us the internet and one set of GPS satellites , without charge .
For sure , a lot of money is wasted in the US military .
But , somehow , this innovation was lost in the morass of private contracts and IP sales within private industry .
Larry Gelbart won two Emmy awards and was nominated for two Oscars
The award - winning US television , film and theatre writer Larry Gelbart , who is best remembered for the M*A * S*H TV comedy series , has died at 81 .
Mr Gelbart died at his California home after a battle with cancer .
M*A*S*H - about army doctors during the Korean War - began in 1972 and won Mr Gelbart an Emmy award .
He also won a Tony award for A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum , and was twice nominated for an Oscar , including for the film Tootsie .
Mr Gelbart was brought in to develop the TV version of M* A * S*H , which had been filmed for the big screen by Robert Altman in 1970 .
Mr Gelbart wrote 97 shows over four seasons before leaving .
The comedy show went on until 1983 as one of the most successful on US television .
Early in his writing career , Mr Gelbart wrote jokes for stars including Bob Hope and Red Buttons , and worked on Sid Caesar 's show Caesar 's Hour .
In 1962 he co-wrote the Ancient Rome - based hit Broadway show A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum .
His Oscar nominations were for the Dustin Hoffman movie Tootsie and Oh , God ! , starring George Burns .
Mr Gelbart also won another Emmy for the Wall St - based film Barbarians at the Gate .
During some of the media 's endless coverage of the Fort Hood shootings today , Larry King brought in former POW Shoshana Johnson , Dr. Phil McGraw and former JAG officer Tom Kenniff to speculate about what the mindset of the accused attacker Nidal Malik Hasan may have been .
When Kenniff called some of CNN 's previous coverage on the topic " psycho - babble " , tried to say that a ranking officer could not be suffering from PTSD and asserted that Hasan 's motivations looked more like an act of terrorism because he has a Muslim name , Shoshana Johnson and Phil McGraw both rightfully called him out for it .
When Kenniff while attempting to counter McGraw and Johnson asked Johnson if she had ever been to Iraq , she had to remind him that she was a POW :
KENNIF : I spent a year in Iraq , ma'am .
Have you ever been to Iraq ?
JOHNSON : I 'm a POW .
I got shot .
Kenniff was obviously unaware that Johnson was in fact the first female African American POW in U.S. history .
KING : We 're back .
We are happy to be able to call on our friend , Dr. Phil , the host of his own show , " New York Times " best - selling author and a -- and a member of the fraternity that is from Texas .
In fact , do you know Fort Hood ?
DR .
PHIL MCGRAW , TV SHOW HOST : I do .
I 've been there and I 've spent time working with some of the widows of soldiers and widows and widowers of soldiers that were lost in Iraq and Afghanistan .
So I 've spent time on Fort Hood .
And it 's a -- it 's a wonderful ...
KING : It 's a huge base , right ?
MCGRAW : It 's 339 acres .
It 's a city within itself down there .
And on any given day , you can have 30,000 or 40,000 people on the base .
It truly is a city within a city and good folks .
And , as the general said , it 's -- it 's their home .
I mean this is n't a war zone , it 's their home .
KING : I asked the FBI if he had -- the FBI agent if he had ever heard of a psychiatrist committing mayhem .
He never had .
Have you ?
MCGRAW : Well , no , I have not .
But , Larry , we 're dealing with a very different kind of war here .
And , you know , this is a man that , from what I understand , was doing all kinds of drug and rehabilitation counseling with -- with soldiers and returning soldiers .
And we know that there is a tremendous degree of stress with this war .
And I think the military will tell you that it 's a new animal and nobody knows exactly what to do with it .
And I do n't know -- everything is speculation at this point .
But he was apparently scheduled for deployment , did not want to go .
I think he has maybe seen the problems that some of these soldiers were experiencing when they come back to try to reintegrate into society , and maybe the fear got him , and he just snapped .
You can't make sense out of nonsense .
And you have to stop and think about this , Larry .
How far out of touch with reality and reason do you have to go to actually pick up a weapon and kill your friends , kill your fellow soldiers , your fellow warriors ?
This is a major mental event .
This guy was not just having a bad day .
This is a serious , serious -- KING : Joining us in New York is Tom Kennif a commissioned officer with the Army National Guard 's Judge Advocates General Group .
He is a general with the war in Iraq , and a criminal defense attorney .
In Washington , our old friend Shoshanna Johnson , former POW , U.S. Army specialist , now serves on the Advisory Panel for the Veterans Administration .
Dr. Phil is with us here in the studios in Los Angeles .
Tom , what do you make of this ?
TOM KENNIFF , FMR .
ARMY JAG : Look , Larry , you know , with all due respect to Dr. Phil , you know , having been through the war in Iraq , and having seen what these soldiers go through , you know , with respect to this incident , I need to take a giant step back from all the psycho - babble I 've been hearing for the last few hours .
Let 's take a look at the facts of this situation .
This is not some lower enlisted soldier .
This is a major .
He is a high ranking field grade officer .
That means that he outranks approximately 95 percent of the military .
He has a medical -- he is a medical doctor .
He is an MD .
That means he occupies a position of prestige , not only within the military , but also within society at large .
He is paid well for the job he does .
You know , this looks a lot less like PTSD , and a lot more like the Hassan Akbar case in 2003 , where another soldier who has an Islamic last name , throws grenades randomly into tents occupied by his fellow officers , and by his fellow soldiers , for no other reason but to commit acts of terror , and to instill fear on the military installation , and to bring attention to himself .
SHOSHANA JOHNSON , FORMER POW : Hello .
KING : Are you doing , Tom -- by mentioning Islamic last name , are you doing speculating of your own ?
KENNIFF : I am speculating . .
That 's true .
We have very limited information right now .
But we 're all speculating .
And what I 'm saying is my speculation seems to fit a lot more in with the reality of this case .
JOHNSON : No .
No , it does n't .
No , it does n't .
I think you 're talking -- ( CROSS TALK ) KING : Hold it .
Let 's -- MCGRAW : I do n't think you can say that .
I think that 's a terrible innuendo here .
( CROSS TALK ) JOHNSON :
As someone who suffers from PTSD , I know exactly what I say to my psychiatrist .
And if he is sitting back and hearing this day in and day out , the fear may get to him .
The fact of the matter that he is a major , or the fact that he is a doctor does n't excuse that he is a human being and he feels .
You 're saying because he is a major in the Army that he is not going to feel the way a private does .
The Obama administration came out with its first set of numbers on the jobs impact of its stimulus package .
It ’s pretty much along the lines of what was predicted .
To date , the package has created close to one million jobs .
That is good news , but in an economy with more than 15 million unemployed workers , it is not nearly good enough .
We need to do more , much more .
Fortunately , there is an easy and quick way to begin to get these unemployed workers back to work .
It involves paying workers to work shorter hours .
The mechanism can take the form of a tax credit to employers .
The government can give them a tax credit of up to $ 3,000 in order to shorten their workers ’ hours while leaving their pay unchanged .
The reduction in hours can take the form of paid sick days , paid family leave , shorter workweeks or longer vacations .
The employer can choose the method that is best for her workers and the workplace .
If take - home pay is left unchanged as a result of the credit , then demand should be left unchanged .
If workers are on average putting in fewer hours and demand is unchanged , then employers will need to hire more workers .
This logic is about as simple as it gets .
The process is also quick and cheap .
In principle , the government can go this route to save jobs at a cost of a bit more than $ 20,000 per job , far less than the estimates of the cost per job under the administration ’s stimulus package .
We do n’t even have to speculate about whether this sort of short - hours arrangement can work .
Germany put a short - hours program in place at the start of its recession .
Its unemployment rate today is 7.6 percent , about the same as the unemployment rate it had going into the recession .
Imagine that workers in the United States , like workers in Germany , were dealing with the recession by putting in four - day weeks ( while getting paid for five ) or getting an extra two weeks a year of paid vacation .
This sure beats being unemployed or being threatened with unemployment .
Seventeen states already have a “ work - share ” program in place that allows employers to use unemployment insurance money to cover a reduction in work hours , without a corresponding reduction in pay .
More than 100,000 layoffs have been prevented as result of this program .
Sen .
Jack Reed of Rhode Island has a bill that would increase funding for work - share programs and remove some of the bureaucracy that makes it difficult for employers to take full advantage of the programs that currently exist .
The bill would also provide start - up money for the states that do not have work - share programs .
The Reed bill would be a big step towards following the Germany model , taking advantage of a program that is already in place .
It could very quickly make a big dent in the unemployment rate , by preserving many of the jobs that are now being lost .
In this respect , it is important to clear up a common confusion about the economy .
Every month , we get a figure from the Labor Department for the new jobs created or lost .
However , this is a net figure .
Approximately four million people leave their jobs every month , about half of these workers , or two million , lose their jobs involuntarily .
If the economy creates more than four million new jobs , then we will have a positive jobs figure for the month .
If the economy creates less than four million new jobs , then the Labor Department will report that the economy lost jobs in the month .
Suppose that this work - share program reduced the number of people who lose their jobs involuntarily by 20 percent , or 400,000 workers per month .
This would have the same effect to our job count as adding 400,000 additional new jobs .
If this rate could actually be maintained over a full year , then it would imply that the economy would generate nearly five million new jobs .
All the projections show that the unemployment rate is likely to continue to rising for the immediate future and remain high for years to come .
The Congressional Budget Office projects that the unemployment rate will average 10.2 percent next year and even in 2011 it will average 9.1 percent .
If this projection proves accurate , it would be a disastrous scenario for tens of millions of people .
There are quick and effective ways to increase employment , with shorter hours at the top of the list .
Making tens of millions of people suffer for economic mismanagement and the greed of the bankers is not acceptable .
We must do something .
Hong Kong Citizens Are Living in Cages … Literally
Hong Kong is a vibrant city chock - full of people — so much so that the quality of life for those at the bottom tier is atrocious .
And I ’m not talking about , “ Oh my goodness , I have to share a bathroom with my brother and sister . ”
I ’m talking about up to 18 strangers being smashed into a tiny 625 square foot flat with just one toilet to share .
One such former cage - dweller is Chau Kam - chuen .
Mr. Kam - chuen used to be one of over 400,000 working poor who paid approximately $ 167.6 USD to live in such an environment .
According to him , it ’s extremely uncomfortable , especially if you get the top bunk : “ You hit your head on the ceiling . ”
The way it works is that a flat is chosen and then partitioned into multiple cubicles , each composed of wooden planks and wire mesh .
Each cubicle then becomes home to one resident .
The cage that the woman sits in above contains all her possessions , from clothes to cooking supplies and even family heirlooms .
Realistically speaking , the cage is smaller than a jail cell ; yet , these cages house thousands of poverty - stricken men and women who have nowhere else to turn .
And they are n’t comfortable either .
Oftentimes , the air - conditioning and heating does n’t work .
Or if it does work , it rarely gets turned on before 9 m .
As Lai Man-law , an employed man from Hong Kong explained , “ It ’s dirty and hot .
There are cockroaches and bedbugs , and the air - conditioning does n’t work . ”
One wonders though why someone would choose to live like this .
Most of these people have no alternative option .
These are normal everyday citizens who befell upon hard times and ended up unemployed , homeless , and struggling to make ends meet .
The horrific floods of 2008 did n’t help either , as it forced many into homelessness and poverty .
To bring this unfortunate situation to light , Hong Kong ’s Schoeni Gallery decided to focus their annual art charity event on displaying these cages directly to the public .
Their goal was to showcase the widening gap between the poor and rich in Hong Kong .
The cages displayed are real cages from real flats .
In fact , the man pictured above is Mr. Kam - chuen himself .
He hopes that this event inspires more people to offer a helping hand to those in need — especially the poor cage dwellers of Hong Kong .

The total outlay will hit £ 417 million in just 24 hours , making it the busiest web shopping day of the year .
Sales are expected to peak between 1 pm and 2 pm when office staff log on from work .
Another hectic period will have occured this morning when mothers got home after dropping their children off at school .
And the biggest - selling items ?
They 're expected to be Apple iPod Touch , Wii fit , Scalextric and LCD TVs
Should I ever make it to the North Pole and find the great man at work , I imagine Father Christmas 's Grotto would look a little like this .
I dare say there would be a few marked differences .
His staff would be shorter and , being elves , they would probably have green hats and pointy ears , too .
And his loading bays would be full of reindeer instead of the ceaseless juggernauts which rumble in and out at the rate of one every five minutes .
But the overall set - up must be pretty similar .
Because if you really want to dispatch Christmas presents to millions of people all over the world - or , indeed , cope with today 's predicted £ 17 million - an - hour online shopping bonanza - then you need an operation like this .
Santa 's one - stop - shop : The Amazon warehouse near Milton Keynes has everything you can think of - including the author 's own book !
Crate expectations : Workers set about making sure the right gifts head towards the right address
It 's a multi-storey , fully - automated shopping colossus next to Junction 13 of the M1 near Milton Keynes with a roof the size of eight football pitches and a thousand staff .
It is several times larger than Britain 's largest conventional department store - and , unlike Harrods , it never closes .
Yet it has no shoppers .
And if you think this thing is huge , then you should have a look at its shiny new sibling down in Swansea .
It 's half as big again .
But do n't think of calling this a warehouse or even a distribution hub .
In Amazon - speak , it 's a ' fulfilment centre ' .
' This is all about fulfilling people 's wishes , ' says European vice - president , Allan Lyall , the nearest thing to Santa in these parts .
I can think of another name for it - Retail Hell .
There are , quite literally , millions of different products stored in no particular order , their location governed only by their size and the spare shelving available at the second they arrived .
It is impossible to get your mind around this place - which is just as well because you do not need to .
If you want to know where anything is , you do n't ask a worker - or ' associate ' as they are known .
You ask the computer .
These days , Amazon has nearly 100 million customers worldwide and sells everything from jewellery to computers to bibs .
It then sends it to anyone anywhere on the planet with a legitimate postal address .
It all began in 1995 , at the dawn of the internet age , as a cheap way of selling books .
At first , it was based in the Seattle home of its American founder , a cyber - savvy hedge - funder called Jeff Bezos .
It did n't stay there very long .
Within three years , he had expanded across America and the Atlantic , opening Amazon.co.uk in this airport - sized beehive in Bedfordshire .
And it 's enough to drive the average shopper screaming into the M1 traffic .
Here is a system seemingly devoid of logic or classification of any sort .
In one open area , I find a column of shrink - wrapped copies of The Times Atlas Of The
World next to a pile of Philips kettles next to a pile of cameras next to a mountain of Wii computer consoles .
An hour later , I am up in one of the endless avenues of multitiered shelving where I pick a random row of merchandise .
There is a copy of the American Theatre Book of Monologues next to various opera CDs next to five editions of the AA Golf Course Guide 2008 .
Hang on .
2008 ?
Why bother stocking copies of a guide book that is a year out of date ?
' Someone might want them , ' says Allan .
' People still buy vinyl LPs .
Jeff Bezos has always had a vision of a place where any customer can find absolutely anything . '
Not even a Princeton - educated multi-billionaire like Jeff Bezos could find his own shoelaces round here without one of the all - knowing computer guns .
These hand - held devices are to the ' associate ' what the ball of string was to Theseus as he sought the Minotaur in the Labyrinth of Knossos .
They are your compass , your friend , your sanity ...
The more you are immersed into all this controlled chaos , the more you realise there is nothing chaotic about it .
It is , actually , a piece of logistical genius .
In management consultant circles , it is a work of art - the Mona Lisa of distribution , the Venus de Milo of shelf - stacking .
Two fundamental processes are at work here .
The first is bringing in millions of different items and putting them somewhere .
The second is finding them again and sending them out .
Allan takes me to the starting point , a concrete expanse next to 30 loading bays where all incoming products are scanned and plonked in yellow crates .
These automatically shoot off to a far corner of the Amazon jungle where the computer has identified a bit of empty shelving .
An ' associate ' merely has to move the contents from crate to shelf .
Meanwhile , out in the real world , you or I might decide we want to send the AA Golf Course Guide 2008 and a Philips kettle to someone in Timbuktu .
We type our order on our keyboard and - ping !
- it is instantly digested by the omniscient computer which redirects our command to the nearest ' associate ' on picking duty .
It does n't matter if it 's 2 am .
This place never sleeps ( except on Christmas Day ) .
Everyone 's doing it : Experts say £ 17 million will be spent every hour today on online stores
Santa logs on : Just what kind of a global distribution network does the great man have ?
Each ' picker ' is allocated precisely enough orders to fill a trolley and the gun even calculates the fastest route between products .
It 's like shopping with sat nav .
So our kettle and book end up in an orange crate which is automatically propelled to somewhere called ' binning ' .
' Binners ' then separate orders and push them to ' shippers ' , who pack them .
The computer even tells them which one of 15 differently - shaped pieces of cardboard to wrap them in for the optimum fit .
Perhaps it also tells them when it 's time to go to the loo or do something about their wedding anniversary .
Suddenly , I spot a tiny ray of human creativity in a far corner .
It 's the gift - wrapping department .
And they really are wrapping by hand .
How do they choose which wrapping suits which customer ?
Er , they do n't .
The computer has already decreed red paper for small packages , broad gold paper for big ones and assorted silver boxes for funny shapes .
It must be said , though , that the staff seem to like all the automation .
Many have worked here for years .
Once an order is packed and ready to go , the Amazon monster weighs it , labels it and , in the blink of an eye , flings it into the right chute for the right bin for the right lorry .
Here , over a few seconds , is a random list of destinations : County Cork , Austria , Australia , Wirral , Somerset , London . . .
Amazon has five monsters in Britain ( Milton Keynes , Swansea , two in Scotland and a temporary Christmas plant in Peterborough ) .
More than half of the company 's global business is outside America and much of that is handled via Britain and Germany .
With 10,000 staff under his wing , Allan Lyall is running an outfit the size of a major airline .
So , what is the failure rate ?
' I think it 's nought point nought nought something per cent , ' says the 49 - year - old Scottish systems expert , somewhat surprised that anyone should voice such a silly thought .
They may be cocky , but do n't you wish this lot were in charge of baggage - handling at our airports ?
I cannot resist a shameless vanity exercise , even if it does make me look just like that Yellow Pages ad ( remember dear old JR Hartley hunting down his book about flyfishing ? ) .
Can the computer track down a certain Monarchy : The Royal Family At Work by , ahem , Robert Hardman ?
No problem .
Not only do they find my book on one shelf , sandwiched between Led Zeppelin DVDs and Farrow & Ball : The Art Of Colour , but I 'm elsewhere too .
Moments later , I find my book sitting between The Oxford History Of Music Volume 5 and Erotic Confessions ( I wonder which will sell out first ) .
While flattered to be in several places at once , it turns out that this is standard .
Allan explains it is deliberate policy to scatter batches of the same product all over the building because it is more efficient .
If a ' picker ' has to find a copy of , say , my book plus a Philips kettle , it 's much easier if there are random quantities of both near each other rather than at opposite ends of a building the size of Stoke - on - Trent .
Today , this entire system will undergo the greatest challenge in its short history .
For some reason , online shopping reaches its peak on the first Monday of December .
Last year , ' Mega Monday ' at Amazon saw a best - ever 1.4 million British orders in 24 hours and the computer has calculated that 2009 will beat that record by up to a third .
This is astonishing and faintly depressing for those of us who prefer to leave our shopping until Christmas Eve .
However , help is at hand .
Amazon promises it can deliver December 24 shopping to certain postcodes by the same evening , just like Father Christmas .
Ten pregnant servicewomen
sent home from Afghanistan war
Ten British servicewomen on operations in Afghanistan have been sent back to the UK in the past six months after becoming pregnant .
A number of the soldiers may have become pregnant after having relationships with their colleagues .
The cases raise the prospect of soldiers being investigated for breaching sexual conduct rules , the Ministry of Defence said last night .
Soldiers must adhere to a ' no - touching ' rule .
Ten female soldiers have been sent home after falling pregnant
Those who abuse their position , or take advantage of a colleague who may be separated from their partner for a long period of time , are subject to disciplinary procedures which can include dismissal .
The pregnant Servicewomen were sent home between April 30 and October 31 this year under military rules which ban pregnant women from being on battle duty .
It was unclear last night how many , if any , of the women fell pregnant after being sent to war .
Some may have conceived before they went to the battle zone and only discovered they were pregnant having embarked on their tour of duty , the MoD said .
‘ It is not an offence for a Servicewoman to be pregnant , ’ an MoD source said last night .
‘ But there is a code of conduct and it is to do with anything that would damage operational effectiveness . ’
The source insisted it would be ‘ difficult ’ for Servicewomen to become pregnant in Afghanistan because very few troops had private bedrooms .
A spokesman added : ‘ If women become or discover they are pregnant on operations , they are returned to the UK at the first opportunity . ’
Former Army commander Lieutenant Colonel Robin Matthews told the Sunday Mirror : ' Together , both servicemen and women face an uncertain future and , as those bonds of war strengthen , inevitably relationships will develop . '
Women make up around nine per cent of the Armed Forces and some 80,000 troops have been sent to Afghanistan since the war began in 2001 .
With its internal wiring hanging from the open cargo doors like the entrails of a gutted whale , passenger jet VT - EYF – the one - time pride of the Air India fleet – was yesterday just the latest multimillion - pound flying machine to come to Kemble Airfield to die .
In front of the 18 - year - old Airbus , which would have cost its owners £ 30 m new , stood the sorry remains of an identical plane , an A320 operated until this summer by Spanish airline Click .
Propped up incongruously on a pile of railway sleepers , it was already shorn of the engines , on - board computers and avionics that together will fetch about £ 400,000 – a fraction of their original price .
Against a backdrop of the Cotswold hills , three giant Boeing 747s which had until recently been plying their trade in southern Africa as freighters , await their turn in the new year to be painstakingly stripped of anything of value , before their gleaming aluminium airframes meet the jaws of an industrial wrecking machine .

Welcome to the unlikely epicentre of one of the few booming sectors of the global aviation industry – the dismantling , recycling and crushing of aircraft that are no longer needed by airlines who find themselves with older , inefficient jets that can not be filled or sold .
The result is that an anonymous former military airbase in Gloucestershire has become the world 's most prolific aircraft boneyard , with dozens of passenger planes until recently operating in locations from the Seychelles to the Ukraine making one final , smoky flight across the globe to a fatal meeting with the cutting tools of professional dismantlers .
Kemble Airfield , a sprawling expanse of hangars and asphalt near Cirencester which was Britain 's busiest RAF base during the Second World War , is the operating base of Air Salvage International ( ASI ) , a British company which has eviscerated more than 350 jets in its short history and , in the teeth of the credit crunch , seen its scrapping business double in the last 12 months .
The phenomenon is part of a global shift in the aviation industry which will see 12,500 passenger planes around the world reach the end of their useful life over the next 20 years .
That 's 400 - plus aircraft a year to be recycled , stripped of their usable components and compacted into scrap metal .
From business class seats being snapped up by enthusiasts for their front rooms to sections of airframe used by colleges to train would - be flight attendants , the contents of aircraft that once commanded prices up to $ 148 m ( £ 89 m ) are now being sold off for a song after being torn apart in Gloucestershire 's aviation charnel house .
The steady stream of Boeings and Airbuses to Kemble Airfield is the price that the aviation industry is paying for the years during the credit boom when airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair , and bank - backed leasing companies , placed huge orders with manufacturers .
The recession claimed dozens of carriers and inflicted heavy damage on the finances of many others , from British Airways to American Airlines , as they struggled to keep their fleets profitable .
As the price of new aircraft dipped and passengers stayed at home , airlines have mothballed more than 3,000 jets and turboprops , including ageing short - haul workhorses such as MD80s , Boeing 737s and Airbus A320s , in the desert conditions of America and southern Europe .
Almost all are destined for the scrapyard .

Owen Geach , commercial director of the International Bureau of Aviation , an industry consultancy , said : " There is a range of aircraft which are increasingly expensive to operate and , in the current economic circumstances , their owners are reaching the conclusion that more money can be made from parting them out rather than keeping them in the air .
" There is now a healthy underbelly of activity in the industry that is the recycling and dismantling sector .
Not so long ago , these were companies that just took a chainsaw to an airframe .
Nowdays it is a more sophisticated industry . "
With the aviation industry 's environmental image battered by its contribution to the emissions that cause global warming , it has spotted an opportunity that when it comes to ending the life of a passenger jet , its methods should be eco-friendly .
Boeing and Airbus have signed up to guidelines which ensure that at least 70 per cent of every plane they have produced is recycled , with that proportion rising to more than 95 per cent as technology improves .
But it is left to the likes of ASI , a founding member of the Aircraft Fleet Recycling Association , the industry body which is overseeing the rapid expansion of the dismantling sector , to get down and dirty with the unwanted jets by recovering all usable components for sale on the market in certified second - hand aircraft parts , now worth £ 1.2 bn a year .
Mark Gregory , ASI 's managing director , said : " Breaking up an aircraft is a last resort .
These are multimillion - pound machines which their owners would rather not see disappear off their balance sheet if they can possibly help it .
If you send an aircraft for dismantling you are looking at a 90 per cent loss on its listed value .
" But we have reached a point where there are simply more of these aircraft out there than the global market can sustain and they are worth more broken up into their parts .
We have never been busier – at times we 've had four or five aircraft arriving each week . "
Engineers at Kemble Airfield spend anywhere between two months and 12 weeks fastidiously deconstructing each jet , testing all its systems before draining its lifeblood of fuel and hydraulic fluid , and removing and labelling each re-usable part from the rudder to the football - shaped fire extinguishers that lie in the wings .
Inside this cordoned - off aircraft abattoir , a line of engine cowlings stands beside cockpits that have been surgically sliced away from their airframes ready to be shipped to customers who will use them as flight simulators or props in colleges for trainee in - flight attendants .
Faded markings attest to the previous lives of these dinosaurs of the sky – one flight deck sports a sticker for the 40th anniversary of Air India while another bears the name of the aircraft , La Belle Creole .
The company has even built up a thriving trade in reclinable first and business class seats , complete with their television screens and reading lights , which are snapped up by aircraft enthusiasts for about £ 300 each .
They would have cost about £ 5,000 in a new aircraft .
Figures produced by the International Bureau of Aviation provide stark evidence of a drastic fall in prices for passenger jets , old and new .
A new Airbus A320 or Boeing 737 now costs 8 per cent less than it did in 2008 .
Older jets have suffered an even more dramatic fall : a 20 - year - old 737 now has a list price of $ 5.8 m ( £ 3.5 m ) – a drop of 24 per cent in 12 months .
Industry sources told The Independent that the going rate for super - annuated passenger planes on the open market is even less , with one 20 - year - old 737 on offer to anyone with £ 1.5 m going spare .
Such is the extent of the plunge in values that a German bank last month decided to scrap the 737 it operates on lease and instead rent out the engines – by far the most valuable component of an aircraft – for £ 40,000 per month .
Pointing a finger towards passenger jet VT - EYF , which had been denuded of its nose cone and was awaiting the removal of its engines , Mr Gregory said : " It 's actually quite sad .
Some of these planes are beautiful machines in very good condition .
They have been looked after to the last degree .
And then they come here .
The problem is they 're just not wanted any more . "

( PhysOrg.com ) --
British scientists are aiming to develop a device that can detect the smell of fear , and that could one day identify terrorists , drug smugglers , and other criminals .
The 18 - month project to develop two sensor systems is being carried out at the City University London , and is being led by Professor Tong Sun .
The project has funding from the Home Office Scientific Development Branch .
After a feasibility study is complete , two devices are expected to be designed to identify the fear pheromone in human sweat ; one by laser absorption , and the other by a portable optical fiber instrument .
The devices could be used to help police identify abnormal behavior at big events such as the 2012 Olympics .
The research project follows on from evidence gained last year in the US by scientists who collected the underarm sweat of 20 novice skydivers about to make their first jump .
They then asked other volunteers , ignorant of the experiment 's nature , to smell the samples via a nebulizer , while their brains were scanned .
The study found the smell of fear is real , and that the parts of the brain associated with fear responded to the smell of fear .
The British scientists hope to use the effect to develop security systems that can detect the fear pheromone .
The challenge , according to Sun , is in identifying and characterizing the specific chemical signature for human fear , especially fear related to criminal acts .
The research will also examine potential problems such as interference by deodorants and perfumes , and will look at variations in pheromone production in different people .
Professor
Sun said prototypes of the " fear detectors " could be developed within a couple of years , and she added that she saw no reason why there could not be similar detectors to identify other human odors by age , gender or race , in order to build a profile of a criminal .

No surprise here : The Federal Reserve Bank of New York , in a desperate headlong rush to rescue American International Group , screwed the pooch .
Despite holding all of the cards , cash and power , they still managed to manuver themselves into a corner with “ little negotiating room . ”
So says the most recent audit from the Office of the Special Inspector General ( SIG ) for the TARP program ( full embed here ) :
“ SIGTARP concludes that : ( 1 ) the original terms of federal assistance to AIG , including the high interest rate it adopted from the private bank ’s initial term sheet , inadequately addressed AIG ’s long term liquidity concerns , thus requiring further Government support ; ( 2 ) FRBNY ’s negotiating strategy to pursue concessions from counterparties offered little opportunity for success , even in light of the willingness of one counterparty to agree to concessions ; ( 3 ) the structure and effect of FRBNY ’s assistance to AIG , both initially through loans to AIG , and through asset purchases in connection with Maiden Lane III effectively transferred tens of billions of dollars of cash from the Government to AIG ’s counterparties , even though senior policy makers contend that assistance to AIG ’s counterparties was not a relevant consideration in fashioning the assistance to AIG ; and ( 4 ) while FRBNY may eventually be made whole on its loan to Maiden Lane III , it is difficult to assess the true costs of the Federal
Reserve ’s actions until there is more clarity as to AIG ’s ability to repay all of its assistance from the Government .
SIGTARP also draws lessons that should be learned regarding the importance of transparency andratings agencies had on the AIG bailout . ”
In other words , the deal that was cut in November 2008 with AIGs counter - party banks resulted in those banks being paid off in full for high risk credit - market bets .
Had AIG gone bankrupt , these firms would have recieved pennies on the dollar .
The banks that benefited the most included Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , Merrill Lynch and large French banks Société Générale and Calyon .
( See table below )
The New York Fed said its goal was to “ prevent a system - wide collapse ” and not obtain the best deal possible .
So they got played for patsies .
Here ’s the WSJ :
The “ SIGTARP ” audit provides a window into a bailout effort that has been shrouded by a lack of disclosure — acknowledged in the report — and questions over why the U.S. government in effect funneled tens of billions of dollars to U.S. and European banks that were AIG ’s trading partners .
In November 2008 , less than two months after the New York Fed first bailed out AIG with an $ 85 billion credit line , the government restructured its aid to AIG as the insurer ’s cash needs mounted amid the market downturn .
The revamped package included a company called Maiden Lane III buying complex mortgage - linked securities from U.S. and European banks to cancel insurance contracts that AIG ’s financial –products division had written on the securities .
The banks were effectively paid par , or 100 cents on the dollar , for those securities , which had declined significantly in value due to rising home - loan defaults .
The report acknowledged challenges the regulators faced , including insistence by most of the banks and a French bank regulator that they be paid in full .
But the report said the “ refusal ” of the Federal Reserve and New York Fed “ to use their considerable leverage , ” in negotiations with the trading partners “ made the possibility of obtaining concessions from those counterparties extremely remote . ”
Its simply embarrassing and pathetic . . .

Posted by : James Brown Date : January 08 , 2009 10:05AM
I can't find the definition of " sending data " time duration ( show profile ) .
My query spends the most of the time in this state ...
I could understand it if my query retrieves a lot of data , but my query is a SELECT COUNT (* ) , so there is no data being sent , is it ?
Any idea about what " sending data " means ?
Thanks in advance

The LHC is built inside a 27 km - long circular tunnel The Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) experiment on the French - Swiss border has set a new world record for energy .
The LHC pushed the energy of its particle beams beyond one trillion electron volts , making it the world 's highest - energy particle accelerator .
The previous record was held by the Tevatron particle accelerator in Chicago .
Officials say it is another milestone in the LHC 's drive towards its main scientific tests set for 2010 .
The LHC is designed to smash together beams of sub-atomic particles at just under the speed of light .
Researchers hope to see signs of new physics in the aftermath of the collisions , helping them unlock the secrets of the Universe .
Operated by the European Organisation for Nuclear Research ( better known by its French acronym Cern ) , the LHC is built inside a 27 km - long circular tunnel .
' Pilot beam '
" We are still coming to terms with just how smoothly the LHC commissioning is going , " said Cern 's director general Rolf Heuer .
" It is fantastic .
However , we are continuing to take it step - by - step , and there is still a lot to do before we start physics in 2010 .
I 'm keeping my champagne on ice until then . "
Until now the LHC had been operating at a relatively low energy of 450 billion electron volts .
On Sunday , engineers increased the energy of this " pilot beam " , reaching 1.18 trillion electron volts at 2344 GMT .
The previous record of 0.98 trillion electron volts has been held by the Tevatron accelerator since 2001 .
The LHC is eventually expected to operate at some seven trillion electron volts .
Last week , the machine circulated two beams of protons for the first time and carried out its first low - energy beam collisions .
Researchers working on the collider have said they are delighted with the quick progress made since the machine restarted on 20 November .
The LHC had to be shut down for repairs shortly after its inauguration in September 2008 when an electrical fault caused one tonne of liquid helium to leak into the collider 's tunnel .

The true dangers of trans fats
( Natural News )
Of all the poisons in the food supply , trans fats are perhaps the most frequently overlooked .
They 're hidden in all sorts of foods , from crackers and baked goods to breakfast cereals .
And thanks to intentionally deceptive FDA - approved labeling laws , food products that contain sizable amounts of trans fatty acids can still declare " trans fats free " right on their labels ( this clever trick involves reducing serving sizes until the trans fat level drops to 0.5 grams , at which point the FDA says companies can just " round down " to zero ) .
But just how damaging are trans fats , really ?
Here , we 've gathered an important collection of information that helps answer that question .
Read this before you take another bite of a cookie , cracker or other baked food item .
Keep trans fats out of your body and you 'll be far healthier and more mentally alert !
Shortening consists of almost one - fifth trans fats , and some brands of margarine contain almost one - fourth trans fats .
The oils used to cook French fries and fried chicken in the United States consist of about 40 percent trans fats , and the amount increases when the cooking oil is heated .
Trans fats now account for about 7.5 percent of the fat calories consumed in the United States , and the average American eats nearly five pounds of trans fats each year .
The downside for consumers is the dangerous trans fats that are formed with hydrogenation .
The ingestion of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and the trans fats that are formed with this process has been linked to increases in cancer , heart disease , and many other chronic degenerative disorders .
What is wrong with trans fats ?
Trans fats , formed during hydrogenation , are actually toxic substances for our cell membranes .
When our cells contain an overabundance of trans fats , the cells become leaky and distorted .
This can promote vitamin and mineral deficiencies .
The amount of trans fats consumed daily in the United States varies tremendously from person to person .
Trans fats are so common in processed foods that the average consumer does not know how much he or she is consuming .
Trans fats have no cholesterol .
Trans fats have no trace compounds that may be beneficial to health .
Trans fats are very useful to the food industry and , if replaced , a proper substitute must be found .
Suggestions have been made for partial replacements to keep their level low .
Palm oil could be a good choice .
It is not always easy to make sense of the research on trans fats but here 's the short answer : if you can avoid trans fats , you should .
These fatty acids may be only a small part of your total dietary fat , but small changes in your diet can add up to significant health benefits , and this is one change that is well worth making .
Although the amount of trans fatty acids appearing in margarine and shortening has been reduced in the United States , these damaging fats are still found in many other foods such as bakery items and fast food products .
Trans fats become a major part of American diets when the 30 pounds of French fries consumed per capita are factored into dietary analysis .
Trans fats often hide on dietary labels as partially hydrogenated fats .
Learn to read labels and avoid trans fats .
Growing public awareness regarding the dangers imposed by trans fats has prompted a reduction in their consumption .
Given the overwhelming evidence of the link between trans fats and diseases like cancer , cardiovascular disease and diabetes - all of which will be discussed in more detail - you might wonder what sort of bizarre justification the FDA could come up with for protecting the food industry by not requiring the listing of trans fats on these nutrition facts labels years ago .
Hold on to your seat , because here it is :
The FDA has decided that since trans fats should be entirely avoided in the diets of all human beings , there is consequently no recommended daily allowance of trans fats .
Finally , in the United States , the FDA has ruled that , by 2006 , all trans fats must be listed on food labels , thus allowing shoppers to make informed decisions about what they put in their bodies .
Trans fats are often found in processed and convenience foods .
Read labels carefully to avoid products containing them .
If the ingredient list contains partially hydrogenated vegetable ( or corn , soybean , or canola ) oil or vegetable shortening , the product contains trans fats .
Here are a few common culprits - they may surprise you .
But hydrogenation has serious health consequences because it creates trans fats .
Trans fats are polyunsaturated vegetable oils that have been processed to make them remain solid at room temperature .
Trans fats also come from frying food in polyunsaturated vegetable oils , such as corn oil , sunflower oil , safflower oil , and soy oil , all of which are not bad for you until they are heated .
As you may know , trans fats increase the level of bad LDL cholesterol in your bloodstream and lower your level of good HDL cholesterol .
It has been suspected for some years that trans fats may be no better for us than saturated fats , but more evidence is emerging and it now seems that perhaps trans fats can actually be more damaging , for instance in the case of heart disease .
It now appears , according to a very large American trial , that trans fats not only raise levels of LDL blood cholesterol ( the " baddie " ) but also lower levels of the " good " cholesterol , HDL .
Trans fats are the only types of fat to do this - natural saturated fats , such as butter or cheese , may raise LDL levels but also raise HDL levels .
They occur naturally at low levels in meat and dairy products , but most of the trans fats in the American diet are formed during a hydrogenation process that renders vegetable oils solid .
Trans fatty acids inflict damage akin to the effects of saturated fats , except trans fats hit you with a double whammy - in addition to raising LDL levels , trans fats decrease your HDL levels at the same time .
This is one reason many researchers consider trans fats to be a bigger bad boy than saturated fats .
Trans fats make the coronary arteries more rigid and contribute to the formation of blood clots , which can lead to heart attack or stroke .
Trans fats also reduce HDL ( " good " ) cholesterol levels and increase LDL ( " bad " ) cholesterol .
According to a study by Dr. Walter Willett , chairman of the department of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health , approximately 30,000 premature heart disease deaths each year can be attributed to the consumption of trans fats .
In 2006 , the FDA began to require food companies to list trans fats ( which are linked to pre-diabetes and cardiovascular disease ) in Nutrition Facts boxes ; however , amounts of trans fats that are less than 0.5 ( one - half ) gram per serving do not have to be listed .
In other words , products containing 0.49 gram of trans fats ( or less ) can be labeled as having zero trans fats per serving .
The catch ?
People can easily consume one or more grams by eating a large serving or two servings .
There is now a lot of interesting work going on regarding the health effects of trans fats , and what is clear is that trans fats appear to be doing many nasty things .
Besides affecting the LDL and HDL , trans fats increase triglycerides , and they increase the dysfunction of the endothelium in arteries , that layer of cells lining blood vessels , which increases risk of heart attack .
Lp(a ) is now recognized as an independent lipid risk factor for coronary heart disease , and trans fats compared to saturated fats do raise Lp( a ) .
Again , that 's also something we do n't really understand .
These trans fats can lower HDL , the good cholesterol , something that saturated fats do not do .
The larger the intake of trans fats , the greater the lowering of the HDL .
Recent research shows some deleterious effects of trans fats on the particle size of LDL and levels of Lp( a ) , both indicators of heart disease risk .
The presence of natural unsaturated fats may play a protective role when trans fats are consumed as it does when saturated fats are consumed .
Manufacturers of trans fat may find other ways to hydrogenate that yield a different kind of fat .
Another surprising place to find trans fats is in cow 's milk .
Cows are ruminant animals , which means that they regurgitate partially digested food from their four - compartment stomachs , chew it a while , and swallow it again .
Bacteria in their stomachs produce trans fats , which end up in milk fat .
The amount of trans fats produced varies over the year and is higher in the summer than the winter .
Consumption of trans fats in the United States tripled from the early 1900s until the mid-1960s , when it began to decline .
In 2003 , the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the level of trans fats in the diet should be as low as possible .
Amounts as low as 2 or 3 grams of trans fat a day can increase risk of heart disease .
Look for hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated on food labels to identify those that contain trans fats .
The nurses ' health study revealed that women who ate the greatest amount of trans fats had a 50 percent greater risk of heart disease .
In July 2003 , the Food and Drug Administration mandated that trans fats be listed on food and supplement labels by 2006 .
One variant of hydrogenated oils , the so - called trans fats , deserves some special mention .
You 've read the headlines : " Doctors Find That Margarine Is as Bad as Butter . "
The accompanying news stories said that trans fats , which are found in supposedly healthful margarine , could push your cholesterol level through the roof .
Appropriately concerned consumers started to check the labels on margarine and other foods .
But they never found the words trans fats on any of them , either in the ingredient lists or on the government - required nutrition labels .
What 's going on here ?
The most harmful fats were trans fats and hydrogenated fats .
Trans fats are formed when liquid vegetable oils go through a chemical process called hydrogenation .
Hydrogen added to fat makes it more solid .
Trans fats are not normally found in nature , and our bodies have a hard time metabolizing them .
( Sound familiar ?
I liken this to the difference between synthetic and natural hormones . )
Industry loves trans fats because products made with them never seem to go bad ( it seems bacteria can't handle them , either ) .
Most people are at least somewhat aware of the dangers of " trans fats " since they have received so much media attention over the last few years .
But few people are aware that all hydrogenated oils contain trans fats .
And few people read labels of the foods they buy , so even though they know trans fats are dangerous to their health , they buy them and eat them anyway !
Despite the opposition of powerful food lobbies , the FDA finally mandated the labeling of foods containing trans fats , beginning on January 1 , 2006 .
This was almost three years after it created the regulation in July 2003 and more than a decade after the dangers of these fats were clear .
The FDA estimates that just making people aware of the dangers of trans fats with the new labeling regulations will save between $ 900 million and $ 1.8 billion each year in medical costs , lost productivity , pain , and suffering .
Of all the fats , we find the so - called synthetic , or trans fats , to be the most dangerous .
These man-made products are fats that have been altered chemically to produce new substances .
The reason the food industry created trans fats is that these fats are very resistant to oxidation ( or going rancid ) , giving foods with high trans fat content a very long and stable shelf life .
Trans fats include partially hydrogenated fats , margarine , and shortening ; today they can be found in every aisle of the supermarket .
Partially saturated or partly hydrogenated oil almost invariably contains trans fats .
Oils that have been made into margarine contain significant amounts of trans fats , although food processors have made recent efforts to reduce the trans fat content of some margarines .
Most processed foods and baked goods contain partially hydrogenated oils , and there is now a significant amount of these abnormal fats in the Western diet .
These fats increase the risk of developing heart disease and cancer more than natural saturated fats .
In addition , trans fats interfere with normal immune function .
Fortunately , as awareness about trans fats increases , more products like " trans - fat free " or " non-hydrogenated " margarines are becoming available .
Labeling is improving too .
While listing the trans fat content in food labels has long been up to the manufacturer 's discretion , a report from the Institute of Medicine , concluding that there is no safe level of trans fats in the diet , finally prompted the Food and Drug Administration to require that trans fats be listed as part of the Nutrition Facts food label .
This decision came after several years of negotiations .
For example , spreadable tub margarine is less hydrogenated ( and less hard ) than stick margarine and so has fewer trans fats .
Most of the trans fats in the American diet are found in commercially prepared baked goods , margarines , snack foods , and processed foods .
Commercially prepared fried foods , like French fries and onion rings , also contain a good deal of trans fat .
Trans fats are worse for cholesterol levels than saturated fats because they not only raise LDL ( lethal ) cholesterol but also lower HDL ( healthy ) cholesterol - a real double whammy .
Saturated Fats - Just Plain Bad .
Most of these enticing desserts , fried foods , and convenience foods are deadly , heart - attack - causing foods , even if they contain no animal products and no cholesterol , because of the trans fats they contain .
Even Orville Redenbacher 's natural microwavable popcorn contains artery - clogging trans fats .
More than two years ago , the Center for Science in the Public Interest petitioned the FDA to count trans fat as saturated fat on labels and to ban claims like " low cholesterol " or " low saturated fat " on foods that are high in trans fats .
It is speculated that substituting foods rich in trans fats with polyunsaturated fats could reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by nearly 40 percent ( Salmeron et al. 2001 ) .

As this study shows , there exists evidence that trans fats also promote diabetes in adult human beings .
If you did n't have enough reasons to avoid trans fats already ( heart disease and cancer ) , this is a third one : diabetes .
