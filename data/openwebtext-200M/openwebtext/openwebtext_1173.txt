LPC : 25 years of X

The X Window System quietly hit its 25th anniversary back in June ; it is , undoubtedly , one of the oldest and most successful free software projects in existence .
Keith Packard has been working with X for most of that time ; at the Linux Plumbers Conference in Portland he used his keynote address to look at the highlights ( and lowlights ) of those 25 years and some of the lessons that have been learned .
The version of X we know today is X11 .
There were nine predecessor versions ( one got skipped ) , but the first version to escape widely was X10 , which was released in 1986 .
Companies were shipping it , and the vendors which formed the X Consortium were starting to think that the job was done , but the X developers successfully pleaded for the opportunity to make one more " small " set of revisions to the X protocol .
The result was X11 - a complete reworking of the whole system - which was released on September 15 , 1987 ; it is still running today .
There was a wealth of new ideas in X11 , some of which made more sense than others .
One of those ideas was the notion of an external window manager .
In X , the window manager is just another process working with the same API .
This approach helped to create a consistent API across windows , and it also made it possible to manage broken ( non-responding ) applications in a way that some other systems still can't do .
On the other hand , the external window manager created a lot of on - screen flashing - a problem which still pops up today - and it does not work entirely well with modern compositing techniques , getting in the way of the page - flipping operations needed to make things fast .
The use of selections for cut - and - paste operations was another early X11 innovation .
With selections , the source of selected data advertises its availability , and the destination requests it in the desired format .
This mechanism allows data to be selected and moved between applications in almost any format .
Unfortunately , the " cut buffer " concept was left in , so applications had to support both modes ; the fact that Emacs was not updated to use selections for a very long time did not help .
The existence of multiple selections created interoperability problems between applications .
On the other hand , the selection mechanism proved to be a very nice foundation for drag - and - drop interfaces , and it handled the transition to Unicode easily .
Input has been the source of a number of problems .
The requirement that applications specify which events they want made sense when the focus was on trying to make the best use of a network connection , but it led to some interesting behavioral changes depending on how applications selected their events .
X was meant to be a policy - free system , but , in retrospect , the rules for event delivery were a significant amount of policy wired into the lowest levels of the system .
" Grabs , " where an application can request exclusive delivery of specific events , were a case in point .
" Passive grabs " allow window managers to bind to specific keys ( think alt - middle to resize a window ) , but that required a non-intuitive " parent window gets it first " policy when these grabs are in use .
" Synchronous grabs " were worse .
They were intended to help create responsive interfaces in the face of slow networks and slow applications ; clicking on a window and typing there will do the right thing , even if the system is slow to respond to the click and direct keyboard focus correctly .
It was a complicated system , hard to program to , harder to test , and it required potentially infinite event storage in the X server .
And it 's really unnecessary ; no applications use it now .
This " feature " is getting in the way of more useful features , like event redirection ; it may eventually have to be removed even at the cost of breaking the X11 protocol .
Text input was not without problems of its own ; X went to considerable effort to describe what was written on every key , and required applications to deal with details like keyboard maps and modifier keys .
It worked reasonably well for English - language input , but poorly indeed for Asian languages .
The addition of the XIM internationalization layer did not really help ; it was all shoved into the Xlib library and required that applications be rewritten .
It also forced the installation of a large set of core fonts , despite the fact that most of them would never be used .
Text output was " an even bigger disaster . "
It required that fonts be resident in the server ; applications then needed to pull down large sets of font metrics to start up .
That was bad enough , but generating the font metrics required the server to actually rasterize all of the glyphs - not fun when dealing with large Asian fonts .
Adding fonts to the system was an exercise in pain , and Unicode " never happened " in this subsystem .
In retrospect , Keith says , there was an obvious warning in the fact that neither FrameMaker nor Xdvi - the two applications trying to do serious text output at that time - used the core fonts mechanism .
This warning might have been heeded by moving font handling into clients ( as eventually happened ) , but what was done at that time , instead , was to layer on a whole set of new kludges .
Font servers were introduced to save space and make addition of fonts easier .
The XLFD ( X logical font description ) mechanism inflicted font names like :
- adobe- courier - medium - r- normal--14-100-100-100-m-90-iso8859-1
on the world without making life easier for anybody .
The compound text mechanism brought things forward to iso - 2022 , but could n't handle Unicode - and , once again , it required rewriting applications .
The X drawing model had amusing problems of its own .
It was meant to be " PostScript lite , " but , to get there , it dispensed with small concepts like paths , splines , and transforms , and it required the use of circular pens .
So there really was n't much of PostScript left .
The model required precise pixelization , except when zero - width " thin " lines were used - but all applications ended up using thin lines .
Precise pixelization was a nice concept , and it was easily tested , but it was painfully slow in practice .
The use of circular pens was the source of more pain ; the idea was taken from the PostScript " Red Book , " but , by then , the PostScript folks had already figured out that they were hard to work with and had kludged around the problem .
A line drawn with a circular pen , in the absence of antialiasing , tends to vary in width - it looks blobby .
The generation of these lines also required the calculation of square roots in the server , which was not the way to get the best performance .
Even so , people had figured out how to do circular pens right , but nobody in the X team knew about that work , so X did not benefit from it .
Rather than provide splines , the X11 protocol allowed for the drawing of ellipses .
But there was a catch : ellipses had to be aligned with the X or Y axis , no diagonal ellipses allowed .
There was a reason for this : there was a rumor circulating in those days that the drawing of non-axis - aligned ellipses involved a patented algorithm , and , for all of the usual reasons , nobody wanted to go and actually look it up .
It turns out that the method had been published in 1967 , so any patent which might have existed would have been expired .
But nobody knew that because nobody was willing to take the risks involved with researching the alleged patent ; even in the 1980's , software patents were creating problems .
As an added bonus , the combination of ellipses and circular pens requires the evaluation of quartic equations .
Doing that job properly requires the use of 128 - bit arithmetic ; 64 - bit floating - point numbers were not up to the job .
Color management was bolted on at a late date ; it , too , was shoved into the " thin and light " Xlib layer .
It provided lots of nice primitives for dealing with colors in the CIE color space , despite the fact that users generally prefer to identify colors with names like " red . "
So nobody ever used the color space features .
And the " color management " code only worked with X ; there was no provision for matching colors in output to graphic metafiles or printed output .
X color management was never a big hit .

All of these mistakes notwithstanding , one should not overlook the success of X as free software .
END QUOTE ]
All of these mistakes notwithstanding , one should not overlook the success of X as free software .
X predates version 1 of the GPL by some five years .
Once the GPL came out , Richard Stallman was a regular visitor to the X Consortium 's offices ; he would ask , in that persistent way he has , for X to change licenses .
That was not an option , though ; the X Consortium was supported by a group of corporations which was entirely happy with the MIT license .
But in retrospect , Keith says , " Richard was right . "
X was an industry - supported project , open to " anybody but Sun . "
Sun 's domination of the workstation market at that time was daunting to vendors ; they thought that , if they could displace SunView with an industry - standard alternative , they would have an easier time breaking into that market .
Jim Gettys sold this idea , nearly single - handedly , to Digital Equipment Corporation ; it is , arguably , the first attempt to take over an existing market with free software .
It worked : those vendors destroyed Sun 's lock on the market - and , perhaps , Keith noted , the Unix workstation market as a whole .
There were problems , needless to say .
The MIT license discourages sharing of code , so every vendor took the X code and created its own , closed fork .
No patches ever came back to the free version of X from those vendors .
Beyond that , while the implementation of X11 was done mainly at DEC , the maintenance of the code was assigned to the X Consortium at MIT .
At that point , Keith said , all innovation on X simply stopped .
Projects which came out of the X Consortium in these days were invariably absolute failures : XIE , PEX , XIM , XCMS , etc .
There began the long , dark period in which X essentially stagnated .
X is no longer stagnant ; it is being heavily developed under freedesktop.org .
As X has come back to life , its developers have had to do a massive amount of code cleanup .
Keith has figured out a fail - safe method for the removal of cruft from an old code base .
The steps , he said , are these :
Publish a protocol specification and promise that there will be long - term support .
Realize failure .
" Accidentally " break things in the code .
Let a few years go by , and note that nobody has complained about the broken features .
Remove the code since it is obviously not being used .
Under this model , the XCMS subsystem was broken for five years without any complaints .
The DGA code has recently been seen to have been broken for as long .
The technique works , so Keith encouraged the audience to " go forth and introduce bugs . "
The important conclusion , though , is that , after 25 years , X survives and is going strong .
It is still able to support 20 - year - old applications .
There are few free software projects which can make that sort of claim .
For all its glitches , kludges , and problems , the X Window System is a clear success .
Felipe Massa behind the wheel of an F1 car for the first time since his accident
Felipe Massa has tested in a Formula 1 car for the first time since suffering a fractured skull , but Ferrari say he will not return to competition in 2009 .
Massa is making good progress since his crash in qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix in July and the 28 - year - old tested in an F2007 in Italy on Monday .
But Ferrari say they " want to proceed gradually " and do not intend to rush the Brazilian before he is ready .
" Talk of a proper return to F1 can wait until the start of 2010 , " they added .
Massa underwent neurological tests in Paris on Friday .
According to Ferrari , the outcome was " rather positive " , prompting the decision to allow him to get behind the wheel of a privately - owned F2007 on Monday .
In - season testing is banned in F1 , but the sport 's governing body the FIA gave Massa permission to test using GP2 tyres at Ferrari 's test track at Fiorano , as part of his rehabilitation .
" It went very well , " Massa said after his rain - hit session behind the wheel .
" It seems that what happened in July has n't changed anything .
" I did n't manage to do many laps because of the rain but everything we 've done up to now has been normal like before .
It 's positive for me and for the team to see I'm the same as before . "
Ferrari insist there is no chance of Massa making a comeback in 2009 , with only two races of the campaign remaining .
606 : DEBATE
" This is in no way a proper test session and looking at the stopwatch will not be on the agenda , " said the Ferrari statement .
" There will be plenty of time for that in 2010 , when , alongside Fernando Alonso , he will begin development work of the new single - seater .
" It is simply an opportunity for Felipe to renew his acquaintance with his natural environment , namely the race track . "
Massa was knocked unconscious by a loose car part and injured the area around his left eye , prompting fears at the time that he could have suffered loss of vision .
At one stage , he had hoped to return for the final grand prix of the season in Abu Dhabi on 1 November .
Massa feels fit to race now but has accepted he will have to wait until 2010 before making his competitive comeback .
He added : " I did n't have any vision problems and today I would be ready to do , not one race , but two straight after each other .
" Naturally there is a period of time that must elapse first for precautionary reasons .
But , having been in the car , I can say that I 'm the same as before the accident .
" ( We can ) start preparing for next year , which wo n't be an easy year because this one has been hard , and work to have a good car and fight for the championship . "

He loved records .
When given an elementary school assignment to “ write about something we had at home , ” he reeled off from memory the precise selections , composers , singers and dates of each band on an opera anthology ranging from 1909 to 1932 .
He also loved relics of bygone time , ingested horehound drops as snack food and was using the world “ talkie ” about movies in 1965 .
Among Mr. Page ’s extremely colorful examples of his obsessive , controlling boyhood behavior is his having gotten hold of  and then re-edited , following a scene - by - scene description of the original from a library book  an eight - millimeter print of the 12 - minute silent film “ The Great Train Robbery ” because he knew that a distributor had tampered with the original .
And there ’s more : in 1967 he was directing his own films and became the subject of a prizewinning documentary called “ A Day With Timmy Page . ”
Mr. Page ’s wing - nut film fanaticism led him to discover Bob Dylan ’s “ Bringing It All Back Home ” not for the obvious reasons but because Louella Parsons ’s biography of Jean Harlow appears amid the coffee - table clutter on the album ’s cover .
With seemingly effortless grace this book moves back and forth between Mr. Page ’s very private idiosyncrasies and those of the wider culture in which he came of age .
The fear and rigid conventionality of the 1950s were relatively easy for him .
The ’60s took more effort , but he worked hard to adapt .
He was sufficiently well assimilated to go with the flow , grow long hair and get a job in a record store , “ where I became the very model of the snide know - it - all counterperson we have all met and loathed . ”
“ Parallel Play ” is illustrated by a series of expertly chosen photos of the author that amount to a kind of time - lapse photography : from a little boy making an open - mouthed goldfish grimace ( “ Try as I might , I could n’t remember how to smile ” ) to a beret - wearing , contented - looking , broadly smiling professor .
He is on a park bench in Baltimore .
Thanks to the candid , companionable voice of his memoir , the implied invitation to sit down and discuss , oh , maybe the later Beach Boys records ( which he marvelously describes as “ vaporous , ethereal , elaborately ornamented musical clockworks , distinguished by a blossoming tenderness and sheer sonic splendor ” ) is all but irresistible .
But there is also a strain of mournfulness running through this book .
It ’s not about Asperger ’s , but it is intensified by the peculiar nature of Mr. Page ’s Asperger - governed perceptions .
Tirelessly logical , sometimes agonizingly so , he lives life in an extra dimension , with a sense of time that irrevocably links past and present , living and dead , ardent love affairs and broken ones .
The people who left him  and it seems to have happened a lot  are still with him .
The schoolmate who died in his teens has become , in Mr. Page ’s imagination , his aging contemporary .
The music heard at a long - ago party is still playing .
And the hardest job of Mr. Page ’s life , as “ Parallel Play ” conveys even in its brightest moments , has been to struggle for a way to make peace with it all .
La Compañía de Luz y Fuerza del Centro era una empresa estatal mexicana responsable del abastecimiento de suministro eléctrico en el centro del país , criticada por sus elevados costos que superaban los ingresos por ventas , lo que se hacía insostenible dado el creciente deterioro de las finanzas públicas del Estado en medio de una crisis global .
El fin de semana pasado , mientras la mayoría de los mexicanos miraban por televisión el partido que decidiría la clasificación definitiva de la selección nacional de fútbol al Mundial de Sudáfrica , unos 5.000 policías federales fueron desplegados en las 113 instalaciones de la compañía de luz .
Alrededor de 40.000 trabajadores perdieron su empleo de la noche a la mañana .
DW - WORLD habló con el experto Frank Priess , representante de la Fundación Konrad Adenauer .
DW - WORLD : Señor Priess , ¿cual es el ambiente que se respira en la ciudad de México tras la decisión de liquidar la compañía de Luz y Fuerza del Centro ?
Frank Priess :
En realidad la situación es bastante tranquila a pesar de que ha habido varias marchas .
Ayer hubo una manifestación frente al Parlamento y está anunciada una mega marcha para el jueves .
Pero hay un ambiente bastante tranquilo aunque con muchas opiniones encontradas , especialmente en el sindicato de electricistas y grupos afines a ellos , al igual que el señor López Obrador y sectores del Partido de la Revolución Democrática ( PRD ) , que están a favor de una derogación del decreto de liquidación de la empresa .
Al mismo tiempo en los medios hay muchas opiniones de usuarios de Luz y Fuerza que respaldan plenamente la medida .
Cinco mil agentes federales fueron desplegados en las instalaciones de la empresa estatal .
Se dice que era una empresa ineficiente que reflejaba las lacras del pasado , algunos la describen como una vieja empresa de Europa del Este .
¿ Era inevitable su cierre ?
Yo creo que sí , además hubo recomendaciones de auditores que señalaban que el funcionamiento de la empresa era inoperable , por la carga de subsidios provenientes del Estado , que era mucho más alta que el apoyo que reciben instituciones como la Universidad Autónoma de México ( UNAM ) .
Al mismo tiempo la empresa ofrecía tarifas comparativamente altas y un servicio muy ineficiente , lo que permitía , por ejemplo , la existencia de los famosos “ diablitos ” que evitaban la medición del costo del servicio eléctrico , sobre todo en el sector informal .
Se escuchan muchos casos de corrupción , incluso los contratos colectivos de trabajo , negociados hace décadas , están fuera de contexto para cualquier trabajador común y corriente aquí en México .
Tenían prestaciones como la jubilación con el 100 % del sueldo , aunque el trabajador hubiera prestado pocos años de servicio .
Todo esto se tradujo en una enorme carga para la empresa , enormes subsidios del Estado y precios muy altos por el suministro eléctrico .
México se ha visto fuertemente golpeado por la crisis económica , ¿responde esta medida a una situación de emergencia ?
La situación económica ha golpeado al país en distintos aspectos .
Por una parte la dependencia hacia EEUU adonde se destina el 85 % de las exportaciones .
La situación ha golpeado a México , reduciéndose fuertemente las remesas que mandan los mexicanos a su país .
El turismo ha disminuido por la amenaza de la gripe A , también pega el bajo precio del petróleo tratándose de un país exportador .
Tampoco ayuda la imagen de seguridad que tiene el país .
Por otra parte se discute el paquete presupuestal para el 2010 en donde el Estado piensa ahorrar unos 300.000 millones de pesos , entonces también busca la posibilidad de reducir costos .
Pero obviamente en este conflicto están mezcladas otras cuestiones , como la existencia de sindicatos establecidos de manera muy corporativista de décadas anteriores .
Miembros del sindicato de electricistas protestan en contra de la liquidación de Luz y Fuerza del Centro .
Luz y Fuerza suministraba de energía eléctrica al centro del país , cuál es el plan del gobierno mexicano ?
¿ Como se vive la situación tras la liquidación , no ha habido cortes de luz ?
Hoy en la mañana hubo apagones en la Delegación Coyoacán , ( al sur de la ciudad ) pero eso no es inusual .
Son épocas de fuertes lluvias y no se sabe si hay problemas en la empresa o es por la situación meteorológica .
Actualmente la Comisión Federal de Electricidad está manejando el suministro en la ciudad como en el resto del país .
El gobierno ha dicho claramente que no se busca una privatización del sector .
También ha ofrecido una recontratación de personal después de que acepte la liquidación que está en marcha .
Pero la nueva empresa operará con menos personal y bajo la dirección de la Comisión Federal de Electricidad .
Se dice que Calderón se juega su sexenio con esta medida , porque asume riesgos pero también la oportunidad de hacer imponer las leyes y la democracia .
Es muy difícil dar marcha atrás y eso se ve que sectores importantes del Partido Revolucionario Institucional ( PRI ) están respaldando la medida .
El senador Francisco Labastida dio ayer su pleno respaldo .
En el PRI veremos una cooperación medida , negociada , porque como tienen expectativas de regresar a la presidencia en el 2012 , rige cierta prudencia , tienen que buscar caminos en cuestiones económicas pues en algún momento tendrán esa herencia .
Eso ayudará al presidente Felipe Calderón tras el desastroso resultado en las elecciones de julio .
Urge reinventar la presidencia no solamente con el tema de seguridad sino con el tema económico que es el más importante para los mexicanos .

Two sunspots are visible on our star 's face for the first time in more than a year , possibly ending an unexpected lull in solar activity .
Solar flares rise and fall on an 11 - year cycle , so scientists thought sunspot activity would pick up some time in 2008 .
It did n't .
And this year has been quiet , too .
No sunspots have been visible on the sun for 80 percent of the days this year .
Sunspot activity is correlated with the total amount of energy we receive from the sun .
If the sun 's activity were to change remarkably , it would have an influence on global climate .
So , in the context of climate change , the fact that the current solar minimum has been the longest and deepest in more than a century has been of special interest .
In May , a big sunspot seemed to augur a return to normal , but it faded away and sunspotless days returned .
The latest activity might not mark the end of the solar minimum , however .
People have been counting sunspots since Galileo first observed one in the early 17th century .
Through the 28 documented cycles , stretching from 1745 to today , some variation in cycle length has been observed .
That 's why NASA 's former chief sunspot watcher , Michael Kaiser , told us earlier this year that the minimum was " not out of the extreme ordinary . "
The photo above is of one of the sunspots , AR 1026 .
It was sent to Wired.com by solar photographer Trevor Little .
Little lives in southern England and snaps his gorgeous photos with " a Solarmax 60 telescope and a Lumenera Skynyx 2 - 0 m CCD camera . "
If you 're an astronomer and you want to share images with Wired Science , please tweet us @wiredscience or send an e-mail to our editor , Betsy Mason .
( For you sticklers out there , the polarity of solar storms alternates , so technically , a full solar cycle is 22 years long . )

Not a Halloween montage , but no lobbying allowed in these families
The committee on June 9 authorized issuance of subpoenas to the Justice Department , the National Security Agency and the FBI for " certain intercepted communications " regarding Rep. Jane Harman ( D - Calif . ) .
As was reported earlier this year , Harman was heard in a 2005 conversation agreeing to an Israeli operative 's request to try to obtain leniency for two pro-Israel lobbyists in exchange for the agent 's help in lobbying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) to name her chairman of the intelligence committee .
The department , a former U.S. official said , declined to respond to the subpoena .
If Democrats are disappointed by Joe Lieberman ’s threat to filibuster any healthcare reform bill that includes a public option , they should n't be .
Despite all of his past promises to support universal healthcare , nothing was more predictable than the Connecticut senator 's fealty to the insurance and pharmaceutical lobbyists .
Much the same can be said of Sen.
Evan Bayh , who emerged from hiding on healthcare to announce that he too plans to filibuster against reform with the Republicans , regardless of what his constituents and Americans in general plainly want .
Like Lieberman , his state is home to powerful corporations that want reform killed -- and like Lieberman , his wife has brought home very big paychecks from those same interests .
The Lieberman family 's financial ties to the health industry are no secret , yet their full extent remains unknown .
During her husband 's 2006 reelection campaign , Hadassah Lieberman 's employment as a " senior counselor " to Hill & Knowlton , one of the world ’s biggest lobbying firms , briefly erupted as an issue , especially because the clients she served were in the controversial pharmaceutical and insurance sectors .
Exactly what she did for those clients has never been disclosed .
... The best that can be said about the Lieberman family 's conflict of interest is that it appears to have ended in 2005 -- while the Bayh family continues to collect enormous amounts of money from the same health insurance and drug companies that will benefit from her husband ’s actions .
Indeed , the smell of ethical rot arising from the Bayh household is even worse than the self - serving aroma that surrounds the Liebermans .
Susan Bayh was invited to join the board of Wellpoint back in 1998 , when the Indiana - based company was still called Anthem Insurance and had not yet completed the mergers that made it the largest health insurer in America ( and gave it monopoly status in many regions of the country ) .
According to her official biography on Wellpoint 's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission , her qualifications to sit on the board of a billion - dollar corporation were minimal , to put it politely .
She was 38 years old , teaching law at a local university , with limited experience as a corporate attorney at Eli Lilly & Co. , the big pharmaceutical company that is also headquartered in Indiana .
But then her husband , Evan , after two terms as governor , had just been elected to the United States Senate .
Susan Bayh 's compensation from Wellpoint , including the stock options that she has exercised repeatedly over the past 10 years , has reached an estimated $ 2 million , including last year 's director salary of over $ 300,000 .
She is the only director who , according to the most recent SEC filing , actually owns no shares in the company , because she sells as soon as her options become available .
In January 2007 , she exercised her options to acquire 3,333 shares of Wellpoint for an estimated cost of $ 147,000 -- and sold them the same day for an estimated price of $ 260,000 , netting a tidy sum of $ 113,000 .
She repeated the same process five months later for a net profit of $ 136,000 , and then seven months after that , selling another 1,430 shares for $ 123,000 .
That represented profits of nearly $ 400,000 on top of her salary .
Evidently Susan Bayh is most interested in accumulating wealth , and so far she has done a fine job .
The Bayhs are now worth somewhere between $ 5 million and $ 10 million , an amount that was not scrimped from Evan 's salary in the Senate .
In 2007 he reassured a Fort Wayne newspaper in sonorous tones that sounded Liebermanesque : " I can honestly tell you that if my wife did not have a job , none , I can't think of a single decision I 've made that would be any different .
I look at what 's best for our state and our country and my own conscience .
My integrity matters more to me than anything , so I always do what 's right for the people who put their trust in me . "
I 'd be more interested in knowing how the Justice Department investigations into the most corrupt members of Congress -- like the 3 Inland Empire crooks , Jerry Lewis , Ken Calvert and Gary Miller -- are progressing , but yesterday thepublished a leak showing that more than 30 House members are being looked at by the largely ineffective Ethics Committee .
As always -- going back to the days when Jerry Lewis ran it and Duke Cunningham and Duncan Hunter ran rampant -- the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee is a major focus .
Todd Tiahrt , a teabagger - supported candidate for the open Kansas Senate seat is one member who has been trading earmarks for campaign cash .
Aside from the regular crooked dealers we 've all been waiting to get carted off to prison , like Charlie Rangel , I was especially happy to see that Blue Dog Jane Harman 's activities on behalf of another country are being looked into :
This week investigative journalist Joe Conason took corruption investigating to a much - needed level the feds have generally avoided -- how members of Congress use their spouses to collect millions of dollars in bribes from corporate interests .
It 's hardly a new phenomenon , and John Doolittle is n't in Congress any longer because of it .
But Conason shines a much needed light on two sickeningly sanctimonious hypocrites : Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh .
Evan Bayh claims Susan Bayh is n't allowed to lobby him on matters regarding the companies she 's financially involved with .
Whew !
I wonder if there 's another repeat about that Balloon Boy show on TV today .

Bee Culture – Nov. 11 , 2005
by Walt Wright
Here ’s a way that ’s fast , easy and the bees can use .
All the experts have had their turn at generating an article on the subject of feeding honey substitutes .
Those articles generally provide the pros and cons of the various popular techniques such as top jar , division board , boardman , etc .
There is no substitute for comb feeding when a large amount of feed must be moved in a short time .
This is especially true in clustering temperatures .
Other feeding techniques permit limited access to the source , as in a perforated mason cap .
Comb feeding provides an expanse of open cells to encourage literally thousands of bees to move feed at the same time .
First some background on when and why Fall feeding is required .
As is the case in most of my output , some literature bashing is included in the following treatment .
The literature , coming from the northern tier of eastern states , does not seem to recognize that they are keeping bees outside the normal climate range of the European honey bee .
Perhaps that opinion should be supported with a few brief statements :
(1) If you trace the U.S. / Canadian western border around the globe to Europe , it passes south of England and north of Paris in northern France .
Neither English nor French Winters are in the same league with the winters in Minnesota .
(2) The 60 - degree boundary of northern Saskatchewan and Manitoba , Canada passes south of Helsinki , Finland .
The southern end of the Scandinavian countries is well populated and the northern area of the Canadian provinces has mainly First Nation people living there .
(3) Central Europe does not have the equivalent of the ‘ Alberta Clipper ’ moving southeastward that brings the polar air mass in Winter to the U.S. Northeast .
(4) Latitude is not the only factor in Winter severity .
The point of this trivia is that European Winters are less severe than north central and eastern U.S. Winters .
Do you know of a strain or race of Apis M. that is native to Central Norway ?
If so , I could be encouraged to re-think the opinion that north central and north eastern U.S. is outside the natural climatic range of the European bees we use .
In our coldest regions , the honey bee survival traits are pushed to their marginal limits .
One aspect of their survival format is pushed beyond limits .
They want to Winter the cluster on a brood nest filled with nectar after brood rearing ceases in the Fall .
In northern areas where frost / freeze weather stops forage availability while they still have brood , the colony cannot make it happen .
They are forced to relocate up on solid capped honey .
To get back to feeding , this article will stop the discussion here with the note that feeding may be required to fill the brood nest for wintering .
More details can be found in two earlier articles , the Nov. 03 and Sept. 04 : Bee Culture .
The literature recommends heavy syrup for Fall feeding .
That is a valid recommendation if you have been both greedy and callous in your harvest of honey .
Were you not greedy , you would have left enough for the bees to Winter .
Were you not callous , you would not offer a substitute for their hard - earned Winter rations .
In case you had n’t noticed , I look at beekeeping from the bee ’s perspective .
In northerly locations where brood rearing extends beyond forage availability in the field , you need to consider assisting the colony in preparing the brood nest .
In one of the earlier articles , you were invited to check these concepts by opening a couple colonies in December .
If , on your last hive opening in the Fall the cluster was in the lower deep , and in the upper deep in late Winter , they may have relocated upward off the empty brood nest .
You likely did n’t check it out yet , but you have another opportunity to do it this week and through the month .
The colony can be enticed to move back down to the brood nest if there is sufficient mild weather left to move the feed .
In early Winter the typical colony has gone into the conservation mode .
After stopping brood rearing for the season , they go into essentially full - time clustering .
Both those actions reduce honey consumption .
Without brood , the cluster internal temperature is permitted to drift lower and the insulating bees of the cluster shell become inactive .
Once they reach this conservation status , they are reluctant to break cluster .
If the brood nest has been properly filled , the fuel to warm the cluster is readily available for early Winter .
If the brood nest does n’t get filled , and they are forced to relocate up onto solid capped honey , mid Winter brood rearing is slowed .
The timing of the sequence above suggests a need to feed by a means that moves feed in minimum time .
Comb feeding meets that objective .
Assuming some mild days are present between waves of ever - colder days , there is some time to help your bees fill the brood nest .
This beekeeper highly recommends taking the time to do it .
You will be rewarded by better wintering of the colonies in your charge .
Filling comb with simulated nectar requires that you impart some velocity to the feed .
The same surface tension that keeps nectar in horizontal comb cells resists penetration from the other direction .
Dipping comb wo n’t work .
I probably should n’t publicize my mental ineptitude , but several ways were tried to impart velocity to the feed .
First , using a quart jar with perforated cap like a saltshaker .
Two problems with that approach : slippery jar and it took as much time refilling the jar as filling comb .
Then , a garden sprayer with a fan nozzle attachment was tried .
Too much time pumping up the sprayer pressure .
Finally , the light bulb came on : Try gravity .
Gravity works very well .
The picture block shows the simple process .
In the larger picture at the left , Perma Comb ® ( PC ) is being filled with nectar substitute .
PC is rugged and can stand considerable abuse .
Both PC and natural comb in wooden frames will float in the tub of feed .
Higher sidewalls on the tub of feed are recommended to contain the splatter of feed in the surrounding area .
It ’s not advisable to antagonize the regular kitchen crew .
The stop action film shows individual droplets of feed between the can and the comb .
In use , it looks like a sheet of feed and only takes a few seconds to empty a half can of feed .
One pass , over and back , will fill most of the cells .
If you want 100 % filling , it may take another half can .
Quick and dirty !
Scoop up a can of feed , fill one side and flip the frame over to fill the other side .
The lower right picture shows draining the excess off the comb .
Invert the frame to avoid drips on the way to the transport box .
Very little feed is lost en route to the bee yard .
( That surface tension thing . )
The transport tray is shown in the setup photo at upper right .
Those are homemade telescoping covers that never got metal covers .
There were so many uses for them , including this one , that the inside joints were caulked to make them watertight .
Any drips collected can be poured into the hive when the comb feed is installed .
A three - pound coffee can is the main equipment needed for this process .
The bottom line of holes is shown : center - right .
This is not my best can .
It just happened to come to the top first .
Notice the staggered line of holes on the left side in the photo .
That arrangement of holes works better than the solid line of holes on the right side .
If the holes are too close , or too large the flow tends to converge into a stream .
The top of the can is not shown .
One side is squared off to make a scoop to pick up feed in the tub and the opposite rim is folded inward to make a finger grip .
Several years ago a time test was run to see how fast a super could be filled with this procedure – in case I ever got around to writing this article .
In the hurry - up mode care was not taken to fill every cell ( estimated at about 90 % of capacity ) .
And draining off the excess was limited to a couple quick shakes over the tub .
Nine frames could be almost filled in seven minutes .
Moving boxes in and out of position , and mixing another batch of feed took almost as much time as filling a super .
But a medium super could deliver more than two gallons at a time – with one hive opening .
There is no feeding system that is man - hour free .
We consider this system to be competitive in man-hours spent and has advantages that others do not have .
The literature recommends a two to one ratio by weight for Fall feeding .
That ’s fine for supplementing Winter stores overhead .
But if the feeding is intended to fill the brood nest , the bees naturally use nectar .
And what is the ratio of sugar to water in Fall nectar ?
It ’s certainly not two to one .
In the September ABJ , George Ayers reports that the sugar content of New England aster is about 25 % .
Further he says that that amount is ‘ fairly dilute . ’
Until I get more data , I ’m using 1 / 2 to one as a mixture ratio to fill the brood nest .
That ’s roughly a four - pound bag of sugar to a gallon of water .
In the past , I have cut 55 % HFCS half and half with water .
That ’s in the same ballpark .
Those of you that have more time to burn can research this question further .
Let us know what you learn .
Some beekeepers recommend weighing hives in the Fall to verify adequate Winter stores .
Like the ‘ heft ’ test , preparation of the brood nest is not fully verified .
There are so many variables in per-hive weight that it would be quite difficult to select a go / no go weight that proves proper brood nest filling .
As an example , just the variation in honey weight in a full deep can obscure the nectar weight in a Fall brood nest .
In my area , colonies typically get the brood nest filled with nectar after brood nest close - out .
But not always .
One year there was almost none and another year about half filled .
As we go north to the Canadian border , the probability gets worse to the point where its almost a certainty that it wo n’t get done .
When you get a killing freeze before brood nest close out , there is no field nectar .
Since I live about six miles from the Alabama state line , there is a large area where this feature of colony preparations for Winter has some impact .
If you enjoy Winter losses , you can totally ignore this article .

There is a lot to say on the consequences of the policies of the regulators and the Federal Reserve from outrageous and irresponsible bailouts of big banks and some big businesses , and we ’ll continue to talk about and expose that at American Banking News .
But Jim Rogers gets to a very simple core principle of free market capitalism , and that is that allowing businesses and banks to fail has been part of the risk inherent in going into business in the first place , and is a end result of the quality and skill of those running those businesses .
So when the government uses and leverages taxpayers ’ dollars to shore up poor management , they ’ve interfered in the market in ways that they will never admit to and with results that will be difficult to lay blame at their doorstep as the years go on .
They know that , and so continue on their merry way , understanding they may never be held accountable for their actions , nor their actions understood by most .
Jim Rogers and others will have none of that though , and Rogers said recently at the CNBC Wordwide Exchange that he not only wished that Lehman Brothers had failed , but 10 other banks as well .
He even adds that the government was thrilled that Lehman Brothers failed because it gave them an excuse to “ jump in and support banks . ”
Here ’s how Rogers sees the current problem and its source :
“ The real problem over the past 10 - 15 years has been that regulators have not let people fail .
Had they let people fail we would have solved this problem a long time ago .
I do n’t know why they ’re not in jail . ”
When Rogers says this , understand he ’s identifying the problem as it is today , not attacking the ultimate root of the problem , which is the Federal Reserve and the need to abolish it .
But to wonder why they ’re not in jail for their actions is a powerful statement by Rogers as to what their practices have brought about , and the consequences of those actions across a wide sphere of our social makeup .
Rogers has been accurately hitting hard for some time on the foolishness of propping up any business by the government which has obviously been run poorly .
He rightly exposed the stupidity of supporting businesses and banks which are n’t able to compete with better run companies , and although dead , are allowed to live , not based on improved practices , but on the infusion of taxpayer money which they think will be offered in endless supply .
That ’s why Rogers always uses the term “ zombie ” when referring to businesses and banks this type of artificial life support .
When you follow this line of reasoning and use zombie as a metaphor , think of those monster movies you ’ve watch .
It ’s not natural to have something come back from the dead and walk around the streets feeding off of that which is alive .
But that ’s exactly what the Federal Reserve and regulators have allowed to happen .
And every time they do it , the terribly run banks get bigger and are allowed to continue operating , doing business as usual , knowing every time they ’re bailed out it ’s one more step toward always being bailed out because they ’re “ too big to fail . ”
This is truly monstrous and a waste of assets .
Rogers takes the practices of the Federal Reserve with the blessing of the government and extends them to their logical conclusion , which is zombie banks will end up with zombie capitalism .
By that he means the system is being fought from being allowed to cleanse itself and the quality companies emerge even stronger after the bad companies have been removed from the system .
He now expects ‘ zombie capitalism ’ to run rampant over the next 15 - 20 years , with many large companies that should have been left to die , resuscitated by mortgaging the futures of our children and grandchildren .
In the end , no matter how much money you throw at at problem , if the business and banking practices are wrong , you ’re doing nothing but wasting money and extending the problem by not allowing the genious of the free market system to cleanse itself of the impurities of managments that do n’t know what they ’re doing .
On top of all these problems and the usual unintended consequences , Rogers adds that we ’ll enter into either a full currency crisis , or at minimum a semi-crisis , sometime with the next year or so .
It ’s as simple as allowing banks and business to fail when others are run better than they are .
How hard can that be for the Federal Reserve and regulators to understand ?
TOKYO , Japan ( CNN ) -- Former Japanese Finance Minister Shoichi Nakagawa , who resigned from his post after appearing intoxicated at a news conference earlier this year , was found dead in his home Sunday , police said .
Shoichi Nakagawa resigned three days after appearing intoxicated at a G7 news conference in Rome .
The cause of death was not clear and no will was found , police said .
Nakagawa , 56 , resigned in February , three days after he appeared intoxicated at the G7 news conference in Rome , Italy .
Japan 's prime minister quickly appointed Kaoru Yosano , the economics minister , to replace Nakagawa .
Nakagawa 's resignation followed an announcement by Japan 's main opposition party that it would introduce a motion to censure him .
He had apologized for his behavior , but denied that it was the result of heavy drinking .
Nakagawa said he had alcoholic drinks on his flight to Rome and during the G7 luncheon , but that the real culprit was too much medicine taken because he was n't feeling well , Japan 's Kyodo news agency reported .
In video of the news conference , Nakagawa responds slowly to reporters questions , slurring his words .
At one point , he closes his eyes .
The G7 meeting brought together finance ministers from the world 's leading industrialized nations in Rome .
Last month , the Pentagon confirmed that it would be removing 14,000 support troops from Afghanistan and replacing them with 14,000 combat troops , saying they needed more “ trigger pullers ” on the ground .
Today , officials are reporting that President Obama has approved another 13,000 support troops for Afghanistan , essentially completing the backdoor escalation that many predicted the moment the support cut was announced .
Defense officials claim that President Obama has been planning this move and has approved of it since March , when he unveiled his “ 21,000 ” troop escalation which has quickly become a 34,000 troop escalation .
Officials say the number of soldiers on the ground wo n’t increase by years end , but it seems the president has already made arrangements to see the overall force rise to 80,000 + sometime next year .
This is in addition to the over 60,000 additional soldiers requested by Gen.
Stanley McChrystal , which seems poised to raise the occupation force to one larger than even the failed Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980’s .
If approved , it will also mean President Obama will have more than tripled the number of American soldiers on the ground since taking office .
No Such Thing As Majority Rule
Government claims , as its source of legitimacy , “ the consent of the governed . ”
Its most sacred ritual for for demonstrating that consent is the periodic election of public officials and , in some areas , referendum voting on particular issues .
In a recent column , I examined claims of elections as a basis for claims of representation and found them wanting .
Buried within the information upon which I based that analysis was the core of a far more damning finding upon which I ’ll now elaborate .
Simply put , not only do elections not provide meaningful representation , they also fail to make the case for anything approaching universal consent to accept representation at all .
My data set last time consisted of statistics on the election of a particular congresswoman .
This time , I ’m going to use focus on an American county — the county in which I live , St. Louis County , Missouri ( not to be confused with the city of St. Louis , which in Missouri ’s political scheme is treated as a county in its own right ) .
I ’ll use numbers from 2000 , the latest year for which I can easily compare different variables .
Per the 2000 census , the population of St. Louis County was 1,016,315 .
Of those more than one million inhabitants , only 726,325 — 71.5 % — were registered to vote .
Of those 726,325 voters , only 488,400 — 67.2 % of those registered , 48 % of the county ’s population — turned out to participate in the ritual .
To put it a different way , 28.5 % of the county ’s population boycotts elections entirely by not registering to vote , and 52 % ( including nearly a third of registered voters ) boycotted the 2000 election in particular .
From this fact we can derive two conclusions , one indisputable and one debatable but reasonable .
The indisputable conclusion is that because a majority of the population did n’t vote in that election , neither a single politician elected to office nor a single measure put up for public ratification can be honestly advertised as having secured majority approval .
The debatable but reasonable conclusion is that in declining to vote in the 2000 election , 52 % of the population withheld consent to be bound by its outcomes or ruled by its winners .
The conventional wisdom has it otherwise : Refusal to participate in an election , we ’re told , constitutes consent to be bound by that election ’s outcomes and ruled by its winners .
Silence is consent — especially since non-voters make use of “ public services ” delivered to them through the whole process .
Non-voting is a sign of “ apathy ” or “ laziness , ” not of alienation or opposition .
This is akin to saying that by slamming my door in the face of a magazine salesman , I ’m consenting to pay for subscriptions to Time , Scientific American and Playboy … and that proof of this claim may be drawn from the fact that when those magazines begin to arrive , I read them rather than sending them back or throwing them away .
There are , of course , two flaws in this analogy , neither of which reflect well on the electoral system .
The first major difference between the state ’s ritual and my hypothetical magazine subscription experience is that any small claims court would likely reject a frivolous a suit by the magazine salesman claiming that I owe him money for subscriptions I neither asked for nor consented to pay for .
Any tax court , on the other hand , would likely find that a non-voter owed payment for those “ public services ” that some portion of 48 % of the populace outside his door had voted to purchase for him without his consent .
The second major difference is that when it comes to magazines , my choice of titles and vendors is limited only by the market ’s offerings .
I do n’t have to buy Time , Scientific American and Playboy from the door - to - door guy .
I can go to the newsstand or log onto the Intarweb and buy Newsweek , National Geographic and … well , something a bit more righteously smutty than Playboy , if you know what I mean … or for that matter I can eschew magazines entirely .
For the most part , I ’m forbidden to buy ( or not buy ) my own road system , postal carrier , army or navy .
Not only do I have to pay for the brands chosen by some portion of that 48 % of the populace , but I ca n’t buy my own on the side and use them instead .
There are exceptions ( private schools , for example ) , but they are exceptions .
The rule is “ one size fits all , cough up and pipe down . ”
One objection I ’ve encountered in this line of thinking is that many non-voters are non-voters because they ’re not allowed to vote .
They ’re under 18 , they ’ve previously been convicted of a felony and barred from voting , or they originally came from elsewhere .
My reply : Bollocks !
If they ’re not allowed to participate , they can hardly be said to have consented to be bound by the outcomes .
Exclusion , like boycott , negates claims of consent .
The question of whether or not majority rule is a valid measure of consent is an interesting one , but one we do n’t have to reach here .
The dirty little secret of “ majority rule ” is that it ’s no such thing .
Rather we are governed by ( usually ) “ representatives ” chosen by a majority of a minority , in most cases plausibly representing no more than 25 - 30 % of the population .
There ’s a curious , fairly outrageous , brouhaha going on in the American Jewish community and particularly in the American Jewish community ’s relationship with the current Israeli government .
You may or may not have heard of J Street , a new pro-peace Zionist lobby recently established as a counterweight to AIPAC , which over the years has become more and more exclusively tied to the Israeli right .
Michael Oren is the recently installed Israeli Ambassador to the United States , who among other things wrote a very good history of the Six Day War .
( Tom Segev ’s 1967 is also a very good and very different book . )
Prime Minister ’s Netanyahu ’s decision to appoint Oren was provocative in itself since Oren had already been quite critical of President Obama during last year ’s presidential campaign .
And he quickly set about pushing the envelope of what is normally considered acceptable in a resident ambassador by inserting himself into American domestic politics .
In any case , a short time ago , J Street invited Oren to address its upcoming conference .
Oren declined , while authorizing his spokesman to suggest that J Street is ‘ anti-Israel . ’
We published an article yesterday reporting the key facts of the case .
The head of J Street , Jeremy Ben - Ami followed up with a public letter restating the invitation .
And it appears
Oren may now be reconsidering the refusal .
Now , in a related development , a member of Israel ’s main opposition party , Kadima , today attacked Oren over his actions .
There are a few different issues here .
One is that given his public profile Oren was probably a poor choice for Ambassador in the first place .
But sitting ambassadors are expected not to publicly insert themselves into the domestic politics of their host country , which Oren is doing .
But there ’s a different level of this within the American Jewish community .
Israel remains very important to the American Jewish community as a whole .
But the American Jewish community is extremely important to Israel .
But here Oren is pretty clearly defining a whole slice of American Jewish opinion ( probably a substantially larger slice than he and his government realizes ) as anti-Israel , which is not only wrong on the facts but extremely shortsighted given the demographic trends within American Jewry .
I do n’t expect him to be departing any time soon unless and until the Netanyahu government falls .
But Oren should quickly rethink the J Street decision .
And even if he does , the Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs should recall Oren and replace him with someone who represents the current government ’s views without interfering in American domestic politics or damaging Israel ’s standing among American Jews .

And Tango Makes
Three is the top most controversial book Authors , artists and musicians are due to gather at a library in San Francisco to protest against the banning of books in schools and libraries in the US .
The event , part of the 27th annual Banned Books Week , has been organised by the American Library Association .
Since 2001 bans on 3,736 books and other materials have been requested .
In recent years , And Tango Makes
Three - based on a true story and centring on gay penguins in New York 's Central Park Zoo - has had the most ban requests .
The book 's authors are Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell .
In a statement to the BBC on Friday , Mr Richardson said : " It 's regrettable that some parents believe reading a true story about two male penguins hatching an egg will damage their children 's moral development .
" They are entitled to express their beliefs , but not to inflict them on others . "
Reasons given by organisations and individuals for their requests to get it removed from public shelves , include " anti-ethnic , anti-family , homosexuality , religious viewpoint , and unsuited to age group " .
Other works featuring in the most - challenged books list for 2008 include Philip Pullman 's His Dark Materials and Khaled Hosseini's The Kite Runner .
Parents ' concern Pullman told Britain's Guardian newspaper that he was glad to be on the list .
However he added : " Of course it 's a worry when anybody takes it upon themselves to dictate what people should or should not read . "
The association said the aim of the annual awareness week , which ends on Saturday , is to remind US citizens not to take their freedom for granted .

They plan to stage a number of performances and defend controversial books .
In 2008 the American Library Association recorded 517 ban and restriction requests .
Seventy - four were successful .
The organisation recorded that the most common reason given was that contents were too " sexually explicit " .
Other classic literature subjected to complaints include JD Salinger 's The Catcher in the Rye , The Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald and To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee . The Harry Potter series by JK Rowling also feature on the list .
Earlier this week , it was claimed that Harry Potter author JK Rowling missed out on the Presidential Medal of Freedom because some US politicians believed she " encouraged witchcraft " .

One of the most intensely debated aspects of President Obama 's " Race to the Top " fund for education , especially here in California , has been its insistence on a mechanism that would allow for teacher evaluations based on the performance of their students .
It 's a no - brainer as far as a lot of people are concerned , but teachers unions abhor it and California law specifically forbids linking teachers with student achievement , at least at the state level .
Now comes some interesting , and perhaps counterintuitive , news from Portugal , where the government recently began tying teacher pay to student achievement .
A study released in May ( and brought to our attention today by the Public Education Network ) contains this stunner of a conclusion : " Overall , our results consistently indicate that the increased focus on individual teacher performance caused a sizable and statistically significant decline in student achievement . "
That 's right , students did worse when teacher pay was based on their performance .
Go figure .
The study , by the Institute for the Study of Labor in Bonn , Germany , does contain solace for supporters of performance - based pay .
Simply put , the Portuguese system might not be the best example of how to put together such a system , and the authors acknowledge that " teacher incentives ... may improve student achievement " if done well .

Skhizein : The Sad Story of a Man Living 91 - Centimeters from Himself
Skhizein is a humorously strange animated short film by the French filmmaker Jérémy Clapin .
The film has earned several awards , including The Cannes ’ Kodak Prize for Best Animated Short and Animafest ’s Best Film ; it was a 2008 Oscar nominated animated short film .
What would happen if a 150 - ton meteorite fell on you ?
Skhizein tells the very sorrowful story about sad Henry , who did experience the terrible misfortune of being struck by a 150 - ton meteorite , which resulted in the poor fellow being split away from himself , forever having to live precisely ninety - one centimeters from himself .
If Harry wants to move or do anything like answer the phone or sit in a chair , he has to measure his distance 91 - centimeters ( 3 feet ) away , because he always exists 91 - centimeters from where he used to exist .
And if insanity is measured in centimeters ….

Israeli navy to deploy robot craft
by Staff Writers
Tel Aviv , Israel ( UPI ) Oct 6 , 2009
The Israeli navy will shortly begin deploying unmanned craft along the Mediterranean coast , particularly off the Hamas - held Gaza Strip in the south and Lebanon in the north where Hezbollah guerrillas operate .
These highly maneuverable unmanned surface vehicles , operated by remote control from land stations , can carry out a wide range of missions , such as patrolling coastal waters to counter gun-running and infiltration with less prospect of being detected than the much larger manned vessels .
" There are areas that the navy preferred to first enter in an unmanned capacity before a manned capacity , " a senior navy officer told The Jerusalem Post Sunday in reference to the Gaza and Lebanon sectors .
The Protector , built by Rafael Advanced Systems Ltd. , is one of the new systems acquired by the navy .
It can carry a wide range of payloads , including cameras , sensors and weapons .
These new craft are making Israel one of the global leaders in the development and combat deployment of unmanned systems in the air , on the land and now at sea .
Israel 's defense industry recently announced the development of an unmanned land vehicle for carrying supplies in combat zones .
Elbit Systems will be displaying a newly developed land robot , the Beagle , at the Association of the United States Army defense exhibition in Washington .
The Beagle is self - navigating and can avoid obstacles and climb stairs .
Its extendable arm can lift up to 4.5 pounds and carry a wide variety of payloads .
But it is in the air that Israeli expertise in the unmanned vehicle sector is most widely seen .
Elbit will be also be displaying for the first time at the Washington exhibition its Hermes 90 long - endurance unmanned aerial vehicle , which can remain aloft for up to 18 hours and has a range of up to 62 miles .
Poland is currently considering buying Israeli UAVs to support its forces deployed in Afghanistan .
" We 're going to buy a whole range of drones , from short to medium range , " Defense Minister Bogdan Klich told Jane 's Defense Weekly in August .
He comments followed Warsaw's Aug. 11 announcement that Poland would create a backup force of 200 troops for its 2,000 - man contingent currently serving with NATO 's International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan .
Elbit announced Sunday that it opened an office in Baku , capital of the oil - rich former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan where Israeli influence is growing .
Israel is a major buyer of Azeri oil from the Caspian Basin .
Elbit is currently working on UAV projects with the Azeri Defense Ministry , whose budget this year was increased to $ 2.5 billion .
According to Azeri media , Israel defense contractor Aeronautics Defense Systems will construct a factory to help the Azeris build UAVs and satellites .
The company 's chief executive officer , Avi Leumi , accompanied Israeli President Shimon Peres when he visited Baku in June .
There 's a geek mecca in them thar hills .
And do n’t expect your iPhone 's GPS to guide you to it .
Hidden in the green hills of West Virginia , in a 13,000 - square - mile National Radio Quiet Zone , is the world ’s largest fully steerable telescope .
The GBT ( Great Big Telescope , Great Big Thing or Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope , depending on whom you ask ) is the most overbooked telescope in the world .
The waiting list to get some time on this baby is long and prestigious .
And with good cause :
Its sensitivity to radio signals is unparalleled .
The telescope is so sensitive , in fact , that the National Radio Astronomy Observatory ( NRAO ) has a van that drives around the surrounding countryside asking people to stop using their wireless speaker systems , electric fences , broadband wireless modems , military radar , etc. — anything that might interfere with the telescope 's readings .
With the growing popularity of radio- array telescopes , the GBT may end up being the last single - dish telescope of its kind built in the world .
The difference between an array and a giant single - dish like the GBT is the difference between a zoom and wide - angle lens on your camera .
The GBT is extremely good at finding a source in space by searching a wide area , while the radio array is like a telephoto lens that good at looking at the details .
Read on for a tour of this towering instrument of space exploration .

The GBT is 485 feet tall , a nudge taller than the Statue of Liberty and a nudge shorter than the Washington monument .
It was put into service in early 2000 .

The 140 was out of service for a number of years , but has been brought back online in conjunction with an MIT project to study turbulent properties of the earth 's ionosphere .

The 16 - million - pound Great Big Telescope cost $ 75 million to build , but some would say it has already paid back the investment .
The GBT is helping prove Einstein ’s general theory of relativity by discovering the high masses and short rotation periods of pulsars .
The GBT Feed Arm ( above , top right ) is where all the radiation from the dish is reflected before being redirected to the receiver room .
It 's offset from the center of the dish , so it does n’t obscure any portion of the sky .
The only vehicles permitted on the NRAO property are diesels , from ancient pickup trucks and vintage Volkswagens to more - modern diesel autos .
Unlike gas - guzzling vehicles , diesels do n't use spark plugs for ignition , the sparks from which would interfere with the telescope 's readings .
The GBT ’s time is split into about one - third pulsar research , one - third astrochemical research and the rest a hodgepodge of mapping projects , including hydrogen clouds and various radar signals .
The objective is to receive , detect and amplify .

Bob Anderson , Chief Antennae Engineer takes the Wired.com team to the surface of the dish .
This platform is 370 feet above the tracks below .
It 's said the entire West Virginia University football stadium could fit inside the dish .
Not just the field , but the entire stadium .
Or , more accurately , 2.3 acres of surface area .

The surface of the GBT is made up of 2,004 individual panels , each of which can be adjusted to an accuracy of 0.3 millimeters .
“ Everything is one of a kind , and we are constantly pushing the technology , " says Bob Anderson , who obviously loves his job .
Living this far out in the hills of West Virginia has been an adjustment for his wife , but she has adapted and has been honing her online shopping skills .
Walking on the surface of the GBT must be something like walking on the moon .
Even as you make your way along the surface , it is almost impossible to grasp the overall size of the dish , and the shiny white surface makes it difficult to orient yourself .

Although the GBT can only run one receiver at a time , eight are mounted on this rotating turret above the receiver room .
You can see a couple of the larger receiving horns with heat ducts pointing at their tops .
It can get mighty snowy and cold in this part of the world , which makes keeping the radio operating a challenge .
The hardware for the eight receivers is shown from below .
The room is filled with a loud racket from the helium pumps that keep the instrument in a temperature window between 10 and 50 Kelvins ( 442 to 370 degrees below zero Fahrenheit ) .
The different receivers are used to detect radio frequencies , ranging anywhere from 1 gigahertz up to 90 gigahertz .
Bob Simon , an Electronic Engineer at the NRAO , holds the new feed horn for a 7 - pixel focal - plane array .
They are hoping to implement the new radio receiver this winter for ammonia mapping in the K band , between 18 and 26 megahertz .
The humid West Virginia summers make it almost impossible to read the K band , as any moisture in the air blocks the signal , highlighting the minute nature of the information the GBT detects and the sensitivity of the instruments it uses .

“ I love this thing , ” said Scott Gordon , who was helping inspect the telescope .
“ It is definitely an optical illusion .
You realize how high up you are when you have a 60 - foot rope and it ’s not touching the ground . ”
The GBT whirls itself around full - circle in nine minutes on four sets of four - wheeled trucks .
The wheels carry more than a million pounds each .
The original track had a number of design flaws which made it buckle .
Fixing it cost millions of dollars , but now the telescope rotates smoothly .

The control room is so far away , a small plane could land between it and the GBT .
In fact , the intervening fields do have an old airstrip .
The control room has some rather dated computers lying about , but we were assured they have plenty of computing power to get the job done .
The entire control room is a Faraday cage , as in the movie “ Enemy of the State ” with Gene Hackman .
The Faraday cage is used to keep the computer noise in and any radio - frequency interference out .
The operators can look through windows covered with wire mesh to the GBT a couple of miles away .

Like a giant dinosaur roaming the Earth , the GBT makes a profound impression on the landscape .
The telescope can reach full elevation in four minutes on a shaft just 30 inches in diameter , which was specially designed to handle the 16 - million - pound load .
Its size is in fitting proportion to the tasks that it undertakes , probing incomprehensible distances and documenting alien planetary phenomena .
Update :
This story has been corrected with the proper weight for the GBT .

According to the secretary if the Russian Security Council , the Russian government ’s new review of its nuclear weapons policy retains and even expands the nation ’s long - standing option to pre-emptively use nuclear weapons in warfare .
“ Different variants are considered to allow the use of nuclear weapons depending on a certain situation and intentions of a would - be enemy , ” the secretary insisted .
Russia has insisted that it has the right to launch pre-emptive nuclear strikes since early 2008 .
NATO has likewise had a long - standing position of threatening to launch pre-emptive nuclear strikes , even against non-nuclear nations .
Most recently officials have said the alliance could use nuclear weapons against other nations if they were concerned that they might soon acquire nuclear weapons .
Between them , Russia and NATO control the vast majority of the world ’s nuclear weapons , and while they are unlikely to use them against one another , fearing reprisal , the threat remains that either side may launch a pre-emptive strike against a smaller power with little to no retaliatory capability .
So far , however , such threats have remained simply threats , and no nation has used nuclear weapons against another in over 64 years .
The intelligence and passion that Chef Dan Barber exuded during his twenty - minute presentation on “ natural ” foie gras at the Taste3 conference inspired The Astronomer and me to seek out a meal at Blue Hill at Stone Barns during a week - long trip to New York .
Situated on a working four - season farm , Chef Barber ’s five - year - old restaurant is dedicated to creating a consciousness about the effects of everyday food choices .
After exploring the farm ’s magnificent grounds and learning about its mission , The Astronomer and I were ready to sit down and experience how a principled approach to food translated onto the plate .
Sourcing from the surrounding fields and pastures , as well as other local farms , Blue Hill highlights the abundant resources of the Hudson Valley .
Upon being seated , diners are presented with a list of over a hundred ingredients containing seasonal offerings from the field and market .
During our visit in early September , items such as Samantha cabbage , Socrates cucumber , lobster mushroom , and Aztec beans were on the “ menu . ”
The only decision diners make is choosing between the five - course tasting ( $ 105 ) and the Farmer ’s Feast ( $ 135 ) .
To experience the full range of the kitchen ’s abilities and the season ’s bounty , The Astronomer and I chose the Farmer ’s Feast .
Shortly after deciding to feast rather than taste , we were bombarded by a parade of amuses .
In the span of ten or so minutes , seven different bites appeared at our table , leaving us feeling simultaneously overwhelmed and giddy .
First up were two V8 shooters .
Served slightly chilled , the juice provided a refreshing start and readied our bellies for more .
Next to arrive was a most delightful “ fence ” of dewy vegetables .
The artful presentation reminded me of Martin Kastner ’s thoroughly modern tableware designs for Alinea in Chicago .
We relished plucking each tomato ( Jaune Flamme , Sungold , Magic Mountain ) , lettuce , carrot , and fennel with our bare fingers and popping them into our mouths .
The Astronomer could n’t get enough of the licorice - laced fennel , while I was enamored by the impossibly sweet yellow Husk tomatoes .
My favorite of the amuses were the bite - sized tomato burgers .
The semi-sweet buns had an airy texture reminiscent of macarons , while the heart of the burger tasted intensely vibrant , like tricked - out sun-dried tomatoes .
I happily polished off both burgers because The Astronomer loathes tomatoes .
Our waiter informed us that during the winter months , beets are used in place of tomatoes in this dish .
Perched atop wooden skewers were hunks of yellow summer squash encrusted with pancetta and sesame seeds .
In contrast to our earlier bites , this one was warm and mostly savory .
Frittatas made from the eggs of Rhode Island red hens arrived on a charcoal slate .
In between the soft eggy curds were layers of potatoes and salty pancetta .
The squares of perfectly white fat nestled in the slices Berkshire pork were downright silky .
The final amuse was an array of melons sprinkled with ground black pepper .
The colorful collection of spheres included honeydew , cantaloupe , and yellow and red watermelon .
The interplay between sweet , spicy , and juicy was a treat for the senses .
Following the slew of unique amuses , we were served slices of caramelized onion potato bread .
On the side were little bowls filled with tomato salt , ricotta , and butter .
Both the cheese and butter were made using milk from Blue Hill Farm .
I weighed down my already delicious bread with a combination of runny ricotta and a light sprinkling of tomato salt .
The first official course of the evening was a slab of fresh blue fish dressed in caviar and a pigs ear vinaigrette .
The naturally chewy pig ear imparted a subtly gelatinous texture to the vinaigrette .
Due to The Astronomer ’s aversion to tomatoes , the kitchen fixed two different summer salads for the second course .
My salad contained tomatoes and watermelon topped with balsamic vinegar and a yogurt foam .
The simple accouterments highlighted the sweet and juicy perfection of the tomatoes and watermelons .
I do n’t think I ’ve ever enjoyed a vegetable course more .
The Astronomer ’s warm summer salad was a verdant collection of green beans , zucchini , and broccoli florets accented with an eggplant dressing and foam .
To say that The Astronomer loved this dish would be an understatement , he practically inhaled it .
The strongest dish of the night was the butter - poached Maine lobster served with members of the “ night shade ” family including tomatoes , peppers , and eggplants .
With each forkful , I closed my eyes and blocked out the entire dining room in order to taste the sweet and tender lobster without distractions .
As with all foods that are heartbreakingly good , this tail disappeared much too soon .
It is a difficult task following up a perfectly executed lobster , but this special egg preparation was up to the challenge .
Beneath the edible herb - and petal - embedded rice paper was a warm farm fresh egg , softly cooked , and paired with tomatoes and eggplants .
The rich egg yolk coated the vegetables and flavored the dish simply and beautifully .
The egg dish was appropriately followed by a chicken preparation .
I must admit that my heart sank a little when our waitress announced this course .
On my list of favorite animals to eat , chicken lies somewhere near the bottom along with field mouse .
I need n’t have worried because the chicken was nothing short of fabulous .
Moist and tender pieces of light and dark meat shared the slate with corn and okra .
The most memorable components of the dish were the two slices of rare liver .
Accustomed to liver that is bitter in taste and unpleasantly grainy in texture , I was taken aback by the succulence of this version .
Raw offals are the new black .
After witnessing herds of sheep gorging upon the grassy hills outside the restaurant , The Astronomer and I sinisterly and secretly hoped that we ’d be served lamb for dinner .
Sure enough , the final savory course of the evening was Dorset lamb .
We were spoiled with three different parts — loin , rack , and my favorite , belly .
A coarse puree of eggplant , cheese , carrots , and pine nuts rounded out the dish .
The cheese course included two different raw milk wedges from Vermont paired with honeycomb , apricot chutney , and wheat toasts ( $ 14 supplement ) .
Following the cheeses was an apricot and elderberry flower sorbet .
The various tart gelée underneath the sorbet added a little something extra to the refreshing palate cleanser .
For dessert : a perfectly summery fromage blanc cake with fresh blackberries and yellow raspberries .
The blackberry sorbet swathed in the trio of sauces ( honey , vanilla , and guava ) really made this dessert for me .
And lastly , the mignardise — red currant and yogurt macarons , blueberry jellies , strawberries , and yellow raspberries .
As a disciple of both Michal Pollan and Marion Nestle , I ’ve long internalized the rhetoric that food produced using natural and environmentally sound methods tastes better and is better for us .
However , as a city dweller who is n’t on a first name basis with her local farmers , I ’ve based my trust in this fact on principle rather than actual experiences .
From the glorious amuses to the berry - licious finishes , the Farmer ’s Feast at Blue Hill drove the message home .
Grow well .
Buy well .
Eat well .
Live well .

* G20 to play lead in global economy coordination - U.S .
* IMF reform seen giving emerging economies bigger voice
* U.S. Treasury ’s Geithner sees support for rebalancing
* Police fire pepper gas in clash with protesters
* Agreement seen on phasing out fossil fuel subsidies ( Recasts with G20 ’s new role ; IMF pact )
By Caren Bohan and Darren Ennis
PITTSBURGH , Sept 24 ( Reuters ) - Leaders of the Group of 20 rich and developing nations will turn their club into the main body for coordinating economic policy , reflecting the rise of new heavyweights like China , officials said on Thursday .
At a G20 summit to discuss ways of avoiding a repeat of the financial crisis , the leaders also agreed to give more voting power at the International Monetary Fund to countries that have long been under - represented at the global financial watchdog .
The two - day summit convened with the United States pressing its plan to build a more stable global economy in the face of the near meltdown of the financial system in 2008 which plunged the world into recession .
Giving the G20 the main role for coordinating economic policy would make it more important than the G7 and G8 groupings of the industrialized countries which have long dominated the world ’s economy .
Two years of financial market turmoil , which began in the rich world , have enhanced the economic role of fast - growing countries such as China and India .
“ Today , leaders endorsed the G - 20 as the premier forum for their international economic cooperation , ” the White House said in a statement after a summit dinner .
“ This decision brings to the table the countries needed to build a stronger , more balanced global economy , reform the financial system , and lift the lives of the poorest . ”
G20 AS STEERING COMMITTEE
Earlier , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said leaders would institutionalize the G20 , which groups the major rich and developing countries , as the key economic steering committee .
“ It ’s never really happened before .
We ’ve had the G8 , we ’ve had all these organizations .
We ’ve got this one chance to make a huge success of international economic cooperation , ” he said .
The United States is seeking to enlist the support of countries around the world for a plan to rebalance the world economy and to crack down on banks ’ risky behavior .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told reporters there was broad support for this , although G20 members were still hashing out the details .
The White House statement stressed the role of the wide global community in working on economic repairs , saying the agreement by leaders “ put the G - 20 at the center of their efforts to work together to build a durable recovery while avoiding the financial fragilities that led to the crisis . ”
REGULATORY REFORM
U.S. President Barack Obama , hosting his first Group of 20 summit on the same day he chaired the United Nations Security Council , laid out a broad agenda that also included reforming financial regulation and tackling climate change .
One breakthrough was the agreement to shift more IMF voting power to developing economies from the rich world , something the United States had backed strongly .
“ We arrived at agreement tonight on reform of ( the ) IMF to give under - represented countries more of a say in its governance , ” European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso told Reuters .
The White House said regulatory overhaul was the top priority for the G20 and Geithner said he expected to leave the two - day meeting with a firm schedule for implementing reform .
[ ID : nWEN4027 ]
Geithner said the challenges facing the global economy “ do n’t respect national borders , and nor can the solutions come from individual countries acting on their own . ”
“ Financial risk and leverage is going to flow where the rules are most lax , but the consequences of failure will be felt globally , ” he added .
The summit also looked likely to generate an agreement on phasing out fossil fuel subsidies as part of combating global warming , although without fixing a firm timetable .
[ ID :nN24469250 ]
FINANCIAL SECTOR BONUSES
Aides were still working on the precise wording for a statement to be issued at the end of the summit on Friday detailing the G20 ’s commitments .
France and Germany wanted curbs on bonuses in the financial sector that they say fostered huge risk - taking and helped cause the turmoil that shoved the world economy into recession .
Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama said his country wants to play a part in crafting global rules to rein in “ excessive money - making games . ”
[ ID:nN24457904 ]
A Canadian official told Reuters the G20 would outline pay principles at this meeting but it was up to each country to enforce its own rules .
[ ID :nN24476113 ]
The United States , the world ’s largest economy and the epicenter of the global crisis , wants G20 countries to commit to reducing reliance on U.S. consumers by boosting consumption in exporting countries , such as China , while encouraging debt - laden nations such as the United States to save more .
China has given only qualified support for the idea of policing global imbalances .
There was broad consensus that tougher , coordinated regulation was needed to avoid a repeat of the two - year crisis that cost millions of people their jobs and forced governments to put up trillions of dollars in taxpayer money to prop up a faltering financial system .
PROTESTS
Protesters ran through an area about a mile ( 1.6 km ) from the cordoned - off convention center where the G20 was meeting , throwing rocks at police and smashing shop windows as officers in riot gear used pepper gas , pellet - filled “ beanbags ” and batons to disperse them .
Protests -- usually against some aspect of capitalism -- have often marked summits since trade talks in Seattle in 1999 , when demonstrators ransacked the center of the city , targeting businesses seen as symbols of U.S. corporate power .
On Tuesday I noted that , contrary to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's assurances that the protections for First Amendment rights in the federal hate crime bill are stronger now than ever , the latest version ( the one that will become law ) omits language that the ACLU considered crucial .
Hans Bader and Byron York , both in the Washington Examiner , point out another way in which the bill has become less freedom - friendly on the way to passage :
The conference committee that resolved differences between the House and Senate versions dropped an amendment written by Sen.
Sam Brownback ( R - Kan. ) that said the bill should not be applied in a way that imposes a substantial burden on First Amendment freedoms " if such exercise of religion , speech , expression , or association was not intended to plan or prepare for an act of physical violence or incite an imminent act of physical violence against another . "
The bill now says that it 's OK to impinge on people 's First Amendment freedoms even if they are not conspiring to commit a violent crime or deliberately inciting one , as long as the burden " is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest . "
In light of this more permissive language , Bader argues , the new law could be combined with the federal " aiding and abetting " statute to justify prosecuting people whose speech allegedly influenced others to commit hate crimes , even when that result was unintended .
For example , a minister who inveighs against homosexuality could be prosecuted if a member of his congregation assaults gay people .
This is the sort of scenario cited by many conservative opponents of the hate crime bill .
It never seemed very plausible to me , and I still think the courts would reject such cases on First Amendment grounds .
But it 's hard to see the purpose of the change highlighted by Bader and York unless it was meant to allow prosecutions that go beyond violent criminals to the people who allegedly shape their thinking .
The latest version of the hate crime bill is here ( PDF ) ; it begins on page 1471 of the file , and the " compelling governmental interest " exception is on page 1488 .

It 's getting on for mid-September , the Ashes are in the bag , and England 's footballers have just qualified for the World Cup finals .
Those are just three significant reasons why no - one other than the 21,000 punters who forked out 70 - odd quid to sit in the Rose Bowl 's evening chill will care too much about this latest result .
This is just another day , just another defeat , for a team of cricketers going through the motions as the summer winds to a close .
Andrew Strauss , inevitably , protested the charge when it was put to him at the end of the match .
" We 're not good enough in one - day cricket to sit here and go easy , and I do n't think we have for one minute , " he said .
But the evidence is all around him .
No single England partnership was worth more than 41 , and even that was more than 100 runs fewer than Cameron White and Michael Clarke managed in their game - breaking alliance .
Whether they are setting the agenda or chasing the game , England are about as effective as the weather forecasters ' prediction that 2009 would be a " barbeque summer " .
" We have n't played well enough , clearly , but I do n't think it 's for lack of trying , " said Strauss .
" We 've had three poor batting performances , and the first two were very winnable at the halfway mark , but as a batting unit we just have n't fired .
We 've got to be honest with ourselves and have a look at it , in terms of how we can improve .
In one - day cricket , you can't go into your shell and grind it out , you 've got to play with enough confidence to put a competitive score on the board , but at the same time make good decisions . "
You 've got to play , in other words , like Cameron White , who started this series with a reputation for a late - innings big hitting , but has morphed remarkably effectively into a man with the range of strokes for all occasions , and the temperament to utilise them at the correct moments .
Admittedly he could - and maybe should - have been run out on 46 and 70 ( just as he was for 53 in the first match at The Oval ) but he did n't offer a chance off his own bat until he had made 92 and the game was already safe .
" The wickets can be quite hard to score on , so you can feel the scoreboard pressure , and pressure from the opposition at times , " said White , who would not have been batting at No. 3 had Ricky Ponting not flown home for a break , and who will not feature there - injuries permitting - for the rest of the series .
Either way , he did not snatch at the opportunity , and ended up teaching England 's own batsmen how to survive in their own conditions .
" Maybe the scores have n't been as high because the pitches have been a little tough to score on , " he said .
" It just takes a little bit of time to get used to the pace of the pitch , and obviously if you bowl a good length and straight at the stump it is hard to score .
It makes the run-rate a little bit slower . "
" He played it very well , " said Strauss .
" When we were trying to squeeze the Australians he played some big shots to keep the momentum going , and he 's taken his chance pretty well .
We 're a bit frustrated we did n't take all our chances , our fielding was n't as good as it should have been , but fair play to him , he guided Australia home , which was what was needed in those circumstances - one guy to bat through and get a big score . "
And that , as Strauss well knows , is exactly the role he himself should have played in each of the first three games .
Regardless of the outcomes in the series to date , England 's captain has still looked the most fluent and classy strokemaker on display .
Each of his three innings , however , have been unfulfilled promises , undermined by the wrong shot at the wrong moment , not least as today 's clip to midwicket when , with 63 out of a total of 98 for 4 , he had scored almost two - thirds of England 's runs .
" We 've had three poor batting performances , and the first two were very winnable at the halfway mark , but as a batting unit we just have n't fired .
We 've got to be honest with ourselves and have a look at it , in terms of how we can improve " Andrew Strauss
" When you 're batting well , you have to make hay , " said Strauss .
" But I have n't done that , and that 's frustrating .
Every time you pull on an England shirt you 've got a chance to go on and achieve something , and I am as culpable as anyone . "
England have two days to regroup before returning to Lord 's for the first of their four must - win matches , and though Stuart Broad will be back to shore up the seam attack , Joe Denly 's football - crunched knee is likely to keep him sidelined for yet another contest .
With Kevin Pietersen proving an immeasurably huge void to fill , and Paul Collingwood so exhausted after featuring in every single international fixture this year that he has reportedly asked to be released from his Champions League obligations with Delhi Daredevils , there 's little immediate hope of arresting the current decline .
So , can Australia achieve an unprecedented feat , and complete a 7 - 0 whitewash ?
" Yes , at the moment , " said White .
" I think , if we keep playing good , consistent cricket , keep bowling and fielding well , there 's no reason why not .
I definitely think we want to keep the momentum going , and I do n't think we 're playing at our total best at the moment .
" There are still areas we feel we can improve in , " he said .
" There 's probably things we 've got to work on to get better in the rest of these four games , and hopefully come four more games time , we are at our peak .
Seven one - day wins against a really good side would be a pretty strange thing to happen , but I 'm not saying it can't . "
Nor , at this moment in time , are many of the few people in England still paying any attention .

Canada 's three biggest broadcasters – CTV , Global and CBC – have temporarily set aside their competitive rivalry and joined forces to launch a national campaign designed to win over public opinion in their ongoing fight to collect fees from cable and satellite companies .
Calling it " Local TV Matters , " the conventional broadcasting giants are kicking off a massive multi-media advertising blitz today that includes website localtvmatters.ca , along with TV , radio and print advertisements .
Their campaign centres on a proposal called fee for carriage .
That idea , already twice rejected by the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission , would require cable and satellite companies to pay over - the - air broadcasters a fee to carry their signals .
CRTC will reconsider the idea for a third time at public hearings in November .
The broadcasters say carriage fees are a " matter of fairness , " arguing the business model for over - the - air television is " broken . "
Cable and satellite companies , however , liken the proposal to a bailout for broadcasters that overspent on acquisitions and U.S. programming in recent years .
They warn that if adopted , those added costs would be borne by consumers .
The broadcasters ' campaign is being launched about 10 days after cable giant Rogers Communications Inc. sent a strongly - worded email to customers warning them that fee - for - carriage could inflate their cable bills by up to $ 10 a month .
Shaw Communications Inc. has also taken similar action .
Rogers vice - chairman Phil Lind estimates that more than 10,000 Canadians have already complained to the CRTC about the issue , which he deems a massive consumer backlash .
" There 's a lot of volatility because it is a very expensive issue for people , " he said .
A CRTC spokesperson confirmed late Friday that it has received about 10,000 consumer comments and that most of them were " complaints . "
The broadcasters , however , agree that ordinary Canadians should not have to absorb higher costs .
Rather , the cable and satellite companies should voluntarily eat the difference , they say .
Broadcasters say they just want the ability to negotiate " fair value " for their signals , but deny they already have a price in mind .
They 've warned the CRTC for years the industry faces a " systematic problem , " now that more viewers are migrating to specialty channels and the Internet .
Earlier this year , the CRTC reported that profits at conventional TV networks tumbled by more than 90 per cent last year as revenues shrank and costs grew .
The industry 's profits before interest and taxes were $ 8 million for 2008 versus $ 112.9 million in 2007 .
" It is not something that is going to go away in the next two years .
It is a chronic issue , " said Steven Guiton , the CBC 's chief regulatory officer .

But Bell Canada , which owns Bell TV satellite service and a 15 per cent stake in CTVglobemedia , argues the broadcasting business is merely evolving .
" Canadian broadcasters have adapted to the changes and remained financially healthy , although the source of their profits is shifting from conventional to specialty / pay , " Bell said in a document last week .
CTV and CanWest each own a stable of specialty channels .
Cable and satellite companies currently pay carriage fees to distribute specialty TV channels but not for conventional stations as those signals can be pulled in for free with an antenna .

( CNN ) -- President Obama said Friday that he was " surprised and deeply humbled " by the decision of the Norwegian Nobel Committee to award him the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize .
President Obama , speaking Friday , said the award was " an affirmation of American leadership . "
The committee said it honored Obama for his " extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples . "
Obama said he viewed the decision less as a recognition of his own accomplishments and more as " a call to action . "
The decision appeared to catch most observers by surprise .
Nominations for the prize had to be postmarked by February 1 , only 12 days after Obama took office .
The committee sent out its solicitation for nominations last September , two months before Obama was elected president .
Obama had not been mentioned as among front - runners for the prize , and the roomful of reporters gasped when Thorbjorn Jagland , chairman of the Nobel committee , announced that the president was the winner .
The Nobel committee recognized Obama 's efforts at dialogue to solve complex global problems , including working toward a world free of nuclear weapons .
Watch CNN 's Christiane Amanpour 's analysis »
" Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the world 's attention and given its people hope for a better future , " the committee said .
Jagland said the decision was " unanimous " and came with ease .
Watch the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize announcement »
He rejected the notion that Obama had been recognized prematurely for his efforts and said the committee wanted to promote the president just it had Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 for his efforts to open up the Soviet Union .
Ed Rollins : Obama now must earn it
" His diplomacy is founded in the concept that those who are to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world 's population , " the committee said of Obama .
Listen to Jagland explain why Obama was this year 's choice »
Choosing a winner The Nobel Peace Prize winner is chosen by a five - member committee of lawmakers elected by the Norwegian parliament .
Specially appointed advisers weigh in .
More than a year before the prize is awarded , the Nobel committee seeks nominations from members of governments and international courts , heads of universities , academics and previous Nobel laureates .
Self - nominations are not allowed .
The nomination deadline is in February .
The committee makes its final vote in October .
The winner is determined by a simple majority vote .
Obama said he did not feel he deserved " to be in the company " of past Peace Prize winners , but would accept the prize while pushing for a broad range of international objectives , including nuclear nonproliferation , a reversal of the global economic downturn and a resolution of the Arab - Israeli conflict .
He also acknowledged the ongoing U.S. conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan , noting that he is the " commander in chief of a country that is responsible for ending a war and working in another theater to confront a ruthless adversary that directly threatens the American people " and U.S. allies .
" This award is not simply about my administration , " he said .
It " must be shared " with everyone who strives for " justice and dignity . "
Watch Obama react to receiving the prize »
It was just before 6 a.m. that the president learned he had won the award , said Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary .
The announcement by the committee caught the White House off guard .
One senior administration official said that " we were quite surprised . "
Some analysts have speculated that the prize could give Obama additional clout as he forms a new strategy for the war in Afghanistan and attempts to engage Iran and North Korea .
Another senior administration official told CNN he hopes the White House can " use it for the positive . "
The domestic political consequences are unclear .
Obama 's supporters hope the prestige associated with the prize will strengthen the president 's hand in the health care reform debate .
A top Republican from George W. Bush 's administration , however , argued that " this will backfire on them for a while " and asserted it was " a gift to the right . "
Zakaria : Nobel honors Obama 's ' bold gambit '
Obama , the first African - American to win the White House , is the fourth U.S. president to win the prestigious prize and the third sitting president to do so .
Former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari , last year 's laureate , said it was clear the Nobel committee wanted to encourage Obama on the issues he has been discussing on the world stage .
" I see this as an important encouragement , " Ahtisaari said .
The committee wanted to be " far more daring " than in recent times and make an impact on global politics , said Kristian Berg Harpviken , director of the International Peace Research Institute .
Praise , skepticism greet Nobel announcement
While most Nobel prizes are awarded by committees based in Sweden , the Peace Prize is determined by a five - member panel appointed by the Norwegian parliament .
Wangari Muta Maathai , the Kenyan environmentalist who won the 2004 Peace Prize , said the win for Obama , whose father was Kenyan , will help Africa move forward .
" I think it is extraordinary , " she said .
" It will be even greater inspiration for the world .
He has shown how we can probably come together , work together in a cooperative way . "
Mohamed ElBaradei , who won the 2005 Peace Prize for his efforts to prevent nuclear energy being used for military means , said Obama deserved to win for his efforts to bring Iran to the table for direct nuclear talks with the United States .
" I could not think of anybody who is more deserving , " said ElBaradei , the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Listen to ElBaradei react to the announcement »
The award comes at a crucial time for Obama , who has multiple administration officials dispatched on global peace missions .
Obama 's envoy to the Middle East , George Mitchell , has returned to the region to advocate for peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians .
Mitchell met Thursday with Israeli President Shimon Peres .
He plans to meet Friday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before talking with Palestinian leaders in the West Bank .
A view from Egypt : Obama honor premature
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was starting a six - day trip to Russia and Europe on Friday .
On the trip , the secretary will discuss the next steps on Iran and North Korea , and international efforts to have the two countries end their nuclear programs .
The centerpiece of the trip will be her visit to Moscow , where she will work toward an agreement to take the place of the Start II arms control pact , which expires December 5 .
She also will address the new bilateral presidential commission that is working on a broad range of issues , from arms control to health .
" This is an encouragement to this president to continue to follow through on those commitments when , inevitably , he hits the bump in the road , " said John King , CNN chief national correspondent .
" The committee is essentially saying , ' Stay at it , Mr. President .
You have our prestige behind you now . ' " Laureates to Nobel winners : Prepare for ' lightning bolt '
King noted that the Nobel Committee pushes " multilateralism around the world [ and ] very much disliked the prior U.S. president [ George W. Bush ] .
...
This is in part a reflection of that as well . "
Bush was heavily criticized during his presidency for what some observers said was an excessive reliance on unilateral action and U.S. military power .
In a statement announcing its decision , the committee said that multilateral diplomacy " has regained a central position , with emphasis on the role that the United Nations and other international institutions can play .
Dialogue and negotiations are preferred as instruments for resolving even the most difficult international conflicts . "
Obama unique among presidential Nobel winners
The decision of the international committee to award Obama the prize highlights the sharp contrast in views toward the president at home and abroad .
Watch how online community reacted »
Obama remains extraordinarily popular overseas , particularly in Western Europe .
A recent Pew Research Center survey found that more than three - quarters of respondents in Britain , Germany , France and Spain approve of Obama 's foreign policy .
In the United States , however , Obama 's overall approval ratings have declined .
An October 1 - 5 Associated Press poll showed that 56 percent of Americans approved of Obama 's job performance .
A September 17 - 20 NBC / Wall Street Journal poll found that only half of all Americans backed his handling of foreign policy .
The split perception was illustrated earlier this year by a U.S. university 's decision to deny Obama an honorary degree when he delivered a commencement address at the school .
While the Nobel Committee on Friday praised Obama for his " extraordinary effort , " a spokesman for Arizona State University said last spring that Obama 's " body of work is yet to come .
That 's why we 're not recognizing him with a degree at the beginning of his presidency . "

The last sitting U.S. president to win the peace prize was Woodrow Wilson in 1919 .
The other was Theodore Roosevelt in 1906 .
Jimmy Carter had been out of office for more than two decades when he won in 2002 .
This year 's Peace Prize nominees included 172 people -- among them three Chinese dissidents , an Afghan activist and a controversial Colombian lawmaker -- and 33 organizations , the highest number of nominations ever .
The Nobel recipient receives a prize of about $ 1.4 million .
Obama plans to donate the money to charity , a White House spokesman said .

Today ’s statement from the BLS Commissioner notes :
Job losses continued in September , and the unemployment rate continued to trend up , reaching 9.8 percent .
Nonfarm payroll employment fell by 263,000 over the month , and losses have averaged 307,000 per month since May .
Payroll employment has fallen for 21 consecutive months , with declines totaling 7.2 million .
In September , notable job losses occurred in construction , manufacturing , government , and retail trade .
Based on today ’s report on the employment situation , the real unemployment rate U - 6 , the best and most realistic unemployment measure , has now reached 17 % :
The numbers are worse than analysts had expected :
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected non-farm payrolls to drop 180,000 in September and the unemployment rate to rise to 9.8 percent from 9.7 percent the prior month .
The poll was conducted before reports , including regional manufacturing surveys , showed some deterioration in employment measures .

This concept proposes a multitouch interaction system that does not require a multitouch screen ( and thus does not have to deal with all the problems such a screen causes ) , but instead uses a multitouch area near the keyboard .
The proposed graphical user interface makes full use of this multitouch area .
Watch the video , it ’s definitely worth your time ( of course , some people disagree ☺ ) .

In April , NASA ’s space - based Swift satellite sent back a text message announcing that it had detected a gamma-ray burst , the remains of an extraordinarily violent explosion that ended the life of a distant star .
Since then , astronomers using ground - based telescopes have been able to measure the spectrum of the burst ’s infrared afterglow and estimate its distance from Earth .
When you look at the stars , you are looking at light that comes from the past .
This gamma-ray burst , officially GRB 090423 , is , in fact , the most distant , and oldest object , yet detected in our universe ; it is some 13.1 billion light - years away .
In other words , this is the vestige of an explosion that took place a mere ( when it comes to the life of the universe ) 630 million years after the Big Bang .
Light coming to us from such a distance is stretched because the universe is expanding .
The greater the stretching  called redshift  the more distant the object .
The previous most - distant object , a galaxy , has a redshift of 6.96 .
GRB 090423 has a redshift of 8.2 and appears to observers as an extremely red point of light .
When that explosion took place , the universe was more than nine times smaller than it is now .
It ’s one thing to explore such remote recesses of time in theory .
It ’s something else again to witness their afterglow .
And GRB 090423 is an invitation for all of us to unfetter our imaginations .
We imagine looking outward from that distant point knowing that our own exploration still lies some 13 billion years in the future .

Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Richard A. Posner ( avatar shown above ) gave a lecture in the virtual world of Second Life on December 7 , 2007 , where he discussed his latest book , Not a Suicide Pact , his defense of the Patriot Act , copyright , and other topics .
Richard Posner 's latest conversion is both charming and alarming .
It is charming because it exhibits a youthful enthusiasm for a newly discovered idea : Keynesianism .
He just recently read John Maynard Keynes 's book The General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money .
Posner 's tone echoes that of Paul Samuelson , when he says ,
To have been born as an economist before 1936 was a boon — yes .
But not to have been born too long before !
Then Samuelson quotes William Wordsworth :
Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive ,
But to be young was very heaven !
I can see why Posner might find it liberating .
In recent years , Posner abandoned his rational - choice approach in law for what he has been calling " pragmatism . "
Keynes also thought of himself as a pragmatic , nondoctrinaire person — one who by skillful policy would save the best of capitalism .
( Of course , his antipathy to stock markets , the resource - allocation role of interest rates , and even the idea of inherent scarcity makes one wonder what he was trying to save .
Let that pass . )
So Keynes enables Posner to throw off the shackles of rational choice almost completely .
It is also alarming to see Posner go this way — picking up the " latest " intellectual fashion with little regard for the mountain of scholarly criticism of Keynes 's book that has accumulated since its publication .
Posner is a voracious reader and a brilliant man .
Has he forgotten to perform his " due diligence " ?
I do not know .
I do know that he writes his article in the New Republic as if nothing had been written critical of Keynes .
It especially disturbs me that he ignores both F. A. Hayek and Milton Friedman , each of whom had a few important things to say .
Perhaps it is too much to ask for subtlety in a magazine article .
And yet Posner has been subtle in general forums of discussion in the past .
As an author of The Economics of Time and Ignorance , I am fully on board about incorporating some of the valuable insights Keynes had into my own largely Austrian perspective .
I have even blogged about the similarities between Keynes 's view of the method of economics and that of Hayek .
They both were strong proponents of " subjectivism " and opponents of excessive formalization .
On the other hand , I can understand the dismissive attitude toward Keynes exhibited by Ludwig von Mises .
Mises thought that Keynes was an enemy of the economic way of thinking .
He entitled a critique of Keynesianism , " Stones into Bread : The Keynesian Miracle . "
A fundamental difficulty with Keynes is that he gives us no way of determining when ordinary rational - choice microeconomics — with its concern for such mundane things as resource allocation — is appropriate and when it is not .
Even in nonrecessionary times we are always threatened with sour animal spirits .
Consider this statement from Posner 's article :
Owing to uncertainty , businessmen even in the best of times lack " strong roots of conviction " in their estimate of what the future holds , and so a sudden change in economic conditions can paralyze them .
If so , a downward spiral will develop , as falling demand and falling investment reinforce each other , causing layoffs that reduce incomes and therefore consumption and production , and so induce more layoffs .
( emphasis added )
Interest rates must be kept permanently low to avoid continual falls into recession .
So the idea of a market mechanism to allocate resources over time is kaput .
Stock markets are casinos .
The " socialization of investment " ( whatever that means exactly ) must take over .
The Keynesian is thus always in a position to annul microeconomics " temporarily . "
I do n't believe that Posner fully understands what he has accepted .
Youthful enthusiasm has its virtues .
But we can not be young in spirit forever .
For this we should give thanks .
I have requested that this letter from the Harvard Medical School ( Class of 1955 ) be posted on our blog .
I wanted to call attention to this letter even though it does n’t explicitly support single payer , because many of the signers are strong single payer advocates .
The signers include significant leaders in medicine – chairmen of departments , deans , professors at major medical schools and prominent practicing physicians .
I hope that they will turn their advocacy in the future towards promoting Medicare for All .
— Oliver Fein , M.D.
Fifty - nine members of the Harvard Medical School Class of 1959 are convinced that reform of the American health care system is essential , must be substantial and carefully designed , and must include a public health insurance option .
We present our position in this statement , a result of intense discussions begun at our June reunion commemorating 50 years since graduation .
We are a majority of our 112 living American classmates .
Six declined to sign the statement because they disagree with it , 3 more because it is not detailed enough , and 44 expressed no opinion .
Each of the signers has 50 years of experience and leadership in clinical practice , medical education , administration , and / or research .
Our collective careers cover a wide variety of primary care and specialty fields in a range of organizational settings , in both private practice and academia , across the United States .
We believe that our humane and enlightened country , committed to “ life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ” , has the obligation to provide everyone with the opportunity to obtain affordable insurance and quality health care .
We support President Obama ’s proposal that all citizens should be offered the option of a government - sponsored medical insurance plan , along with private options .
In our opinion , health care reform will fail without the discipline of competition from a public option .
Excluding a public option would throw away a vital opportunity to test different ways to provide quality care for all .
A public plan would help develop and evaluate new standards of practice , malpractice reform , and reimbursement of physicians , and would emphasize preventive care .
To be affordable , it would have to avoid financial incentives for unnecessary services and contain measures that curb financial abuse and waste by some hospitals and , unfortunately , by some of our medical colleagues .
A public option would also identify and encourage use of demonstrated best practices shown to be effective at less cost , offer greater access , and provide higher quality of care .
Administrative overhead , as now in Medicare , would be significantly lower without for - profit intermediaries .
These innovations could help lift the competitive burden that health care places on American employers in the global marketplace , while also offering portability and continuity of coverage during job changes and illness .
Common sense demands a planned , full comparison of the relative benefits of public vs. private options .
At the outset , there must be clear and uniform ground rules for measuring , reporting , and evaluating cost , access , and quality of care for all plans .
We urge Congress and the President to take this courageous step at a vital time in our nation ’s history .
Names and relevant positions of signers are attached .
This statement represents only their opinions , not necessarily those of other 1959 graduates of Harvard Medical School or of that institution .

Lobbyists opposed to new curbs on the multi-trillion dollar market for financial derivatives are trying to shift lawmakers ' attention away from Wall Street to the impact the rules would have on big industrial businesses .
The Obama administration and congressional Democrats are working on a proposal to rein in the market for derivatives by trying to move most of the financial transactions onto central clearinghouses or public exchanges .
The market is now largely opaque and unregulated , and many critics and government officials blame derivatives for exacerbating the financial crisis last year .

Credit default swaps , one form of derivatives , were central to the downfall of Lehman Brothers and American International Group ( AIG ) and the ensuing credit crisis .
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) circulated a 187 - page bill on the issue on Friday evening and will hold a hearing on Wednesday .
Frank is eying a vote on the legislation in his committee before the end of October .
Financial and business lobbyists , alongside centrist Democrats , have been making the case that some derivatives are so tailored to specific business needs that they should not be part of the new set of clearinghouses and exchanges .
The effort aligns Wall Street banks that are the primary dealers of financial derivatives with big businesses that are largely the banks ' clients .
The business groups formed The Coalition for Derivatives End-Users to press their argument , and on Friday they sent a letter to senators asking them to preserve the market for customized derivatives .
The effort is organized by the Business Roundtable , National Association of Manufacturers and U.S. Chamber of Commerce , and the letter was signed by more than 170 organizations .
" By insulating companies from risk , customized OTC derivatives provide businesses with access to lower cost capital — enabling them to grow , make new investments and retain and create new jobs , " the organizations wrote .
New Democrats , a group of business - minded Democrats in the House , praised Frank 's bill on Friday for helping those " end users . " Rep. Melissa Bean ( D - Ill. ) said the legislation would provide " robust and dynamic oversight " of the market , " while preserving appropriate risk - management tools for end users . " Rep. Michael McMahon ( D - N.Y. ) , another New Democrat , said Congress was making progress on the issue and some of the earlier criticism to outlaw the market was misplaced .
" A year ago , many critics of derivatives were ready to eliminate the entire over - the - counter market .
This reaction was unreasonable and not in the best interest of our economy , " McMahon said .
OMG you 're a complete utter tin foil lunatic ...
Nothing of what you said has actually been proven to exist and / or work .

Absolutely , and then a true researcher will be able to separate idiotic mumbo- jumbo from reality .

I 've studied that BS well beyond the point of seeing it was all BS just for the fun of it .

The US has every characteristic of a failed state .
The US government ’s current operating budget is dependent on foreign financing and money creation .
Too politically weak to be able to advance its interests through diplomacy , the US relies on terrorism and military aggression .
Costs are out of control , and priorities are skewed in the interest of rich organized interest groups at the expense of the vast majority of citizens .
For example , war at all cost , which enriches the armaments industry , the officer corps and the financial firms that handle the war ’s financing , takes precedence over the needs of American citizens .
There is no money to provide the uninsured with health care , but Pentagon officials have told the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in the House that every gallon of gasoline delivered to US troops in Afghanistan costs American taxpayers $ 400 .
" It is a number that we were not aware of and it is worrisome , " said Rep. John Murtha , chairman of the subcommittee .
According to reports , the US Marines in Afghanistan use 800,000 gallons of gasoline per day .
At $ 400 per gallon , that comes to a $ 320,000,000 daily fuel bill for the Marines alone .
Only a country totally out of control would squander resources in this way .
While the US government squanders $ 400 per gallon of gasoline in order to kill women and children in Afghanistan , many millions of Americans have lost their jobs and their homes and are experiencing the kind of misery that is the daily life of poor third - world peoples .
Americans are living in their cars and in public parks .
America ’s cities , towns , and states are suffering from the costs of economic dislocations and the reduction in tax revenues from the economy ’s decline .
Yet , Obama has sent more troops to Afghanistan , a country half way around the world that is not a threat to America .
It costs $ 750,000 per year for each soldier we have in Afghanistan .
The soldiers , who are at risk of life and limb , are paid a pittance , but all of the privatized services to the military are rolling in excess profits .
One of the great frauds perpetuated on the American people was the privatization of services that the US military traditionally performed for itself .
" Our " elected leaders could not resist any opportunity to create at taxpayers ’ expense private wealth that could be recycled to politicians in campaign contributions .
Republicans and Democrats on the take from the private insurance companies maintain that the US cannot afford to provide Americans with health care and that cuts must be made even in Social Security and Medicare .
So how can the US afford bankrupting wars , much less totally pointless wars that serve no American interest ?
The enormous scale of foreign borrowing and money creation necessary to finance Washington ’s wars are sending the dollar to historic lows .
The dollar has even experienced large declines relative to currencies of third - world countries such as Botswana and Brazil .
The decline in the dollar ’s value reduces the purchasing power of Americans ’ already declining incomes .
Despite the lowest level of housing starts in 64 years , the US housing market is flooded with unsold homes , and financial institutions have a huge and rising inventory of foreclosed homes not yet on the market .
Industrial production has collapsed to the level of 1999 , wiping out a decade of growth in industrial output .
The enormous bank reserves created by the Federal Reserve are not finding their way into the economy .
Instead , the banks are hoarding the reserves as insurance against the fraudulent derivatives that they purchased from the gangster Wall Street investment banks .
The regulatory agencies have been corrupted by private interests .
Frontline reports that Alan Greenspan , Robert Rubin , and Larry Summers blocked Brooksley Born , the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from regulating derivatives .
President Obama rewarded Larry Summers for his idiocy by appointing him Director of the National Economic Council .
What this means is that profits for Wall Street will continue to be leeched from the diminishing blood supply of the American economy .
An unmistakable sign of third - world despotism is a police force that sees the public as the enemy .
Thanks to the federal government , our local police forces are now militarized and imbued with hostile attitudes toward the public .
SWAT teams have proliferated , and even small towns now have police forces with the firepower of US Special Forces .
Summons are increasingly delivered by SWAT teams that tyrannize citizens with broken down doors , a $ 400 or $ 500 repair born by the tyrannized resident .
Recently a mayor and his family were the recipients of incompetence by the town ’s local SWAT team , which mistakenly wrecked the mayor ’s home , terrorized his family , and killed the family ’s two friendly Labrador dogs .
If a town ’s mayor can be treated in this way , what do you think is the fate of the poor white or black ?
Or the idealistic student who protests his government ’s inhumanity ?
In any failed state , the greatest threat to the population comes from the government and the police .
That is certainly the situation today in the USA .
Americans have no greater enemy than their own government .
Washington is controlled by interest groups that enrich themselves at the expense of the American people .
The one percent that comprise the superrich are laughing as they say , " let them eat cake . "
The Best of Paul Craig Roberts
Sales received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2005
US comedian Soupy Sales , who had some 20,000 pies thrown at him during a career spanning half a century , has died at the age of 83 .
Sales died in a hospice in New York after being admitted a week ago , his former manager Dave Usher said .
During the 1950s and 60s , Sales was one of the most instantly recognisable faces in the US , Mr Usher said .
Having pies hurled at him became his trademark act and he acknowledged it would be his legacy .
" I 'll probably be remembered for the pies , and that 's all right , " he said in a 1985 interview .
Sales was born Milton Supman on 8 January 1926 , in Franklinton , North Carolina .
Bow tie
His television career began in 1951 hosting a children 's show in Cleveland , before moving to Detroit where he drew large audiences on a local station .
Appealing to adults and children alike , the show went nationwide with co-star puppets White Fang ( the meanest dog in the United States ) and Black Tooth ( the nicest dog in the United States ) .
Celebrities including Frank Sinatra and Shirley MacLaine appeared on his show to be spattered with a pie while standing next to the comedian , often wearing his trademark black jumper and oversized bow tie .
Sales remained a familiar television face , first as a regular from 1968 - 75 on the game show What 's My Line ? and later appearing on The Love Boat .
He also played himself in the 1998 Eddie Murphy film Holy Man .
Sales is survived by his wife , Trudy , and two sons , Hunt and Tony .
Ares I - X rocket chalks up successful test flight , CNet
" But in a departure from the expected flight program , the dummy second stage went into a flat tumble as it continued along its ballistic trajectory instead of maintaining a nose - forward orientation .
The dummy upper stage rose to a maximum altitude of about 150,000 feet before arcing over and plunging back to Earth 150 miles east of the space center . "
' We stand today on the shoulders of giants , ' rocket manager says , Huntsville Times
" One area of concern comes from the separation of the first - stage solid rocket booster and the upper stage mockup , Davis said .
" We are looking into that .
It appeared the upper stage could have come back and made contact with the first - stage booster , " he said .
" That 's what testing a design is all about , though .
We 've had some concerns , and now we 've got hard information coming back so we can improve on Ares . "
Ares test launch helps NASA ' avoid potential political damage ' , Huntsville Times
" Griffin , who is working to develop a Center for Systems Studies at UAH , watched the launch on his computer .
" It was marvelous , " he said .
" It was right on trajectory the whole way . "
Keith 's note :
In this NASA CGI video of a computer simulation of the Ares 1 - X , the first stage is shown slowly tumbling at staging and the second stage is shown flying on straight after staging only to start tumbling later .
But the actual flight shows the first stage in steady flight and the second stage flying almost backward .
According to Bill Harwood 's article in CNet , Mission Manager Bob Ess said " So far , we 're on a path to learn a lot .
The separation seemed a little different than we predicted as far as how the upper stage reacted after separation .
So right there 's an opportunity for us to jump in and figure out what was different in the actual flight from our models .
So , hugely successful . " ?
AS for Mike Griffin 's comment about the rocket being " right on trajectory " I am going to assume that he shut off the video feed before staging .
Hmm , had there been a crew in a real capsule on a real second stage this might have been a slight problem .
Yes , there was no second stage motor .
But what if there was a real motor and it failed to start ?
One would think , at a minimum , that you 'd like to have a design that defaults to a safe stage separation regardless of whether second stage ignition occurs such that a crew abort could be initiated .
Its these high altitude abort scenarios that NASA managers often wave around to disqualify EELVs for use with human crews .
Then again , this was a flight test .
And this aspect of the flight of Ares 1 - X demonstrates precisely why they are valuable .

Following extensive discussions over the past 24 hours , the Force India Formula One Team has agreed to release Giancarlo Fisichella from his contract to join the Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro team for the remainder of the 2009 season , starting with immediate effect .
Dr Vijay Mallya , chairman and team principal , commented , ‘ Giancarlo and his management team approached me yesterday with the proposal from Ferrari .
For any Italian driver , a Ferrari race seat is a long - held dream and for Giancarlo it was no exception .
No one should stand in the way of this .
Furthermore the agreement will secure Giancarlo ’s long - term future with Ferrari and it would be incorrect to jeopardise this , particularly when Giancarlo has made such a vital contribution to Force India .
‘ We would like to stress that we have not agreed any financial settlement with Ferrari .
This agreement has been made in good faith and for the good of Giancarlo and the sport in general .
A competitive Italian driver in a Ferrari for Monza is a positive story for Formula One , which can only help raise the sport ’s profile in these difficult times .
‘ We would like to thank Giancarlo for all his help over the past one and a half seasons and for delivering us our first World Championship points last weekend .
He has been an integral part of the team and we owe him a great deal for his input behind the scenes and performance out on track .
We wish him all the best for the future .
‘ For Force India , this sport is a team effort and removing one part , even a major one , will not significantly affect our performance .
The competitiveness of the team seen in Belgium was a result of hard work in the factory and wind tunnel and we have further developments coming for the final races , so we are confident this momentum can be sustained .
We are now looking forward to a strong finish to the season . ’
Giancarlo commented , ‘ I am very grateful to Vijay Mallya for allowing me this opportunity to drive for the Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro team .
It is true that it has always been an ambition to do this , and for Vijay to have allowed it to become a reality is very generous .
I hope in my turn I have helped Force India grow up and be on the right path to achieve their own ambitions .
They are now a very competitive team and I wish them all the very best . ’
A decision regarding the driver of car number 21 will be made in the coming days and no further comment will be made on this front .

he previous articles in this series ( see the Related Resources section in the left column ) covered the releases of Python 3.0 and Python 2.6 .
Despite the relative youth of these versions , the Python core developers have already created Python 3.1 , which was released on June 27 , 2009 — less than seven months after the release of Python 3.0 .
While the 3.1 release has much smaller scope than Python 3.0 , it still brings several interesting features , additions — and everybody 's favorite — performance improvements !
Core Language Changes
I 'll cover changes to the core language first , and then move on to changes in the standard library and performance improvements .
String Formatting
One welcome feature is the ability to auto - number format fields .
Formatting strings is a very common operation in many programs .
Python 2.x has the [ s ] printf - like percent operation :
>>> '%s , %s ! ' % ( ' Hello ' , ' World ' ) ' Hello , World ! '
Python 3.0 added advanced string formatting capabilities ( PEP - 3101 ) modeled after C# 's format syntax :
>>> '{0} , { 1} !'. format( ' Hello ' , ' World ' ) ' Hello , World ! '
This is better for many reasons ( see the Advanced String Formatting topic in this earlier article ) , but Python 3.1 improves it further .
In Python 3.0 you had to specify the index of each positional argument whenever you referred to them in the format string .
In Python 3.1 you can simply drop the index and Python will populate the arguments in sequence :
>>> '{} , {} !'. format ( ' Hello ' , ' World ' ) ' Hello , World ! '
PEP - 378 : Format Specifier for Thousands Separator
In financial applications , a thousands separator is the norm .
Bankers and accountants do n't write " You owe me $ 12345678 , " but rather " You owe me $ 12,345,678 , " with commas ( or another character ) as separators .
Here 's how you achieve that in Python :
>>> format( 12345678 , ' , ' ) ' 12,345,678 '
You can combine it with other specifiers .
The width specifier ( 8 in the example below ) includes the commas and decimal point :
>>> format( 12345.678 , ' 8,.1 f ')
' 12,345.7 '
A comma is the default separator character ; if you want to use a different separator you 'll need to substitute the character you prefer using replace :
>>> format ( 1234 , ' , ' ) .replace ( ' , ' , '_ ' ) ' 1_234 '
Of course , you can also use the format function as a string method :
>>> '{ 0:8,.1 f}'.format( 123.456 ) ' 123.5 '
This seems like a minor addition to me ; basically it simply adds one more display specifier to the format function that still does n't handle the more difficult cases of formatting content for different locales ; that remains your responsibility .
Still , the addition got its own PEP that encouraged a lively discussion , with at least two proposals .
The maketrans Function
Together , the maketrans ( ) and translate ( ) functions let you replace a set of characters with a different set .
Although I have never used maketrans ( ) / translate ( ) in a real application , I assume that they 're highly efficient .
Using the functionality is a little cumbersome , because it requires that you build a translation table using maketrans ( ) that maps input characters to output characters .
You then pass the resulting translation table to the translate ( ) function .
The string module still has its own maketrans ( ) function , but that has been deprecated in Python 3.1 in favor of separate maketrans ( ) functions that operate on bytes , bytearrays , and str .
Here 's an example that demonstrates how to use maketrans ( ) and translate ( ) with a bytes object .
Note that the translation table for bytes has 256 entries ( one for each possible byte ) , and this example maps most bytes to themselves — the exceptions are 1 , 2 , and 3 , which the table maps to 4 , 5 and 6 respectively :
>>> tt = bytes.maketrans ( b' 123 ' , b'456 ' ) >>> len( tt ) 256 >>> tt b'\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08 \ t
\x0b\x0c\r\x0e\x0f\x10\x11\x12\x13 \ x14\x15\x16\x17\x18\x19\x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\ x1e\x1f ! " #$ %&\'()*+,-./0456456789:;<=> ?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\ ] ^_`abcd efghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~\x7f\x80\x81\ x82\x83\x84\x85\x86\x87\x88\x89\x8a\x8b\ x8c\x8d\x8e\x8f\x90\x91\x92\x93\x94\x95 \ x96\x97\x98\x99\x9a\x9b\x9c\x9d\x9e\x9f\ xa0\xa1\xa2\xa3\xa4\xa5\xa6\xa7\xa8\xa9 \ xaa\xab\xac\xad\xae\xaf\xb0\xb1\xb2\xb3\ xb4\xb5\xb6\xb7\xb8\xb9\xba\xbb\xbc\xbd\ xbe\xbf\xc0\xc1\xc2\xc3\xc4\xc5\xc6\xc7\ xc8\xc9\xca\xcb\xcc\xcd\xce\xcf\xd0\xd1\ xd2\xd3\xd4\xd5\xd6\xd7\xd8\xd9\xda\xdb\ xdc\xdd\xde\xdf\xe0\xe1\xe2\xe3\xe4\xe5 \ xe6\xe7\xe8\xe9\xea\xeb\xec\xed\xee\xef\ xf0\xf1\xf2\xf3\xf4\xf5\xf6\xf7\xf8\xf9\ xfa\xfb\xfc\xfd\xfe\xff '
After you have the translation table you just pass it to the translate ( ) function :
>>> b'123456'.translate ( tt ) b'456456 '
You may also pass an additional argument that simply deletes characters :
>>> b'123456'.translate ( tt , b'5 ' ) b'45646 '
It 's interesting to see that the original 5 from 123456 was deleted , but the translated 5 ( remember , the table translates 2 s to 5 s ) was n't .
That implies that translate first deletes the characters from the original string and then applies the translation .
Translating strings is a little different .
Rather than a fixed translation table of all possible characters ( remember , strings are Unicode now ) the string version of maketrans returns a dictionary .
This public option would include the State opt - out provision , and would not be tied to medicare rates :
Another important point : Reid ’s version of the public option is different from the more liberal version advocated by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi in two key ways :
1 ) Reid ’s version would allow individual states to opt- out of the program , giving public option critics the chance to say that their states retain the right to scrap the idea ; and , 2 ) Under Reid ’s plan , the new government insurance program would have to negotiate payment rates with health care providers .
Under Pelosi’s , payment rates would be tied to the lower rates paid by Medicare .
If you remember , Howard Dean is OK with the State opt - out provision , and the HELP bill was not tied to medicare rates , so that was never realistic in the Senate anyway .
I am OK with both of these provisions ( while of course hope we get something stronger after reconciliation with the House ) .
The article goes on to say that Baucus is " apoplectic , " and is at " DEFCON 1 . "
Sorry Max , Obama is President , not you .
Feel free to vote against the Bill , but we all know you wo n't be the one to single - handedly kill HCR by voting against cloture , right ?

We ’ve all been told that there ’s another “ Wave ” of foreclosures coming and I ’ve even done some of my own planning based on that prediction .
Almost all of the people I ’ve heard the next “ wave theory ” from were just repeating what they had heard from someone else .
The more thoughtful of these pointed to the continuing rise in Notices Of Default but we all scratched our heads because the expected actual foreclosures did n’t show up on the REO market .
What happened ?
The foreclosures seemed to get lost on their way to the MLS …
I had nothing objective to base it on but just started losing my faith in the Foreclosure Wave theory a few months ago .
Then I finally found an objective explanation of why the foreclosures are n’t showing up on the expected schedule .
Check out this chart which shows what happened to foreclosures after Secretary Paulson ’s Troubled Asset Relief announcement last September 19th .
Here it is on the chart , courtesy of Sean O’Toole of Foreclosure Truth.com .
O’Toole explains , “ While many will point out this was necessary to keep home loans available and interest rates low , I think it also clearly sent banks a message … you will get more for these assets from the taxpayer than you will through foreclosure .
Add to that the mark - to - model rule changes from the Federal Accounting Standards Board , and a ton of politicial pressure and it should be no surprise to anyone that foreclosures have slowed .
The drop in foreclosure sales defies logic given the continued increase in properties scheduled to be foreclosed on .
But defying logic to do what is politically expedient while simultaneously inflating bank earnings and bonuses and without regard to future consequences IS the new normal .
We are yet again trading tomorrow for today . ” ( Full Article here )
Whether O’Toole ’s analysis is right or wrong , the fact remains , Investors can no longer choose from many available foreclosures like in the “ old days ” of 6 months ago .
I believe there are still good deals out there , we just have to look harder for them .
The larger spread from buy to sell which is available in foreclosures is what allows me to do large energy saving packages in the renovation and still sell my projects to first time buyers .
So even if the good deals are harder to find , they are worth the effort .
Here are three techniques that I ’m using while waiting for the wave .
1. Increased attention to Short Sales .
As you know these can take a long time , so it ’s good to have a lot of offers in the pipeline .
My broker and I have turned our attention to Short Sales and recently got one ( after 5 months )
2. Remember the Ugly House .
The house that I just put in escrow last week may qualify for the “ Ugliest House ” award .
Certainly in the City , Maybe the State .
My perfect plan is to buy the Worst House in the neighborhood and make it the Best House in the neighborhood .
We call it our Cinderella Process .
I ’ll be showing pictures and talking about my latest Ugly House on the RoundTable Conference Calls every Tuesday at 6 pm Pacific .
Sign up on the FREE WEBINAR form and I will send you the slide deck before the Conference Call .
3. More Conventional Ways Of Finding Motivated Sellers .
We ’ve really gotten spoiled this last year with such easy pickings in the REO market .
It ’s time to dust off some of the harder ways to find those great deals .
Pre foreclosure letters , signs , working with attorneys ….
none of which are my specialty , but I will post here and we can learn together .
The effort is worth it and we need really good deals if we are going to Save The Planet , One House At A Time thru Energy - Wise House Flipping .
And who knows .
The political winds and banking rules may change and the “ Wave ” may really come .
Wise investors will have a little cash available for the buying party when it ’s Wave Season .

In an interview with the Telegraph , Woody Allen tells fans how to tell which of his movies are worth their time just from their titles .
He explains : “ I never title a movie until it ’s finished because if I look at the film and it ’s no good I do n’t like to give it an aggressive title , I give it what I call one of my hiding titles — the kind of title that is low - key and promises nothing , so people are less disappointed by it .
But if I feel the film is good , I give it an aggressive , confident title and then hope for the best . ”
To see if this pattern holds up , we ’ve gone through his oeuvre and done our best to determine which titles are low - key and which are aggressive .
Our conclusion :
It holds up , for the most part .
Woody may have been the only person who loved the aggressively titled The Purple Rose of Cairo .
But he probably agreed with everyone else ( except Quentin Tarantino ) that the tentatively titled Anything Else , Another Woman , Melinda and Melinda , Celebrity , and Hollywood Ending were among the worst films of his career .
Aggressive titles :
Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask ( 1972 )
Vicky Cristina Barcelona ( 2008 )
Deconstructing Harry ( 1997 )
The Curse of the Jade Scorpion ( 2001 )
The Purple Rose of Cairo ( 1985 )
What ’s Up , Tiger Lily ? ( 1966 )
A Midsummer Night ’s Sex Comedy ( 1982 )
Sleeper ( 1973 )
Bananas ( 1971 )
Bullets Over Broadway ( 1994 )
Manhattan Murder Mystery ( 1993 )
Mighty Aphrodite ( 1995 )
Crimes and Misdemeanors ( 1989 )
Small Time Crooks ( 2000 )
Manhattan ( 1979 )
Annie Hall ( 1977 )
Hannah and Her Sisters ( 1986 )
Zelig ( 1983 )
Broadway Danny Rose ( 1984 )
Husbands and Wives ( 1992 )
Take the Money and Run ( 1969 )
Cassandra ’s Dream ( 2007 )
Relatively low - key titles :
Shadows and Fog ( 1991 )
Alice ( 1990 )
Match Point ( 2005 )
Sweet and Lowdown ( 1999 )
Radio Days ( 1987 )
Scoop ( 2006 )
September ( 1987 )
Stardust Memories ( 1980 )
Love and Death ( 1975 )
Everyone Says I Love You ( 1996 )
Interiors ( 1978 )
Another Woman ( 1988 )
Hollywood Ending ( 2002 )
Melinda and Melinda ( 2004 )
Anything Else ( 2003 )
Celebrity ( 1998 )
Whatever Works ( 2008 )
Woody Allen Interview [ Telegraph UK ]
New research from Queen Mary , University of London and Harvard Medical School has revealed precisely why taking fish oils can help with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis .
In a paper published in Nature today , researchers describe how the body converts an ingredient found in fish oils into another chemical called Resolvin D2 and how this chemical reduces the inflammation that leads to a variety of diseases .
The research also suggests that Resolvin D2 could be the basis for a new treatment for diseases including sepsis , stroke and arthritis .
Unlike other anti-inflammatory drugs , this chemical does not seem to suppress the immune system .
The researchers , who were funded by the Arthritis Research Campaign , the Wellcome Trust and the National Institutes of Health , looked at a particular ingredient of fish oils called DHA .
They were able to show how the body converts DHA into Resolvin D2 and discover its exact chemical structure .
Mauro Perretti , Professor of Immunopharmacology at Queen Mary , University of London , led the UK team .
He said : " We have known for some time that fish oils can help with conditions like arthritis which are linked to inflammation .
What we 've shown here is how the body processes a particular ingredient of fish oils into Resolvin D2 .
We 've also looked in detail at this chemical , determining at least some of the ways it relieves inflammation .
It seems to be a very powerful chemical and a small amount can have a large effect . "
" This research is important because it explains at least one way in which fish oils can help in different types of arthritis .
We can also work on this chemical and see if it can be used not only to treat or even prevent arthritis , but also as a possible treatment for a variety of other diseases associated with inflammation . "
Arthritis , and many other diseases , are caused by inflammation .
This means that the body 's natural defences against infections are mistakenly directed at healthy tissue .
Previous research has shown that a crucial step in this process occurs when white blood cells , called leukocytes , stick to the inner lining of the blood vessels , called the endothelium .
Researchers studied these blood cells and how they interact with the endothelium in the lab .
When they added Resolvin D2 they found that the endothelial cells produced small amounts of nitric oxide , which acts as a chemical signal discouraging the white blood cells from sticking to the endothelial cells and preventing inflammation .

If digging through build trees for a Mac build of Chromium ( the open source project behind Chrome ) was more trouble than you wanted to go through , here 's some good news for you : developer preview builds for Mac OS X are actually pretty usable for most browsing needs .
We decided to take it for a spin after Google 's Sergey Brin mentioned during the Web 2.0 Summit that he is using developer preview builds on a daily basis .
The developer preview is based on the upcoming version 4 of Google 's upstart browser , and it 's important to note that although it 's publicly accessible , it 's still not quite a beta .
Several release versions have already been available for Windows , and beta releases of version 4 are also available for Windows , but no final or beta vesions have been released for Linux or Mac OS X .
Developer preview builds have been available for a few months , but we found the latest — build 4.0.223.8 — quite usable .
One of Chrome 's defining features include title bar - based " top tabs , " which were much maligned when they appeared in betas of Safari 4 .
( I like the vertical space savings , but to each his own . )
It also has a new tab page that includes thumbnail links to recently visited and most visited pages , cited as the inspiration for Safari 4's " Top Sites " feature .
It also supports custom skinning via themes — often based on famous artists — which some may find fun .
The major technological advantage of Chrome is that each tab within the browser is sandboxed within its own process .
While this method can use significantly more memory to keep dozens of tabs open , it offers a major performance advantage : it prevents problems on one particular web page that might crash the browser from taking all your other open tabs with it .
If you 're running several web apps , it keeps you from losing work in one app if another proves troublesome .
Furthermore , it also offers a major security advantage .
Malicious websites that might otherwise try to use browser vulnerabilities to crack into your system are locked into the sandbox created for each tab .
This security model , which Firefox is already considering using for future versions , has proven solid so far — Chrome was the only browser that was n't hacked in the last Pwn2 Own hacking contest held during the CanSecWest conference this past spring .
Chrome already feels quite snappy loading different types of content .
Just for fun , I ran the Sunspider JavaScript benchmark a few times , and performance does n't appear to any different since we last took a look at bleeding - edge browser JavaScript performance ( for the record , 850.6 ms is the average of three runs ) .
Overall , though , the browser is at least as perceptibly fast as Safari 4 and perhaps a little faster than the latest version of Firefox .
In a nice touch , Chrome will import bookmarks , settings , and history from your current default browser — it had no trouble pulling in this data from Safari and it took less than a minute to get set up and browsing .
Thankfully , it uses the Mac OS X keychain for storing and retrieving online passwords .
Though we did n't test it extensively — this post was researched , uploaded , and edited using the developer preview — Chrome seems stable enough for daily use .
If your current Mac OS X browsing options are n't cutting it for you , or you 're just curious about Chrome , we recommend giving the Chrome for Mac developer preview a try .
UPDATE : As mentioned in the comments by Google Chrome team member Peter Kasting , developer builds have been available for a few months — though some features had yet to be implemented .
After hearing that Sergey Brin mentioned that he is using developer previews at the Web 2.0 Summit , we were under the impression that there was something new .
The opening paragraphs have been updated to reflect the fact that developer preview builds for Mac OS X are n't new .
Learn more about the Public Suffix List
The Public Suffix List is a cross-vendor initiative to provide an accurate list of domain name suffixes , maintained by the hard work of Mozilla volunteers and by submissions from registries , to whom we are very grateful .
The usefulness of this can be seen if we take the example of cookies .
In the past , browsers used an algorithm which only denied setting wide - ranging cookies for top - level domains with no dots ( e.g. com or org ) .
However , this did not work for top - level domains where only third - level registrations are allowed ( e.g. co.uk ) .
In these cases , websites could set a cookie for .co.uk which would be passed onto every website registered under co.uk .
Since there was and remains no algorithmic method of finding the highest level at which a domain may be registered for a particular top - level domain ( the policies differ with each registry ) , the only method is to create a list .
This is the aim of the Public Suffix List .
Software using the Public Suffix List will be able to determine where cookies may and may not be set , protecting the user from being tracked across sites .
As well as this , the Public Suffix List can also be used to support features such as site grouping in browsers .
By knowing where the user - controlled section of the domain name begins and ends , browsers can group cookies and history entries by site in a way that could n't easily be done before .
Some people use the PSL to determine what is a valid domain name and what is n't .
This is dangerous , particularly in these days where new gTLDs are arriving at a rapid pace , if your software does not regularly receive PSL updates , because it will erroneously think new gTLDs are not valid .
The DNS is the proper source for this information .
If you must use it for this purpose , please do not bake static copies of the PSL into your software with no update mechanism .
Uses
These are some of the uses of the list we know about .
If you are using it for something else , you are encouraged to tell us , because it helps us to assess the potential impact of changes .
For that , you can use the psl - discuss mailing list , where we consider issues related to the maintenance , format and semantics of the list .
Note : please do not use this mailing list to request additions to the PSL 's data .

Explanation : Last Friday , a gathering of three bright planets and the Moon graced the morning sky .
With Mercury , Venus , Saturn , and a narrow lunar crescent close to the eastern horizon in the dawn twilight , this picture of the beautiful conjunction was recorded near Noerdlingen , Germany .
These planets are wandering apart now and Mercury is sinking closer toward the rising Sun .
But if you also scan the rest of the sky this week you should be able to add Jupiter and Mars to your planet spotting list , as Mars rises around midnight and Jupiter shines brightly after sunset .
In fact , if you want a better view of Jupiter than Galileo had , you might check out the 2009 International Year of Astronomy activities and events during these next few Galilean Nights ( October 22 - 24 ) .

Gap between top 1 % and bottom 90 % now worse than at any time since 1928 .
Ottawa ( 10 Sept. 2009 ) - Two - thirds of all American income gains from 2002 to 2007 flowed to the top 1 % of U.S. households , giving that privileged minority a larger share of income at the end of the period than at any time since 1928 .
During the period , the average inflation - adjusted income of the top 1 % of households soared by 62 % compared to a gain of just 4 % for the bottom 90 % of households .
The figures , published by the U.S. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities ( CBPP ) , are based on an analysis of newly - released Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) data by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez .
The CBPP is a non-partisan research and policy institute working on federal and state fiscal policies and public programs that affect low - and moderate - income Americans .
10 times faster
The last economic expansion began in November 2001 and ended in December 2007 , according to the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) .
This means that the Piketty - Saez research essentially covers the full period .
Other information revealed by the data :
2007 marked the fifth straight year in which income gains at the top outpaced those of the rest of the population .
The proportionate share of the nation ’s total income going to the top 1 % of households also rose sharply , from 16.9 % in 2002 to 23.5 % in 2007 .
This was a larger share than at any time since 1928 .
( In 2000 , at the peak of the 1990s boom , the top 1 % took home 21.5 % of total national income . )
Income gains have been even more shocking among those at the extreme top of the income scale .
The incomes of the top 1/10th of 1 % of U.S. households grew by 94 % or by $ 3.5 million between 2002 and 2007 .
The overall share of the total national income flowing to the top 1/10th of 1 % rose from 7.3 % in 2002 to 12.3 % in 2007 .
These are the most lopsided figures in Piketty - Saez data going back to 1913 , surpassing even the previous peak in 1928 .
" The uneven distribution of economic gains in recent years continues a longer - term trend that began in the late 1970s , " the CBPP reports .
" In the three decades following World War II ( 1946 - 1976 ) , robust economic gains were shared widely , with the incomes of the bottom 90 % actually increasing more rapidly in percentage terms , on average , than the incomes of the top 1 % , " the center says .
" But in the three decades since 1976 , the incomes of the bottom 90 % of households have risen only slightly , on average , while the incomes of the top 1 % have soared . "

While other top Israeli officials dismissed the UN ’s Gaza War Crimes report with a combination of the usual accusations of personal bias by South African Judge Richard Goldstone and claims of outright anti-semitism behind the assessment of Israel ’s January invasion of the Gaza Strip , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had a surprisingly frank response .
The hawkish Israeli Prime Minister cautioned that world leaders had better publicly reject the report , because they might face similar accusations of war crimes for their behavior in their assorted wars as well .
The UN report cited evidence that both the Israeli military and the Gaza militant groups involved in the conflict committed serious war crimes which might amount to crimes against humanity .
Human rights groups say that the vast majority of the roughly 1,400 Gazans killed by the Israeli attack were civilians .
And while the UN report went out of its way to accuse both sides of war crimes , the United States was among the first to heed Netanyahu ’s calls , condemning the report as “ clearly one - sided . ”
The US was among the most outspoken defenders of the Israeli invasion .

Former US President Jimmy Carter says much of the vitriol against President Barack Obama 's health reforms and spending plans is " based on racism " .
Mr Carter told a public meeting there was " an inherent feeling among many in this country that an African - American should not be president " .
Republican lawmaker Joe Wilson was rebuked on Tuesday in a House vote .
He shouted " You lie ! " while Mr Obama was delivering an address on healthcare to Congress last Wednesday .
The House resolution of disapproval described it as " a breach of decorum " .
ANALYSIS Mark Mardell , BBC North America editor
This debate - which is so difficult to have in America - is beginning to surface .
Carter said he thinks an overwhelming proportion of what he calls " the intensely demonstrated animosity " towards President Obama is based on the fact he 's a black man .
Regarding Joe Wilson , over the weekend we saw people pointing out that he was once a junior aide to a segregationalist politician - and that he was one of the few politicians to vote for the Confederate flag to fly over the state congress in his home state .
Mr Wilson has n't answered these allegations .
But conservatives are furious .
They think their opponents are playing the race card .
They regard it as a cheap shot , because in some ways racism is the worst insult that you can hurl at someone in America .
But Mr Wilson 's eldest son , Alan , has denied racism was a factor in his father 's outburst .
Some conservatives have accused the president 's supporters of playing the race card .
' Abominable '
Angry town hall meetings and a recent taxpayers ' demonstration in Washington have been vitriolic towards the president , reports the BBC's North America editor Mark Mardell .
Many have not just protested against the president 's policies but have accused him of tyranny , and have promised to " reclaim America " .
" Those kind of things are not just casual outcomes of a sincere debate on whether we should have a national programme on healthcare , " Mr Carter said at a public meeting at his Carter Center in Atlanta held prior to the Congress vote on Tuesday .
" It 's deeper than that . "
Responding to a question specifically on Mr Wilson 's outburst , he said Mr Obama was the head of state as well as the head of government and - like heads of state elsewhere - he should be " treated with respect " .
It was a " dastardly thing to do " , he said .
His comments were rejected by Joe Wilson 's son , Alan , an Iraq veteran who is running for state attorney general in Georgia .
I guess we 'll probably have folks putting on white hoods and white uniforms again and riding through the countryside intimidating people
Rep. Henry Johnson ( Georgia )
Reaction : Obama ' racism ' row Send us your views " There is not a racist bone in my dad 's body , " he said .
Apology
In Tuesday 's vote , lawmakers voted 240- 179 in favour of the resolution to censure Mr Wilson .
The move was backed by most Democrats , but dismissed by many Republicans as a distraction from more serious issues .
" My goodness , we could be doing this every day of the week , " said Republican Minority Leader John Boehner .
But Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer insisted that Mr Wilson 's outburst could not be ignored .
" At issue is whether we are able to proceed with a degree of civility and decorum that our rules and our democracy contemplate and require , " he said .

Mr Wilson himself maintained that his personal apology to Mr Obama should have been enough to resolve the matter .
Mr Obama " graciously accepted my apology and the issue is over " , he said .
Mr Wilson 's remark came in response to a passage of Mr Obama 's speech in which he asserted that his reforms " would not apply to those who are here illegally " .
Under the terms of Mr Obama 's reform package , undocumented immigrants would not be able to claim healthcare subsidies , but they also would not be explicitly barred from buying private insurance through the new health insurance exchanges .

I mentioned in my previous post that I “ had come away with my head reeling from the massive length and depth of the often - changing specification ” , which is entirely true .
Printouts of the current draft of the HTML5 spec can reach , depending on your operating system and installed fonts , somewhere north of 900 pages .
Yes : nine hundred .
There are unabridged Stephen King novels that run shorter .
You might well say to yourself : “ Self , is it just me , or are the people doing this completely off their everlovin’ rockers ?
Because the specification for something as fundamentally simple as HTML should reach maybe 200 pages , max . ”
You might even despair that the entire enterprise is doomed to failure precisely because nobody sane will ever sit down to read that entire doorstop .
But there ’s no real reason to panic , because here ’s the thing about the HTML5 specification that might not be obvious right away : it ’s not for you .
It ’s for implementors .
And that ’s a good thing .
If you do start reading the HTML5 draft , you ’ll start running into really lengthy , excruciatingly detailed algorithms for , say , parsing a time component .
Or moving through the browser ’s history .
Or submitting a form .
There ’s an entire ( long ) chapter on how to process the HTML syntax .
Those are all good things , actually .
They greatly increase the chances of interoperability actually happening within our lifetimes .
There ’s no guessing about , well , much of anything .
It ’s all been exactingly defined , to the extent that one can exactingly define anything using a human language .
A browser team does n’t have to wonder , or even guess , what to do when the document has been completely parsed .
It ’s all spelled out .
And the people on those browser teams will , in the end , be the people who read that entire doorstop .
( Their sanity is another matter , and not discussed here . )
How is all that stuff relevant to you , the author ?
In the sense that when browser teams follow the spec , their products will be interoperable , which is to say consistent .
( Just imagine that for a moment . )
Beyond that , though , the detailed implementation stuff is n’t relevant to you .
You are not expected to know all those algorithms in order to write HTML documents .
Pretty much all you need to know is the markup .
That ’s the part that should be no more than 200 pages , yeah ?
Turns out it is , and by a comfortable margin . Michael ( tm ) Smith ’s HTML5 : The Markup Language is a version of the HTML5 draft with all of those eye - wateringly pedantic implementor sections stripped out , and when I generated a PDF it came in at 147 pages .
That ’s what you really need in order to get up to speed on what ’s in HTML5 .
It ’s for you .

Superconductors could be a rich source of electrons for quantum networks .
Electrons have proved much harder to entangle than photons .

Extracting entangled electrons from superconductors could help to create quantum - computing networks .
It might even put the theory of quantum mechanics through one of its toughest tests yet .
Hopes for building a working quantum computer hinge on physicists ' ability to intertwine electrons into pairs such that changes made to one instantly affect its partner — a process called entanglement .
Photons can be entangled relatively easily ; electrons are much harder .
This is a big problem if we ever want to integrate quantum computing with electronic chips , says Szabolcs Csonka at the University of Basel in Switzerland .
One place that entangled electrons can be found is in superconductors .
Usually they repel each other , but at the low temperatures seen in superconductors electrons pair up and move around as units .
" Entanglement is inherent in these pairs , " says team member Christian Schönenberger , also at the University of Basel .
But until now , physicists have struggled to extract the entangled electron pairs from the superconductor then split them apart , Schönenberger explains .
The team set up an aluminium superconductor and built an escape route for the electrons using nanowires .
Ironically , the key to extracting the electrons is to make it almost impossible for them to cross these wires by applying a high voltage that acts as a barrier , says Schönenberger .
The laws of quantum mechanics allow pairs of electrons to ' tunnel ' through the barrier only very occasionally — helping the team to isolate and control the pairs as they slowly break out .
“ This is the first time anyone 's demonstrated that a stream of entangled electrons can be created on tap . ”
Dan Browne
University College London
Once a pair has reached the other side of the barrier and is out of the superconductor , the electrons ' natural repulsion kicks in and the pair splits apart , says Schönenberger .
The nanowire path beyond the superconductor is configured into a junction and the team ensures that the electrons take separate directions when they meet this fork by placing a ' gate ' built from a nanocrystal , called a quantum dot , at the head of each path .
The quantum dots can be tuned by changing the voltage across them , so that they each attract one electron then spit it out to continue its journey .
" The quantum dots act like turnstiles , letting through only one electron at a time , " says team member Lukas Hofstetter .
The team has succeeded in producing a stream of entangled electron pairs and splitting them in this manner .
The research is published in Nature1 .
Quantum question
Dan Browne , a quantum physicist at University College London says that the technique has important implications for quantum computing .
" For many years it did n't look like we would see many advances for quantum information processing in solid - state [ electronic ] systems , " he says .
" This is the first time anyone 's demonstrated that a stream of entangled electrons can be created on tap . "
Brendon Lovett , an expert on quantum computing at the University of Oxford , UK , believes that the work could help physicists to build a quantum - computing network .
Lovett and his colleagues have shown that quantum information can be transferred from an electron 's spin to the spin of an atomic nucleus , where it can be stored more effectively — creating a form of ' quantum memory '2 .
" Picture a network with a number of small processors at each node made of an atomic nucleus interacting with two or three electrons , " says Lovett .
The team 's new method would provide a clever way to communicate information across the network , by sending entangled electrons between nodes , he explains .
" This might be one way to scale - up quantum computers . "
Entangled electrons might also help to answer a bigger question that is often taken for granted :
Does entanglement really exist ?
ADVERTISEMENT
Most physicists now accept that it does and that members of entangled pairs can communicate with each other instantaneously — a feature that famously made Einstein bristle .
But not everybody agrees and some physicists challenge whether our conventional understanding of quantum mechanics is correct ( see ' Written in the skies : why quantum mechanics might be wrong ' ) .
Technically , entanglement has not been proved , says Browne .
" There are still a couple of loopholes that need to be closed , " he says .
One of these loopholes involves whether or not entangled entities display the correlations expected ; the results are slightly ambiguous in photon tests , says Browne .
" You need very high - quality entanglement and very high efficiency in your measuring devices to know with certainty that the effects you are seeing are n't an artefact of the measuring instrument , " he says .
Repeating entanglement experiments with a combination of entangled photons and electrons might remove the last shades of ambiguity , says Browne .
" We actually do n't have highly efficient light detectors , but electron detectors could be better . "
Demonstrators have protested in Rome against Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's influence over the media .
Organisers claim 300,000 people took part in the rally in the city 's central Piazza del Popolo .
City officials say 60,000 people were at the protest , while agency journalists put the figure at more than 100,000 .
Some protesters wore t- shirts with the writing " now you can sue me too " , and a group of musicians played with gags over their mouths .
They were references to Mr Berlusconi issuing writs against two left - leaning newspapers for their coverage of a sex scandal that has engulfed him since May .
The scandal involves prostitutes who were allegedly invited to his residence in Rome .
Mr Berlusconi dismisses the allegation as gossip , and says he is the victim of a smear campaign .

Even if you ’ve never read a single page of manga before , the chances are you ’re familiar with Osamu Tezuka – and if the name is n’t familiar , then it ’s likely that his most famous creation Astro Boy , is .
Even though she ’s never , to my knowledge , read a page of the manga herself , my girlfriend ’s most prized purchases during last year ’s Tokyo shopping exhibitions where the t-shirts featuring the iconic robo -Pinocchio she picked up in Harajuku .
But Tezuka – often referred to as the ‘ God of Manga ’ and the ‘ Father of Anime ’ – had an impact beyond his cute character designs and children ’s adventure stories , with even Astro Boy at times exploring the darker sides and moral ambiguities of human nature , and perhaps his strongest vehicle for this being the character Black Jack .
Written in the 1970s and 80s , the Black Jack stories deal with an enigmatic but mercenary , unlicensed surgeon for hire .
Drawing on his own experience training ( though never practicing ) as a physician , Tezuka combines what appears to be often sound medical details with Jack ’s almost super - human surgical skills to create Japan ’s most iconic anti-hero .
However , it is not Black Jack ’s amazing feats of medical prowess that are the stories ’ real focus , but more his complex , often self - contradicting , moral standpoints and choices .
I ’d first dipped into Black Jack years ago , so I was thrilled when US publisher Vertical sent me a copy of their fifth volume of their complete re-issue of the decade spanning series for review .
Fears that entering the series at Volume 5 would leave me lost quickly disappeared on being reminded of the series ’ format ; these are short , 20 or so page stand - alone tales rather than an ongoing serial , and while there are re-occurring characters and themes it is easily picked up at any point , without any real prior introduction .
They follow a fairly standard formula : Jack is hired to tend to a patient that , for whatever reason , requires aid that cannot be found within the normal , legal medical channels .
For example , in “ Yet False the Days ” Jack is approached by a paralysed pop idol ’s greedy management to perform plastic surgery on a girl to make her look like the famous star .
But as with all the stories there is a twist in the tale , and even when Jack insists instead on curing the idol so she can perform again and the surgery is a near - miraculous success , the end result is ultimately tragedy .
Elsewhere Tezuka takes aim at the medical establishment , portraying other surgeons and hospital administrators as bloated , self important buffoons – and this combined with Jack ’s own , often mercenary , attitude seems to throw some light on the author ’s own views of the world of medicine .
Clearly fascinated by the science of surgery , Tezuka seems just as intrigued with the feelings of power and control that wielding this knowledge brings , and here he explores both sides in detail , perhaps also throwing some light on to why he never practiced medicine himself .
While it is hard to deny the concise efficiency of Tezuka ’s storytelling , outside Japan some younger critic ’s have taken issue with the style of his drawing .
Clearly influenced by US artists such as Walt Disney and Grim Natwick , even though his work helped to craft what has become accepted as the modern style , it does at times seem removed from what we now instantly identify as manga .
However , to criticise him , as others have , for being ‘ old - fashioned ’ , ‘ too American ’ or ‘ not - Japanese enough ’ looking seems not only ridiculous to me , but blatantly inaccurate .
Just flicking through the book reveals not only Tezuka ’s detailed , graphic depictions of surgery , but also character designs that could be nothing else but Japanese in their origin , with visual elements and archetypes that can still be seen in every newly published manga today .
Yes , Tezuka ’s style may be different from today ’s artists , but to dismiss or dislike it for just these reasons seems both infantile and narrow - minded , and a sad reflection on the tastes and mindsets of the contemporary manga fan that seems to value conformity and the familiar over variety and being challenged .
It ’s perhaps worth pointing out to these self - proclaimed foreign ‘ otaku ’ that back in Japan these distinctions are made far less often , and that widening your tastes beyond what you perceive and pigeonhole as ‘ the manga style ’ may open up some new , rewarding experiences .
But anyway – before I descend into frustrated ranting : this book is an excellent package .
Vertical have done yet another fantastic job with the presentation , the quality of the print is excellent , and of particular note is the unique and stylish front cover .
The book even includes a 12 - page sample excerpt from Tezuka ’s Dororo – seen as many as being the predecessor of Black Jack .
As mentioned previously the short , episodic , stand - alone nature of the stories within make the book accessible to any reader – whether they are new to Black Jack , Tezuka or even manga itself , and based on this volume I would n’t hesitate in recommending grabbing any of the Vertical Black Jack editions you come across .
An essential read .
Dale Neumann says he and his wife continue to trust in God A US couple who prayed rather than seeking medical attention for their dying daughter have been sentenced to six months in jail .
Dale and Leilani Neumann , of Wisconsin , could have received up to 25 years in prison over the 2008 death of Madeline Neumann , who was known as Kara .
The 11 - year - old died of an undiagnosed but treatable form of diabetes .
Judge Vincent Howard ordered the couple to serve one month in jail each year for the next six years .
God probably works through other people , some of them doctors
Judge Vincent Howard
One parent will serve the term in March and the other in September .
The judge told the Neumanns this would give them time to " think about Kara and what God wants you to learn from this " .
He added that they were " very good people , raising their family , who made a bad decision , a reckless decision " .
He added : " God probably works through other people , some of them doctors . "
In addition to the custodial sentence , the Neumanns were also put on 10 years ' probation , as part of which they must allow a nurse to examine their two youngest surviving children at least once every three months , and must immediately take their children to a doctor in case of any serious injuries .
' Legal duty '
Prosecutors said the couple had recklessly killed the youngest of their four children by ignoring clear symptoms of severe illness as she became too weak to speak , eat , drink or walk .

They said the couple had a legal duty to take their daughter to a doctor but had instead relied totally on prayer for healing .
Kara died on the floor of the family 's rural home as people surrounded her and prayed .
The emergency services were only called after she stopped breathing .
In their defence , the parents said they believed healing came from God , and that they had not expected their daughter to die as they prayed for her .
Jay Kronenwetter , Mr Neumann 's lawyer , was asked in a BBC interview if he thought his client had got off lightly .
" My client sees spiritual treatment as the proper medicine and I suspect the people who want harsher punishment see Western medicine as the proper medicine , I guess therein lies the difference , " he told the BBC World Service .
" My clients just happen to have a belief that is very outside of our social norm . "
The couple are appealing against their convictions .

It ’s time for a random dose of statistics courtesy of The Internet Movie Database .
Let ’s consider all movies that have been released theatrically over the last 60 years and see whether there is a trend in their perceived quality over time .
That is , do new movies generally receive higher or lower scores on IMDb than old movies ?
Before looking at the numbers though , we need some rules to clarify what types of movies we are considering :
We only consider theatrically - released films — no straight - to - video movies or TV movies .
Short films that were released theatrically ( such as Pixar ’s Presto ) are included .
We only consider movies that have received 1000 or more votes .
This restriction is to prevent movies with only a handful of votes from skewing the results too much .
The theatrical release date of the movie must have been at least as recent at 1950 .
IMDb contains 10034 movies that satisfy the above criteria .
The average score ( on a scale of 1 to 10 ) of those movies is 6.38 and the median score is 6.6 .
The average score per release year is given by the following graph :
As you can see , older movies ( 1950 – 1975 ) have abnormally high scores , as do very recent movies ( 2000 – 2009 ) .
These differences are indeed statistically significant .
For example , the p-value associated with the test that the mean score in 1950 is the same as the mean score in 1989 is less than 10 - 19 .
The p-value associated with the test that the mean score in 2008 is the same as the mean score in 1989 is about 0.0021 .
Other nearby years give similar p-values .
So this tells us that , in general , particularly old movies receive the highest scores , followed by newly - released movies , followed by “ semi-old ” movies from the 1980 ’s and 1990’s .
So why the differences ?
Were movies from the 1980 ’s really just that bad ?
Possibly , but the more likely explanation is that movies from the 1950 ’s through 1970 ’s have artificially higher scores because people do n’t generally go back and watch the crummy movies of the last generation , so they get forgotten and do not have 1000 votes on IMDb .
Will people be watching Disaster Movie in forty years ?
I sure hope not .
On the other hand , particularly recent movies tend to draw a fair amount of hype and fanboyism .
Remember when The Dark Knight had a score of 9.8 and was at # 1 on the IMDb top 250 ?
Now , one year later , it has a score of 8.9 and is located at # 9 on the top 250 .
It will likely dwindle a little further down over the coming years as well .
The Best and Worst of Each Year
While we ’re looking at ratings of movies over the years , I suppose I might as well provide a list of the best and worst movie of each year ( based on the votes of IMDb users ) , since such a list is not available on the IMDb website itself to my knowledge .
Keep in mind that , as before , only movies with 1000 or more votes are considered .
Enjoy !

Accident Lawyers :
The word accident is not a technical legal term with a clearly defined meaning .
Speaking generally , but with reference to legal liabilities , an accident means any unintended and unexpected occurrence which produces hurt or loss .
But it is often used to denote any unintended and unexpected loss or hurt apart from its cause ; and if the cause is not known the loss or hurt itself would certainly be called an accident .
The word accident is also often used to denote both the cause and the effect , no attempt being made to discriminate between them .
Drug Charges Lawyers : Certain illicit drugs , such as cocaine and methamphetamine , are restricted at both the federal and state level .
This includes the manufacturing , cultivation , trafficking , distribution and possession of these substances .
Conviction on drug charges often carries stiff sentences , including prison time , but sometimes prosecutors will offer plea deals to lower - level offenders in exchange for help with a larger case .
Some states have enacted medical marijuana laws , allowing physicians to recommend the drug for certain illnesses while exempting qualified patients from criminal prosecution on marijuana - related drug charges .
Other states have legalized marijuana for recreational use .
The following articles pertain to drug charges and their respective sentences upon conviction .
As with any criminal charge , the assistance of an experienced criminal defense lawyer is indispensable if you 're facing drug charges .
Besides the criminal penalties involved , a conviction can lead to many negative consequences , such as difficulties in obtaining employment .
A qualified criminal defense attorney in your area can provide you much needed legal advice and representation in a court of law .

Remember the LCROSS project , the one in which NASA plans to fire a huge exploding rocket into the moon ?
The goal is to eject debris from the surface of one of moon 's craters and discovering whether there 's frozen water there .
Well , the time to sit back , relax , grab some popcorn and watch the mission as it unfolds is drawing near .
Early tomorrow , on October 9 , 6:15 a.m. EDT /3:15 a.m. PDT , NASA will start a live TV broadcast that will include live footage from the spacecraft camera , real - time telemetry based animation , expert commentary , and possibly some live footage from the 88 - inch telescope located on Mauna Kea , Hawaii .
You can also follow the mission on Twitter and on Facebook , as well as read the latest info on the official blog .
NASA claims the final stage of the mission will be " spectacular " , so we 'll set our expectations to " crazy high " .
This approach may work for children over the age of 5 or so .
But babies and very young children are terrible at planning and aiming for precise goals .
When we say that preschoolers can’t pay attention , we really mean that they ca n’t not pay attention : they have trouble focusing on just one event and shutting out all the rest .
This has led us to underestimate babies in the past .
But the new research tells us that babies can be rational without being goal - oriented .
Babies are captivated by the most unexpected events .
Adults , on the other hand , focus on the outcomes that are the most relevant to their goals .
In a well - known experiment , adults saw a video of several people tossing a ball to one another .
The experimenter told them to count how many passes particular people made .
In the midst of this , a person in a gorilla suit walked slowly through the middle of the video .
A surprising number of adults , intent on counting , did n’t even seem to notice the unexpected gorilla .
Adults focus on objects that will be most useful to them .
But as the lever study demonstrated , children play with the objects that will teach them the most .
In our study , 4 - year - olds imagined new possibilities based on just a little data .
Adults rely more on what they already know .
Babies are n’t trying to learn one particular skill or set of facts ; instead , they are drawn to anything new , unexpected or informative .
Part of the explanation for these differing approaches can be found in the brain .
The young brain is remarkably plastic and flexible .
Brains work because neurons are connected to one another , allowing them to communicate .
Baby brains have many more neural connections than adult brains .
But they are much less efficient .
Over time , we prune away the connections we do n’t use , and the remaining ones become faster and more automatic .
Moreover , the prefrontal cortex , the part of the brain that controls the directed , planned , focused kind of intelligence , is exceptionally late to mature , and may not take its final shape until our early 20s .
In fact , our mature brain seems to be programmed by our childhood experiences  we plan based on what we ’ve learned as children .
Very young children imagine and explore a vast array of possibilities .
As they grow older and absorb more evidence , certain possibilities become much more likely and more useful .
They then make decisions based on this selective information and become increasingly reluctant to give those ideas up and try something new .
Computer scientists talk about the difference between exploring and exploiting  a system will learn more if it explores many possibilities , but it will be more effective if it simply acts on the most likely one .
Babies explore ; adults exploit .
Each kind of intelligence has benefits and drawbacks .
Focus and planning get you to your goal more quickly but may also lock in what you already know , closing you off to alternative possibilities .
We need both blue - sky speculation and hard - nosed planning .
Babies and young children are designed to explore , and they should be encouraged to do so .
Say what you will about President Obama ’s receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize , but the last person on earth suited to criticize Obama vis-à - vis peace is John Bolton , the least diplomatic diplomat in American history .
On FOX News , Bolton said the Nobel is a political tool that " high minded Europeans " only give to the " right kind " of Americans — who Bolton and his neoconservative buddies are decidedly not ( one could hear Bolton ’s little nose pores bleeding ) .
Bolton was , and continues to be , a national embarrassment .
Even Dick Cheney , who ruled the Republican - controlled Senate of the Bush era with a chain whip , could n’t get Bolton confirmed as Ambassador to the United Nations .
Bolton made his bones with the Bush / Cheney mafia when he blared , " I ’m here to stop the count " in Florida during the 2000 election .
What a kinder , gentler world we would live in now if humanity learned to flick off the John Boltons of this world like sleeve lint .
Like many Americans , I have issues with the current president who I helped vote into office .
I wish he had flushed his long - war Pentagon team — Gates , Petraeus , Mullen , and Odierno — from the outset .
I wish Obama were less reticent to take a cheese - grater to his critics ’ faces , but he proved he could do that in his health care speech to Congress .
That event showed that Obama has a penchant for strategy and tactics that Sun Tzu would approve .
Obama allowed his health care opponents to blow wind and crack cheeks all summer , letting them reach their culmination point before counter - attacking .
I hope that ’s what he ’s up to with the Afghanistan pile of day - old horse lunch .
Gen . Stanley McChrystal and the war mafia have made an all - fronts media assault on him , trying to force him into escalating a war in a country that barely qualifies as a nation - state .
Obama has allowed what amounts to a military insurrection to take place and has kept his cool .
He ’s also managed to ward off the war - centric jackanapes in Congress : John McCain , Ike Shelton , Mitch McConnell , John Boehner , Lindsey Graham , Joe Lieberman and the rest of those yahoos who insist that he needs to give McChrystal what he wants now , now , now .
They remind one of the crowd who hung out in Floyd ’s Barber Shop in Mayberry .
Howard Sprague : I ’m thinking we need to put more troops in Afghanistan .
Goober Pyle :
That ’s what I think too , if you can call what I think " thinking . "
Gomer Pyle : Shazam !
Floyd :
That ’s what General McChrystal wants , from what I see on the television , so I think we should give it to him .
What do you say , Andy ?
Andy Taylor : I think everybody needs to calm down and think a minute .
Opie Taylor : Gee , Pa , Emmitt the handyman says if we do n’t fight them over there , we ’ll be fighting them over here .
Andy :
Well , son , that ’s a mighty long way for them to swim and it ’s an even longer way to jump .
Opie :
Okay then , Pa , I ’m going back outside to play baseball with the other kids .
Andy :
Do n’t break any windows , son .
Obama needs to shed himself of the foreign policy stooges he inherited .
They ’re baggage loaded with clothes that did n’t fit when we bought them , and the only thing they offer to our society is a propaganda organization designed to convince us that our existence depends on them blowing the third world to smithereens bit by bit .
Obama ca n’t can all the war stooges in a fell stroke , of course .
Our politicians and generals all got where they are by learning how to trim their sails .
It will take some time for Obama to unfurl the militaristic mess he walked into .
Here ’s hoping he does n’t lose interest in the project .
Here ’s praying he does n’t turn into Barney Fife on us .
A WHILE AGO , I heard an American scientist address an audience in Oxford , England , about his work on the climate crisis .
He was precise , unemotional , rigorous , and impersonal : all strengths of a scientist .
The next day , talking informally to a small group , he pulled out of his wallet a much - loved photo of his thirteen - year - old son .
He spoke as carefully as he had before , but this time his voice was sad , worried , and fatherly .
His son , he said , had become so frightened about climate change that he was debilitated , depressed , and disturbed .
Some might have suggested therapy , Prozac , or baseball for the child .
But in this group one voice said gently , “ What about the Transition Initiative ? ”
If the Transition Initiative were a person , you ’d say he or she was charismatic , wise , practical , positive , resourceful , and very , very popular .
Starting with the town of Totnes in Devon , England , in September 2006 , the movement has spread like wildfire across the U.K. ( delightfully wriggling its way into The Archers , Britain ’s longest - running and most popular radio soap opera ) , and on to the U.S. , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , and Japan .
The core purpose of the Transition Initiative is to address , at the community level , the twin issues of climate change and peak oil — the declining availability of “ ancient sunlight , ” as fossil fuels have been called .
The initiative is set up to enable towns or neighborhoods to plan for , and move toward , a post-oil and low - carbon future : what Rob Hopkins , founder of the Transition Initiative , has termed “ the great transition of our time , away from fossil fuels . ”
Part of the genius of the movement rests in its acute and kind psychology .
It acknowledges the emotional effect of these issues , from that thirteen - year - old ’s sense of fear and despair , to common feelings of anger , impotence , and denial , and it uses insights from the psychology of addiction to address some reasons why it is hard for people to detoxify themselves from an addiction to ( or dependence on ) oil .
It acknowledges that healthy psychological functioning depends on a belief that one ’s needs will be met in the future ; for an entire generation , that belief is now corroded by anxiety over climate change .
Many people feel that individual action on climate change is too trivial to be effective but that they are unable to influence anything at a national , governmental level .
They find themselves paralyzed between the apparent futility of the small - scale and impotence in the large - scale .
The Transition Initiative works right in the middle , at the scale of the community , where actions are significant , visible , and effective .
“ What it takes is a scale at which one can feel a degree of control over the processes of life , at which individuals become neighbors and lovers instead of just acquaintances and ciphers .
. . participants and protagonists instead of just voters and taxpayers .
That scale is the human scale , ” wrote author and secessionist Kirkpatrick Sale in his 1980 book , Human Scale .
How big am I ?
As an individual , five foot two and whistling .
At a government level , I find I ’ve shrunk , smaller than the X on my ballot paper .
But at a community level , I can breathe in five river - sources and breathe out three miles of green valleys .
Scale matters .
We speak of economies of scale , and I would suggest that there are also moralities of scale .
At the individual scale , morality is capricious : people can be heroes or mass murderers , but the individual is usually constrained by inner conscience and always constrained by size .
While a nation - state can at best offer a meager welfare system , at worst — as the history of nations in the twentieth century showed so brutally — morality need not be constrained by any conscience , and through its enormity a state can engineer a genocide .
At the community level , though , morality is complex : certainly communities can be jealous and spiteful and less given to heroism than an individual , yet a community ’s power to harm is far less than that of a state , simply because of its size .
Further , because there are more niche reasons for people to identify with their community , and simply because there is a greater per-capita responsibility , a community is more susceptible to a sense of shame .
Community morality involves a sense of fellow - feeling , is attuned to the common good , far steadier than individual morality , far kinder than the State : its moral range reaches neither heaven nor hell but is grounded , well - rooted in the level of Earth .
STARTING WITH a steering group of just a handful of people in one locality , the motivation to become a Transition community spreads , often through many months of preparation , information - giving , and awareness - raising of the issues of climate change and peak oil .
In those months , there are talks and film screenings , and a deliberate attempt to encourage a sense of a community ’s resilience in the face of stresses .
When members of the steering group judge that there is enough support and momentum for the project , it is launched , or “ unleashed . ”
Keeping an eye on the prize ( reducing carbon emissions and oil dependence ) , Transition communities have then looked at their own situation in various practical frames — for example , food production , energy use , building , waste , and transport — seeking to move toward a situation where a community could be self - reliant .
At this stage , the steering group steps back , and various subgroups can form around specific aspects of transitioning .
Strategies have included the promotion of local food production , planting fruit trees in public spaces , community gardening , and community composting .
In terms of energy use , some communities have begun “ oil vulnerability auditing ” for local businesses , and some have sought to re-plan local transport for “ life beyond the car . ”
In one Transition Town there are plans to make local , renewable energy a resource owned by the community , in another there are plans to bulk - buy solar panels as a cooperative and sell them locally without profit .
There are projects of seed saving , seed swapping , and creating allotments — small parcels of land on which individuals can grow fruit and vegetables .
“ The people who see the value of changing the system are ordinary people , doing it for their children , ” says Naresh Giangrande , who was involved in setting up the first Transition Town .
“ The political process is corrupted by money , power , and vested interests .
I ’m not writing off large corporations and government , but because they have such an investment in this system , they have n’t got an incentive to change .
I can only see us getting sustainable societies from the grassroots , bottom - up , and only that way can we get governments to change . ”
In the States , the “ 350 ” project ( the international effort to underscore the need to decrease atmospheric carbon dioxide to 350 parts per million ) is similarly asking ordinary people to signal to those in power .
If change does n’t come from above , it must come from below , and politicians would be unwise to ignore the concern about peak oil and climate change coming from the grassroots .
The grassroots .
Both metaphorically and literally .
Transition Initiative founder Rob Hopkins used to be a permaculture teacher , and permaculture ’s influence is wide and deep .
As permaculture works with , rather than against , nature , so the Transition Initiative works with , rather than against , human nature ; it is as collaborative and cooperative in social tone as permaculture is in its attitude toward plants and , like permaculture , is prepared to observe and think , slowly .
One of the subgroups that Transition communities typically use is called “ Heart and Soul , ” which focuses on the psychological and emotional aspects of climate crisis , of change , of community .
Importantly , people are encouraged to be participants in the conversation , not just passive spectators : it is a nurturant process , involving anyone who wants to be a part .
Good conversation involves quality listening , for an open - minded , attentive listener can elicit the best thoughts of a speaker .
Giangrande says that the Transition Initiative — which has used keynote speakers — is also exploring the idea of keynote listeners as “ a collaborative way of learning how to use knowledge . ”
When I asked exactly what that would involve , he could n’t be specific , because it was still only an idea , which is revealing of the Transition process , very much a work - in - progress .
The fact that they were trying out an idea without being able to predict the results has a vitality to it , an intellectually energetic quality , a profound liveliness .
The Transition Initiative describes itself as a catalyst , with no fixed answers , unlike traditional environmentalism , which is more prescriptive , advocating certain responses .
Again unlike conventional environmentalism , it emphasizes the role of hope and proactiveness , rather than guilt and fear as motivators .
Whether intentionally or not , environmentalism can seem exclusive , and the Transition Initiative is whole - heartedly inclusive .
While in many ways the Transition Initiative is new , it often finds its roots in the past , in a practical make - do - and - mend attitude .
There is an interesting emphasis on “ re-skilling ” communities in traditional building and organic gardening , for example : crafts that were taken for granted two generations ago but are now often forgotten .
Mandy Dean , who helped set up a Transition Initiative in her community in Wales , describes how her group bought root stocks of fruit trees and then organized grafting workshops ; it was practical , but also “ it was about weaving some ideas back into culture . ”
In the British context , the memory of World War II is crucial , for during the war people experienced long fuel shortages and needed to increase local food production — digging for victory .
In both the U.K. and the U.S. , the shadow of the Depression years now looms uncomfortably close , encouraging an attitude of mending rather than buying new ; tending one ’s own garden ; restoring the old .
To mend , to tend , and to restore all expand beautifully from textiles , vegetables , and furniture into those most quiet of qualities ; to restore is restorative , to tend involves tenderness , to mend hints at amends .
There is restitution here of community itself .
FOR ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY , people have engaged with the world through some form of community , and this is part of our social evolution .
Somewhere deep inside us all is an archived treasure , the knowledge of what it is to be part of a community via extended families , locality , village , a shared fidelity to common land , unions , faith communities , language communities , co-operatives , gay communities , even virtual communities , which , for all their unreality , still reflect a yearning for a wider home for the collective soul .
The nineteenth - century artist William Morris spoke of the gentle social - ism that he called fellowship : “ Fellowship is life , and lack of fellowship is death . ”
People never need communities more than when there are threats to security , food , and lives .
The Transition Initiative recognizes how much we need this scale now , because of peak oil and climate change .
But beyond this concrete need , the lack of a sense of community has negative psychological impacts on individuals across the “ developed ” world , as people report persistent and widespread feelings of loneliness , isolation , dispossession , alienation , and depression .
Beyond a certain threshold , increased income does not create increased happiness , and the false promise of consumerism ( buy this : be happy ) sets the individual on a quest for a constantly receding goal of their own private fulfillment , while sober evidence repeatedly suggests that happiness is more surely found in contributing toward a community endeavor .
( The Buddha smiles a tired , patient smile : “ I ’ve been telling you that for years . ” )
Community endeavor increases “ social capital , ” that captivating idea expressing the value of local relationships , networks , help , and friendships .
A rise in social capital could be the positive concomitant of a fall in financial capital that a low - carbon future may entail .
Many people today experience a strange hollow in the psyche , a hole the size of a village .
Mandy Dean alludes to this when she explains why she was drawn to the Transition Initiative : “ One of the awful things about modern culture is separation and isolation ; we ’ve broken down almost every social bond , so the one bond left is between parent and child .
In this extreme isolation , we do n’t interact except with the television and the computer .
We ’ve lost something , and we do n’t know what it is , and we try to fill it with food and alcohol and shopping but it ’s never filled — what we ’ve lost is our connection to our community , our place , and nature .
Stepping back away from that isolation is very healing for people ; getting people into groups where they can do things together starts to reverse that isolation . ”
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS , nation - states have attacked communities .
Earliest and most emblematic were the enclosures : when governments passed laws to privatize common land , the spirit of collectivity was undermined as surely as the site of it .
The vicious system of reservations for Native Americans robbed people of communities of land and stole from them the communal autonomy central to their cultural survival .
Indigenous people all over the world have found their language communities assaulted , fracturing even their ability to speak .
From the monster - enclosures of colonialism to the subtle but strangulating enclosures of Time , through which people ceased to “ own ” their own time , instead being corralled into the factory - time of industrial capitalism , the idea and the actuality of community has been eroded in countless ways .
“ There is no such thing as society ” — the most sociopathic lie ever uttered by a British prime minister — was Thatcher ’s summing up as she and Reagan broke the unions , and for decades agribusiness has destroyed the lives and dignity of campesinos in South America , while neoliberalism has wreaked havoc on communities across the world .
And there are seemingly trivial examples that nonetheless are cumulatively important ; in contemporary Britain the mass closures of pubs tear the fabric that knits communities together .
The colonial powers practiced the policy of “ divide and rule , ” usually dividing one community from another , but in contemporary society there is a more insidious policy of “ atomize and rule . ”
The world of mass media fragments real societies into solitary individuals , passive recipients of information , consuming the faked - up society that television , in particular , provides , and one result of this is that the public , political injustices that communities have habitually analyzed and acted upon ( food - poverty , housing - poverty , fuel - poverty , or time - poverty ) have been rendered as merely an individual ’s private problems .
It ’s interesting ( and not a little sad ) that although the French Revolution announced that it stood for three things , only two of these ( Liberty and Equality ) have survived in political parlance while the third , Fraternity , has been made to sound both quaint and unnecessary .
For decades , the voice of the State has declared that community solidarity is occasionally dangerous ( unions are “ too powerful and need to be destroyed ” ) or , like fraternity , rather parochial .
What , though , could be more parochial than the voice of the mass media ?
Rejecting the rainbow of pluralism ( the magnificent myriad Other upon Other upon Other , the Pan- Otherness by which all communities are Other to someone ) , the mass media broadcasts itself in mono .
Narrow .
Singular .
Very , very parochial in its tight and exclusive remit .
In the long fetch of the wave , the Transition Initiative should be seen as a new formulation of a very old idea .
We are ineluctably and gloriously social animals .
We want fellowship .
We flock , we gather , we chirp , we howl , we sing , we call , and we listen .
If the Transition Initiative is empowering for communities , that is because there is an enormous latent energy there to be tapped , so that communities may be authors of their own story , hopeful , active , and belonging , rather than despairing , passive , and cynical .
Naresh Giangrande , in Totnes , tells me about a session they are designing on the theme of Belonging .
Belonging , of course , is a lovely boomerang of an idea — where do you belong ?
Can that place belong to you ?
“ Through the Transition Initiative , ” says Giangrande , “ we can talk about things in public which are normally only talked about privately .
We all have a deep wound about belonging to the Earth . ”
The Transition Initiative , says Giangrande , is “ a movement that could be world - changing .
And it is heartwarming to see how good - natured and good most people are — it revives my sense of community .
It completely contradicts the image of human nature in the media , portraying it as greedy and selfish , competitive , nasty , and unsocial .
That ’s a self - reinforcing prophecy .
We ’re setting up the reverse .
And we ’re asking : will you join us ? ”
People have flocked to do so .
At the time of this writing , there are 146 Transition Initiatives , and by the time you read this there will be far more .
One of its techniques is in strengthening all that is associative , and attempting to democratize power , with a fine understanding of that particular social grace which seeks to create what Martin Buber called The Between .
What is it , The Between ?
Fertile , delicious , and powerful , it is the edge of meeting .
The cocreated place of pure potential , a coevocation of possibility .
The delicate point of meeting between you and him .
Between them .
Between us .
What is the geometry of The Between ?
I could explain best if we went down to the pub , you and I ( mine ’s a glass of red wine , anything as long as it ’s not Merlot , yeuch , that ’s like drinking cold steel ) , and the geometry of The Between is as simple and direct as the line of our eyes across the table .
It ’s horizontal , equal , fraternal .
We might have a chat with a couple of the old farmers , and my pal the vicar might be there with his guitar and best of all is when the harpist plays , which he does , very occasionally .
Warm with conviviality and wine , I might wander home and switch on the television ( except for the fact that I gave it away some years ago ) , and Sky News would be showing me a parade of celebrities , each making me feel that little bit more insignificant .
Celebrity culture is an opposite of community , informing us that these few nonsense - heads matter but that the rest of us do not .
Insidiously , the television tells me I am no one .
If I was Someone , I ’d be on telly .
In this way , television dis-esteems its viewers , and celebrity culture is both a cause and a consequence of the low self - esteem that mars so many people ’s lives .
So , the unacknowledged individual is manipulated into a jealousy of acknowledgment , which is why it is so telling that huge numbers of young people insist that when they grow up they want to be a celebrity .
They are quite right .
( Almost . )
That is nothing less than they deserve , for we all need acknowledgment ( but not fame ) .
We all need recognition ( but not to be “ spotted ” out shopping ) .
We all need to be known , we need our selves confirmed by others , fluidly , naturally .
A sense of community has always provided these familiar , unshowy acts of ordinary recognition , and the Transition Initiative , like any wise community , offers simple acknowledgment , telling us we are all players .
“ MISTAKEN , APPALLING , AND DANGEROUS ” is how the Transition Initiative has been described , which is the kind of criticism you covet , knowing that the speaker is an oil industry professional and author of The Myth of the Oil Crisis .
Others have criticized it for being insufficiently confrontational .
There are also criticisms from within : a tension between those who prefer fast action and those who prefer slow consideration , for the movement is both urgent and slow .
It is transformatively sudden , and yet uses the subtle , tentative questioning of long dialogues within communities , a very slow process of building a network of relationships within the whole community .
In the language of climate change science , there are many tipping points , where slow causations are suddenly expressed in dramatic , negative consequences .
The conference I attended when I met the scientist speaking of his unhappy son was called Tipping Point , and in a sense the Transition Initiative places itself as a social tipping point , with dramatic and positive consequences where the sudden wisdom of communities breaks through the stolid unwisdom of national government .
“ We ’re doing work for generations to come , ” says Giangrande .
You ca n’t change a place overnight , he says , but you have to begin now in the necessary urgency of our time .
“ We ’re facing a historical moment of choice — our actions now [ are ] affecting the future .
Now ’s the time .
The system we know is breaking down .
Yet out of this breakdown , there are always new possibilities . ”
It ’s catagenesis , the birth of the new from the death of the old .
The process is “ so creative and so chaotic , ” says Giangrande .
“ Let it unfold — allow it — the key is not to direct it but to encourage it .
We ’ve developed the A to C of transition .
The D to Z is still to come . ”
Brave , this , and very attractive .
It is catalytic , emergent , and dynamic , facing forward with a vivid vitality but backlit with another kind of ancient sunlight : human , social energy .
Attorney General orders secretive paramilitary group to turn over all its records

Friday , October 2 , 2009
The plans of American Police Force to boss the $ 27 million dollar detention center in Hardin Montana as well as expand their presence across the country while training foreign troops inside the U.S. could be mothballed after Montana ’s Attorney General launched an investigation and demanded the organization turn over all its records .
Suspicions that the paramilitary unit , which attempted to pose as law enforcement in Hardin last week by placing decals on SUV’s that read “ Hardin Police Department , ” is a cut - out or a front group for a larger company , may be realized after AG Steve Bullock ordered Hardin city officials to turn over all their documents related to their dealings with APF by October 12 .
“ His office made a similar demand of American Police Force , including information that would back up ( Michael ) Hilton ’s claims of multiple defense contracts with the U.S. government and other agencies , ” reports the Associated Press .
As we have highlighted , APF grandstands as a major player in the world of international private security , even claiming on its own website that it runs the U.S. Training Center , a Blackwater or “ Xe ” owned facility .
This has led many to claim that the company is a shell or a front organization for something far more sinister , rumors that have only grown with APF ’s blanket refusal to name its parent company .
The investigation was prompted by the revelation yesterday that APF founder “ Captain ” Michael Hilton is a career criminal and a convicted fraudster who has operated under no less than 17 different aliases .
Hilton , a native of Montenegro , was sentenced to 6 years in jail in 1993 for “ Such schemes you cannot believe , ” according to Joseph Carella , an Orange County , Calif .
doctor , namely a dozen counts of grand theft .
Hilton has defrauded numerous different individuals to the tune of $ 1.1 million dollars over the past 20 years .

APF ’s plans to construct another facility in Hardin that will train international paramilitary forces also looks doomed following intense media scrutiny of the organization ’s shady dealings with local authorities and their probable violation of article 2 section 33 of the Montana Constitution .
Judging by the reaction of Attorney Becky Convery , who negotiated the original deal between Hardin authorities and APF , the contract to man the detention center and build the training facility could be torpedoed .
“ Convery said Two Rivers director Greg Smith had a tentative deal with Hilton ’s company to provide law enforcement service , but she said it was never finalized and she was uncertain whether it would be legal , ” reports the AP .
“ We are not at all pleased with American Police masquerading as if they were the police for the city of Hardin , ” she said .
American Police Force and Hilton are now obviously engaging in desperate damage control , trying to offset concerns that they were on the verge of transforming the town into a “ privately run police state , ” as the AP article puts it , before press scrutiny forced them to put the breaks on .
Hilton has now pledged to donate the SUV’s that were marked with the police decals to the city while still pushing ahead with plans to provide law enforcement for the area for $ 250,000 a year .
The fact that APF ’s training center plans to recruit foreign assets who could then be patrolling the streets of America bossing U.S. citizens is obviously a frightening prospect , completely unconstitutional , and another reason why APF needs to abandon its plans to act as a private police force completely .

Think of The Atlantic 50 as our all - star team .
These are the most influential commentators in the nation , the columnists and bloggers and broadcast pundits who shape the national debates .
To compile the list , our team spent months collecting and analyzing data , tracking a group of 400 names that eventually became our 50 .
Our in - house methodology relies on three streams of information :
Influence :
We conducted surveys of more than 250 insiders – members of Congress , national media figures , and political players – asking respondents to rank - order the commentators who most influence their own thinking .
These surveys were done with National Journal .
Reach :
We collected and analyzed data to measure the total audience of each commentator .
Web Engagement :
In partnership with PostRank , a company specializing in filtering social media data , the Wire analyzed top commentators on 16 measures of webiness , including mentions on Twitter and performance on popular social media sites like Digg and Delicious .
The final list is the result of an algorithm that brings together these three factors .
After we identified the Atlantic 50 , we set out to monitor their opinions : to read everything they write , to listen to everything they say , to organize their views in a useful format .
Our profile and topic pages allow you to track the national debate by commentator or by subject .
The goal is to keep you informed about the ideas and personalities driving the conversation .

Dear me , have you noticed how many middle - aged , bearded blokes are around these days ?
It makes Iain Banks terribly difficult to spot in a crowd .
Maybe that 70s polytechnic lecturer look he has assiduously adopted for so many years is finally in fashion .
Still , when he strides into Edinburgh 's swanky Balmoral Hotel , fresh off the train from his home in North Queensferry , he looks trim and well - groomed – and , slightly surprisingly , orders a mineral water from the bar .
Banks has cut down on drink , he says , and drugs have been banished .
At 55 , with his divorce a fading memory and now ensconced in a relationship with the film festival curator and novelist Adèle Hartley , his life would appear fairly contented – except for the fact that he 's having to take a pay cut .
As one of Britain 's most consistently successful writers for a quarter of a century , surely this must have come as quite a shock ?
Banks shrugs .
" I 'm getting less money for my next book contract , " he says simply .
" But I 've heard of writers having their advances cut by 80 % , and others getting nothing .
You know , ' Sorry ; we just do n't want you any more . ' "
In response , he plans to crank out a book a year , rather than his recent rate of one every 18 months .
Ironically his new book , Transition , is being talked of as a return to form after what many fans consider a decade of lacklustre mainstream output .
His last three non-science - fiction novels , The Business , Dead Air and The Steep Approach to Garbadale , left many wondering if the man who , in the 80s , was hailed as the " great white hope " of British literature was running out of steam .
Readers bemoaned the relentless self - indulgence , with characters ranting endlessly about the world 's ills in what felt suspiciously like the author 's own voice .
Fair point ?
" Dead Air is full of rants ; it 's a rant - based book , " he concedes .
" Yes , it 's self - indulgence .
I plead guilty ; mea culpa . "
Readers of both Banks 's mainstream work and his hardcore science fiction ( published under the name Iain M Banks ) agree that the quality of his science fiction has held up much better over the years ; the " M " novels Look to Windward ( 2000 ) and Matter ( 2008 ) were among his most ambitious and accomplished works in the genre .
And , although Banks 's publisher would n't supply me with sales figures , it 's perhaps telling that Transition is being marketed in the US as an Iain M Banks novel .
" I sell better as a science - fiction writer over there , " he admits .
Attack on US foreign policy
So what does he think has prompted this seeming creative renaissance in his mainstream work ?
" With Transition , I wanted to prove something .
I wanted to show I could do something like The Bridge [ his third novel : a brilliant Kafkaesque account of the hallucinations of a man in a coma ] again because until now , that has been my favourite .
At my age , you realise that technically you are quite old , and you feel you have something to prove ; that you can do something that has got energy in it . "
The novel does feel akin to his much earlier works : structurally knotty , with multiple ( often unreliable ) narrators and plotlines .
At the book 's heart , though , is an exploration of the contradictions involved with a powerful organisation unilaterally adopting the moral high ground and setting out to put the world to rights .
It 's difficult , given the writer 's previous rants on the evils of American imperialism both in and outside his fiction , not to see this as anything other than a veiled attack on US foreign policy .
Banks rejects the notion : " I do n't think it 's about America per se ; it 's more about power and the way that it is wielded in general .
The Concern [ a band of self - appointed metaphysical police officers with the ability to jump between parallel universes ] is probably more like the Catholic church ; a very , very long - lasting and very rich organisation with tentacles everywhere . "
The novel features an alternate version of earth , in which a world ­ dominated by Asian influences is under attack from Christian terrorists .
" It 's meant to be a similar society to ours , " he says , " but with some of the stuff inverted .
Christianity would be a great religion for a terrorist ; Catholicism especially because nobody 's innocent , everybody 's guilty .
Babies are born guilty .
Absolutely sick idea . "
Banks 's work has always been infused with nastiness ; from Frank 's macabre rituals in The Wasp Factory to the relentless violence and cruelty of 1997's deeply unsettling A Song of Stone .
Transition is no exception , with the author applying his visceral imagination to the subject of torture .
One member of the Concern , a psychopath known as The Philosopher , meditates at length – and in excruciating detail – on the uses of pain as an interrogation tool .
That , concedes Banks , is an attack on US foreign policy .
" Yes , that all came from Abu Ghraib .
Torture is such a slippery slope ; as soon as you allow a society or any legal system to do that , almost instantly you get a situation where people are being tortured for very trivial reasons .
You know : ' Well , there was n't actually a bomb , but they might have been thinking about making one . . . ' "
Misguided zealot or plain evil
As well as the political rants in his novels , Banks has never hesitated to make his own views clear in other ways .
In 2004 , he tore up his passport and posted the bits to then prime minister Tony Blair , in protest over the Iraq war , only applying for a new one when Gordon Brown ( who has a house down the road from him in North Queensferry ) assumed the hot seat .
" My girlfriend says we 've got to stop describing ourselves as being only a mortar lob from his house . . .
I 'm only a little disappointed in Brown .
I do n't regard him as basically a war criminal , which is what Blair is .
I think Blair was a misguided zealot , or just plain evil in the way Thatcher was – not in the way Hitler was , but still as evil as you get within the British system .
But Blair and Brown have both been very good at standing up to the weak and poor , and utterly pathetic at standing up against the rich and powerful ; they roll over every single time . "
In January , Banks penned a rather gnomic two - sentence missive to the Guardian letters page : " We let the fat boys take over the tuck shop .
We should n't be too surprised when we turn up only to discover that the shelves are bare , " it simply said .
What was that all about ?
" I 'd had that phrase in my head for ages and I guess it was always destined to turn up in a book .
I just thought I 'd get it out there . "
With book publishers now facing the same potentially ruinous challenges of the digital era as newspapers , Banks has gamely agreed to act as guinea pig for his own publisher , Little Brown , which is releasing an abridged audio version of Transition free on iTunes ( the first instalment went online last week , on the same day the print version was published ) .
Is he really reduced to giving away his work ?
Banks seems sanguine – perhaps even a little resigned – about the whole thing : " I think [ the podcast ] is quite brave of my publishers .
I hope they 're getting it right .
My agent said to me : ' What do you think about this ? '
I said : ' I do n't know . '
We 've got our fingers crossed . "
What would he do if his work did stop selling ?
Could he contemplate retirement ?
" Even if I had enough money to live off the interest – and I certainly do n't – I do n't think I would .
The way I imagine it happening is that the intervals between novels will just get longer again .
I enjoy it too much – even if I knew I 'd never get a book published , I would still write .
I enjoy the experience of getting thoughts and ideas and plots and characters organised into this narrative framework .
And apart from anything else , I 've just gone through an expensive divorce so I could n't retire . "
It seems pretty depressing , though , for any aspiring writers if somebody of Banks 's track record is having it rough .
What next for him and his kind ?
" There will still be writers around , although I do n't know how we 'll get paid .
Well over a century after the invention of motion pictures , we still have stage plays .
The novel 's not going to go away and I do n't think the book will either . "
We ’ve recently been making use of an alternative to the traditional mock - and - stub pattern common in Ruby : the Test Spy .
Test spies allow you to record method invocations for later verification .
Basic usage goes something like this :
describe PostsController do it ' shows the given post on GET show ' do post = stub ( ' a post ' , to_param : ' 1 ' ) Post.stubs ( find : post ) get : show , id : post.to_param Post. should have_received ( : find ).with(post.to_param ) should render_template ( : show ) should assign_to ( : post ) .
with ( post ) end end
Compare that with the traditional expectation - based example :
describe PostsController do it ' shows the given post on GET show ' do post = stub ( ' a post ' , to_param : ' 1 ' ) Post.expects ( : find ).with(post.to_param).returns ( post ) get : show , id : post.to_param should render_template ( : show ) should assign_to ( : post ) .
with ( post ) end end
This may seem like a subtle difference , but cleanly separating the test ’s phases has real benefits .
The traditional xunit - style test follows four phases :
Setup : create the necessary preconditions for a test Exercise : run the code you ’re trying to test Verification : make sure that you got the expected result Teardown : clean up after your test so that it does n’t interact
When using fast - failing mocks , this process is turned on its head .
During the setup , you preemptively “ verify ” that certain methods are called with certain parameters .
If the method is called unexpectedly , it will fail immediately ( during the exercise phase ) .
If it does n’t get called at all , it will fail after the test ( during the teardown phase ) .
Besides being counter - intuitive and hard to keep track of , this presents problems when attempting to use the “ one testcase per fixture ” pattern ( common in Shoulda and RSpec suites ) , or worse , when trying to reuse stubs and behavioral assertions .
Many developers like to test each independent requirement for a piece of behavior individually .
Using a mock , that general setup goes like this :
describe PostsController , ' on GET show ' do before ( : each ) do @post = stub ( ' a post ' , to_param : ' 1 ' ) Post.expects ( : find ).with(@post.to_param).returns( @post ) get : show , id : @post.to_param end it { should render_template ( : show ) } it { should assign_to ( : post ) .
with( @post ) } end
If the mock is n’t being used as expected , every example will fail with the same message .
In addition , you ca n’t have an example that specifies “ it should find the given user , ” because that specification got swallowed by the before block .
If you like to write your example descriptions up front , this can be pretty disappointing .
Here ’s the same example using a test spy :
describe PostsController , ' on GET show ' do before ( : each ) do @post = stub ( ' a post ' , to_param : ' 1 ' ) Post.stubs ( find : @post ) get : show , id : @post.to_param end it { should render_template ( : show ) } it ' should find and assign the given post ' do Post .
should have_received ( : find ) .with(@post.to_param ) should assign_to ( : post ) .
with( @post ) end end
In this case , the phases are cleanly separated , and you can specify and verify behavior naturally .
The two independent requirements can be tested independently , and you ’ll get the failures you ’d want and expect .
One other problem with mocks is that you ca n’t share the stub without sharing the built - in verification .
That means that every time you reuse a mock , you ’re retesting the same behavior .
Here ’s an example :
describe PostsController do it ' shows a published post on GET show ' do post = stub ( ' a post ' , to_param : ' 1 ' ) post .
expects ( : published ? => true ) Post.
expects ( : find ).with(post.to_param).returns ( post ) get : show , id : post.to_param should render_template ( : show ) should assign_to ( : post ) .
with ( post ) end end describe ' / posts / show ' do it ' should display a post ' do assigns [ : post ] = stub ( ' a post ' , : published ? => true , title : ' a title ' ) render '/ posts / show ' template .
should have_tag ( ' h1 ' , assigns [ : post ] . title ) end end
Because the mock also sets an expectation , the stubbed post is difficult to reuse in other tests where the expected methods are unimportant .
However , using a test spy , you can share stubs and only verify the parts that are important in a particular test :
module PostHelpers def stub_post ( post_attrs = { } ) post_attrs = { to_param : ' 1 ' , : published ? => true , title : ' a title ' }. update ( post_attrs ) stub ( ' a post ' , post_attrs ) end def stub_post !
( post_attrs = {} ) returning stub_post do | post |
Post .
stubs ( find : post ) end end end describe PostsController do include PostHelpers it ' shows a published post on GET show ' do post = stub_post !
get : show , id : post .
to_param
Post .
should have_received ( : find ) . with ( post .
to_param ) post .
should have_received ( : published ? ) should render_template ( : show ) should assign_to ( : post ) . with ( post ) end end describe ' / posts / show ' do include PostHelpers it ' displays a post ' do assigns [ : post ] = stub_post render '/ posts / show ' template .
should have_tag ( ' h1 ' , assigns [ : post ]. title ) end end
As your test suite grows , the ability to refactor repeated stubs into reusable creation methods will allow you to refactor your production code without correcting mocks and stubs in dozens of files .
Also , because the verification phase is separate , common expectations can be pulled into reusable matchers and assertions :
# post.class.should have_received (: find ).with(post.to_param ) should find ( post ) # Post . should have_received ( :new ) .with( post_attrs ) should build ( Post , post_attrs ) # Post . should have_received (:new ) .with( post_attrs ) # post . should have_received ( : save ) should build_and_save ( Post , post_attrs )
Test spies are supported by the RSpec Mocks and Bourne test double frameworks .
We use RSpec Mocks as our primary default and Bourne when the existing test suite uses Mocha .

This is hardly a good day for a walk however .
In the early morning the sky did not become light until well after it should have due to a very solid , dark and heavy overcast .
It ’s not raining , but there ’s a heavy mist coming down .
We are walking on a tractor trail that connects the house and barn with the fields and some of the clearings .
Often there is evidence of the activities of bears and wolves in the open areas .
The horses are kept close to the house , and that is where the main pastures are as well .
The wild animals stay away from that area other than an occasional sighting when they approach for a look out of curiosity .
When ever she comes back this far on her land though , she carries a rifle .
But today I am carrying it , slung over my shoulder .
This walk in less than ideal conditions is a necessary one .
She talks about what this land means to her .
She loves it .
She knows every tree here .
The fences that frame this huge tract of land , she put up by herself .
She does the haying , training and feeding the horses , and works on the machinery or anything that needs fixing .
There is always a lot to do here .
Yet this woman next to me is just five feet tall , and has never weighed more than 120 pounds in her life .
But she is a tough little stick of dynamite .
She knows what work is , and often starts her day at 5:00 a.m. no matter what the weather brings .
She has auburn colored hair - fairly long .
I often thought that a woman so outdoor active would prefer shorter hair .
But she keeps it long and I ’m glad , because it ’s very pretty .
I adore her smile .
When she smiles , her eyes smile .
Her feminine figure is evident in her blue jeans , tapered shirt , and a waist length denim jacket to help ward off the mist .
She is beautiful .
I have studied her figure every chance I get for two years now .
I find her intriguing .
And still , after two years when we create our private and intimate time to come together and she stands before me , I still tremble .
She wears leather work gloves now , since she had been feeding the horses earlier .
Her jeans are worn and faded from long hours of mending fences , and cleaning stalls .
Her denim jacket is worn as well , and the cuffs are becoming frayed .
Our boots are soaked from walking in the wet tall grass .
After she has talked and made clear her need for this place and what she does here , I take control of the conversation .
I too love the place where I live , my town near the Metro .
And my work is my life .
I could never do anything else .
I am a locomotive Engineer .
I feel good while I am at work doing what I do .
And when I get home , I feel good about what I have done .
The problem that faces us is that our lives are 230 miles apart .
I have been seeing her for two years .
When ever any time at all permits , I drive up to northern Minnesota to be with her .
Sometimes I can stay two or three days .
Sometimes it ’s only for 12 hours .
But I am neglecting my own home , and the obligations that come with it .
I have had experience with horses and I appreciate anything mechanical .
I help her with all the tasks around this place .
But most of all , I cherish the time I have in her presence .
But it is apparent that the physical gap , in miles , that separates us can never be closed .
She has to stay where she is , and I have to stay where I am .
The impracticality of our deep affection for each other is surfacing with time , after having been ignored for so long .
This conclusion was n’t arrived at today .
It is something we have been discussing for a couple months .
The fixes for the problem simply wo n’t work .
And this reality is boldly before us .
After we each take our turns speaking , there is silence as we walk .
I take her gloved hand in my hand to silently confirm with her she is still in my heart .
We pass patches of wild strawberries and blueberries .
I know she is thinking she must get back out here and pick them for canning before the bears take them all .
It ’s part of her ritual .
I understand it ’s part of the fulfillment she cherishes by living here .
We are getting closer to the barn now , and beyond that is where my truck is parked .
The best route from the barn to my truck is to follow a fence line through the trees .
We walk into the barn and I dry off the rifle with a dirty towel on a work bench .
I put the rifle where it belongs - concealed behind a wooden plank .
Just above us in the rafters , is an owl .
He has long since become accustomed to the daytime activities in the barn , and is fast asleep .
The dreary day has made the light in the barn very dim .
Usually , on a sunny day , the barn is a very bright and welcoming .
But not today .
The mist has given way to a steady rain now .
The shoulders and sleeves of her jacket are already quite wet from the long walk in the mist .
And my clothes are wet too .
We talk some more in the barn .
We are old enough and smart enough to realize that if either one of us sacrificed a part of his or her world to be with the other all the time , it would n’t work out .
Sacrifice would turn into regret , and regret is an anchor on a vessel that must keep moving forward .
So it is now that we fully understand we must let go .
We leave the barn through the opposite door we came in , towards my truck .
We walk along the fence line to the opposite side of the trees .
We stop here .
My truck is just one hundred yards away .
We turn towards each other and I place my hands on her waist .
She takes off her leather gloves and lets them drop to the ground as she puts her hands on my waist as well .
We confirm that we will miss each other very much .
I am looking intently at her pretty face .
We only talk a little bit out here because we are getting rain soaked .
“ I could never leave here . ”
She tells me .
“ I could never live near the Metro area and all the congestion .
And I know you could never give up being an Engineer and leave the rails . "
“ You are really good with the horses … . ” she continues , “ and good with the machines too .
You know what needs to be done , and when to do it .
Both with this land …. ”
Then with a smile and a quiet voice says , “ and with me too . ”
She is looking up at me .
As the rain falls on her face , her eyes do n’t even flinch .
This woman has stood outside in much worse weather than this .
I leaned down and kissed her mouth .
I knew that would be our last kiss , and I expected her to let go of me at that moment , but she did n’t .
Instead she shook me slightly , as if she did n’t already have my complete attention .
“ You know what I wish ?
What I really , really wish ?
I wish you and I had connected 20 years ago , instead of just two .
20 years ago we did n’t have such deep set roots in our lives , we were more flexible , and together we could have grown in to who we are now … ….. because you and I make one hell of a good team . ”
She pressed her lips together to help hold back the tears .
With that , she let go of me , and I her .
She picked up her gloves off the ground and began walking the fence line back through the trees .
I watched her as she walked away .
I lost focus for a moment as I realized that I had a lot of thoughts and painful emotions to analyze over the coming days .
When I looked for her again , she was gone .
Instinctively , I took a couple steps toward the fence line .
But caught myself and stopped .
Out of necessity , we had given up something very precious .
We made a painful decision based on reality and practicality .
And now I am a man who had lost true love .
Just standing in the rain .

Mouse house gets new head ; ' Pro - fams ' get bigger traps
by Jeremy Hooper
Marriage .
Basic employment and hate crimes protections .
Adoption .
Now its top corporate jobs from which the " pro-family " set wants us barred :
Disney announced last week it had named Rich Ross as studio chief .
The 47 - year - old television executive helped to revive the Disney Channel , and now will oversee all production , distribution , and marketing for the company 's live - action and animated feature labels .
It is the first time an open homosexual has been named to such a position .
Peter LaBarbera is president of Americans for Truth About Homosexuality .
He says although a boycott of the entertainment giant ( initiated by the American Family Association ) was called off several years ago , the company is still very homosexual - friendly .
" The sad reality is that whenever you see a homosexual activist at the top , nine times out of ten they end up pushing that gay agenda using their influence to push it wherever they can , " states LaBarbera .
" It 's the way the homosexual movement ends up influencing the country far beyond its tiny numbers , " he explains .
" They get in key positions of power , and then they use that power to advance their agenda . "
LaBarbera says it is time for parents to get educated and to move away from Disney to family - friendly entertainment companies .

If Porno Petey wants to talk small numbers , why do n't we talk about the small numbers of religious bigots that are out there .
That 's right kids , there really are n't that many Christo - Fascisti our there but they sure know how to open their fucking traps .

News flash , Petey boy , Nickelodeon is gay friendly too .
That network specifically has aggressive recruiting of talent in the gay community .
Too bad , looks like AFTAH wants to harm the biggest and most powerful family entertainment networks around over the talent that a network in a FREE COUNTRY should be able to hire according to their talents and interests .
Why does n't AFTAH start their own family friendly entertainment network and see how many people they can attract to it .
That 's how the market works , Petey boy .
When you become a boring , screeching anti gay banshee , people just turn you off .

Well , no clue what Rich Ross will do with all that power , but if it were me , I 'd be sure to push my " gay agenda " of making sure all the people working for me had health insurance , partner benefits , hate crime protection , an equal chance at getting promoted .... you know , basic human dignity stuff .

I have taken a lot of grief over the years because on several occasions , I have used this website not to attack the left ( something I do with great regularity and enjoyment ) but because I also highlight some of the lunacy on the right we regularly get from talk show hosts , activists , and other prominent conservatives .
It is not an urge to purge that drives me to expose these clowns , charlatans , mountebanks , and just plain goofs .
It is rather an effort , in my own very small and insignificant way , to stand up for what I know is right ; that employing reason and rationality to fight Obama and the liberals is far superior to the utter stupidity found in the baseless , exaggerated , hyperbolic and ignorant critiques of the left and Obama that is passed off as “ conservative ” thought by those who have n’t a clue what conservatism means .
Yes , I usually find myself being almost as unhinged in my criticism of these kooks as they are in criticizing Obama .
So be it .
Trying to argue rationally with someone who believes Obama is a Nazi , or a Communist is akin to arguing with a stone wall .
And at least the wall is smart enough not to keep opening its mouth and further proving how irrational it is .
I reject arguments that one should n’t criticize one ’s own side and “ do the left ’s dirty work for them ” ( the silly and simple minded argument that I am somehow “ jealous ” of a talk show host ’s or a pundit ’s success are so laughable that I never bother to respond ) .
I believe that one of conservatism ’s major problems these last few years has been a failure of self - examination - and I include myself in committing that sin .
Unless one constantly challenges one ’s beliefs by examining the underlying assumptions of what we truly believe , testing them against what is happening in the real world , and using the logic and reason granted us by our humanity to determine if they still pass muster and are consistent with our principles , we fall into the trap of being inconsistent in the application of our philosophy .
You do n’t have to be an “ intellectual ” to accomplish this .
All it takes is to read and listen to opposing viewpoints once and a while .
To close one ’s mind to alternative points of view is , by definition , unconservative .
And to take the position automatically that liberals have nothing of interest you want to hear is beyond illogical - it is ignorant .
And yet , this is the de facto position of most of my many detractors - that somehow , my mind has been polluted because I quote some liberal every once and a while or I agree with something a liberal says about conservatives .
This is nuts .
And if anyone would take 10 seconds to think about it , most rational people would agree .
Where does this close mindedness get us ?
In the past weeks you ’ve heard me talk about the How to Take Back America Conference being held in St. Louis this Friday , Sept. 25 , and Saturday , Sept. 26 , with speakers like : Gov. Mike Huckabee , “ Joe the Plumber , ” U.S. Reps .
Michele Bachmann , R - Minn. , Trent Franks , R - Ariz. , Steve King , R - Iowa , Tom McClintock , R - Calif. , Dr. Tom Price , R - Ga. , and Three - Star Gen. Jerry Boykin .
But someone who ’ll be there that you did n’t hear about is Kitty Werthmann .
Kitty was 12 years old when Adolf Hitler took over Austria .
She is 83 with a “ vivid memory ” of what happened in her homeland next .
She witnessed the government take over the banks and the auto industry .
Sound familiar ?
In the last nine months , Obama and the Democrats in Congress have successfully orchestrated the government takeover of Chrysler and General Motors along with countless banks .
She witnessed the “ compulsory youth ” service and indoctrination .
That sounds a little like Obama ’s call for “ mandatory volunteerism ” for America ’s youth .
The government takeover of the schools immediately replaced crucifixes with pictures of Hitler and Nazi flags .
“ All religious instruction was replaced with physical education , ” said Werthmann .
No prayer was allowed .
That all happened here decades ago .
It is interesting , however , that Obama ’s speech to the captive audience in the government schools – complete with the essay assignment about how students could help him achieve his political goals – was replaced once the American people got wind of it .
And speaking of government control of education , if the Senate agrees , all student loans will be government issued , according to a bill that passed the House last week .
Before commenting on the substance of what the author actually believes is solid evidence that Obama wants to set up a Fourth Reich , I want you to look at that list of Republicans who will be giving their imprimatur to a conference that features such idiocy .
Those are not “ fringe ” players .
They are all considered “ mainstream ” conservatives .
Should they be taken to task for attending a conference that features such off the wall lunacy ?
If it was the only such session that featured , they might be given a pass .
But here are a few other sessions that many would see as extreme and many more would see as batsh*t crazy :
HOW TO DEFEAT ATTACKS ON SOVEREIGNTY BY U.N. TREATIES AND NORTH AMERICAN UNION ( Just tell me where those black helicopters are )
HOW TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF SUPREMACIST JUDGES ( um…elect more Republicans ? )
HOW TO DEFEND AMERICA VS .
MISSILE ATTACK
I would urge you to click on some of the links to other , more sedate sounding seminars like “ How to Counter the Homosexual Extremist Movement ” or “ How to Understand Islam ” to understand why I condemn any so - called “ mainstream conservatives ” who participated in this nuthouse of a conference .
A description of Mrs. Werthmann ’s “ seminar : ”
At the How To Take Back America Conference last weekend , conservative speaker Kitty Werthmann led a workshop called “ How to recognize living under Nazis & Communists . ”
Announcing the panel in a column preceding the conference , talk show host Janet Porter gushed how Werthmann ’s description of Austria in the 1930s is a “ mirror to America ” today — noting “ They had Joseph Goebbels ; we have Mark Lloyd , the diversity czar . ”
The room was packed over capacity to hear Werthmann , who grew up as a Christian in Austria and serves as Phyllis Schlafly ’s Eagle Forum South Dakota President .
During her session , Werthmann went through a litany of examples of how President Obama is like Adolf Hitler .
She noted that Hitler , who acted “ like an American politician , ” was “ elected in a 100 % Christian nation . ”
Although she failed to once mention Antisemitism or militarism , Werthmann explained how universal healthcare , an Equal Rights Amendment , and increased taxes were telltale signs of Nazism .
Werthmann also warned the audience :
If we had our guns , we would have fought a bloody battle .
So , keep your guns , and buy more guns , and buy ammunition . [...]
Take back America .
Do n’t let them take the country into Socialism .
And I refer again , Hitler ’s party was National Socialism . [...]
And that ’s what we are having here right now , which is bordering on Marxism .
Is there any way to logically address Mrs. Werthmann ’s points ?
The answer is no .
And the reason is because she is living in a different reality than the rest of us .
To 95 % of the world , what Obama and the Democrats are doing you can agree or disagree with , but it is being done by the all - American way of Congress proposing , and the president disposing .
Even Obama ’s executive grabs like taking over private business finds precedent in American history among presidents .
Obama is dead wrong .
But he is not a Marxist , or Nazi , or even a socialist .
He is a far left American liberal which , by the way , puts him considerably to the right of the Euro - left .
To casually toss about the terms “ Marxist ” and “ Nazi ” shows that those who do so are wildly exaggerating what the liberals are doing .
Mrs. Werthmann may be a witness to history but her analogies are childlike in their logic .
Exaggeration is not argument .
It is emotionalism run rampant .
And at its base is simple , unreasoning fear .
Fear of change , fear that the powerlessness conservatives feel right now is a permanent feature of American politics , and , I am sorry to say , fear of Obama because he is a black man .
The emotional state of conservatism now coupled with the hyper partisan atmosphere in the country ( and the already excessive ideological nature of the opposition to Obama ) is a combination that afflicts the reason centers of the mind and is proving to be a block to thinking logically .
What is there to “ fear ” about Obama and the Democrats ?
They are proposing the same liberal crap that the left has been promoting for more than 30 years .
We have fought them before using reason and logic .
What is so different now ?
I agree with the left to a certain extent that the right - especially on the internet - has become something of an echo chamber ( it ’s true on the left too but their crazies have already been marginalized ) .
This has resulted in what might be termed a “ negative feedback loop ” where the more exaggerated claims about dastardly Democrats go around and around , becoming ever more outrageous and illogical , until we get overflowing crowds at a seminar where the most fantastically stretched and mangled analogies to Nazis and Communists are taken seriously .
I do n’t know how to say it any other way ; those conservatives who do n’t see a problem with this , or do n’t think it “ representative ” of a significant portion of the conservative movement , or who do n’t believe this sort of thing should be taken out , examined , and criticized as forcefully as possible are fooling themselves into believing this kind of thinking does n’t matter .
It is poison coursing through the body of conservatism and we either use reason and logic as an antidote or it will end up killing us .
To my mind , there is no alternative .
Ignore it and it only gets bigger and more outrageously out of touch with reality .
This is why I write about it .
This is why you should join me in condemning and marginalizing these crazies , inoculating conservatism against contracting this plague on rational thought .
Vogue model Liksula Cohen wants to sue an anonymous blogger for calling her a 40 - something skank who " may have been hot 10 years ago . "
A New York court ruled in her favor , ordering Google to unmask the anonymous blogger , making her open for a defamation suit .
First , I can't believe a U.S. court ruled to unmask an anonymous blogger for stating her opinion .
Justice Joan Madden rejected the defendant 's claim that blogs , " serve as a modern - day forum for conveying personal opinions , including invective and ranting . "
This Canadian model is apparently accustomed to Canadian defamation law , where the courts will convict and imprison citizens for speaking their opinion about other people .
The only leg Cohen has to stand on is New York Times Co. v. Sullivan ( 1964 ) .
However , this precedent only applies to defamation of public officials .
Cohen 's ego does n't stretch that high .
Additionally , the decision in Gertz v. Robert Welch , Inc. ( 1974 ) removes liability for defamation when the defendant is stating an opinion .
As far as I know , stating that someone is hot or not is still an opinion .
Morgan Tsvangirai ( R ) chose Roy Bennett ( L ) to serve in the cabinet
The US has called for Zimbabwe 's President Robert Mugabe to stop " harassing " his rivals , a day after a senior politician was imprisoned .
The state department said the jailing of Roy Bennett was a " blatant example " of a lack of the rule of law .
Mr Bennett , an aide to Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai , faces trial over an alleged plot kill Mr Mugabe .
Mr Tsvangirai has begun a boycott of his offices and cabinet meetings in protest at Mr Bennett 's imprisonment .
The prime minister has suspended his coming to the office until the issue of Senator Bennett is resolved
James Maridadi
Mr Tsvangirai's spokesman
The prime minister 's Movement for Democratic Change party says the charges are politically motivated and untrue .
Analysts say the issue threatens to split the unity government Mr Tsvangirai formed with Mr Mugabe in February .
State department spokesman Robert Wood joined a chorus of international disapproval that has followed Mr Bennett 's jailing .
" Mugabe has to end the harassment of the opposition , including Mr Bennett , " he said .
The EU also said it was " deeply concerned " that " politically motivated abuse persists " .
Terrorism charge Mr Tsvangirai's spokesman , James Maridadi , said the prime minister had tried to contact Mr Mugabe to discuss the issue , but had failed .

PESHAWAR , Pakistan 
A huge and lethal blast rocked a crowded market in the northwestern city of Peshawar on Friday , in what appeared to be a warning about the government ’s plans to launch a military offensive against militants in the frontier region of South Waziristan .
The blast , which police and security officials suspected was caused by a suicide car bomb containing more than 100 pounds of explosives , was the biggest in Pakistan in months , killing at least 48 people , including seven children and one woman , and wounding 148 others .
It was the second attack by militants this week , after the bombing of a United Nations agency on Monday , raising concern that Taliban militants were preparing a new wave of attacks in a country where scores of suicide bombings have occurred .
Peshawar , the capital of the North - West Frontier Province , has long been an easy target for the militants ; it is also crucial to both the Taliban and the government because of its proximity to Pakistan ’s mountainous frontier .
Furthermore , the city is of strategic value to NATO because it serves as a transportation hub for supplies bound for neighboring Afghanistan .

A majority of the people killed were passengers traveling in a public minibus , which was passing beside the car used in the attack .
Several pedestrians were also killed or seriously wounded .
The blast was so intense that it overturned the passenger bus , leaving bodies and injured passengers trapped in its wreckage .
The bombing also damaged dozens of multistory buildings , shops and offices in the area , a known commercial center , and snapped the power supply cables .
Witnesses said many of the dead were damaged beyond recognition .
“ Out of the 48 bodies , so far 27 have been identified , ” said Dr. Sahib Gul , chief of the trauma center at Lady Reading Hospital , where most of the casualties were taken .
He feared that the death toll might increase , as some of the wounded were in critical condition .
Officials said the militants , who largely attack military or police personnel , were expanding their targets to include civilians to press the government and forestall a possible operation in the South Waziristan tribal region .
The Provincial Assembly was in session about a half - mile away , and local television coverage showed legislators emerging from the building and making calls on their cellphones .
The United States ambassador , Anne W. Patterson , immediately condemned the attack , saying in a statement that it “ serves only to highlight the vicious and inhuman nature of the terrorists who aim to instill fear in the hearts of the Pakistani people . ”

Meanwhile , Rehman Malik , the Pakistani interior minister , said Friday that investigators had made one arrest and identified those involved in the suicide bombing of the headquarters of the World Food Program in Islamabad , the capital , on Monday .
Four Pakistanis and an Iraqi died in the blast .
Speaking to reporters outside the Parliament in Islamabad , Mr. Malik said the government knew who took the bomber to the highly fortified building of the food program .
“ The main handler is in our custody , and we have complete information about the persons involved in executing the terrorist plan and facilitating the terrorists , ” Mr. Malik said .
“ We know where the instructions came from , where he stayed . ”
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack , and a Taliban spokesman , Azam Tariq , said there would be more singling out of foreigners and Pakistanis working with overseas agencies .
“ Given this aggressiveness and this new threat , we are taking a range of actions to redouble our security efforts , ” said Josette Sheeran , the executive director of the food program , which says it supplies food and humanitarian aid to an estimated 10 million Pakistanis .
The program is a United Nations agency , and the organization has temporarily closed its offices in Pakistan .
Ms. Sheeran said the withdrawal of World Food Program staff members from the country was “ not contemplated . ”
Lately , I ’ve noticed a card war brewing .
On one side , stand the Banks and Credit Card firms .
They get paid a percentage of every sale when you swipe your Amex , Master Card or Visa in a credit card machine .
On the other side , are the Retailers .
In the middle , the Consumer .
The battle between the two giant sectors means that choices ( and potential costs ) are multiplying — if consumers become aware of them .
The battle is over that 3 % or so processing fee ( it varies ) when you swipe your card at a store .
It is a big chunk out of Retailer profits , especially during an economic downturn .
One recent retailer study found some stores paid as much as 63 % more in transaction fees than they earned in profits .
“ Choice Architects ” — as Richard Thaler calls them in Nudge — working for retailers have been trying to cut down on these fees :
An increasing number of stores have changed their default card settings to “ Debit ” from “ Credit . ”
I first noticed this during a visit to Target .
I swiped my bank debit card — also a Visa — thru the machine .
Sometime ago , the default setting was Credit , but now it seems the default setting was Debit .
So too is the default setting at the Supermarket .
If you wanted cash back , you previously had to select Debit , than punch in a dollar amount .
Now , the default is debit , and you are automatically asked if you want cash back ( some consumer groups advocate sticking with credit over debit ) .
Interesting . . .
The banks are n’t sitting by idly while a big chunk of their profits disappear .
Several majors have begun to emphasize cash back for credit card purchases , and have issued specific credit cards that pay a % back .
Next volley in the war :
Look for the retailers to fire back : I am waiting for a major chain to offer a 1 % discount for using debit versus credit card .

Happiness is something we like to believe we know and know well , but in practice it can become quite a difficult and elusive thing to obtain .
Recently , positive psychologists and other researchers have begun to ask the question , “ What is it that makes an individual truly happy ? ”
These researchers hope to explain not just what makes a person happy in a single moment , but how habits of good living can create a life of fulfillment and satisfaction .
Television documentaries like 20/20 ’s “ Happiness , ” and ABC ’s “ Mysteries of Happiness ” went on a search to answer this golden question .
Society and happiness
Social scientists and pollsters have spent their time giving questionnaires to thousands of people all over the globe to try and discover where the happiest places on earth are .
According to the research on 20/20 ’s “ Happiness ” , Denmark was ranked at the top .
But why is this so ?
Researchers say that it is Denmark ’s government that plays such a large role in the nation ’s level of happiness , a vast welfare state where citizens are taxed about 60 % of their income .
Despite the high taxes however citizens are secure .
Things like healthcare and education are taken care of so individuals have a greater flexibility in choosing a career they will love and enjoy , rather than needing to worry so much about how to maintain a healthy living .
Singapore , despite the huge difference between its government compared to Denmark ’s , ranked as the happiest country in Asia .
Despite the incredible amount of government regulations and censorship in Singapore , the citizens there remain happy .
Researchers say this is due to the sense of loyalty , security , and community within the nation .
Individuals who break the law risk getting beaten with a bamboo cane , but this kind of incentive not to commit a crime is perhaps the kind of system of rules that can lead to a more obedient , safe and cleaner society .
A similar sense of community is shown in Asheville , North Carolina where the streets are packed with coffee shops , art , and a rich culture .
Even in the poverty - ridden India , and in Amish communities who reject to live in the industrialized world , these people have shown to be happier than those in a more “ materialistic ” society such as the state California .
This is largely due to the strong sense of community that unites these particular societies to recognize themselves as a single family .
Individuals and happiness
So far what has been discussed only accounts for a small fraction of the happiness level of an individual .
Researchers claim that “ life circumstances ” – the environments we are born and live in only include about 10 % of our capacity for happiness .
But what happens to the other 90 % ?
One of the biggest subjects of research , not only in psychology but biology , is genetics .
Positive psychologists like Martin Seligman claim that over 50 % of our capacity of happiness is actually dependent on genetics .
Therefore , it is predetermined .
One great example of this fact was portrayed in ABC ’s “ Mysteries of Happiness , ” where researchers studied a set of twins who were separated at birth .
Cases where identical twins have been separated – meaning they were born with the same set of genes but grew up in different environments – are great opportunities to see the effects that our genes play in our behavior .
Upon seeing these two twins who grew up in completely different life circumstances , it is evident to even a non-scientist that they both share an inclination towards happiness and mental well being .
They literally laugh at everything , and they act as though they have been buddies all their life .
Perhaps this is because their genes dispose each to a healthier and happier brain .
For example , neuroscientists found that the left frontal cortex is an area in the brain that is highly correlated to happiness – meaning it becomes more active in happy individuals then those who are less happy .
The idea that genes may play such a large role in our happiness can sometimes seem daunting to those who are unhappy .
Could it be that some of us are born to be depressed ?
Perhaps this is true to some extent , but researchers also claim that the remaining 40 % of our happiness capacity is actually all up to us – we control it intentionally .
In what ways can we exercise this control of our mental well being ?
In 20/20s “ Happiness , ” positive psychologists describe a state of being called flow – where one is completely absorbed in the action they are partaking in .
It is believed that skillful artists , musicians and athletes enter into this state of flow ( sometimes called “ in the zone ” ) when they are acting out their favorite hobbies .
It is said to be a state of being that is not only skillful , but something that can lead to a greater satisfaction with life .
When we can find our passions and pursue them we add more meaning to our lives and we give our self a greater purpose .
ABC ’s “ Mysteries of Happiness ” depicts other ways for individuals to add a greater purpose and meaning to their life through religion .
It has been shown that many of the happiest regions in the world are also deeply spiritual , and it is this ability to identify with a higher being that gives some the extra enthusiasm and motivation to embrace life to the fullest .
The meaningful life is certainly not something to be ignored when cultivating happiness .
In fact , it often allows the individual to perceive a stronger sense of control over one ’s life .
Some positive psychologists call this learned optimism ( contrary to the popular psychology term “ learned helplessness ” where individuals obtain the sense that no matter what they do they cannot change anything ) .
The takeaway message is that happiness is something that can be cultivated from the inside ; it is not something solely dependent on external conditions .
Through our behaviors , and even how we perceive life , we can make serious changes .
One psychology experiment described in “ Mysteries of Happiness , ” had one set of participants hold a pen in their mouth which mimicked a smile while the other half held the pen in their mouth so that it mimicked a frown ( the participants were not away of the nature of the experiment ) .
Results showed that those who were in the smile group were actually happier than those who were in the frown group .
This creative study shows us that even by simply planting a smile on our face we are allowing ourselves to become more pleased with life , even if it is a fake smile – wow !
But the masters of cultivating happiness from the inside are Buddhist monks .
They spend years and years meditating to relinquish their life suffering and to cultivate long - lasting , unconditional happiness and mental well - being .
A study described in 20 /20 ’s “ Happiness ” showed that even participants who only meditated for two weeks showed significant signs of improvement in their life satisfaction .
It reduces stress , has physical benefits , and cultivates a greater appreciation and love towards life – and it ’s all accomplished by sitting still and training the mind .
Conclusion
Both of these documentaries , 20/20 ’s “ Happiness ” and ABC ’s “ Mysteries of Happiness , ” do a great job at covering all the different factors that affect our capacity to be happy .
As shown , we can separate these factors into three main categories : life circumstances ( 10 % ) , genes ( 50 % ) , and intentional control ( 40 % ) .
Life circumstances entail the society we grow up in , institutions that affect our environment ( especially government ) , and our family background .
Genes are the factors that are determined by our biological make - up .
Some of us get stuck with worse genes than others and therefore are more prone to mental disorders or depression .
These first two factors are essentially out of our control , but the final factor is that we have the ability to make decisions and pick up good habits of living that allow us to be happier .
This is our intentional control over our life affairs , and it plays a great chunk in how happy we can really become .
Whether it is engaging life through our own unique sense of flow , seeking meaning through a spiritual deity , meditating , or even just smiling more often : we have the power to make long - lasting changes that can lead to better living and , most importantly , true happiness .

Certainly , as both the interest in viewing , and the fees for viewing , scientific papers rises , more and more instances of paper piracy will come to light .

It is 40 years since cannabis unleashed the " flower power " revolution of the 1960s , encouraging a generation in Europe and the US to " make love not war " .
Young people at the time hoped their legacy would be world peace .
Instead , it has turned out to be a world of fuzzy dope - heads .
In the intervening decades , the drug whose intoxicating effects have been known for 4,000 years has been increasingly adopted by adolescents and young adults across the globe .
Today , an estimated one in 25 adults of working age – 166 million people around the world – has used cannabis to get high , either in ignorance or defiance of its damaging effects on health .
Now , the extraordinary popularity of the drug is posing a significant public health challenge , doctors say .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Writing in The Lancet , Wayne Hall of the University of Queensland and Louisa Degenhardt of the University of New South Wales , Australia , say cannabis slows reaction times and increases the risk of accidents , causes bronchitis , interferes with learning , memory and education and , most seriously , may double the risk of schizophrenia .
Yet these effects have failed to dent its popularity .
" Since cannabis use was first reported over 40 years ago by US college students , its recreational or non-medical use has spread globally , first to high - income countries , and recently to low - income and middle - income countries , " they say .
Citing figures from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime for 2006 , they say cannabis use is highest in the US , Australia and New Zealand ( where more than 8 per cent of the population indulge ) , followed by Europe .
But because Asia and Africa have bigger populations , they also have the highest proportion of the world 's cannabis users , accounting for almost a third ( 31 per cent ) and a quarter ( 25 per cent ) respectively .
Use of cannabis among young people rose strongly during the 1960s and 1970s , peaking in the US in 1979 .
There was then a long decline until it increased again in the 1990s , before levelling off once more since 2000 .
In Britain , Australia and New Zealand , cannabis use has been falling for several years , but it is thought to be rising in Latin America and several countries in Africa .
The typical user smokes their first joint in their mid-teens , with use peaking in the mid-20s .
The habit then declines steeply as young people move into jobs and discover they have to get up in the morning .
Marriage and babies accelerate the decline .
About one in 10 of those who ever smoke a joint become regular daily users , with 20 to 30 per cent using the drug weekly .
Regular users are also more likely to use other illicit drugs , including heroin and cocaine , lending support to the theory that " soft " drugs act as a " gateway " to hard drugs .
But the authors admit this supposed link " remains a subject of considerable debate " .
However , they add that the ill effects of cannabis are modest when compared with the damage done by alcohol , tobacco and other illicit drugs .
In Australia , it accounted for just 0.2 per cent of the total burden of disease .
VENICE ( Reuters ) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , a fierce critic of U.S. foreign policy who once called George W. Bush “ the devil , ” said on Monday he hoped to be able to work more closely with President Barack Obama .
The leftist 55 - year - old leader added in an interview in Italy that despite the global economic crisis and signs of a slowdown in growth in Venezuela , he did not expect his country to fall into recession .
Chavez was in Venice for the world premiere of “ South of the Border , ” director Oliver Stone ’s sympathetic portrait of a leader he says has championed the poor and who has been unfairly demonized by the U.S. media .
“ I have no reason to call him ( Obama ) the devil , and I hope that I am right , ” Chavez told reporters in Venice .
“ With Obama we can talk , we are almost from the same generation , one ca n’t deny that Obama is different ( from Bush ) .
He ’s intelligent , he has good intentions and we have to help him . ”
Stone ’s documentary argues that the economy has grown under Chavez ’s rule and poverty levels have fallen sharply , all without the help of bailout loans from foreign lenders .
Asked in an interview with Reuters whether the fact that Venezuela ’s economy shrank for the first time in more than five years during the second quarter of 2009 could mean austerity measures ahead , Chavez replied :
“ There is no recession in Venezuela .
There has been a slight slowdown in growth but that is something logical because of the great worldwide recession in capitalism .
“ We have taken some steps but unemployment continues to fall and production continues to rise .
Venezuela has been affected by the crisis but has not and will not go into recession , ” added the president , who sat next to Stone .
“ REAL DEMOCRATIC MODEL ”
Chavez also said his democratic credentials remained intact despite concerns over moves to crack down on the independent media and political opposition .
Thousands of people took to the streets of Caracas over the weekend to voice their opposition to the president , who has been in power for a decade and says he needs another 10 years to pursue his socialist reforms .
“ In Venezuela , no television channel has been closed despite the fact that in many cases the television channels supported a coup d’etat , ” he said .
“ Noam Chomsky ... was asked in an interview what would happen if Fox News or CNN had supported a coup against a president .
Chomsky replied that not only would those channels have been closed , but their owners would have been sent to the electric chair .
“ I ’m entirely dedicated to building a real democratic model in Venezuela .
As Abraham Lincoln said , what is democracy ?
It is not the system by which a rich minority exploits the people .
It is government by the people and for the people . ”
Stone ’s film includes clips of U.S. news channels casting Chavez as a threat akin to that posed by al Qaeda .
“ The caricature compares me to Hitler and Mussolini , that is just laughable , ” he said .
“ It shows a lack of respect to the intelligence of the human being and of society . ”

THE main book market , in Baghdad 's Mutanabi Street , was a hive of angry chatter this week .
Bespectacled traders , complaining about new censorship laws , shouted , “ This is not freedom of expression , ” and talked of holding a demonstration like one last month , when journalists protested against new restrictions .
But would the booksellers dare ?
They said they were already worried that plainclothes policemen had been taking their names .
Perhaps they should go instead to court and fight censorship with the help of lawyers .
“ Not a chance , ” said one book - dealer .
“ This is the new Iraq . ” Legal protections , he noted , count for little .
“ Power ” , he added , “ is held by the men with the guns . ”
He had a point .
The Shia -led government has overseen a ballooning of the country 's security apparatus .
Human - rights violations are becoming more common .
In private many Iraqis , especially educated ones , are asking if their country may go back to being a police state .
Old habits from Saddam Hussein 's era are becoming familiar again .
Torture is routine in government detention centres .
“ Things are bad and getting worse , even by regional standards , ” says Samer Muscati , who works for Human Rights Watch , a New York - based lobby .
His outfit reports that , with American oversight gone ( albeit that the Americans committed their own shameful abuses in such places as Abu Ghraib prison ) , Iraqi police and security people are again pulling out fingernails and beating detainees , even those who have already made confessions .
A limping former prison inmate tells how he realised , after a bout of torture in a government ministry that lasted for five days , that he had been relatively lucky .
When he was reunited with fellow prisoners , he said he saw that many had lost limbs and organs .
The domestic - security apparatus is at its busiest since Saddam was overthrown six years ago , especially in the capital .
In July the Baghdad police reimposed a nightly curfew , making it easier for the police , taking orders from politicians , to arrest people disliked by the Shia - led government .
In particular , they have been targeting leaders of the Awakening Councils , groups of Sunnis , many of them former insurgents and sympathisers , who have helped the government to drive out or capture Sunni rebels who refused to come onside .
Instead of being drawn into the new power set - up , many of them in the past few months have been hauled off to prison .
In the most delicate cases , the arrests are being made by an elite unit called the Baghdad Brigade , also known as “ the dirty squad ” , which is said to report to the office of the prime minister , Nuri al - Maliki .
The American - sponsored judicial system was supposed to protect Iraqis ' civil rights .
But it is sorely overstretched , with some 1,500 people being brought into prisons every month as the Americans empty their own Iraqi jails .
The number of Iraqis in American - run prisons has dropped to less than 9,000 from more than 21,000 a year ago , whereas the number in Iraq 's own jails has risen from 35,000 in February probably to more than 40,000 today .
Moreover , sentencing is getting harsher , with more people sentenced to death .
On a single day in June 19 people were hanged in Baghdad .
In a recent report Amnesty International , a British - based group , says that more than 1,000 Iraqis face execution , often on the basis of confessions , which , it says , are sometimes made under torture .
Journalists are prominent victims of Iraq 's judicial system .
In July one was arrested for photographing a Baghdad traffic jam , after his pictures were deemed “ negative ” for mocking Mr Maliki 's assertion that life in the capital was improving .
Last year Iraq dropped to 158th place out of 173 — its lowest ranking since the American invasion — in a press - freedom table drawn up by Reporters Without Borders , a Paris - based lobby , which detects a decline in freedom in many countries ( see article ) .
The government recently announced plans to censor imported books as well as the internet , saying it wanted to ban hate screeds and pornography .
But human - rights monitors fear this may presage a first step towards a wider web of censorship .
Internet cafés face new rules that require them to register .
Many bloggers and other e-mailers may lose protective anonymity .
Some Iraqis say they approve of this rush to reapply social controls .
They see them as a good way to fight sectarian violence .
But even if less freedom were to bring greater security , the new laws are part of a looming and potentially violent power struggle .
The new establishment has yet to entrench a solid political system , despite endorsing two constitutions since Saddam was ousted .
The Shia -led federal government in Baghdad wants a strong unitary state , whereas the Kurds and some other groups still seek a more federal one .
In any event , Mr Maliki and his friends are trying to secure as much control as they can over the levers of power in the run-up to a general election in January , all the more feverishly since a rash of big bombings in Baghdad in the past two months has badly dented his reputation as a guarantor of public safety .
His government is also seeking to tighten rules to regulate political parties and independent associations ( including charities ) , causing still more alarm .
“ This is not how you build a democracy , ” says Maysoon al - Damluji , a liberal member of parliament .
It is too soon to say Iraq will revert to Saddam 's heinous standards .
Parliament is diverse and vigorous .
The press still airs a range of opinion .
The courts are not yet rubber stamps .
But the trend is going the wrong way .
“ This will be a police state , no question , ” says a Western diplomat with long experience of Iraq .
“ It 'll take two or three years .
But it 's coming . ”
Shots ring out on an overcast fall afternoon .
Musket - toting men clad in coonskin caps and leather leggings have gathered at a campground on the banks of the Osage River , near the Lake of the Ozarks , for the annual Mountain Man Rendezvous .
Here they will replicate an authentic frontier fur - trading post , complete with teepees , a tomahawk - throwing contest and target shooting .
Down at the far end of the encampment , a crowd has congregated around a curious sight in the middle of a dirt road : two anvils stacked one atop the other .
At the heart of the group stands a tall , sturdy man named Gay Wilkinson .
Though his salt - and - pepper beard would make even the burliest of mountain men jealous , Wilkinson is dressed in decidedly un-mountain man garb — khaki shorts , a gray St. Louis Cardinals hoodie , sunglasses .
Dangling from his neck is a gold rope chain with a tiny gold anvil attached .
But this is no blacksmithing demonstration , nor is it a historic reenactment of the Wile E. Coyote vs. Road Runner feud .
What we have here is an exhibition of an obscure but venerable American tradition :
Anvil shooting .
Wilkinson works the crowd like a sideshow huckster , hyping the feat he 's about to perform .
" I am going to make this anvil fly ! " he declares , gesturing toward the two 120 - pound hunks of forged iron at his feet .
" It 's no different than launching pianos or Cadillacs or anything else that was n't meant to fly . "
He upends the top anvil , revealing a brick - size cavity that has been carved neatly into each tool 's flat , hourglass - shaped bottom .
From a beat - up suitcase , he fishes out a large red tin of black powder and fills each hollowed - out space with half a pound of explosives .
Wilkinson gleefully points out that the amount of gunpowder he just poured into the anvils is roughly 700 times what the assembled mountain men use to fire a single round from their muskets .
" If you 're smoking , please take a few steps back , " he warns as the onlookers press in for a closer look .
" I do n't want you to kill us all before y'all get to see this . "
To keep the powder from spilling out when top anvil is turned right - side up , Wilkinson uses peanut butter ( " Acme anvil sealant , " he quips ) to affix a slip of notebook paper to the powder - packed cavity .
He asks for help flipping the sealed anvil back into place over its twin .
A volunteer steps up , grabs the horn and grunts as he and Wilkinson hoist the iron tool .
The men set it down gently , the two gunpowder - filled recesses now flush to one another and aligned .
Next Wilkinson herds the crowd to a spot about 50 feet from the loaded anvils and delivers a well - rehearsed introduction .
" It 'll be loud , but ya wo n't hardly remember that ' cause there 'll be so much else goin ' on , " he says .
" There 'll be a slight second of fear after that anvil goes shootin ' up and starts comin ' back down .
It 'll look like it 's going to land on top of you .
It wo n't .
Unless you hear me yell , ' Run ! '
Then you might wanna move .
" Now , some of you might be wonderin ' , " he continues , " ' Why in the heck we would want to do somethin ' like this ? ' "
" Because we can ? " guesses a middle - aged man sporting a camouflage baseball cap .
" That 's exactly right ! " Wilkinson says with a mischievous smile .
" It 's a whole lot of fun !
People talk about the joy of sex , but it do n't last nothin ' like shootin ' anvils . "
Eventually it 's time for the show .
Wilkinson lights a long fuse that he has threaded into the gunpowder chamber through a tiny hole bored into the side of the base anvil .
He scrambles away , nearly stumbling as he backpedals .
The hushed onlookers plug their ears with their fingertips .
Time seems to slow down as the fuse hisses and disappears inside the anvil .
Thirty seconds elapse .
Just when it feels like it might be a dud ...
KABOOM !
A flash , then a thick cloud of gray smoke .
The explosion emits a bone - rattling concussion and a colossal boom reverberates off the surrounding hills and rings in the onlookers ' ears .
Almost as one , everybody cranes their neck skyward to see the heavy black mass rocket up , up , up , high above the treetops , nearly 150 feet off the ground at its apex .
The anvil seems to float for a brief second before plummeting back to earth , where it lands with a dull thud less than five feet from its twin , which has n't budged from the launching pad .
Anvil shooting — also called anvil launching , firing or ringing — is practiced by a handful of passionate enthusiasts across the South , Midwest and Appalachia , primarily in Missouri and Mississippi .
The National Anvil Shooting Contest — the Super Bowl of competitive anvil shooting — has been held every April since 1994 , in the tiny town of Laurel , Mississippi .
A dozen men ( female anvil shooters are few and far between ) compete for bragging rights in two divisions — Traditional and Super Modified — to see who can propel his anvil the highest .
A point is rewarded for each foot of altitude , and three points are subtracted for every foot away from the launching pad the anvil lands .
The anvil 's apex is calculated using surveyor 's equipment .
Competitors in the Traditional class — the anvil - on - anvil method Wilkinson demonstrated at the Mountain Man Rendezvous — routinely top 200 feet using a 100 - pound anvil and a pound of gunpowder .
In the Super Modified division , participants launch a single 100 - pound anvil set atop a homemade mortar tube packed with two pounds of powder — enough to send the anvil soaring higher than 800 feet .
It is unclear who holds the record for peak anvil altitude .
" The highest one I ever managed was 887 feet , " asserts Jerry Hinton , a Laurel native and eight - time winner of his hometown competition .
" But that was last year .
I think I can it up get over 900 now . "
" It 's kind of like fish stories sometimes , " cautions Columbia resident Mark Bollinger , a former champion in the Traditional division .
" There 's always somebody somewhere that may have gotten it up higher by adding more powder or using a lighter anvil . "
Similarly , there are several theories as to how , when and where anvil shooting originated .
Anvils themselves are among the oldest tools utilized by mankind .
Egyptian hieroglyphics dating back 6,000 years show anvils being used to shape metal .
Anthropologists posit that their use predates humans , as chimpanzees have been observed using logs as anvils on which to crack nuts .
" The anvil is essentially just a surface , " explains Richard Postman , a retired college professor who has authored three books on the history of anvils .
" Anvil simply means something that is stationary that is struck by something else . "
The earliest anvils were crafted from stone , evolving to bronze and later wrought iron .
Today they come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on their purpose and place of origin .
A double - horned style is favored in continental Europe ( and by Wile E. Coyote ) , while the single - horn type that came to prominence in Great Britain is standard in the United States .
There are dozens of anvil brands .
The English - made Peter Wright is the most sought - after by collectors , while others , such as Arm & Hammer , bear familiar names .
The Acme anvils made famous by the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons were actually a generic line of anvils ( and other products ) sold by Sears , Roebuck and Co .
According to Postman , who spent fifteen years researching his 550 - page tome Anvils in America , anvil use in this country peaked in the late nineteenth century , when blacksmiths played a critical role in society .
As large - scale manufacturing was introduced and came to prominence , blacksmiths — and their anvils — became increasingly expendable .
" It 's no coincidence that ' Smith ' is such a common name , " Postman points out .
" Up until about 1930 , everything from forks to sewing needles to axes to wagon wheels was made by a blacksmith .
After that , people did n't go to the blacksmith .
They went to the hardware store and bought the item new . "
But when did folks start blasting their anvils skyward ?
At the Mountain Man Rendezvous , Wilkinson tells the crowd that settlers on the American frontier used the report produced by packing black powder beneath an anvil to imitate cannon fire and ward off Indian attacks .
Southerners , meanwhile , claim the practice evolved during the Civil War , when Union troops attempted to destroy Confederate weapon - making capabilities by blowing up every anvil they encountered .
Postman , though , says the practice dates back further , to the late 1700s : " It goes back to Revolutionary War times .
They 'd fire it mainly for noise :
It really makes a bang for Fourth of July , Christmas — any holiday or celebration . "
These days anvil shooting usually transpires at obscure community festivals .
The Mountain Man Rendezvous has featured an anvil - shooting exhibition for nearly twenty years .
Until recently the town of Millington , Tennessee , hosted a popular anvil - shooting contest at its Goat Days Festival .
The contest in Laurel began at the Jones County Forestry and Wood Products Expo before moving to a private farm .
Despite their shared implement , anvil shooters and contemporary blacksmiths have not forged a common bond .
About a decade ago , the Artists Blacksmith Association of North America , whose membership of 5,000 - plus makes it the largest blacksmiths ' group in the United States , banned the practice because of safety concerns .
" We lost a good six or seven hundred members because of that decision , " says Rome Hutchings , president of the organization .
" The board took action and disavowed several rogue chapters that continued that activity . "
Hutchings can't recall a specific incident or injury that prompted his organization to outlaw anvil shooting , but he heatedly defends the policy .
" It 's dangerous , " he says .
" It 's probably one of the more dangerous things that can be done .
I 've heard reports of anvils coming down on top of people 's cars , anvils flying apart , near misses with human beings .
" It 's really not a sensible thing to do with an anvil . "
The sleepy streets of Farmington are lined with tidy yards and modest bungalows , making it easy to pick out the house that belongs to Gay Wilkinson .
It 's the one with the fake anvil sticking out of the roof .
Located about 70 miles southwest of St. Louis off Highway 67 , Farmington is home to approximately 13,000 citizens , a state prison and a mental hospital .
It is also the undisputed anvil - shooting capital of Missouri , and in that regard Wilkinson is its unofficial ambassador .
The gregarious 58 - year - old was born and reared in the town and elected mayor in 1993 .
His proudest accomplishment during his four - year term was building the municipal rec center , which bears an anvil - shaped plaque engraved with his name .
" Being mayor is kind of how I got involved in [ anvil shooting ] , " he says .
" I could shoot 'em off pretty much anywhere I wanted in the city . "
Wilkinson says he learned about anvil shooting in 1994 , from an elderly local impresario named Tom Sawyer Nichols .
The venerable Nichols was , according to Wilkinson , " a real colorful guy in town , " known for launching anvils to celebrate the Fourth of July and other holidays .
Wilkinson became acquainted with Nichols while shopping at a local gun store , where the latter had posted an ad offering to sell several pounds of gunpowder .
Wilkinson , the proud owner of an antique cannon , a mortar and a collection of assorted handguns , was curious as to why the old guy had explosives on hand .
" I asked my gun shop - owner friend , ' Does he shoot handguns or black - powder rifles or what ? ' "
Wilkinson recalls .
" He said , ' No , he shoots anvils . '
I was like , ' Whoa ! '
I 'd heard of if before , but I did n't know how it worked or what it really was . "
Wilkinson called and inquired about a lesson in anvil shooting .
Nichols obliged and the pair soon struck up a friendship .
The relationship was short - lived .
Nichols passed away a few months after meeting Wilkinson — but not before making a last request of his new pupil : that Wilkinson fire anvils at his funeral .
" Mr. Nichols would say all these great things , like , ' Anvils are like our civil liberties :
You can pound on 'em all you want , but they 're resilient , ' " Wilkinson recalls , adding , " If I 'd have known he was gonna croak , I 'd have recorded it all . "
It 's fair to say that Gay Wilkinson is now anvil obsessed .
His garage is lined with dozens of the objects , in every size , color , material and brand .
He scours the Internet , estate sales and antique stores seeking to expand his collection .
His prize is a massive , 450 - pound antique anvil that he plans to use as his tombstone .
A display in his home is filled with tiny anvils he carved by hand from wood , soapstone and ivory .
" I see anvils in everything , " he confesses .
" My wife has just about had it up to here with it .
She says I have anvils on the brain . "
He has no interest in blacksmithing and says he enjoys the tools purely for their aesthetic value .
" The old ones are all hand forged , " Wilkinson says reverently .
" So no two are alike . "
Which is not to suggest that Wilkinson 's just another hick with an odd hobby .
A respiratory therapist , he heads the respiratory - care department at Mineral Area Regional Hospital , where he has worked for the past 41 years .
" It 's such a spectacular thing , " Wilkinson says of his passion for anvil shooting .
" When you 're physically separating two things with a force like that — it 's quite a cataclysmic event .
You can feel it , hear it , see it and smell it .
It 's quite a sensory experience . "
He mainly shoots anvils on special occasions ( next scheduled launch : his daughter 's wedding ) and at paid appearances , such as the Mountain Man Rendezvous .
He passes out business cards that read : " Have anvils , will travel . "
Beginning in 1996 Wilkinson and his close friend , fellow Farmington native Mark Bollinger , traveled to Mississippi to compete in the National Anvil Shooting Contest .
In his fifth year at the contest , Wilkinson won the Traditional division with a blast of 224 feet .
He has n't been back since .
Each year Gay Wilkinson gives an anvil - shooting demonstration to a group of fourth graders at Farmington Elementary School , as part of the school 's Pioneer Days festival .
One year Noel Barton and his son Dakota were in the audience .
Impressed by the spectacle , the father and son wanted to try their hand at the hobby .
" I seen it , and I practically begged the man to teach me , " Barton says with a thick Missouri drawl .
" He said , ' I do n't want to do it . '
So I went to the source .
I had a little old woman teach me how to shoot , named Ms. Martha Nichols . "
If that surname does n't ring a bell , it ought to : Martha Nichols is none other than the widow of Wilkinson 's former mentor , Tom Sawyer Nichols .
" Mrs. Nichols might have told him about it , " Wilkinson scoffs .
" But he learned it from watching me do it at the Pioneer Days . "
The Barton family soon acquired a set of anvils and immersed themselves in the hobby .
The father - son duo began entering ( and winning ) anvil - shooting competitions , calling themselves " Team Thunder . "
The elder Barton even got a tattoo on his forearm depicting an anvil with an explosion underneath it and flames coming off the top .
" We 'd seen it done , talked to some people and decided it was for us , " says eighteen - year - old Dakota Barton .
" We 're big historian people .
We thought we'd keep it alive — keep the history of it moving along . "
Wilkinson says he quickly came to the conclusion that he wanted nothing to do with the Bartons .
When he heard they were planning a trip to Mississippi to compete in the national contest , he e-mailed a heads - up to that effect to Mike " Shine " Stringer , the event 's cofounder .
" I never heard back , " Wilkinson says .
" I figured they hit it off real good , and I was the turd in the punch bowl . "
According to the Bartons , Wilkinson is correct in that assumption .
Father and son have attended the nationals every year since 2002 .
" We good ol ' boys , " sums up Dakota Barton .
" And we got some good ol ' buddies down there in Mississippi . "
Wilkinson , by contrast , is every inch the gentleman anvil shooter .
He speaks eloquently about politics and frequently jokes about his dislike of country music ( he prefers Pink Floyd and the Beatles ) .
Asked about the differences between him and other hardcore anvil shooters , he chuckles .
" You mean the rednecks ?
Well , I pretty much get along with anybody that tries to get along with me . "
As for Barton , Wilkinson says , " He can do what he wants .
I 'm not going to stop him from shooting anvils .
I 'm not the anvil police . "
That 's dandy with Noel Barton .
" There 's reasons why I do n't like him , but you 're talking about personal shit instead of anvil shooting .
I just do n't like the man .
I have no use for him .
Bottom line . "
Other than competitions , Barton says , he shoots anvils primarily at motorcycle rallies .
" The bikers love it , " he says .
" I do n't know why — it 's just something about blowing shit up . "
Barton says he and Dakota host anvil - shooting fundraisers for local organizations , including one earlier this month for Bismarck High School .
Spectators , he explains , pin paper plates to the ground around the anvil launch site and then bet on which plate they think the anvil will land on , with half the pot donated to charity .
" It 's called anvil bingo , " Barton says proudly .
" And it 's just about the craziest thing you 've ever seen ! "
This year , for the first time in more than two decades , there will be no National Anvil Shooting contest in Laurel , Mississippi , owing to the death of the competition 's cofounder and host , Stringer .
A legend among anvil shooters and the acknowledged originator of super - modified anvil shooting , Stringer succumbed to lung cancer in September at age 63 .
" As far as I know of , there wo n't be another competition , " confirms Jerry Hinton , a friend ( and competitor ) of Stringer from Laurel .
" Unless there are some people out there that want to build something new and get together and have one .
For now I 'm just going to keep doing demonstrations and benefit shoots . "
Beyond Stringer , several other competitive anvil shooters have either died or given up the pursuit in recent years , causing the remaining anvil aficionados to worry that their hobby may be going the way of the blacksmith .
" Something needs to happen to get it revived a little bit , " Mark Bollinger says .
" You got to keep the history of it alive .
That 's one thing Tom Sawyer Nichols impressed upon Gay [ Wilkinson ] and I , is that you do n't just go out and shoot .
You have to talk about how this has been used at celebrations and inaugurations — that the anvil is a metaphor for our nation 's strength and resilience . "
One of the biggest hurdles facing a would - be anvil shooter is the cost of the setup .
Only old - fashioned forged anvils ( i.e. , those made prior to the 1950s ) can be used for traditional anvil shooting ; the modern varieties , which are cast rather than forged , have seams and can split during the explosion .
Not only are the antiques hard to come by — thousands were melted down as scrap during World War II — but they can be prohibitively expensive .
According to historian Richard Postman , anvils used to sell for a dollar per pound .
Recently , though , the price has soared to six times that or more .
That makes a pair of 100 - pound anvils — it takes two for a traditional launch — a substantial investment .
Acquiring an anvil suitable for super - modified shooting is even trickier .
Withstanding the significant force produced by the gunpowder blast requires a specially engineered anvil , and enthusiasts tend to be cagy when it comes to where and how they obtained their " shooting irons . "
" The anvil I shoot is custom made out of highest - malleability steel there is — it will bend before it will break , " boasts Bollinger .
" I 'd never tell anybody where it came from .
There 's liability and whatever — when it was given to me , it was kind of like , ' You 'll find this anvil in your vehicle tomorrow . '
I do n't think anybody wants to be responsible for it . "
There 's also the murky question of whether anvil shooting is legal .
Mike O'Connell , a spokesman for the Missouri Department of Public Safety , says he is unaware of any state laws that expressly prohibit anvil shooting .
Still , notes O'Connell : " There may be local ordinances that would bar this activity in a particular community . "
The practice could easily fall under the umbrella of disturbing the peace , i.e. , " Anything that unreasonably disturbs or alarms another person or persons , " he says .
" I 'm not familiar with this activity , " O'Connell adds .
" But it sounds like it would certainly get someone 's attention . "
Critics of anvil shooting , including Blacksmiths Association president Rome Hutchings , wonder why lawmakers have never tackled the issue .
" I just do n't understand how states and counties and municipal governments can be totally oblivious to this , " Hutchings marvels .
" I would n't be too opposed , if people had to be licensed for this kind of activity . "
" It 's dangerous , " seconds Ken Jansen , president of the Blacksmiths Association of Missouri .
" You 're lofting anywhere from a 70 - to 100 - pound hunk of steel in the air , and there 's no way to tell where it 's coming down . "
Experienced shooters maintain that the falling anvil is the least of their worries .
The most hazardous part of the process , they argue , is loading the gunpowder prior to liftoff .
" We 've never had anybody hurt , but you could go out tomorrow and pack that powder and get a freak spark and blow your face off , " says eight - time Super Modified champ Jerry Hinton .
" It does n't have anything to do with an anvil coming down on top of somebody . "
At the Mountain Man Rendezvous , Wilkinson demonstrates for the audience how he ensures that an anvil will land close to its launching point .
He drops two circular steel plates to serve as a sturdy base , then sets a level on top of them to make sure they 're parallel to the ground .
" You do n't want it to be too perfect , " Wilkinson explains .
" Otherwise the top anvil could come back down and land on the bottom one and cause some serious damage .
It 's pretty hard to tear up an anvil , but that 'll do it . "
Launching pad suitably prepared , Wilkinson packs his anvils with black powder and seals them shut in the traditional manner .
" Anybody know what brand of peanut butter this is ? " he asks rhetorically .
" It 's Peter Pan .
It flies higher than Jif . "
Just before the moment of truth , a woman in the crowd turns to leave .
" Do n't go anywhere , ma'am , " Wilkinson says .
" You 're going to want to see this . "
" I dunno , I heard it 's kind of loud , " she replies .
" Oh , it is ! " Wilkinson grins .
" But that 's where the fun is . "
Creepy , Crazy , and Strange Japanese Toys
While Asia has its share of weird and unusual toys , Japan takes the lead in inventing the truly bizarre items .
From ‘ Road Kill Cat ’ to a legless woman , here are some of creepy toys that are too weird , even for Halloween .
This one is for folks who downplay the usefulness of the ‘ Cat went to Aunt ’s farm ’ cover story for a pet ’s death .
And , while it might be argued that this is a odd collectible aimed at a niche adult audience , the cartoon image of a child ’s face is a disturbing giveaway about the target audience .
For those who wish for a sneak peek at female Golems and Swamp Creatures , there is a keychain that reveals all .
The obscure image of two entangled bodies on the cardboard bit imply that this might be ‘ collect 2 and create a third ’ type of deal .
Pranksters who crave truly original tricks will be pleased with this ‘ Baby in a Mircowave ’ toy .
Given that the determined expression on the cartoon doesn”t match the mortified look on the doll , critics might argue that the artist and the inventor harbored different ideas about this toy .
This grotesque toy depicting an impaled woman is possibly intended for fans of tentacle - related manga .
Failing that , these toys are probably traps intended to pinpoint the Patrick Bateman types of the world .
The next toy , consisting of several dismembered body parts , caters to the folks who dream about creating their own zombie toy .

Rooks appear to have a better understanding of how gravity works than do chimps and babies under 6 months old .
A common way of finding out whether animals and babies understand complex concepts is to show them images of impossible events .
The rationale is that viewers spend longer looking at those which defy their expectations , presumably as they try to work out what ’s going on .
Chris Bird of the University of Cambridge and Nathan Emery of Queen Mary , University of London , showed rooks computer - generated images , half of which were impossible according to the laws of gravity , such as an egg floating in mid-air above a table .
Almost without exception , the rooks spent more time looking at the “ impossible ” images than the possible ones .
They also took more second glances .
The responses were the same when the “ familiar ” egg shape was replaced by a cork , proving the birds ’ insight applied equally to any object , familiar or not .
The researchers say the result is consistent with rooks being able to solve complex problems from knowledge of cause and effect , rather than by trial and error .

Chimp beaters
“ The results illustrate the richness of the information processing underlying bird behaviour , and especially corvid behaviour , ” says Alex Kacelnik , who studies corvid intelligence at the University of Oxford .
“ The team used a very elegant procedure to detect whether rooks form expectations regarding the action of gravity . ”
But Kacelnik said he was surprised that chimpanzees “ failed ” the same test .
“ It could be that chimps may respect gravity but fail to infer its presence in a virtual scene between external objects , but I also find this a striking inability , ” he says .
In other recent experiments , researchers have shown that crows can use simple tools in sequence to obtain food rewards , and can even use tools in the wild .
They ’ve also shown their ability to use tools to stop rewards falling into a hole , something great apes were unable to master .
Rooks , meanwhile , can collaborate together to solve problems , and scrub jays appear to be able to undertake “ mental time travel ” .

Hidden Lyrics in the Keynote Icon
The Keynote Icon contains the lyrics to ” The Bitch of Living Lyrics ” by John Gallagher Jr. & Boys .
Why is it in Keynote ?
Ken Drake , who first decoded the icon , notes that the song was given away as a free iTunes sampler in January 2007 .
Perhaps the designer just liked the song ?
Others have noted that the song is sung in the musical Spring Awakening to “ express frustrations , motivations , and desires directly to the audience . ”
Keynote , audience ?
Er , yeah , does n’t make sense to me either .
Here ’s how the song goes :
“ God , I dreamed there was an angel , Who could hear me through the wall As I cried out - like , in Latin “ This is so not life at all Help me out - out - of this nightmare ”
Then I heard her silver call -
She said : “ Just give it time , kid I come to one and all ”
She said : “ Give me that hand , please And the itch you ca n’t control Let me teach you how to handle
All the sadness in your soul Oh , we ’ll work that silver magic
Then we ’ll aim it at the wall ”
She said : “ Love may make you blind kid - But I would n’t mind at all ”
It ’s the bitch of living ( Bitch , just a bitch )
With nothing but your hand ( Just a bitch , yeah )
Just the bitch of living As someone you ca n’t stand See , each night , it ’s like fantastic - Tossing , turning , without rest …
Windows PC and Jar Launcher
When browsing a network , this is the icon for a Windows PC — an old , beige CRT monitor with the Blue Screen of Death .
Pundit Anil Dash said it was arrogant , ugly and smug .
The icon for Jar Launcher , an app for loading Java files , contains real code .
Address Book and Safari
Look at the detail of these two icons .
You can almost feel the faux - leather texture of Address Book ’s cover ; and I like the way Safari includes the minutes of the compass and the American continent in the background .
Audo MIDI Setup and Time Machine
Here are two more nicely detailed icons : look at the LCD screen of the MIDI Setup app — you can see the outline of the LED bars .
And dig the Star Wars hyperspace effect in Time Machine .
iTunes , Aperture and Mail
These three icons make rare direct references to Apple .
The Aperture icon says “ Designed by Apple in California , ” the tag line used on many of the company ’s products .
The Mail app includes a postmark that says , “ Hello from Cupertino , CA . ” — the location of Apple ’s headquarters .
And in the iTunes icon , look at the middle of the CD spindle .
It says : “ iTunes 7 ” and “ Apple 2006 . ”
Dashboard , Expose and Numbers
These three icons make good use of reflections and transparency .
Look at Numbers icon .
See the reflections in the blue and green columns ?
These are invisible at anything but the largest icon size .
Manic Steve Jobsian - attention to detail , or Apple ’s fantastic sweating - every - detail ?
I say the latter .
LAST week Ben Bernanke appeared before Congress , setting off a discussion over whether the president should reappoint him as chairman of the Federal Reserve when his term ends next January .
Mr. Bernanke deserves to be reappointed .
Both the conventional and unconventional decisions made by this scholar of the Great Depression prevented the Great Recession of 2008 - 2009 from turning into the Great Depression 2.0 .
Mr. Bernanke understands that in the Great Depression , the collapse of the money supply and the lack of monetary stimulus during contractions worsened the country ’s economic free fall .
This lesson has paid off .
Mr. Bernanke ’s decision to keep interest rates low and encourage lending has , for now , averted the L - shaped near depression that seemed highly likely after the financial collapse last fall .
To be sure , an endorsement of Mr. Bernanke ’s reappointment comes with many caveats .
Mr. Bernanke , a Fed governor in the early part of this decade , supported flawed policies when Alan Greenspan pushed the federal funds rate ( the policy rate set by the Fed as its main tool of monetary policy ) too low for too long and failed to monitor mortgage lending properly , thus creating the housing and credit and mortgage bubbles .

Vivienne Flesher
He and the Fed made three major mistakes when the subprime mortgage crisis began .
First , he kept arguing that the housing recession would bottom out soon ( it has not bottomed out even three years later ) .
Second , he argued that the subprime problem was a contained problem when in reality it was a symptom of the biggest leverage and credit bubble in American history .
Third , he argued that the collapse in the housing market would not lead to a recession , even though about one - third of jobs created in the latest economic recovery were directly or indirectly related to housing .
Mr. Bernanke ’s analysis was mistaken in several other important ways .
He argued that monetary policy should not be used to control asset bubbles .
He attributed the large United States current account deficits to a savings glut in China and emerging markets , understating the role that excessive fiscal deficits and debt accumulation by American households and the financial system played .
From the press release we 're sending out this morning :
" On Tuesday , August 4 , GEICO instructed its ad buying service to redistribute its inventory of rotational spots on FOX - TV to their other network programs , exclusive of the Glenn Beck program , " said a spokesperson for GEICO Corporate Communications in an email to ColorOfChange.org .
" As of August 4 , GEICO no longer runs any paid advertising spots during Mr. Beck 's program . "
" We applaud GEICO and all of the other companies who have stepped forward to pull their ads from Glenn Beck , " said James Rucker , executive director of ColorOfChange.org .
" Beck 's rhetoric is dangerous to the fabric of our democracy , and we are heartened that so many big companies feel the same way .
We wo n't stop here -- we 're going to continue our fight to see that as many of Beck ’s advertisers pull their support as possible . "
We 're making incredible progress .
As Glenn Beck 's advertisers learn of his hateful rhetoric , and how deeply it concerns thousands of organized people across the country , they 're deciding that they do n't want their companies associated with Beck 's divisive fear - mongering .
If you have n't already signed our petition to Beck 's advertisers , please do , and please ask your friends and family to do the same ( there 's a sample email you can send them here ) .
We 're going to keep reaching out to Beck 's remaining advertisers , and we 'll keep you posted on ways you can help keep the pressure on .
Thanks so much for your support -- we could n't do this without you .
First Ashes Test , Cardiff ( day five ) : England 435 & 252- 9 drew with Australia 674- 6 declared
Match scorecard Panesar and Anderson were England 's heroes on Sunday
By Oliver Brett
Paul Collingwood hit a valiant 74 and England 's last - wicket pair defied Australia for 40 minutes to clinch a draw in the first Ashes Test .
England , 20 - 2 overnight , lost three further wickets inside 90 minutes but somehow clung on in the final stages .
Collingwood 's innings lasted 245 balls - five hours and 43 minutes in all .
Then , amid scenes of high tension , with every dot ball roared by a capacity crowd , James Anderson and Monty Panesar kept Australia 's spinners at bay .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Collingwood 's was a display of grisly determination , which put the efforts of other players in the top order sharply into perspective .
But with 50 minutes to go in the match , and England still a tantalising six runs away from making Australia bat again , the Durham man played probably his first risky shot .
TOM FORDYCE BLOG Paul Collingwood - 9 . Hung around with immense determination
Tom rates England 's players Attempting to steer Peter Siddle wide of point for four he instead hit the ball high to the fielder .
Michael Hussey parried a catch above his head , before taking it - agonisingly - at the second opportunity .
It seemed now , with Panesar coming out to join Anderson , that England would lose in heart - breaking fashion .
But the last man refused to be an easy target , and when Anderson squirted Siddle down to third man for four , England had a precious lead .
Significantly , that meant England did not have to bat until the 1850 BST cut - off .
They just had to get past 1840 , which meant facing around three overs fewer .
Australia captain Ricky Ponting , who seemed to underbowl his hugely impressive swing bowler Ben Hilfenhaus , gave the final few overs to the two off - spinners Nathan Hauritz and Marcus North .
But Hauritz , though he had bowled brilliantly earlier in the day when he took three significant wickets , was by now tired and North was not a danger to two vastly improved tail - enders .
Anderson and Panesar defied the odds to frustrate Australia
When the clock ticked past 1840 BST , an excitable crowd knew that Hauritz was bowling the last over .
Anderson survived his 53rd delivery - Panesar had hung around for 35 - and the ground saluted a famous result .
Dreadful batting earlier in the day had seemed to ensure that anything other than an Australian win would be extremely unlikely .
Kevin Pietersen , Andrew Strauss and Matt Prior all had only themselves to blame by getting dismissed in the first hour and a half .
Pietersen left a straight ball before Strauss and Prior played cross - batted attacking shots at balls that could have been safely ignored .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
The first wicket of the morning fell in only the fourth over .
Pietersen had already left one Hilfenhaus delivery that went straight on , the ball flicking his pad as he survived an lbw appeal .
But he did not learn the lesson , again pulling out of a forward defensive - and the ball flattened the stumps .
Ponting wasted little time in bringing Hauritz into the attack , and Hauritz wasted little time in bringing about the next huge blow to England 's ambitions of salvation .
Strauss followed up one square cut off the spinner for four by attempting a repeat next ball and nicking it straight into Brad Haddin 's gloves .
It was a depressing way for the captain to get out and he lingered at the crease for several seconds .
The message did not seem to be getting through to the others , as Prior soon aimed an outrageous attempted slash outside off - stump at Peter Siddle - and missed .
Collingwood played superbly before falling on 74 Meanwhile Hauritz was bowling really well , finding drift , bounce and varied amounts of turn .
Collingwood was making him look like Muttiah Muralitharan on a particularly good day , but at least he was surviving , just - despite almost giving short - leg a catch and having to trap a delivery with his boot as it ricocheted towards his stumps .
Prior , on the other hand , persisted with risky cuts , and eventually edged one to slip .
England were surely staring at a massive defeat , but Collingwood was at last playing with some sort of fluency and in Andrew Flintoff - who scored a century to save a Test in Antigua in 2004 - finally found a partner whose mind was not completely riddled with uncertainty .
They took England to 102 - 5 at lunch , still 137 behind , with Collingwood on 35 and Flintoff 11 .
But things started to look dicey again soon after the interval when Hilfenhaus , in bright sunshine , got the ball to swing in both directions - something that bemused the England dressing - room balcony given the travails of the home team 's bowlers .
Collingwood 's tenacity continued - he did not mind having to wait 45 minutes to advance his score after lunch .
But Flintoff never completely settled , and his 23 - over stay at the crease was finally ended when he edged a delivery from Mitchell Johnson that did nothing untoward , and the catch was taken low down at second slip .
Nathan Hauritz and Ricky Ponting saw the Aussies come so close
After narrowly surviving a desperately close lbw appeal first ball , Stuart Broad produced a determined effort , showing up many of the specialist batsmen in the side , but failed to get through to tea .
Playing back to Hauritz when perhaps he might have chosen to go forward he was pinned lbw on middle stump .
Next , Graeme Swann did his best to play doughty sidekick to Collingwood , and he batted until tea and for an hour beyond - initially weathering a ferocious over from Siddle in which he was hit twice by bouncers , requiring the physio each time .
When the new ball failed to provide an immediate breakthrough - Hilfenhaus bowled beautifully , Johnson waywardly - there was genuine hope that the match could be drawn .
But with 19 overs left in the day , Swann went for a pull shot off Hilfenhaus , the ball kept a little low , and he was out lbw , leaving Australia just two wickets away from victory .
The tension cranked up another gear as Anderson became the next batsman to play a courageous hand , and gradually England moved closer to the score they had to reach to make the Aussies bat again .
When Collingwood fell to Siddle , England fans were briefly silenced , but when the match finished in glorious sunshine they left Test cricket 's newest venue with a lot of pleasant memories - even if it was " only " a draw .

Would you like to learn How to Make Turkish Coffee ?
It ’s such a unique drink from its cooking method to the serving and drinking .
You will love that smell spreading in your house when making this easy Turkish coffee recipe .
I must warn you though :
It is addictive !
What is Turkish coffee
The first thing we need to clarify is that Turkey does n’t have its own coffee beans .
Arabic coffee beans are finely ground and used for coffee making .
It ’s more of cooking rather than brewing .
While the term Turkish coffee refers to the preparing method of coffee , I must tell you that it does n’t look like your regular coffee beans .
It is so finely ground that you might think it is cocoa powder when you first see it .
The ground coffee is combined with water and sugar ( optional ) in a special coffee pot called cezve or ibrik and simmered over the lowest heat or traditionally on hot sand .
You end up with a thick and frothy coffee which has a strong aroma .
It is served in traditional small Turkish coffee cups with a lot of foams on the top .
It is significant to be able to have enough amount of foams , which shows how much you know the art of coffee making .
As for the serving , Turkish coffee has its own traditional way .
It is always served with a glass of water and something sweet like Turkish delights or chocolate on the side .
Related : Homemade Turkish Delight Recipe
From grinding to cooking and serving this coffee , it ’s like a special ceremony .
This special drink is a way of socializing for Turkish people .
It is mostly enjoyed following a good meal .
Unlike Turkish Tea , Turkish coffee is considered as a way of spoiling yourself or your guests .
Tips For Good Quality Turkish Coffee
Traditionally , buying the coffee from your local coffee shop is recommended because they are freshly ground there .
However , there are still some tips to understand whether it is really fresh and good quality .
The first thing that is a sign of good quality is the smell of the coffee .
If it has a strong smell that makes you feel in heaven , it is a good one .
If you can hardly feel the irresistible smell , it is likely to be stale , which will result in a tasteless coffee when you make it .
Another tip to understand how fresh your ground coffee is that getting some in your hand and see whether the pieces stick one another .
Fresh coffee never sticks and it is wonderfully crumbly .
Finally , when you are drinking the coffee , you should be feeling that heavenly aroma .
If you feel a watery taste , the coffee is not good quality or it is stale .
If you are asking a good Turkish coffee brand , I would suggest Kurukahveci Mehmet Efendi .
They are a world famous coffee brand , so you can find them at online shopping markets .
How To Store Ground Coffee
It is important to store ground coffee in the right way so that it keeps its texture and aroma .
Tips to keep in mind when storing your coffee :
Store it in a dry and cool place that is away from sunlight .
Keep it in an airtight container or in a glass jar with a tight lid .
Never leave a metal spoon in the container .
Do n’t keep it in the opened package .
Air causes your ground coffee to get stale fast .
Transfer it in an airtight container .
Turkish Coffee Ingredients
It is a super easy coffee recipe with two or three ingredients .
You need :
water
ground coffee
sugar , optional
How to Make Turkish Coffee In Pot
It is very easy to make this coffee in a Turkish coffee pot at home when you follow these easy steps .
First , mix coffee and water .
Using a teaspoon , mix your finely ground coffee with cold water in a Turkish Coffee pot , gently until well combined .
The ratio for a desired consistency is 1 coffee cup cold water and 2 teaspoons ground coffee .
If you want your coffee sweet , add sugar along with coffee and water .
Never add it after your coffee is cooked .
You always need to ask your guests how sweet they like their coffee .
Possible options are as follows :
unsweetened ( no sugar added )
with little sugar ( add ½ cube sugar )
a bit sweeter ( add 1 cube sugar )
super sweet ( add 2 cubes sugar )
The measurement here is for one coffee cup .
If you are making coffee for more than one person and everyone has different sugar liking , make their coffee separately .
Second , place the coffee pot on low heat and let it cook for a while , stirring gently two or three times .
When it is right about to boil and foams rise , remove it from heat .
Using a teaspoon , share the foams into each Turkish coffee cup .
Return to heat and remove when it boils .
Pour the coffee into the cups .
How To Make Turkish Coffee Without An Ibrik
Turkish coffee pot called Ibrik or cezve is the ideal pot to make this special coffee .
It is traditionally made of copper but stainless steel , ceramic or even glass pots are also common today .
Do n’t worry if you do n’t have a traditional cezve or ibrik .
A small saucepan work fine as well .
The smaller , the better .
If you are using a large saucepan and making the coffee for two , you wo n’t have enough foams .
On the other hand , if you are making it for 6 - 7 coffee cups , you will manage to get the foams .
If you are after an easier and quicker way , you can definitely use a Turkish coffee maker .
There are several brands and types with a wide range of prices , but a simple one like Tefal coffee maker will be enough for foamy coffee .
Tips On The Best Turkish Coffee Recipe
There are some tips for making your coffee both with enough foams on the top and with the desired consistency :
Use freshly ground coffee .
If your coffee is not fresh and sits in your pantry for months , it does n’t foam .
To keep your coffee fresh after you open the package , store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator .
If your coffee is not fresh and sits in your pantry for months , it does n’t foam .

Never try to make it with warm or hot water .
Mix the coffee , water and sugar ( if you are using any ) in the pot gently until combined .
Do n’t mix it fast .
Always treat your coffee kindly .
Cook your coffee on the lowest heat , stirring two or three times until it starts to rise .
Never let it boil .
Remove it right before it boils and share the foams into the cups , using a teaspoon .
, stirring two or three times until it starts to rise .
Never let it boil .
Remove it right before it boils and share the foams into the cups , using a teaspoon .
After reheating the coffee , pour it slowly into the cups so that the bubbles remain safe .
Can I Make It With Milk ?
Traditionally , Turkish coffee is known for its strong aroma , so it ’s never made with milk .
However , I remember mom would make it with milk for me when I was a kid just like several moms do for kids .
So use milk only to give it a mild taste , but do n’t expect it to be frothy then .
Why Is It Served With Water ?
It is always served with a glass of water on the side .
That is because you need to prepare your palate for the coffee .
Traditionally you drink water first and then coffee to feel the maximum aroma of it .
You can put a thin slice of apple or rose petal into your water to give it a subtle aroma .
Turkish Coffee Reading
The ceremony does n’t end even after you finish your coffee .
Although it ’s not necessary , most Turkish people place the saucer on top of the cup , make their wish and turn it upside down .
It is left to cool .
Sometimes a golden ring is placed on the top to make it cool faster .
It is ready when the cup is cool enough .
Whoever is talented in coffee reading gets the cup carefully and interprets the symbols in the cup .
While most people do this just for fun , there are people who are known as the master of fortune telling .
I ’ve never tried to read it because the only things I see in the cups are no more than animal shapes .
Lol !

As I posted earlier today , the Electronic Commerce Protection Act comes to a conclusion in committee on Monday as MPs conduct their " clause by clause " review .
While I have previously written about the lobbying pressure to water down the legislation ( aided and abetted by the Liberal and Bloc MPs on the committee ) and the CMA 's recent effort to create a huge loophole , I have not focused on a key source of the pressure .
Incredibly , it has been the copyright lobby – particularly the software and music industries – that has been engaged in a full court press to make significant changes to the bill .
The copyright lobby 's interest in the bill has been simmering since its introduction , with lobbyists attending the committee hearings and working with Liberal and Bloc MPs to secure changes .
The two core concerns arise from fears that the bill could prevent surreptitious use of DRM and block enforcement initiatives that might involve accessing users ' personal computers without their permission .
The DRM concern arises from a requirement in the bill to obtain consent before installing software programs on users ' computers .
This anti-spyware provision applies broadly , setting an appropriate standard of protection for computer users .
Yet the copyright lobby fears it could inhibit installation of DRM - type software without full knowledge and consent .
Sources say that the Liberals have introduced a motion that would take these practices outside of the bill .
In its place , they would define computer program as , among other things , " a program that has as its primary function … inducing a user to install software by intentionally misrepresenting that installing that software is necessary to safeguard security or privacy or to open or play content of a computer program . "
This sets such a high bar – primary function , intentional mispresentation – that music and software industry can plausibly argue that surreptitious DRM installations fall outside of C - 27 .
Even more troubling are proposed changes that would allow copyright owners to secretly access information on users ' computers .
PIPEDA currently features a series of exceptions to the standard requirements for obtaining consent for the collection of personal information ( found in Section 7 ) .
Bill C - 27 includes a provision that bars those exceptions in cases involving computer harvesting of email addresses and the " collection of personal information through any means of telecommunication , if the collection is made by accessing a computer system or causing a computer system to be accessed without authorization . "
In other words , email harvesting and spyware would not be permitted and would not qualify for the PIPEDA exceptions found in Section 7 .
The copyright lobby is deeply concerned that this change will block attempts to track possible infringement through electronic means .
The Section 7 ( 1 ) ( b ) exception in PIPEDA currently states that collecting personal information without consent or knowledge of the individual is permitted if it is reasonable to expect that the collection " would compromise the availability or accuracy of the information " and the collection is " related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada . "
One can well imagine how this exception could be used for investigations targeting the violation of a user agreement or alleged copyright infringement .
With the changes in C - 27 , the exception would no longer apply to harvesting email addresses or to accessing personal information on computers without authorization .
For the copyright lobby , this would block investigations that involve capturing user information on computers without knowledge or consent .
In response , sources advise that the Liberals have tabled a motion that would exclude Section 7 ( 1 ) ( b ) from C - 27 – effectively restoring the exception in these circumstances .
On top of these provisions , sources say the Liberals have also tabled motions to extend the exemptions for telecom providers .
The bill currently includes an exemption for telecom providers where they act as intermediaries in the transmission of a spam message ( Section 6 ( 6 ) of the bill ) .
This obviously makes sense as telecom providers should not be treated as the message sender when they are merely the messenger .
Yet there is a proposed motion that would also create an exception for telecom providers to the requirement to obtain express consent before users install programs on their computers .
It states that the section does not apply to telecom providers providing a telecom service , which is defined to include :
" providing computer security , user account management , routing and transmission of messages , diagnostics , technical support , repair , network management , network maintenance , authorized updates of software or system firmware , authorized remote system management , and detection or prevention of the unauthorized , fraudulent or illegal use of a network , service , or computer software , including scanning for and removing computer programs "
These proposed changes are simply outrageous and it is disappointing that the Liberals have brought forward motions on behalf of the lobby in this manner .
With the hearing on Monday , it is critical for Canadians to speak out – yet again – to ensure that C - 27 does not leave the door open to private surreptitious surveillance .
Write to Industry Minister Tony Clement , your MP , or the members of the Industry Committee today asking them to reject these changes .
The members of the committee include :
The recent American Consumer Survey had some thought provoking data regarding the typical American household .
Wages over the past decade have been stagnant .
At least that is what is propagated in the common datasets but in reality , not only has income not grown it has actually declined .
The U.S. dollar during this time has been crushed as well .
So incomes moving in a horizontal fashion may appear to be steady for Americans , but in reality the purchasing power has fallen due to inflation ( not recently ) and the declining dollar .
Think of the rising cost of housing , healthcare , food , and automobiles .
In the last decade , even after the housing bust , prices are still higher yet incomes still lag .
Americans leveraged debt in this decade to make up for their lost purchasing power .
Access to debt is now being limited .
But let us first look at a crucial aspect of the typical household that seems to be missing from the mainstream financial press , household incomes :
This is the latest data we have and we should spend some time on the above chart .
20 percent of American households make more than $ 100,000 per year .
The median income is $ 52,029 .
In other words over 56,500,000 households make due with $ 52,029 or less per year .
This is the average American consumer and also helps to explain why things are still in a troubled state .
I put together a budget before for someone making the median income and given the updated income figure , things have n’t changed much .
Keep in mind the above data reflects the 2008 year .
A troubled year no doubt , but we have yet to factor in the increased unemployment brought about in 2009 .
This data will be reflected in September of 2010 and we already know that incomes are going to fall yet again .
With 27,000,000 Americans unemployed or underemployed , we know the recession is deep and pervasive .
But what is usually missed , is even the employed in those 56.5 million households are struggling with rising costs of healthcare and education .
Housing costs may be going down but not because of a healthy economy .
What we are seeing is debt destruction .
Now try to factor this out with a real world budget :
We ’ll go with the state of Georgia just as an example .
After taxes the median household is netting roughly $ 3,200 per month .
In August , the median home price in the United States came in at $ 177,700 .
Now run the numbers on a FHA insured loan here with a 3.5 % down payment :
Home Price : $ 177,700
Down payment : $ 6,219.50
30 Year Mortgage Amount : $ 171,480.50
PITI : $ 1,235
We ’ll leave aside the $ 8,000 tax credit for the moment .
So let us run a simulation on this budget since this on the face seems to workout :
Before you start picking the budget apart , keep in mind this is only a sample .
If you look around your own neighborhood , how many people do you see with two relatively new cars ?
A flat screen TV ?
Designer clothes ?
The above budget does n’t allow for that .
And that is why we are seeing bankruptcies also rising in the current environment .
The spending was done outside of the budget via credit cards and other forms of revolving and non-revolving debt .
Credit card companies are quickly jacking up fees , putting onerous terms , and decreasing credit available to a consumer that is losing income .
You can see how quickly things can get out of hand .
Take for example the budget above .
What happens if one spouse loses their job ?
The net income will fall but expenses will stay the same most of the time .
Or what about a medical emergency ?
One night in a hospital can wipe out one or two years of an emergency fund without insurance and millions fall in this category .
What if the car busts the transmission ?
There goes $ 2,000 .
Things can escalate quickly without access to the easy debt machine that hid a decade of lost income .
But a sector that did do well in this time is the financial sector :
Source : New York Times
The financial sector has cannibalized a large part of our economy .
After decades of bubbles and mismanagement , what have they left the average American with aside of the mountains of debt ?
We have $ 3.5 trillion in commercial real estate debt to contend with .
Household net worth in the U.S. has fallen by over $ 12 trillion since this crisis started .
It is hard to see what benefit the financial sector has brought to the typical American family .
It gave people the illusion of wealth through debt but as we are now seeing , is quickly taking it away via bankruptcies , foreclosures , and yanking credit cards away .
I agree that many Americans over spent and now many are paying the price .
But what price does Wall Street pay ?
In fact , they are rewarded with bailouts .
The notion that things are getting better is hard to understand .
If we mean that things are better because Wall Street is up , then yes , things are better .
But jobs are still not on the horizon and most people associate employment with a healthy economy :
During this earning season what is rarely reported is that the jump in profits with many companies is coming from one time inventory replenishment and also , by cutting your largest cost .
Employees .
Look at the above chart .
For every job opening you have six people trying to fill it .
And job openings are below levels at the start of the decade and we have more people in raw numbers plus , we have the 27 million unemployed and underemployed Americans .
Just to replenish the lost jobs since December of 2007 we would need to find 8 million jobs .
Even if we added 150,000 jobs per month starting in November ( not happening ) it would take us over 4 years just to get back to where we were at the start of the recession .
Even after all the debt destruction , household debt is still weighing like an albatross on the American household balance sheet :
The above chart is important because it shows the stickiness of debt .
That is , unemployment has been going up since December of 2007 but debt goes down slowly .
The amount of workers in the U.S. economy is seeing a sort of lost decade .
But look at the financial obligations above .
We are only back to 2005 levels .
The bubble started much further back .
Why is that ?
As we now know , a foreclosure takes a very long time while being laid off can happen in one day .
Those mortgage payments keep coming in while the income from work is cut off .
It is n’t like the mortgage suddenly adjusts to reflect the real economy .
The obligation is still there .
So is the auto payment .
And the credit card bill and everything else .
So debt that was once seen as a supplement to income is now a massive drain on your monthly balance sheet .
Just looking at this data I ’m not convinced of this job less recovery .
We are still losing jobs at a rate of 3 million per year .
In fact , just to keep at a normal pace we need to be creating 150,000 jobs per month .
Until we get there , the average American is going to feel this as the deep recession that it is .

Even with a relatively limited set of options in CSS , typography can vary tremendously using pure CSS syntax .
Serif or sans - serif ?
Large or small font ?
Line height , spacing , font size and padding …
The list goes on and on .
[ Links checked February / 09/2017 ]
To find typographic design patterns that are common in modern Web design and to resolve some common typographic issues , we conducted extensive research on 50 popular websites on which typography matters more than usual ( or at least should matter more than usual ) .
We ’ve chosen popular newspapers , magazines and blogs as well as various typography - related websites .
We ’ve carefully analyzed their typography and style sheets and searched for similarities and differences .
We have also put together a spreadsheet of the study that displays the websites ’ various values ( for example , the ratio between the line height and line length ) .
Ultimately , we identified 13 general typographic problems and issues related to typographic design and tried to find answers to them through our research :
How popular are serif and sans - serif typefaces in body copy and headlines ?
Which fonts are used most frequently ?
What is the average font size ?
What is the average ratio between the font size of headlines and body copy ?
What is the average line height of body copy ?
What is the average ratio between line height and font size in body copy ?
What is the average ratio between line height and line length in body copy ?
What is the average amount of spacing between paragraphs ?
What is the average ratio of paragraph spacing to line height in body copy ?
How are links styled ?
How many characters per line are common in body copy ?
How often are links underlined ?
How often is font replacement ( sIFR , etc. ) used ?
We ended up with solid data , which we evaluated and prepared for this article .
Based on the statistics , we have identified several “ rules of thumb ” for working with type .
Please note that these rules can often , but not always , be considered best practice .
1. Serif vs. Sans-serif
Whether designers should use serif or sans - serif fonts for body copy is one of the most discussed and unresolved questions about typesetting on the Web .
Some designers prefer to give their headlines serifs ( which are short , decorative lines at the end of letter strokes ) to give them more appeal .
The main reason to choose a serif font for your headlines is that , at a large size , serif fonts are easy to read and look great .
The contrast between a serif font for headlines and a sans - serif font for body copy can be interesting , too .
Some designers prefer serif fonts for body copy because they believe the lines at the end of letter strokes help guide readers from one letter to the next , making scanning and reading more comfortable .
According to our study , sans - serif fonts are still more popular than serif fonts for headlines , although they seem to have dropped in popularity in recent years .
60 % of websites use sans - serif typefaces for headlines , mostly Arial , Verdana , Lucida Grande and Helvetica .
Among them : CNN , ArsTechnica , Slate , BBC and NewScientist .
Only 34 % of websites use a serif typeface for body copy .
Among them : New York Times , Typographica , Time , AIGA and Newsweek .
The most popular serif typefaces for headlines are Georgia ( 28 % ) and Baskerville ( 4 % ) .
The most popular serif typefaces for body copy are Georgia ( 32 % ) and Times New Roman ( 4 % ) .
The most popular sans - serif typefaces for headlines are Arial ( 28 % ) , Helvetica ( 20 % ) and Verdana ( 8 % ) .
The most popular sans - serif typefaces for body copy are Arial ( 28 % ) , Verdana ( 20 % ) and Lucida Grande ( 10 % ) .
Two thirds of the websites we surveyed used sans - serif fonts for body copy .
The main reason is probably because , despite the growing popularity of advanced font replacement techniques , such as Cufón , most designers stick to the core Web fonts , which essentially give them only two viable options : Georgia and Times New Roman .
And because of the stigma attached to Times New Roman ( that it often makes a modern website look outdated ) , they ’re left with only Georgia .
Sans - serif fonts offer a wider variety of options for the Web .
2. Which Typeface Is Most Popular ?
Surprisingly , despite the growing popularity of font replacement techniques and growing availability of new pre-installed fonts ( e.g. Windows Vista and Mac fonts ) , designs in our study mainly used the traditional , core Web fonts , the only exceptions being Lucida Grande ( which comes installed only on Macs ) , Helvetica and Baskerville .
As one would expect , Arial , Georgia and Verdana are used for the majority of body copy today .
In our study , around 80 % of websites used one of these three fonts .
For the remaining 20 % , designers ’ favorite Helvetica is a popular choice , as is Lucida Grande .
With options such as Verdana and Arial available as fall - backs , a designer really has no reason not to specify other non-standard fonts to achieve the best effect .
You can learn more about advanced CSS font stacks in Nathan Ford ’s article Better CSS Font Stacks and CodeStyle ’s Build Better CSS Font Stacks .
Jon Tan used serif typeface Baskerville for headlines and serif typeface Georgia for body copy .
Verdana is used minimally for headlines .
Only 10 websites use it for body copy to begin with , and only four use it for headlines .
The main reason is that Verdana puts a lot of spacing between letters , which makes it not as tidy to read at a large size .
If you are going to use it for headlines , you may want to take advantage of the CSS letter - spacing property .
Georgia and Arial are most popular fonts for headings .
Finally , we note that “ alternative ” fonts are used much more for headlines than for body copy .
Designers seem more willing to experiment with their headings than with the main body .
If you want to bring some typographic variation into your next design , headings may be the easiest place to start .
3. Light Or Dark Background ?
We were curious to learn the extent to which designers were willing to experiment with dark background colors .
We looked out for any typography - oriented websites that had a dark color scheme and were surprised to find not a single one .
The New Yorker has a light color scheme , with Times New Roman used for headlines and body copy .
Pure white background for body copy won by a landslide .
However , many of the designs avoid the high contrast of pure white on pure black ; text color is often made a bit lighter than pure black .
Designers clearly focus on legibility and avoid experimenting with background colors .
The contrast of black on white is easy to read and is , at least among these websites , the status quo .
4. Average Font Size For Headlines
Of course , the choice of headline font size depends on the font used in the design .
In any case , in our study by far the most popular font sizes ranged from 18 to 29 pixels , with 18 to 20 pixels and 24 to 26 pixels being the most popular choices .
Our study did n’t yield any clear winners .
The average font size for headings is 25.6 pixels .
But note that any size between 18 and 29 pixels could be effective ; it depends , after all , on how your headings fit the overall design of your website .
Still , you could try experimenting with larger sizes , because displays are always getting larger , as are display resolutions .
An obvious outlier is Wilson Miner ( screenshot below ) , who uses a massive font size of 48 pixels for his headlines .
His website is a special case , though , because all of his posts have extremely short titles , only a few words .
5. Average Font Size For Body Copy
Do you remember about seven years ago when Web designs had tiny , barely readable elements , and body copy was set to 8 pixels in Tahoma ?
Small font sizes are out , and more and more modern designers are turning to large font sizes .
From our sample size , we saw a clear tendency towards sizes between 12 and 14 pixels .
The most popular font size ( 38 % ) is 13 pixels , with 14 pixels slightly more popular than 12 pixels .
Overall , the average font size for body copy is 13 pixels .
We noted ( as one would expect ) more and more attention being paid to the smallest typographic details .
Dashes , quotes , footnotes , author names , introductory text and paragraphs have been carefully set , with optimal legibility in mind .
Type setting is usually very consistent , with a lot of white space , leading and padding .
Typographica uses a large font size for the introductory paragraphs of its articles , and then reverts to a normal size for the rest of text .
Heading to Body Font - Size Ratio
To better understand the relationship between heading and body font size , we divided each website ’s heading font size by its body font size .
We took the average of these ratios and derived a rule of thumb for you to work with :
Heading font size ÷
Body copy font size = 1.96
The overall value , then , is 1.96 .
This means that when you have chosen a font size for your body copy , you may want to multiply it by 2 to get your heading font size .
This , of course , depends on your style ; the rule of thumb wo n’t necessarily give you the optimal size for your particular design .
Another option is to use a traditional scale ( 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 21 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 72 ) or the Fibonacci sequence ( e.g. 16 – 24 – 40 – 64 – 104 ) to get natural typographic results .
6. Optimal Line Height For Body Copy
Leading ( or line height ) will always depend on your chosen font size and measure ( or line length ) .
In general , the longer the measure , the longer the leading should be .
Therefore , presenting a chart of the most popular choices for leading in pixels would n’t make sense here .
More appropriate would be for you to use a relative unit , such as an em or percentage value , that determines the relation between leading and measure and between leading and font size .
According to our study :
line height ( pixels ) ÷ body copy font size ( pixels ) = 1.48 .
Note that 1.5 is a value that is commonly recommended in classic typographic books , so our study backs up this rule of thumb .
Very few websites use anything less than that .
The number of websites that go above 1.48 decreases as you get further from this value .
.
Note that 1.5 is a value that is commonly recommended in classic typographic books , so our study backs up this rule of thumb .

The number of websites that go above 1.48 decreases as you get further from this value .
line length ( pixels ) ÷ line height ( pixels ) = 27.8 .
The average line length is 538.64 pixels ( excluding margins and paddings ) which is pretty large , considering that many websites still use 12 to 13 pixels for their body copy font size .
.
The average line length is 538.64 pixels ( excluding margins and paddings ) which is pretty large , considering that many websites still use 12 to 13 pixels for their body copy font size .
space between paragraphs ( pixels ) ÷ line height ( pixels ) = 0.754 .
We were surprised by this result .
It turns out that paragraph spacing ( i.e. the space between the last line of one paragraph and the first line of the next ) rarely equals the leading ( which would be the main characteristic of perfect vertical rhythm ) .
More often , paragraph spacing is just 75 % of the paragraph leading .
The reason may be that leading usually includes the space taken up by descenders , and because most characters do not have descenders , additional white space is created under the line .
AIGA is a perfect example of optimal leading .
Its font size is 13.21 pixels ( converted from ems ) and its line height is 19.833 pixels ( conversion from ems ) .
In fact , 19.8333 ÷ 13.2167 = 1.5011 .
So , once you have decided on your body copy font size , multiplying this value by 1.5 will give you the optimal line height .
Once you ’ve got that , you can multiply this new value by 27.8 to get your optimal line length .
Note that the layout will also need gutters , margins and padding to let the body copy breathe .
The New Scientist has 20 pixels of spacing between paragraphs .
7. How Many Characters Per Line ?
According to a classic rule of Web typography , 55 to 75 is an optimal number of characters per line .
Surprisingly , our study shows that most websites have a higher number .
We counted how many characters could fit on one line using the design ’s default font size .
The result , which is an average of 88.74 characters per line ( maximum ) , is extremely high .
Of course , this maximal number is different from the average number of characters per line , which in general ranges between 75 and 85 characters per line .
Still , the range is way above the conventional range – quite peculiar .
Between 73 and 90 characters per line is a popular choice among designers , yet we also found outliers : Monocle ( 47 characters per line ) and Boxes and Arrows ( 125 characters per line ) .
To get a more exact reading for each website , you would need to take an average character count from multiple lines .
Other Findings
46 % of websites underlined the links in their body copy , while the others highlighted only with color or a bold font weight .
6 % of websites used some kind of image replacement for headings or body copy ( e.g. Monocle , New Yorker , Newsweek ) .
96 % of websites do not justify text .
Websites gave their text a left padding of on average 11.7 pixels ( counting from the left content area border ) .
Conclusion
The study shows a clear set of common practices and guidelines for setting type in Web design .
Note , though , that these findings are not scientific and should serve only as rough guidelines :
Either serif or sans - serif fonts are fine for body copy and headings , but sans - serif fonts are still more popular for both .
Common choices for headlines are Georgia , Arial and Helvetica .
Common choices for body copy are Georgia , Arial , Verdana and Lucida Grande .
The most popular font size for headings is a range between 18 and 29 pixels .
The most popular font size for body copy is a range between 12 and 14 pixels .
Header font size ÷
Body copy font size = 1.96 .
Line height ( pixels ) ÷ body copy font size ( pixels ) = 1.48 .
Line length ( pixels ) ÷ line height ( pixels ) = 27.8 .
Space between paragraphs ( pixels ) ÷ line height ( pixels ) = 0.754 .
The optimal number of characters per line is between 55 and 75 , but between 75 and 85 characters per line is more popular , Body text is left - aligned , image replacement is rarely used and links are either underlined or highlighted with bold or color .
Of course these “ rules ” are n’t set in stone .
Rather , they are a set of rough guidelines that you can use as a basis for setting typography .
Every website is unique , and you may want to modify your choices at each stage of your design to suit your layout .
You can also take a look at the spreadsheet of the study and export its data for further analysis .

Wie heißt es so schön : “ Übermut kommt vor dem Fall ” ;-)
Stretchable micro-LED display , consisting of an interconnected mesh of printed micro LEDs bonded to a rubber substrate .
Developed by a team of international researchers , the new process creates tiny , ultrathin inorganic light - emitting diodes ( LEDs ) that shine brighter and last longer than conventional LEDs .
John Rogers , professor of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois , teamed up with experts at Northwestern University , the Institute of High Performance Computing in Singapore , and Tsinghua University in Beijing to create the new process , as described in a news story published Thursday by the University of Illinois and in the journal Science .
Micro_LED display printed on a thin sheet of plastic , wrapped around a finger Micro_LED display printed on a thin sheet of plastic , wrapped around a finger
Conventional Inorganic LEDs are brighter and long - lasting , but they ’re costly , thick , and difficult to manufacture .
Organic LEDs ( OLED ) are cheaper and easier to make , thinner , and can be applied to flexible surfaces .
The new process combines the best of both worlds .
The new process for creating ultrathin , ultrasmall inorganic light - emitting diodes ( LEDs ) and assembling them into large arrays offers new classes of lighting and display systems with interesting properties , such as see - through construction and mechanical flexibility , that would be impossible to achieve with existing technologies .
Applications for the arrays , which can be printed onto flat or flexible substrates ranging from glass to plastic and rubber , include general illumination , high - resolution home theater displays , wearable health monitors , and biomedical imaging devices .
“ Our goal is to marry some of the advantages of inorganic LED technology with the scalability , ease of processing and resolution of organic LEDs , ” said Rogers .
“ By printing large arrays of ultrathin , ultrasmall inorganic LEDs and interconnecting them using thin - film processing , we can create general lighting and high - resolution display systems that otherwise could not be built with the conventional ways that inorganic LEDs are made , manipulated , and assembled . ”
The technology could pave the way for TV screens that you roll up and brake light indicators that fit the contour of your car .
The Fabrication Methodology
To overcome requirements on device size and thickness associated with conventional wafer dicing , packaging and wire bonding methods , the researchers developed epitaxial growth techniques for creating LEDs with sizes up to 100 times smaller than usual .
They also developed printing processes for assembling these devices into arrays on stiff , flexible and stretchable substrates .
As part of the growth process , a sacrificial layer of material is embedded beneath the LEDs .
When fabrication is complete , a wet chemical etchent removes this layer , leaving the LEDs undercut from the wafer , but still tethered at anchor points .
To create an array , a rubber stamp contacts the wafer surface at selected points , lifts off the LEDs at those points , and transfers them to the desired substrate .
“ The stamping process provides a much faster alternative to the standard robotic ‘ pick and place ’ process that manipulates inorganic LEDs one at a time , ” Rogers said .
“ The new approach can lift large numbers of small , thin LEDs from the wafer in one step , and then print them onto a substrate in another step . ”
By shifting position and repeating the stamping process , LEDs can be transferred to other locations on the same substrate .
In this fashion , large light panels and displays can be crafted from small LEDs made in dense arrays on a single , comparatively small wafer .
And , because the LEDs can be placed far apart and still provide sufficient light output , the panels and displays can be nearly transparent .
The thin device geometries allow the use of thin - film processing methods , rather than wire bonding , for interconnects .
In addition to solid - state lighting , instrument panels and display systems , flexible and even stretchable sheets .
One especially promising use for flexible LED sheets lies in the medical field .
“ Wrapping a stretchable sheet of tiny LEDs around the human body offers interesting opportunities in biomedicine and biotechnology , ” said Rogers , “ including applications in health monitoring , diagnostics , and imaging . ”

More power to your elbow ( s ) . ’- Brian
For decades , Tom Casten of Recycled Energy Development has preached the gospel of saving money , resources and the planet by simply not wasting heat .
The typical power plant uses only one - third of the energy produced by burning fuel ( usually coal ) to generate electricity .
The remaining two - thirds of that energy escapes as waste heat .
Mr. Casten says that we easily could — and should — harness this heat to warm water or even cool buildings .
( You can cool with a heat source by using an absorption chiller . )
By harnessing waste heat , the same fuel would do twice the work .
We 'd have doubled efficiency .
The simultaneous production of heat and electricity is called cogeneration .
Electrical generation is not the only heat - wasting culprit .
Various industries — the production of metals , glass , and silicon , among other things — release waste heat as a byproduct .
In these cases , heat could turn turbines and generate electricity .
Indeed , Casten estimates that industrial waste heat alone could supply about 200,000 megawatts of electricity in the US .
That 's 20 percent of the US 's electricity needs , or 95 nuclear power plants not built .
In other words , we could burn fewer fossil fuels , spend less money , and fight global warming simply by harnessing the heat now flowing out of the country 's collective flues and smokestacks .
So why do n't we ?
In a word , outdated laws .
The near monopoly on electrical transmission by utility companies does n't help either .
In most states , for example , it 's illegal for all but a utility to erect electrical transmission lines across a public thoroughfare .
So if you generate electricity with the heat coming out your smokestack , you can't get it anywhere .
There goes the incentive to do something with the waste heat .
A new , in - depth article by the New Republic 's Bradford Plumer explains how things got this way :
Because they were shielded from competition , most utilities saw little reason to innovate or upgrade their lumbering fossil - fuel plants , since they ’d just be forced to pass on any savings to consumers .
A Fortune article in 1969 savaged utility executives as “ generally unimaginative men , grown complacent on private monopoly and regulated profits . ”
After the OPEC crisis in the ’70s exposed the industry ’s clumsiness in the face of adversity , Congress tried to promote competition on the generation side in some states .
But deregulation was only partial , and most Americans still have little , if any , choice of utility .
One problem : utility companies have little incentive to change .
Plumer writes :
Perhaps the most urgent state - level reform would be to alter how electricity rates are structured , so that utilities ’ profits do n’t just hinge on pumping as many electrons as possible through their wires .
After all , there ’s broad consensus that the cheapest , fastest way to reduce carbon - dioxide emissions is to use power more prudently .
Lawmakers have usually tried to do that through a blizzard of government mandates — from building codes to appliance standards .
But these mandates only do so much if utilities are constantly trying to sell more power .
So , a handful of states have tinkered with an approach called “ decoupling , ” in which utilities are guaranteed a fixed revenue each year , and can increase profits by cutting costs and selling less power .
In California , which pioneered decoupling back in 1982 , energy use per capita has flattened ( even as it ’s ballooned in most states ) , and utilities spent nearly $ 1 billion in 2008 on things like helping customers trade in their creaky , power - hogging fridges or promoting green buildings .
Yet many utilities and regulators are wary of abandoning a business model that has persisted for nearly a century .
And yet , change is not impossible .
In fact , judging from past examples , Sean Casten , Tom Casten 's son and CEO of Recycled Energy Development , argues that rapid change — quicker than what 's proposed in the climate bill currently in the Senate — is quite possible .
In an online essay , he points out that in the 1970s after various government programs went into effect , oil use fell by 17 percent .
In the same period , economic production increased by 27 percent .
The US 's consumption of foreign oil dropped by half in a little over five years .
New policies sparked a similar , radical shift in 1998 , he says , when government " mandated non-discriminatory access to the transmission grid . "
Private companies could finally transmit energy they generated .
In just 10 years , these entrepreneurs added almost 200 gigawatts capacity to US electrical generation potential .
That 's double what US nuclear reactors supplied .
Therein lies a lesson , says Sean Casten :
The country 's first 800 gigawatts of capacity took nearly a century to get up and running .
But after deregulation , it took only decade to increase that to 1000 GW .
And this acceleration happened without any public investment whatsover .
Private money fueled the growth .
Simply opening up the electric grid to the private profit incentive — a first in US history — could work wonders .
These same lessons apply to the current debate around energy and mitigation of climate change , says Casten .
And he concludes his essay by calling for more ambitious energy policies :
[ O ] ur climate debate remains mired in the swamp of diminished expectations .
Policymakers seem to think they have to treat energy companies with kid gloves — as if demanding big changes will somehow be too much for them to bear , resulting in a devastating blow to our economy .
But this view simply does n’t square with history .
With even minor reforms , enormous changes can occur .
The climate debate tends to be framed by armies of lobbyists who support specific technologies — coal , nuclear , renewable , carbon sequestration — and argue about which of these approaches should be near - term winners and losers of government largess .
Yet more dramatic change is clearly possible .
History suggests that the pace of greenhouse - gas reductions can be vastly quicker and cheaper than we anticipate .
Why could n’t we replace 2 % percent of today ’s fleet with cleaner technologies each year , as we already shown possible after the 1992 EPACT ?
Why could n’t we move even faster and replace 5 % per year as New England has demonstrated ?
Might it be possible to move faster still ?
History provides us optimistic answers to these questions , and suggests that our optimism is much more likely to be limited by our ambition than any capital , technical , thermodynamic or commercial constraint .
Tackling climate change and changing the electricity system can be easier , cheaper , and faster than we think .
Once we start .

" “ We must never forget , ” he ( Obama ) said .

So , how is this different from the deluded propaganda that the Bush Administration served up about Iraq for years and years ?
The sub - text in these remarks is the fantasy that has been circulating among minimally informed senior officers and staffs , a fantasy that insists that the Muslim fanatics of the Al - Qa'ida network are a credible existential threat to the United States .
As the fantasy goes , the yearning of the very small number of dangerous zealots to restore the medieval empire of the 'umma on a global basis has some chance of realization .
Power Point presentations have been written by shady consultants that support the idea that " the Muzlims " want to restore that supposedly theocratic " uber " state under the name of the " Caliphate , " ( khilafa ) and to reduce such existing countries as Pakistan , Egypt , Denmark , etc. to mere commanderies ( emirates ) of the " Muzlim " world empire .
An example of such a briefing for the JCS is at the bottom of this post .
Well , people in Hell want ice water , too .
The yearning of the zealots does not equate with capability now or in the future .
The Bush Administration did not like Husni Mubarak 's " pharonic democracy " in Egypt , but his insistence on suppressing Islamist groups has kept these people from power in that country .
Hopefully , the Danes can do as well .
The idea that this small group of crazies is an existential threat to the US would be funny if it were not so very clear that the same kind of nonsense was " sold " to the American people before and during Iraq .
Park your own propaganda influenced fantasies at the door and let 's remember - Iraq did not have WMD .
Iraq did not have a working relationship with the Sunni crazies .
Iraq did not participate in 9/11 .
We are leaving Iraq without having changed anything there except that we put the Shia Arabs in charge of whatever parts of the country that they can hold .
We improved the security situation in Iraq by applying the age old method of " divide and conquer " to the qalaxy of leaderless ( in terms of central command ) insurgent grops that we faced .
It had nothing to do with the purple thumbs .
Now we have the same kinds of propaganda fantasies being sold to the American people and to a malleable executive branch .
We are now told by the president himself that governance and development in Afghanistan are vital American national interests .
We are told that the plight of Afghan women is a vital interest of the United States .
Such statements imply a long term commitment to the " modernization " of Afghanistan .
Such statements imply an ever moving process of " mission creep " no matter what sort of reception McChrystal 's " strategic review " receives in Washington .
And , lastly there is the theocratic police state in Iran .
It is being suggested to Americans that ; the government of Iran ( Shia ) , the Pushtun dominated Taliban melange ( Sunni ) , and Al - Qa'ida ( Sunni ) are all really the same thing .
I heard Hillary say that a few months ago .
Obama implied it yeasterday .
What rot !
But , it is selling .
Ask yourself .
Where is this foolishness of " caliphates " and " existential threats " coming from .
THINK !!

Patriot Act Renewal Debate Kicks Off Over Party Lines
Created : September 23 , 2009 06:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Rep. John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) ( WDCpix )
Eight years after it was passed , the USA Patriot Act remains among the most controversial pieces of counterterrorism legislation in the so - called “ war on terror . ”
On December 31 of this year , some of its more controversial provisions will expire , forcing Congress to revisit it and decide whether to reauthorize the expiring provisions , amend them , or re-work the entire law .
The sections set to expire give the government the authority to access business records , operate roving wiretaps and conduct surveillance on “ lone wolf ” suspects with no known link to foreign governments or terrorist groups .
A justice Department official last week told Congress that the Obama administration supports their renewal .
Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich wrote to Senator Patrick Leahy ( D- Vt. ) that the administration would consider stronger civil rights protections “ provided that they do not undermine the effectiveness of these important ( provisions ) . ”

But at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday , it was clear that Democrats do n’t uniformly support the White House on that .
Some Democrats on the committee were still bitter that some Republicans back in 2001 had pushed aside a bipartisan version of the bill produced by the Judiciary Committee in favor of a version substantially revised and altered by the Rules Committee , led by then - chairman David Dreier ( R - Calif . ) .
“ Then - Chairman Dreier under Lord knows whose instructions , substituted that bill for another bill , that we at judiciary had never seen .
So we come here today now to consider what we do with those parts that are expiring ” and that , according to committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) , created problems that the bill he ’d approved would have prevented .
“ We held in this committee five days of markup and achieved unanimity on the Patriot Act , ” Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) echoed later in the hearing .
“ Then the bill just disappeared .
And we had a new several hundred page bill revealed from the Rules Committee ” that had to be voted on the next day , before most members of Congress even had a chance to read it , said Nadler .
The fight over the bill appears to be as partisan today as ever .
At the House hearing , Democrats and their witnesses warned that provisions of the law that allow “ roving wiretaps ” of different communications devices used by unnamed suspects , or electronic surveillance of suspects with no affiliation to known terrorist organizations , violate constitutional safeguards against unreasonable searches and seizures .
And a “ gag order ” provision of the bill , they complained , violate the First Amendment by preventing the recipient of an FBI - issued National Security Letter , which can request customer information from businesses , from disclosing to their customers that the information was requested .
While Democrats in the House yesterday cast these provisions as unnecessary and abusive , Republicans deemed them critical to national security .
“ We must not be lulled into a false sense of security , ” warned Rep. Lamar Smith ( R - Texas ) .
“ The threat remains high , ” he added , and proceeded to list about a half a dozen terrorist plots that were either carried out or planned but foiled by the FBI since September 11 , 2001 , including the 2004 Madrid train bombings , the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai , and the thwarting of what he called a “ plot to kill U.S. soldiers at the Fort Dix Army base ” in 2007 .** **
** **
But several witnesses , such as Suzanne Spaulding , a national security lawyer and former staff director of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , testified that parts of the law such as the “ lone wolf ” provision , which allows the FBI to monitor suspects with no connection to foreign terrorist organizations , “ undermines the policy and constitutional justification for the entire [ Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ] statute .
“ This extraordinary departure from the Fourth Amendment ’s warrant standards is justified only in investigation of foreign powers or their agents , ” she said .
The “ lone wolf ” provision would allow the government to spy an someone suspected of participating in terrorism but where the evidence is not strong enough to meet the stricter standards for obtaining a regular warrant from an ordinary federal court .
Michael German , a former FBI agent and now policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union , noted that the FBI inspector general himself in 2007 concluded that the Patriot Act had been abused .
Section 505 of the Act increased the number of officials who could authorize national security letters , seeking private information about certain businesses ’ customers , reduced the standard necessary to obtain information with them , to the point where information could be collected about people who are not even suspected of having done anything wrong , testified German .
Even with such broad latitude , German testified , the Inspector general reports “ confirmed widespread FBI mismanagement , misuse and abuse of these Patriot Act authorities . ”
The inspector general reported that the FBI ’s record - keeping was so poor it did n’t know how many national security lettesr it had issued , and it often sought private information that it was not entitled to .
“ Most troubling , FBI supervisors used hundreds of illegal “ exigent letters ” to obtain telephone records without national security letters by falsely claiming emergencies , ” German added in written testimony submitted to the subcommittee on Tuesday .
And Thomas Evans , a former Republican Congressman from Delaware testified on behalf of the bipartisan Constitution Project that the section of the Act allowing the FBI to issue National Security Letters without a court order and accompanied by gag orders creates “ great potential for abuse . ”
Last week the Constitution Project sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee , signed by 26 policy experts across the political spectrum , seeking major reforms to the Patriot Act .
On Tuesday , Todd Hinnen , Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the National Security Division of the Justice Department testified that many of the problems identified by the Inspector General and others have been solved .
“ Since that time , FBI has put in a new data subsystem governing those [ national security letters ] , ” he said , adding that the National Security Division of the Justice Department has increased its oversight and Congress and the Inspector General retain their oversight authority .
Hinnen testified further that the expiring Patriot Act provisions were absolutely necessary tools for law enforcement to pursue terror suspects .
“ We feel that these are very important investigative authorities and that it would be very unfortunate to allow them to lapse .
The administration firmly supports renewal before December 31 so there ’s no gap in the investigative abilities of the government . ”
Conyers was not impressed .
“ You sound like a lot of people from DOJ that have come over here before , and yet you ’ve only been there a few months , ” he said , after Hinnen said he started in the job on January 21 .
“ Do you think that ’s a good thing or a bad thing ? ” Conyers asked .
As Hinnen hesitated , Conyers added : “ You do n’t have to respond to that . ”
On Wednesday , the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold its own hearing on the Patriot Act .
That promises to be equally contentious .
Already , several senators have introduced bills to reauthorize and amend expiring provisions of the Patriot Act , although there ’s already evidence of disagreement among Senators on the same side of the aisle .
Last week , Senator Russ Feingold ( D - Wisc. ) , with co-sponsorship from Dick Durbin ( D - IL ) , Jon Tester ( D - MT ) , Tom Udall ( D - NM ) , Jeff Bingaman ( D - NM ) , Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) , Daniel Akaka ( D - HI ) and Ron Wyden ( D - OR ) , introduced a bill to narrow the Patriot Act , called The Judicious Use of Surveillance Tools In Counterterrorism Efforts Act , or the JUSTICE Act .
The Act would amend not just the expiring provisions but would add protections for privacy civil liberties in each section fo the Patriot Act and other surveillance laws .
It would also repeal the retroactive immunity granted to telecommunications companies included in the FISA Amendments
Act passed last year .
The Obama administration has supported and defended in court this immunity for telecom companies .
A bill introduced on Tuesday by Sens. Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , Benjamin Cardin ( D - Md. ) and Ted Kaufmann ( D - Md. ) , does not repeal the immunity provision , and makes more modest amendments to the Patriot Act .
It extends all three of the provisions set to expire this year , but expands reporting requirements to allow Congress to monitor how the administration is using the law .
Greetings Leaders !
Before I get into the blog , you have to watch this video .
I do n’t know when or where it was made , but it made me smile .
I ’m sitting at home alone tonight .
My wife is out of town caring for her aunt and my daughter is up at her boyfriends .
It ’s a good time to reflect .
I recently read a great article by John Hope Bryant in Forbes called Stop Trying to Get Rich and it made me wonder , where have all our heroes gone ?
The article put me in a reflective mood and after spending some time at the bookstore after dinner , I bought the movie The Right Stuff and watched it when I got home .
The movie portrayed America ’s first astronauts during the late 1950s and early 1960s .
Yes , I know the world has always been a turbulent place .
But … back then we had heroes .
Real heroes .
We had men and women who sacrificed their time and their lives to achieve great things .
There were people like Chuck Yeager who braved “ demons ” as he challenged the sound barrier .
There was of course the Mercury Seven and let us not forget the astronauts of Apollo 1 , Space Shuttle Challenger and Space Shuttle Columbia .
There were other heroes of the time too .
Mother Teresa , Ghandi , Martin Luther King Jr. , Nelson Mandela and Princess Diana .
We looked to business icons like Lee Iacocca , and Sam Walton .
We had sports heroes like Roger Staubach , Bart Starr , “ Broadway ” Joe Namath , Joe Montana , Kareem Abdul Jabar , Michael Jordan , Bruce Jenner , Mark Spitz , Mary Lou Redden , Carl Lewis , Hank Aaron , George Foreman and yes even Mohammed Ali .
I know , they were n’t perfect .
Yet , they made a generation or two believe that we could become better .
In the entertainment world we had stars such as Robert Redford , Barbara Streisand , Clint Eastwood , John Wayne , Vanessa Redgrave , Jimmy Stewart , Burt Lancaster , Jerry Lewis , Henry Fonda , Cary Grant , Audrey Hepburn , Humphrey Bogart , Katherine Hepburn , Julie Andrews and tons of others .
Again , not perfect .
But , their lives did n’t seem as chaotic as the lives of stars we have today .
Where have all our heroes gone ?
Who are our spiritual leaders ?
Researchers have identified that Generations X and Y have no real heroes .
They are generations that have no strong figures to which they can identify and aspire to be like .
Instead I turn on the television and I see shows , tons of shows , that make promiscuity , being self - centered and using drugs seem second nature .
I had a first grader come up to me in Sunday School last week flashing gang signs , thinking it was cool .
First grade !
Where are his heroes ?
Where have all our heroes gone ?
Feel free to let us know what you think !
All the best !
All the time !

Earth ’s ocean depths are often referred to as the planet ’s last great unexplored frontier .
Blacker than the darkest night , crushed by unimaginable pressure and for the most part untouched by the hand of Man , the benthic world is bursting with life – though in many cases not life as we know it .
Here are 7 exceptional examples of the wonders lurking far beneath .
Pacific Barreleye
( images via : National Geographic and Futurama Madhouse )
The Pacific Barreleye ( Macropinna microstoma ) is one of a group of deep sea fish that have evolved a unique set of anatomical accoutrements to fit their particular lifestyle .
These fish are very fragile and specimens brought to the surface by fisherman and researchers were distorted by the pressure differential .
This fish ’s most unique features are its soft , transparent head and the barrel - shaped eyes within .
Normally fixed in an upward - looking position with green “ lens caps ” to filter out sunlight , the Pacific Barreleye can swivel and telescope its odd eyes much like Bender of Futurama .
What appear to be “ eyes ” are sensory organs ; the real eyes reside inside the fish ’s fighter plane canopy style forehead .
Below is a video of the Pacific Barreleye in its natural habitat , looking very UNnatural :

Bathysaurus

Bathysaurus sounds like a dinosaur and it looks like one too – and not one of the nice , gentle plant - eaters , either .
The cutie above , Bathysaurus Ferox to be exact , is described as “ the world ’s deepest - living superpredator ” : anything and everything it meets , it eats .
Once Bathysaurus latches on to lunch it ’s game over : the fiendish fish ’s jaws and even its tongue are studded with razor - sharp fangs .
( image via : Skwirlinator )
With a face only a mother could love , one might think Bathysaurus Ferox might have a tough time getting a date .
Not to worry ; the fearsome - faced bottom dweller has both male and female sex organs .
As CSNY used to say ( or sing ) , “ If you ca n’t be with the one you love , love the one you ’re with ” .
Viperfish

How awesomely badass is the Viperfish ?
Maybe you ca n’t handle the tooth !
If one glance at its fang - tastic kisser did n’t convince you it was the embodiment of evil , consider this : it preys on Dragonfish and we ’re sure they ’re no pushovers .
Most Viperfish have expandable stomachs that allow them to ingest fish larger themselves in one bite … and WHAT a bite !
( image via : All Time Greatest Hits )
If you ’re lucky , the closest you ’ll come to being eye to eye with a Viperfish is by checking out the cover of Mr. Bungle ’s 1995 album Disco Volante .
Deep Sea Anglerfish
( images via : GameSpot Forums , Whitman College and Arts On Earth )
A trademark of deep sea Anglerfish is their lure , which tends to resemble a tiny creature in upper ocean species but becomes bioluminescent in benthic species .
One of the scariest scenes in Finding Nemo involved Dory being hypnotically drawn to a glowing light … which turned out to be attached to the toothiest Anglerfish EVAR !
There are many different types of Deep - sea Anglerfish but the rule of thumb seems to be : the deeper they are , the uglier they are .
( image via : Magazine 13 )
They do n’t get much better once hauled to the surface either , as the unfortunate specimen above illustrates .
The sudden reduction in pressure caused its stomach to balloon out into its mouth .
Nice .
Piglet Squid
( images via : SERPENT and Seaway Blog )
Known officially as Helicocranchia Pfefferi , the cuter than cute Banded Piglet Squid is a welcome relief from the bug-eyed , big - toothed menagerie of horror that seems to typify deep sea life .
The squid lives in the dim middle - ocean layer several thousand feet beneath the surface .
( image via : Seaway Blog )
Perhaps only the difficulty in creating a livable environment and the near - impossibility of finding suitable live food has prevented the Banded Piglet Squid from becoming a home aquarium superstar .
Japanese Giant Spider Crab
( images via : GameSpot Forums and HuckleBeary )
Spider crab ’s big , yeah yeah yeah .
It ’s not small , no no no .
Need some numbers ?
Try a 13 - foot ( 4m ) leg span , a 15 - inch ( 37 cm ) wide body and a weight of up to 44 pounds ( 20kg ) .
Japanese Giant Spider Crabs can live up to 100 years , similar to the largest and oldest lobsters .
These spindly seafloor dwellers are the cleaners of the deep , making short work of the dead and dying alike .
Those who ’ve watched The Deadliest Catch know that crab traps are baited with cod carcasses to attract crabs from miles around .
This is one case where , if attacked , playing dead is NOT recommended .
( image via : Vince Lewis )
Japanese Giant Spider Crabs are a delicacy though eating one requires about a cow & a half of butter .
Good luck also finding the mother of all cooking pots .
Tongue Eating Louse
( images via : Practical Fishkeeping and Wellsphere )
Cymothoa exigua is a type of parasitic Isopod ( crustaceans often called Sea Woodlice ) with a very unusual lifestyle .
After entering the mouth of a Spotted Rose Snapper , it attaches itself to the base of the fish ’s tongue and derives nourishment by sucking its blood .
Eventually the fish ’s tongue atrophies and shrinks as a result of the chronic blood loss , at which point Cymothoa grasps the tongue - stub with its lower legs and effectively becomes the fish ’s tongue !
( image via : Bugs In The News )
Once it replaces its tongue , Cymothoa does not eat leftovers from the fish ’s meals , instead continuing to feed on fish blood or on mucus secreted inside the fish ’s mouth .
There are indications Cymothoa may be spreading – fishermen have recently reported finding Cymothoa infesting the mouths of Weaver fish caught off the Jersey ( the UK island , not the US state ) coast near Normandy , France .
While not exclusively a “ deep sea ” creature , Cymothoa is bizarre enough to out - weird pretty much any other marine lifeform found at any depth .
As children we worried about monsters under the bed but luckily we grew up and found out they were n’t real .
How disconcerting , then , to learn that a nightmarish house of horrors beyond anyone ’s imagination lurks below the waves on the ocean ’s bed .
At the same time , one must admire the way nature has provided these creatures with the adaptations , bizarre as they might seem , to survive in the world ’s most most hostile environment .

Didier Drogba feels his development into one of the world 's most feared frontmen is down to Jose Mourinho .
Blues striker thanks former coach for raising his game
Progress
Didier Drogba feels his development into one of the world 's most feared frontmen is down to Jose Mourinho .
The Ivorian striker was signed by the Portuguese tactician upon his arrival at Chelsea in the summer of 2004 .
Big things were expected of him , especially as the Blues had shelled out £ 24 million in order to snatch him away from Marseille .
Drogba initially struggled to settle in England , but soon flourished under the careful guidance of Mourinho .
Having gone from strength to strength in recent years , the African ace is now widely regarded as the complete attacking weapon .
Drogba admits that he was able to fulfil his potential because of the faith shown in him by Mourinho , while he has also shed light on the man-management skills which helped to raise his game .
" Mourinho is somebody very strong tactically but mainly from the psychological side .
He knows how to get through to the players , " Drogba told .
" I remember sometimes I would talk to him and say ' Why are you giving me two days off even though we have a match in a few days ? '
And he said that my rest was mostly psychological .
" That means you can cut yourself off for a couple of days and you rest and you 're mentally well and you come back fresh .
The mental side is 90 per cent of football .
The players are with him absolutely .
He gives you everything .
" He says ' Do what you want , with me you can do what you want .
But on the pitch you give me everything .
You do n't betray me .
I give you everything you want , I give you days off but you must be performing on the pitch . '
" He would come and tell you if you had a bad game that you did n't play well but the next match if you played well he'd also come to say ' For me you were man of the match . '
" I loved him because he made me progress as a player .
I was ready to break my legs for him . "
Mourinho's own star rose considerably during his days at Stamford Bridge , with his outspoken attitude making him a firm favourite with fans and the media .
However , the now Inter Milan coach claims that he does not intentionally seek the limelight and insists he would prefer to be left to do his job in peace .
" I love being a coach and the year I had without football after leaving Chelsea was difficult , " he said .
" But some parts of the job are not so attractive .
" Even though people say I like being in the media , the opposite is true .
If I could avoid talking to the media from this moment on , I would do it .
" But players and managers have contractual obligations to talk so we do it .
I do n't like being a star .
I do n't do this job to be famous or get my picture in the paper , but this is part of what we have to do . "
I do n't understand it , and never have .
By any definition of the word , I 'm a bookworm .
I read while brushing my teeth .
Going to the loo .
In the bath .
Having breakfast .
Breastfeeding .
I read on trains , planes and occasionally while driving in heavy traffic .
I have two library cards and Amazon Prime .
And I will read anything ; absolutely anything .
I will read cereal packets , Narnia , Blyton , the Brontës , Dickens , Neil Gaiman , Jilly Cooper , Richard Feynman ; George MacDonald Fraser ; Vikram Seth ; Michel Faber ; Brian Masters ; Agatha Christie , Chekov ; Hunter S Thompson ; Douglas Adams ; Lee Child , T S Eliot , Antony Beevor ; Heat , Viz , The New Yorker .
I will read high , low and the Richard and Judy list in between .
All that matters to me is that it 's good .
When people say , " Oh , I would never read science fiction / crime / novels without a gun on the cover " I am instantly suspicious .
The true bookworm starts with their parents '
Dr Spock ( or , as a novelist friend of mine did as a four - year - old , Teach Your Child to Read ) and absolutely will not stop until they go blind .
( Although another friend of mine has already taught herself to read braille .
Apparently , it means you can keep your hands warm by reading under the covers on cold winter evenings . )
An elderly lady once mentioned to me that she keeps books both upstairs and downstairs , in case she ever has a fall and has to wait for help .
I understand this completely .
Thinking about that one time I hopped , bookless , out of a hotel in New York to grab a quick cup of coffee and got stuck in the lift still brings me out in goosebumps .
Except , somehow , every year , I never feel like reading the contenders for the Man Booker prize , the winner of which is announced on Tuesday .

This is what I believe reading is for : I believe it is either a window on to your own world or a door to someone else 's .
It is immersion .
It is somewhere else .
One is always searching for the seamless connection , the direct brain - to - brain download from writer to reader that only books can provide , in the currently unimprovable format of a paperback ( the sole reason , I think that books so far have n't gone the way of music and television and are believed to be " free " ) .
Time vanishes , as does noise .
When I was reading The Crimson Petal and the White I was startled half to death by an electronic voice on the Tube as it intruded into my 19th - century reality .
You read and you read and you read , and then you come to and it is three o'clock in the morning ; or you are lying , curled up on the floor , weeping in a frenzied ball at the end of A Prayer for Owen Meany .
This is what I do not believe reading to be for : bragging rights .
Admiration of form .
Stopping in the middle of narrative to admire a particularly unusual metaphor .
Experimenting with style at the total cost of engagement .
Being po-faced on purpose ; putting on your Sunday clothes .
The aim of the Booker prize seems so simple – " to reward the best book of the year written in English " .
That sounds pleasingly straightforward and clear .
Except , of course , the time restraints render it an impossibility , forcing the judges to discuss the merits of art without the help of critical distance .
Truly the Booker should run five or 10 years retrospectively , so that it is easier to see that , for example , A Fine Balance would resonate long after Last Orders would be drained ; that A Suitable Boy ( not even shortlisted ) should perhaps have pipped Roddy Doyle 's perfectly competent Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha ; that , in fact , The Crimson Petal and the White should have been called in regardless of minor passport issues .
And , of course , the Booker is n't the best book of the year ; it 's the best literary book of the year in " Serious issues of serious literature " , that most humourless of genres .
White Tiger remains almost unique among Booker winners for having the occasional joke .
There was panic and scandal the year D B C Pierre won for Vernon God Little , that the prize was " dumbing down " , rewarding , as it did , a readable , exciting work .
Genre has no chance : Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell , an astonishing exercise in world - building , but with supernatural elements , did n't even make the shortlist in 2004 ; nor did the " children 's book " The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night - time .
It did win the Costas .
But the Costas ( as the Whitbread used to be known ) has simple judging criteria : which of these books would you press on a friend and implore them to read ?
Can you really imagine grabbing an aquaintance and insisting they read The Famished Road ?
Would you read it again yourself , other than from a sense of duty ?
I find the great novels , the really great novels , are intensely , endlessly readable .
Middlemarch , Great Expectations , Madame Bovary : page turners , every one .
But , oh goodness , I had to leave behind that old man in the mountains slowly pondering his tea in The Inheritance of Loss .
I can't even remember the source of that woman 's faintly limpid sense of disquiet in Hotel du Lac .
The sense of sombre worthiness surrounding the awards drags everything down .
Is it just me ?
I have staggered through Ulysses .
I 've read every gilded word Edith Wharton ever published .
Most amazingly of all , I 'm the only person in the history of the world who made it to the end of Nirpal Singh Dhaliwal 's novel , the single worst thing ever committed to print .
( Well , nearly the end .
I still bet I did better than anyone else who picked it up , though . )
So why do I look at The Sea by John Banville with such a sinking heart ?
( Cover quote : " Incandescent prose .
Beautifully textured characterisation .
Transparent narrative " .
If you have to say that a narrative is transparent , you already have a problem right there . )
I adored Anne Enright 's book Making Babies and bought it for anyone I knew who got pregnant .
But I read the blurb for The Gathering – " the nine surviving children of the Hegarty clan gather in Dublin for the wake of their wayward brother Liam " and thought , jeez , another bloody wake , and bought Diana Athill instead .
The Booker does bring publicity to literature , which is supposedly the point .
But it 's the wrong type of publicity : it confirms to the 58 per cent of people who have n't read a book since school that , in fact , " good " books are manifestly not for them ; because if they 're not even for people like me , then who are they for ?
" Posh bingo " , Julian Barnes has called it , and he may be right : a tiny circle of gossip and dissent and showing off and chatter .
And I am very fond of the ( possibly apocryphal ) story of Jeffrey Archer ringing his agent after each novel and saying , " So , ahem , do you think you could submit this one ? "
And , of course , there are great Booker novels : The Remains of the Day is close to perfect ; Life of Pi is a wondrous thing ; and , fingers crossed , Wolf Hall will be recognised for the sensational work it is on 6 October .
But the Booker 's enduring legacy to me is this : this is Grown - up Serious Reading and would all you little sentimental people who like being entertained please scuttle back to your tawdry little comics , your Katie Prices , threefers and celebrity autobiographies .
Which , given its fame , its scope , its power , seems such a rotten shame for us , the bookworms , the readers .
Jenny Colgan 's latest novel is Diamonds are a Girl 's Best Friend
Nobody ever said the Light Saber was a practical weapon – it's no match for a good blaster , if you ask me – but it exerts a powerful fascination .
Special Operations Command have " completed ongoing testing and field evaluation studies " of the next best thing , according to a Pentagon budget document .
It 's a Plasma Knife which cuts through flesh with a " blade " of glowing ionized gas .
But rather than being a weapon , the Plasma Knife is a surgical instrument that could save lives .
Prompt medical care has proven extremely effective at reducing the mortality rates of combat casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan .
A policy of basing medics as far forward as possible and carrying out essential treatment before transfer to a full medical facility has reduced the chances of dying from battlefield injuries from 25 % during the Korean war – to just 10 % today .
But commandos often find themselves in remote areas without the luxury of medical backup , which is why they require their own emergency medical capability .
And that 's where the Plasma Knife comes in .
If you survive the massive tissue damage caused by a bullet or an improvised bomb , then the biggest immediate risk is bleeding to death .
The Plasma Knife is a tool to stop bleeding .
In a sense it goes right back to the old technique of cauterization , where you stop the bleeding by applying red - hot irons .
Modern surgeons have electrocautery which uses an electrically - heated wire , for the same purpose .
The more advanced version is radiosurgery , which replaces the wire with high - energy radio - frequency radiation which heats tissue directly .
All of these work on the same basic principle of stopping bleeding by creating an impermeable layer of necrotic tissue .
Or to put it another way , you melt the flesh the form a bandage .
The necrotic – that is , dead – tissue is comprised of two layers , a porous outer layer in which all the moisture has been completely vaporized , and an impervious layer where proteins have been broken down but some water remains .
The key thing is not to simply blast the bleeding wound with heat , as that literally burns away the flesh and makes the injury deeper .
Energy has to be applied in a controlled fashion .
The Plasma Knife resembles tools used for radiosurgery , but has the advantage that it produces plasma ( hot ionised gas– not the liquid sort of plasmafound in blood ) which penetrates the outer porous layer of dead tissue without damaging it .
In principle this means that more serious blood flow , such as that caused by large blood vessels being severed , can be stemmed without doing major damage .
As the name suggests , the Plasma Knife can also be used as a surgical cutting instrument .
As with laser and radiosurgery tools , it can be sterile even in field conditions .
And it cauterizes and seals the incision as it goes .
A normal medical Plasma Knife relies on mains power , but the commando version is described as being low - power and wearable , suggesting it has a separate power pack .
Just do n't run the batteries down playing Jedi Knights .
Special Operations
Command are also looking at a range of other technologies to improve field medicine , including some which are on the far end of extreme , such as recombinant agents suitable for controlling the bleeding in penetrating brain injuries – “ Looks like a bullet in the head – take two aspirin and one of these ” .
The Plasma Knife might not impress Luke Skywalker .
But it might be a step forward for field medicine .

Why Is Life So Hard ?
" Why ? "
When life is hard , is there a way to have peace ?
How do we explain what we see in this world ?
Terrorist attacks , sex slavery , racism , world hunger ?
Subconsciously , we probably ask ourselves questions like these quite often .
But consciously we rarely do .
We 're so busy living our lives we rarely stop and wonder WHY ?
But then something happens to wake us up .
Our parents get divorced .
The girl down the street gets abducted .
A relative gets cancer .
That wakes us up for awhile .
But then we can often sink back into the denial .
That is , until another tragedy hits , another incongruence .
Then we 're likely to think , Something is n't right here .
Something is really , really wrong .
This is n't how life 's supposed to be !
So , WHY do bad things happen ?
Why is n't this world a better place ?
There is an answer to the WHY question , found in the Bible .
But it 's not an answer that most people like to hear : the world is the way it is because it 's the world that we , in a sense , have asked for .
Sound strange ?
What or who could make this world different than the way it is ?
What or who could guarantee that life is pain - free , for everyone , all the time ?
God could .
God could accomplish that .
But he does n't .
At least not right now .
And we 're angry with him as a result .
We say , " God ca n't be all - powerful and all - loving .
If he were , this world would n't be the way it is ! "
We say this hoping that God will then change his position on the matter .
Our hope is that putting a guilt trip on him will make him change the way he 's doing things .
But he does n't seem to budge .
WHY does n't he ?
God does n't budge -- he does n't change things right now -- because he 's giving us what we asked for : a world where we get to treat him as though he is absent and unnecessary .
Remember the story of Adam and Eve ?
They ate the " forbidden fruit . "
That fruit was the idea that they could ignore what God said or gave them , and strike out on life apart from God.
For Adam and Eve sort of hoped that they could become like God , without God .
They consumed the notion that there was something more valuable in existence than God himself , something more valuable than having a personal relationship with God .
And this world system -- with all of its faults -- came as a result of the choice they made .
Their story is the story of all of us , is n't it ?
Who has n't said -- if not audibly at least in their hearts --
God , I think I can do this without you .
I 'll just go this one alone .
But thanks for the offer .
We 've all tried to make life work without God .
Why do we do that ?
Probably because we 've all bought the notion that there 's something more valuable , more important , than God .
For different people it 's different things , but the mindset is the same :
God is n't what 's most important in life .
In fact , I 'd just as soon do it without him altogether .
What is God 's response to that ?
He allows it .
Many people experience the painful results of others ' or their own choices that run contrary to God 's ways ... murder , sexual abuse , greed , lying / fraud , slander , adultery , kidnapping , etc .
All of these can be explained by people who have refused to give God access and influence over their lives .
They are going about their lives as they see fit , and they and others suffer .
What 's God view on all of this ?
He 's not smug .
In fact , God could rightly be viewed as leaning forward , compassionate , hoping we will turn to him so that he can bring real life to us .
Jesus said , " Come to me , all who are weary and heavy - laden , and I will give you rest . "
1
But not all are willing to go to him .
Jesus commented on this when he said : " O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you , how often I have longed to gather your children together , as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings , but you were not willing . "
2
Again , Jesus brings the issue back to our relationship with him .
" I am the light of the world .
He who follows me will not walk in darkness , but will have the light of life . "
3
But what about when life is unfair , when bad things happen to us ?
What about those horrible circumstances that hit us in life , caused by someone other than ourselves ?
When we are feeling victimized , it 's useful to realize that God himself endured horrendous treatment from others .
God more than understands what you are going through .
There is nothing in life that could be more painful than what Jesus endured on our behalf , when he was deserted by his friends , ridiculed by those who would not believe in him , beaten and tortured before his crucifixion , then nailed to a cross , in shameful public display , dying of slow suffocation .
He created us , yet allowed humanity the freedom to do this , to fulfill Scripture and to set us free from our sin .
This was no surprise to Jesus .
He was aware of what was coming , foreknowing all the details , all the pain , all the humiliation .
" And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , he took the twelve disciples aside , and on the way he said to them , ' Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes , and they will condemn him to death , and deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified , and he will be raised on the third day . "
4
Imagine knowing something that awful was going to happen to you .
Jesus understands emotional and psychological anguish .
The night that Jesus knew they would arrest him , he went to pray , but took some friends with him .
" And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , he began to be sorrowful and troubled .
Then he said to them , ' My soul is very sorrowful , even to death ; remain here and watch [ keep awake ] with me .
And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed , ' My Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass from me ; nevertheless , not as I will but as thou wills . "
5
Though Jesus confided in his three friends , they did n't understand the depth of his torment , and when Jesus returned from prayer he found them asleep .
Jesus understands what it 's like going through pain and extreme sadness alone .
Here it is summarized , as John describes in his gospel : " He was in the world , and the world was made through him , yet the world knew him not .
He came to his own home , and his own people received him not .
But to all who received him , who believed in his name , he gave power to become children of God . " 6
" For God sent the Son into the world , not to condemn the world , but that the world might be saved through him .
For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son , that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life . "
7
There is no question that there is pain and intense suffering in this world .
Some of it is explained by selfish , hateful actions on the part of others .
Some of it defies an explanation in this life .
But God offers us himself .
God gives us the knowledge that he has endured also , and is aware of our pain and needs .
Jesus said to his disciples , " Peace I leave with you ; my peace I give to you ; not as the world gives do I give to you .
Let not your hearts be troubled , neither let them be afraid . "
8
There is ample reason to be afraid , troubled , but God can give us his peace , which is greater than the problem before us .
He is after all , God , the Creator .
The one who has always existed .
The one who created a universe on the backstroke .
Yet even in his power , he's also the one who knows us intimately , even the smallest , insignificant details .
And if we will trust him with our lives , relying on him , though we encounter difficulties , he will hold us securely .
Jesus said , " These things I have spoken to you , so that in me you may have peace .
In the world you have tribulation , but take courage ; I have overcome the world . " 9
He went through our ultimate threat -- death -- and overcame it .
He can take us through the difficult circumstances of this life , and then bring us into eternal life , if we will trust him .
We can either go through this life with God or without him .
Jesus prayed , " O righteous Father , although the world has not known you , yet I have known you ; and these have known that you sent me ; and I have made your name known to them , and will make it known , so that the love with which you loved me may be in them , and I in them .
"
10
You might find yourself asking , " Why is life so hard ? "
Without God , humanity is easily drawn into hatred , racism , sexual abuse , murdering each other .
Jesus said , “ I came that you might have life , and have it more abundantly .
” 11 To find out how to begin a relationship with God , please see Knowing God Personally .

The disturbing findings , released for National Fork Lift Safety Week , highlight the dangers of the vehicles , used to carry heavy loads .
Announcing the figures today , Fork Lift Truck Association ( FTLA ) Chief Executive David Ellison , said : “ Men need to learn from their female co-workers that fork lift trucks can be deadly , and should be always treated with great caution .
“ Every single day , somebody is hospitalised or killed by a fork lift truck – and the vast majority of the victims are men .
" These accidents claim lives and shatter families , friends and workplaces .
If men could take the same precautions as women , much of this unnecessary tragedy would be eliminated .
“ We ask everyone who finds themselves in the vicinity of a fork lift truck to be alert and to avoid making any assumptions that the driver – who may well be concentrating on a complex manoeuvre – has seen or heard you .

As unlikely as that may seem , progress in neuroscience and genetics in recent years makes it a very real possibility .
In fact , according to one philosopher , we have an ethical duty to consider the option .

SUPPORTERS of the US President , Barack Obama , are preparing to launch street protests against any plan to escalate the Afghan war .
At the same time , Democrats in Congress are in revolt against Mr Obama 's war strategy , which is expected to result in a further 20,000 combat troops being sent to the country .

Unease has been heightened by Friday 's NATO bombing of two fuel tankers hijacked by the Taliban , which killed about 125 people .
Local officials and relatives say many villagers were among the casualties .
NATO has launched an investigation into the strike .
The Washington Post reported yesterday that a German commander ordered the air strike based on intelligence from only one source , in possible violation of NATO rules .
Alexis Webb enters a small room at Washington University in St. Louis with walls , floor and ceiling painted dark green , shuts the door , turns off the lights and bends over a microscope in a black box draped with black cloth .
Through the microscope , she can see a single nerve cell on a glass cover slip glowing dimly .
The glow tells her the isolated nerve cell is busy keeping time .
Webb , a graduate fellow in the Neuroscience Ph.D. Program , working with Erik Herzog , Ph.D. , associate professor of biology in Arts & Sciences ; Nikhil Angelo , an undergraduate biology major ; and James Huettner , Ph.D. , associate professor of cell biology and physiology in the School of Medicine , has demonstrated that individual cells isolated from the biological clock can keep daily time all by themselves .
However , by themselves , they are unreliable .
The neurons get out of synch and capriciously quit or start oscillating again .
The biological clock , a one - square millimeter area of the brain called the suprachiasmic nucleus , or SCN , just above the roof of the mouth and atop the crossing of the optic nerves , comprises about 20,000 neurons .
These cells , remarkably , contain the machinery to generate daily , or circadian , rhythms in gene expression and electrical activity .
But the individual cells are sloppy and must communicate with one another to establish a coherent 24 - hour rhythm , says Herzog .
These features make the SCN a flexible clock that can reset to stay in synch in an ever - changing environment .
The underlying sloppiness is probably what allows us to adjust to local time when we cross time zones and to vary our sleep cycles with the season , say the WUSTL researchers .
The research is being published the week of Sept. 7 in the online Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
“ We ’ve known for more than 15 years that unicellular organisms like cyanobacteria can keep 24 - hour time , and isolated cells from the marine snail eye can as well , ” says Herzog .
“ But nobody was sure whether individual cells in vertebrates are circadian pacemakers . ”
The SCN includes many kinds of neurons that make different neurochemicals and connections within the SCN and to other parts of the brain .
“ Some scientists felt that all of the cells in the SCN would be intrinsically rhythmic and that there was nothing special about any of them , ” says Herzog .
“ Some thought that none of the cells would be rhythmic and that the rhythm arose instead from their network interactions , and a third group thought specialized SCN neurons would be rhythmic and the others would n’t be at all capable .
Our experiments proved all three hypotheses wrong . ”
Capturing the rhythm
Webb digested slices of mouse SCN with enzymes to isolate individual neurons and then plated the cells sparsely on a dish .
“ The neurons will actually attach to the glass and grow , ” says Webb , who is in the Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences .
“ And as long as you give them all of the nutrients they need , they ’ll live for months . ”
The cells had been genetically engineered to glow whenever they expressed the time - keeping gene Period 2 .
( The cells came from transgenic mice where the Period 2 gene had been linked to one found in firefly tails . )
The rhythmically waxing and waning glow was detected by a camera designed to capture the light from distant stars and so sensitive that it will register the passage of even a single cosmic ray .
The recordings showed that all cells seem to be able to keep a 24 - hour rhythm — there are no special pacemaker cells — but they do n’t seem to do it all the time .
Neurons that make different neurochemicals show circadian rhythms in gene expression , and none was more dependable than the others .
“ Single cells sometimes will be very robust and rhythmic , but most of the time they quit or lose the rhythm , ” says Webb .
“ It appears that the network structure of the SCN is important for stabilizing these sloppy intrinsic rhythms . ”
To show that different kinds of SCN neurons did not have rigidly defined roles , Webb exposed SCN to the drug TTX , a pufferfish toxin that shuts down cell - to - cell communication .
“ In a sense we just isolated the nerve cells again , ” she says , “ but chemically rather than physically and in a reversible way . ”
She washed off the TTX , and then added it again , to see if the second time the cells were exposed to the toxin , they would behave the same way .
“ We found cells that changed their behavior , ” she says .
“ So the first time they were isolated , or uncoupled , with TTX , they continued to oscillate , but the second time they stopped oscillating .
But we also saw the reverse : cells that were non-oscillatory becoming oscillatory . ”
Paradoxically the sloppiness of the clock is what makes it so precise .
“ The SCN is the master clock that synchronizes other biological clocks , like your liver or your lung .
Those peripheral clocks can keep 24 - hour time , but not for very long , ” says Herzog .
“ Because the SCN is built differently , it can self - sustain — it can keep on ticking like a good Timex . ”
The researchers are now focusing on the connections that help synchronize and stabilize these biological oscillators .

From Democracy Now -- Judge Rejects Blackwater Attempt to Dismiss Cases Filed by Iraqi Victims :
A federal judge has rejected a series of arguments by lawyers for the private military contractor Blackwater who were seeking to dismiss five war crimes cases brought by Iraqi victims against the company and its owner , Erik Prince .
We speak to award - winning investigative journalist and Democracy Now !
correspondent , Jeremy Scahill , author of Blackwater : The Rise of the World ’s Most Powerful Mercenary Army .
AMY GOODMAN : We ’re going to talk about Sudan in a minute , but right now we turn to a major decision here in the United States .
I ’m Amy Goodman , with Juan Gonzalez .
Juan ?
JUAN GONZALEZ : Well , a federal judge has rejected a series of arguments by lawyers for the private military contractor Blackwater who were seeking to dismiss five war crimes cases brought by Iraqi victims against the company and its owner , Erik Prince .
At the same time , the judge ruled that lawyers for the Iraqi plaintiffs need to amend and re-file their cases to provide more specific details on the alleged crimes before a decision can be made on whether the lawsuits will proceed .
Susan Burke , the lead attorney for the Iraqi victims , told The Nation magazine she was “ very pleased with the ruling . ”
While Blackwater ’s spokesperson , Stacy DeLuke said , quote , “ We are confident that [ the plaintiffs ] will not be able to meet the high standard specified in [ the judge ’s ] opinion . ”
AMY GOODMAN : For more , we ’re joined by Democracy Now !
video stream by award - winning investigative journalist and Democracy Now !
correspondent , Jeremy Scahill , author of the international bestseller Blackwater : The Rise of the World ’s Most Powerful Mercenary Army .
His article on the ruling is available online at TheNation.com .
Jeremy , welcome to Democracy Now !
It ’s being played by the mainstream media as a huge defeat for those who are taking on Blackwater , but you have a very different take .
Explain .
JEREMY SCAHILL : Well , I mean , when I got up yesterday morning and saw all these headlines from the Associated Press and other media outlets saying that a federal judge had tossed out all of the lawsuits against Blackwater , I was actually quite stunned .
I mean , that would have been a devastating development for the Iraqi victims of the company .
But then I actually got the fifty - six - page ruling from Judge T.S. Ellis , who , by the way , is a Reagan appointee , and I read it .
And actually , what you see in this document is that it ’s a very well - thought - out legal argument by Judge Ellis , where he ’s essentially saying to Blackwater , “ Your argument that you ca n’t be sued as a private company under the Alien Tort Statute is false .
Your argument that private individuals or companies cannot commit war crimes is false . ”
AMY GOODMAN : Whoops .
Looks like we just lost Jeremy .
Jeremy is speaking to us by video stream .
We ’re going to try to get him back on , and we ’ll try to get him on the phone .
But right now — we ’ll do that for the end of the show — we will turn to our next guest .
That , consider just a tease for the rest of that subject .
[...]
AMY GOODMAN : We go back right now to Jeremy Scahill to try to complete that conversation on the issue of a federal judge rejecting a series of arguments by lawyers for the private military contractor Blackwater , who were seeking to dismiss five war crimes cases brought by Iraqi victims against the company and its owner , Erik Prince .
Jeremy , we ’ve got you back on the Democracy Now ! video stream .
Very quickly , explain the significance of the case .
JEREMY SCAHILL : Well , I mean , basically , these are five cases brought by Iraqi civilians that were allegedly wounded by Blackwater and the families of Iraqis that were killed by Blackwater .
These are very high - stakes cases .
Blackwater is fighting passionately to have them thrown out .
They ’ve made arguments that they , as a company , ca n’t be sued , that it would violate the rights of the President of United States to make battlefield decisions , and if Blackwater was prosecuted , that would infringe upon the President ’s rights .
They ’ve said that they , as a company , ca n’t be sued for war crimes , because war crimes can only be committed by state actors or nations .
And what we saw here is that this conservative Judge Ellis said to Blackwater , “ No , none of that is valid . ”
What he did do , though , is he referenced a Supreme Court decision in May , Ashcroft v. Iqbal , which really reversed decades of case law and made it very , very difficult , more difficult , for plaintiffs to have their cases moved to the trial phase .
In other words , the bar was set much higher to proceed to trial .
So what the judge said to Susan Burke and the Center for Constitutional Rights , the lawyers representing these Iraqis , “ You need to re-file your cases with more evidence , and then we ’ll take it from there . ”
So , while it ’s being portrayed by the corporate media as a judge tossing out these cases , that quite clearly is not the case .
This was actually a pretty significant defeat for Blackwater and a victory not only for the Iraqis in this case , but also for those lawyers from the Center for Constitutional Rights that have spent decades trying to apply US laws to crimes committed abroad .
Blackwater remains in very , very hot water , not only because of this case , but also the US Justice Department is going to begin its prosecution of five Blackwater operatives for manslaughter charges relating to the Nisoor Square massacre in September of ’07 .
This is very high - stakes stuff , and the corporate media got it basically absolutely wrong .
AMY GOODMAN : Jeremy Scahill , we ’ll leave it there .
I want to thank you for being with us , award - winning journalist .
Tatras are generally infused with an innovative streak bordering on lunacy .
Case in point : a V8 - powered combat snowmobile designed to fight in the Russian winter .

In the late autumn of 2007 , I had the wonderful privilege to go on a private tour of the Tatra factory .
Nestled amongst the chilly mountains of Moravia in the town of Kopřivnice , the factory is a shadow of its former self , with less than a quarter of its original workforce .
The old Czech hands who remain , however , are still going at it hard : you pass lockers decorated with big - haired 70s women and big Tatra race trucks to wander among massive air - cooled dry - sumped V8 truck engines made on site , which will be fitted to Tatra ’s unique central backbone tube frames .

In Kopřivnice proper there is a museum dedicated to all things Tatra , a wildly imaginative and furiously creative collection of weird cars .
You see streamlined , futuristic T77’s from 1937 , 22 - liter W18 tank engines , racing monopostos , a one - off white roadster made for Joseph Stalin ’s birthday .
Then , head buzzing , you enter a room and face what is probably the weirdest automobile ass ever manufactured :

It ’s called the V855 and it ’s a snowmobile prototyped under German occupation in 1942 .
A thousand miles east , the Wehrmacht was engaged in expeditionary warfare against the Soviet Union , an adversary with no shortage of winter conditions .
The Germans needed everything they could throw at the rising tide of the Red Army , preferably things that could handle lots and lots of snow .
Advertisement
The base for the V855 was Tatra ’s T87 sedan , a barely disguised spaceship designed by the brilliant Hans Ledwinka — who got the Rosalind Franklin treatment from Ferdinand Porsche when the latter stole his ideas to create the Volkswagen Beetle — and the Hungarian engineer Pál Járay .
That the shape of the T87 is reminiscent of a certain airship that went down in flames at Lakehurst Naval Air Station in New Jersey is no accident : all the big Zeppelins , including the Hindenburg , were based on Járay designs from his years at Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH .

Lacking rear wheels , the 75 HP produced by the V855 ’s rear - mounted air - cooled 2.9 - liter V8 is directed to a giant propeller mounted above the engine and a trailing drum which also acts as a brake .
Steering is by the two pairs of skis .

Here ’s how Tatra describes the arrangement on a plaque in the museum :
This snowmobile was steered by two pairs of skis using the bigger steering wheel .
Propulsion was by pusher propeller and mechanical drum with cardan drive shaft .
The drum was also used as a brake .
Hand brakes acted on the rear skis .

The V855 never saw production : the project was cancelled after two prototypes .

Meanwhile , things were anything but quiet on the Eastern front .
It would be hard to argue that snowmobiles instead of tens of thousands of T - 34 ’s , a cold disregard for millions of casualties and a spirit of patriotism were what won the war for the Soviet Union , but one thing is for certain : German troops in their incresingly doomed quest for a more spacious Lebensraum were coming face to face with Soviet combat snowmobiles .

A new polll from WSJ / NBC corroborates some of the ugly data that came out of Gallup this morning , which indicates that sentiment about the economy is starting to backslide , after a brief tip up .
Fifty - eight percent of those polled say the economic slide still has a ways to go , up from 52 % in September and back to the level of pessimism expressed in July .
Only 29 % said the economy had " pretty much hit bottom , " down from 35 % last month .
Meanwhile , as the healthcare debate reaches its fever pitch , the poll is mixed .
Overall , respondents sent Mr. Obama mixed signals on his top policy initiatives .
His health - care plan continues to face a plurality of opposition -- 42 % say it is a bad idea , against 38 % who say it is a good idea .
But a key flash point in the health - care debate is showing steadily increasing support .
A government - run insurance plan that competes with private insurance plans -- the so - called public option -- is now backed by 48 % , compared with 42 % who oppose it .
To be honest , we do n't understand these numbers .
How can 48 % favor a public option , while only 38 % think that healthcare reform is a good idea .
The public is confused .
Finally on outlook for the economy going forward :
The economy is where real signs of stress are showing .
The recent recovery of the stock market has done little to temper the pessimism : 64 % said the rise of the Dow Jones Industrial Average did n't have much impact on their views of the economy ; 32 % said it was an important indication of economic improvement .
Just 42 % said the economy will get better in the next 12 months , down from 47 % in September .
In contrast , 22 % said things would get worse , up from 20 % , and 33 % said the economy would stay in the same condition , up from 30 % .

CHICAGO HEIGHTS , Ill. , July 9 ( UPI ) --
Police say a 50 - year - old man should not have become close to a woman he met in a strip club in Chicago Heights , Ill. , given she allegedly stole from him .
Police said the unidentified man from Park Forest , Ill. , originally met Rachel Klootwyk , 38 , in a strip club and soon learned of her alleged health and financial problems , the SouthtownStar reported Thursday .

After the man started helping out his strip club friend by paying some of her bills , Klootwyk allegedly learned his bank account information and began using his funds as her own .
Park Forest Police Chief Tom Fleming told the SouthtownStar the man alerted police after learning of $ 3,700 worth of unauthorized account withdrawals .
" These are tough economic times for everyone , including bad guys , " Fleming said regarding the felony financial identity theft charge against Klootwyk .
" Sometimes , you get what you expect .
Generally , you meet better people at church than you do at a strip club . "
Wook Kundor says she feels " lonely " during her husband 's absence
A 107 - year - old Malaysian woman has said she wants to get married again , for the 23rd time , as she fears her husband wants to leave her , says a report .
When Wook Kundor married four years ago to a man 70 years her junior their wedding photos made regional media .
But now she fears her husband will not return home after completing treatment for drug addiction in Kuala Lumpur .
She told reporters she felt " lonely " without her husband , ahead of the Muslim feast at the end of Ramadan .
' Insecurity '
Wook Kundor , who lives in northern Kuala Terengganu state , said she planned to visit her husband - Muhammad Noor Che Musa - if her neighbours would drive her to the capital , where he is receiving voluntary treatment .
She said she would re-consider her plans if the 37 - year - old told her he still had feelings for her .
Speaking to The Star newspaper in Malaysia she said : " Lately , there is this kind of insecurity in me .
" I realise I am an aged woman ...
My intention to re-marry is to fill my forlornness , and nothing more than that . "
Her husband , who used to be her lodger , had previously said it was " God 's will " that he fell in love with his wife to be .
Operation Maker ’s Mark : The Results Are In
Devoted foodies and restaurant newbies love Foobooz .
Sign up now for our twice weekly newsletter .
A couple of months ago , I reported my suspicions that Oscar ’s , a popular hole - in - the - wall bar at 1524 Sansom Street , was serving cheap bourbon to customers who ordered Maker ’s Mark .
I filed a formal complaint with the State Police ’s Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement , whose Officer Tara Amato paid a visit to Oscar ’s , confiscating six bottles of liquor .
Many of the bar ’s devoted patrons and one employee attacked on our comments page , accusing me of “ bad journalism ” and , worst of all , of being a “ bourbon fraud . ”
This morning , Officer Amato informed me that the state ’s crime lab ( yes , the same one that analyzes DNA evidence and fibers from murder scenes — probably a good indicator of why it took two months to process the seized liquor ) has concluded that the Maker ’s Mark she took from Oscar ’s in late July is , in fact , not the genuine article .
As she stated :
“ Results of the analysis of item 1.1 ( Maker ’s Mark Whiskey ) do not agree with the results of the analysis of the authentic sample ( item 2.1 ) of Maker ’s Mark Whiskey .
Item 1.1 was determined to be contaminated . ”
And , as a special bonus , Amato indicated that the bottle of Ketel One vodka was also not Ketel One .
The remaining bottles taken from the bar that day were “ determined to be true samples . ”
The results do not specify how the contamination occurred — did Oscar ’s water down the booze ?
substitute rotgut for the real thing ? — but clearly something is amiss .
Oscar ’s did not immediately return a call for comment this afternoon .
According to Amato , her office ’s legal department will now determine whether to issue a citation , after which a fine , suspension , or other penalty could be imposed .
Whether or not to issue a citation ?
Though it might come as a surprise to you , I used to be a fan of Oscar’s .
Good crowd .
Generally friendly staff .
And 23 - ounce draft beers for $ 3.25 .
But in light of these crime lab results , yeah , I think they ’d better go ahead and issue that citation .

American internet TV service Hulu could stage an abrupt turnaround and begin charging viewers for the right to watch programmes online .
The website – which is a joint venture between US television giants NBC , Fox , which is owned by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation , and Disney – is considering bringing in charges for some premium broadcasts .
According to News Corp 's deputy chairman , Chase Carey , the advertising - supported free - to - air model that Hulu has used so far is not viable in the long term .
" I think a free model is a very difficult way to capture the value of our content , " he told the Broadcasting & Cable OnScreen conference in New York on Thursday .
" Hulu concurs with that , it needs to evolve to have a meaningful subscription model as part of its business . "
The site – which offers shows including House , The Simpsons and Lost – has proven a hit with American television viewers since it launched in 2007 .
However , the economics of the service have been questioned since the value of advertising on the site is far lower than that achieved on traditional broadcast TV .
The move could put the brakes on plans to launch a British version of the service , which had been rumoured to be in the works .
With UK users flocking to the BBC iPlayer website , which offers the corporation 's programming for free , and Channel 4 recently forging a deal to put its shows on YouTube , it could prove tough to convince viewers to pay for online access .
It also brings into question the decision to shutter development of Project Kangaroo - a plan to create a more open version of the iPlayer , supported by all of Britain 's terrestrial broadcasters .
That scheme was blocked by the Competition Commission earlier this year , after objections from Murdoch - owned Sky .
While Carey did not confirm that there were concrete plans to introduce charges to Hulu , he suggested that a paywall could be introduced in 2010 .
" It 's time to start getting paid for broadcast content online , " he said .
In recent months senior News Corp executives have announced a series of plans to roll back the company 's free - to - access web strategy – including across its newspaper and TV outlets .
Murdoch himself has said he wants to bring in paywalls to fix the media 's " malfunctioning " business model , while former Times editor Robert Thomson – now running the Wall Street Journal – has lashed out at Google on several occasions for what he says is a parasitic attitude towards mainstream media .
Yesterday , Thomson repeated his attacks - telling Google vice president Marissa Meyer that she encouraged a loose relationship between media companies and consumers .
" Marissa unintentionally encourages promiscuity , " he said .
" The whole Google model is based on digital disloyalty – about disloyalty to creators . "
A rumor – or urban legend , if you will – has been circulating about the Tootsie Roll wrapper pretty much since the first candy was created in 1931 .
Certain wrappers were said to show a caricature of a Native American taking aim at a star with his bow and arrow .
A rumor began that you could get a free Tootsie Roll Pop if you found a star on your wrapper and sent it off to Tootsie Roll Industries .
Is it true ?
Sorry .
No .
Even Tootsie Roll Industries
Is in the Dark
Nobody seems to know how this rumor got started , least of all the folks at Tootsie Roll Industries in Chicago .
They 've been politely deflecting mail - in requests for free Tootsie Roll Pops ever since the 1930s .
The company maintains that there was never any sort of official promotion or contest associated with Tootsie Pop wrappers .
Where the notion came from is a mystery , although it may have originated or been kept alive when local stores began to give away free Tootsie Pops whenever anyone produced one of these wrappers .
It 's been said that some independent grocers still do unofficially honor the supposed free Tootsie Pop offer when kids bring the Indian wrappers into their stores for redemption .
But it 's neither sanctioned nor financed by Tootsie Roll Industries .
There Are a Lot of These Wrappers
There 's actually more to the erroneously coveted wrapper than just a star .
The complete illustration shows a boy dressed as a Native American shooting an arrow at the star .
This is the " Indian chief " most people mention when they repeat the rumor .
And according to Tootsie Roll Industries , the wrapper is not that rare .
The shooting star appears on one in every four to six wrappers .
Now consider how many Tootsie Rolls are created and run off the assembly lines every day .
Tootsie Roll Industries says it changes up the wrappers for the sake of variety .
Not much of a mystery there .
The Legend of the " Indian Wrapper "
For many years , the company responded to kids who wrote in to claim their free Tootsie Pop with an apologetic ( and surely disappointing ) note , but they 've also enclosed a short work of fiction called " The Legend of the Indian Wrapper " since 1982 .
Apparently , it 's intended to serve as a sort of consolation prize .
But might n't it be less distressing and more cost effective to simply chuck a free Tootsie Roll Pop in the mail ?
In fine ad - executive prose , the enclosed tale tells of a man " long , long ago , when all lollipops were made alike , " who wanted to make a new kind of sucker with something special inside .
But he could n't figure out how .
One day the man awoke " to find a grand Indian chief smiling at him .
The chief told the man that he would help him make a lollipop with a chewy candy center if the man promised the chief that he would never , ever , stop making them for people .
The man promised .
The ' Indian Wrapper ' is supposedly a sign that the grand chief has personally checked that particular lollipop for the chewy candy center . "
Here 's another explanation , straight from the company 's website : " Mr. Owl informed us that one night he was sitting on his branch and he came across a shooting star in the sky .
He suggested that we add the shooting star on the Tootsie Pop wrapper to give our fans the necessary luck that may be needed to find out just how many licks it takes to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop .
Over the years , thousands of people have tried and their lick counts have all varied .
There have even been studies done to try to figure out the age old question ! "
Recalculation and State and Local Relief By Arnold Kling
Tyler Cowen finds and responds to some criticisms of the Recalculation story .
Avent and Yglesias suggest that Kling is making up his own macro but the innovation is simply to call the adjustment process “ recalculation , ” to give it a more Austrian gloss .
He mentions plenty of predecessors to the sectoral shift story .
I would add James Tobin ’s AEA Presidential Address on inflation and unemployment .
For that matter , the old Lucas - Phelps “ island ” model is an adjustment story .
I am pushing the Recalculation story hard because I think that it is a mistake to try to do macro with a one - sector model where all off us work at GDP factories .
I want the profession to emerge from what Krugman calls the Dark Age of one - sector , representative - agent , rational - expectations models .
The point of the Recalculation story is not to argue against stimulus .
In fact , I am in favor of stimulus .
The Recalculation story may help support the kind of stimulus that I favor , which is an immediate cut in the employer contribution to the payroll tax .
I do not see how any story can support the kind of stimulus that was passed , where much of the spending will not take place until 2011 and after .
The Recalculation story does not tell you whether relief for state and local governments is a good stimulus idea .
But it does lead you to ask whether it is right to think of state and local governments as 50 Herbert Hoovers or 50 Wesley Mouches .
For those of you who do not know , Wesley Mouch is a fictional character in Atlas Shrugged who increases government control over the economy .
Herbert Hoover is also a fictional character , whose policies are laissez faire and balanced budgets .
( There was a real President Herbert Hoover , but he was interventionist and ran deficits . )
State and local governments obtained a lot of revenue during the boom–higher home prices do tend to raise property tax revenues .
So payrolls and pension plans expanded , average government salaries rose relative to average private sector salaries , state universities competed for top - drawer professors , and school systems held onto incompetent teachers .
If you think that ought to continue , then you should favor aid to state and local governments to get them through this period of low tax revenues .
If you think that has to change at some point , then stimulus funds will better help recalculation if they are distributed to other sectors .
Mr. Medvedev on Friday maintained that Russia did not feel obligated to respond to the United States as part of some deal .
But he added : “ There always is a score in politics .
And if our partners hear some of our concerns , we will , of course , be more attentive to theirs . ”
Mr. Medvedev and Mr. Obama are to meet at the United Nations in New York next week .
Russian officials did indicate that they would withdraw a proposal to base short - range missiles on Russia ’s western border , in Kaliningrad , though American officials had not seemed very worried about that Russian plan .
What else Russia might do to respond was a topic of speculation in both Washington and Moscow on Friday .
One issue was whether the Kremlin , after more closely examining the new Obama antimissile plan , would voice new protests about it .
Mr. Obama ordered the development of a system that would deploy smaller SM - 3 missile interceptors in 2011 , at first on ships , later on land in Europe .
They are aimed mostly at short - and medium - range Iranian missiles .
At least as currently designed , they are not capable of destroying Russia ’s intercontinental missiles , though they are expected to be eventually upgraded , Obama administration officials said .
The Obama plan calls for dozens and eventually possibly even hundreds of the smaller interceptors , not just the 10 larger ones included in Mr. Bush ’s plan .
Pavel Y. Felgenhauer , a military analyst who writes a column for Novaya Gazeta , an opposition newspaper in Moscow , said he doubted that the Kremlin would be able to complain about the new plan .
Mr. Felgenhauer emphasized that the Kremlin had opposed the Bush system because it believed , on the advice of the Russian military , that the system was intended not to bring down Iranian missiles , but to give the United States the potential to make a crippling first strike against Russia .
Also on Friday , in another sign of a warming in relations , NATO called for new cooperation with Moscow , including possibly on antimissile systems .
The endgame begins .
London waits on Washington .
Washington waits on Barack Obama .
Obama waits on Kabul .
Kabul waits on history .
The clarion of military bravura in Afghanistan sounds an ever more uncertain note .
It is obvious that this war is starting to stink , but no one dares say so .
Everyone waits .
Hillary Clinton even takes time off for diplomacy 's favourite round of golf , telling Irishmen or Palestinians how to behave themselves .
Reports from Washington suggest a battle royal is being fought , as happens at a turning point in every war .
It is between the loss - cutters and the one - last - pushers .
The cast is familiar .
The soldiers , led by the third general in a year to guide America 's Afghan war , Stanley McChrystal , are doing what soldiers always do .
They are asking for more troops , either 40,000 more ( a 60 % rise on the present American deployment ) or preferably 80,000 more .
This is coupled with our old friend , a " re-engineered " counter - insurgency strategy to win hearts and minds on the ground .
On the other hand much of Obama 's cabinet and , it would seem , the president himself , cannot see the point in pouring good men and money after bad when all intelligence from the front points to strategic failure .
Ever since Obama declared Afghanistan a " good war " he has been hoist on his own petard .
Having adopted the war as vital to America 's security , he can hardly admit that he was wrong while his generals are still urging him forward .
This is the moment in the approach of defeat when all stop thinking of war and start covering their backs .
Generals may advise against a conflict but , once committed , their profession demands that they promise victory if only enough troops are committed .
This means that when defeat occurs , they can blame politicians .
In Britain this has been the tactic of both the present and previous army chiefs , Sir David Richards and Sir Richard Dannat .
The latter has inexcusably taken himself off to the opposition Tory camp where he will doubtless persecute David Cameron with unhelpful advice .
Politicians are little better .
Craving the electoral elixir of military victory , they will do anything to avoid admitting the inevitability of defeat .
For the last three years in Afghanistan , every British politician has mouthed the same nonsense .
The war is " winnable but only if … " some unrealisable policy nostrum is adopted .
There " must be a determination " to win hearts and minds , build roads and schools , eradicate poppies , retrain the Afghan army and bomb safe havens .
Any rubbish will do when prefixed with if and suffixed with victory .
As for the poor bloody infantry , they are " dying for freedom " while politicians play for time .
Some glimmers of sanity are showing in Washington , if not in London .
Suddenly it is " time to negotiate with the Taliban " , as if this were unthinkable before .
There is talk of an " Iraqi - style surge " , of somehow separating Taliban from al - Qaida , of good Taliban and bad Taliban , of decapitating the Taliban 's extremist leadership with drone bombers .
There is even talk of the Taliban not being the real enemy of the west after all , as indeed they keep asserting .
Perhaps they are just colourful Pashtuns who mean no harm to anyone but each other .
Their former hospitality to al - Qaeda was a phenomenon of the 1990s that in future can best be prevented by means other than a regional war .
Enter those picadors , the historians , to taunt statesmen with darts of wisdom in their hour of torment .
In America , debate over the future of the war has , according to recent reports , degenerated into an intriguing " battle of the books " , on the dread precedent of Vietnam .
Was that defeat the result of politicians refusing the army resources for one last surge , as claimed in Lewis Sorley 's A Better War , or was it due to their losing control to the military over a doomed escalation , as claimed in Gordon Goldstein 's Lessons in Disaster ?
Needless to say , the Pentagon hawks are reading – and preaching – the former .
They want an Iraq - style surge in Afghanistan to take , hold and pacify Taliban territory and eventually drive the insurgents back over the border into Pakistan .
This would mirror what they believe would have happened in Vietnam after the 1968 Tet offensive , had American public opinion not lost the will to continue the war .
The doves are reading Gordon Goldstein and demanding an urgent withdrawal to Kabul .
Hamid Karzai's regime should be left to its fate by letting it negotiate with provincial warlords and the Taliban 's local commanders , as it often claims to want to do .
The eventual outcome , as in Vietnam , would be a regime more tolerable to the west and more hostile to al - Qaida than anyone imagined at the time .
As a sop to the hawks , the doves offer military force to be concentrated on al - Qaida leaders , with drone attacks wherever intelligence can find them .
Rather than Vietnam , they regard a better precedent as being Reagan 's abrupt retreat from Beirut in 1984 , under cover of bombing the Syrians in the Lebanon 's Chouf mountains .
Who now remembers that defeat ?
The scene is thus set for nemesis in both Washington and London .
Because of a gross over - reaction to 9/11 , leaders have turned a terrorist outrage from what should have been a global coalition against Islamic extremism into a costly and bloodthirsty display of military chauvinism .
America , Britain and the other Nato powers are hopelessly trapped .
All intelligence concludes that policy has failed .
Yet such is the awesome logic of war that nobody can bring themselves to listen .
The sooner the Afghan war ends , the better .
It has no real bearing on western security and is merely cover for politicians to avoid confronting their past mistakes .
But extrication will require a bold act of leadership by Obama .
Perhaps the looking - glass world of the Nobel peace prize could at last vindicate itself .
If prizes are to be awarded before rather than after they are deserved , perhaps Obama will feel obliged and emboldened .
Perhaps he will refuse to continue the slaughter in Afghanistan and accept that it is time to go home and earn his award .
Jacques Diouf , the director general of the Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) , today opened two days of talks on the challenges that lay ahead for farming over the next 40 years .
Around 300 experts and scientists on agriculture and food security turned up in Rome for the first day of the high level forum on how to feed the world in 2050 , which Diouf says was a " reflection of your dedication and commitment not only to the fight against hunger of today , but also to the well - being of future generations " .
Proceedings of the event can be watched via an FAO webcast .
The meeting will inform discussions at a three - day world summit on food security due to be attended by heads of state next month .
The aim of this week 's forum is to discuss the problems facing security and identify " tangible solutions " to deal with them , said Diouf .
During the first half of this century , agriculture will face several challenges , Diouf told delegates .
World population is expected to soar by 34 % to 9.1 billion by 2050 .
The population growth would take place entirely in developing countries and would centre on urban areas , which are predicted to swell by 86 % , or by nearly 3 billion people .
The rural population is expected to shrink by 18 % .
" The combined effect of population growth , strong income growth and urbanisation , with shifts in diet structures towards more nutritious and higher quality food is expected to result in almost the doubling of demand for food , feed and fibre , " said Diouf .
Agriculture , he said , would have no choice but to be more productive .
" This means the small rural workforce will have to produce more and better from fewer resources to meet demand . "
He added that global agriculture will have to cope with the effects of climate change - higher temperatures , greater rainfall and extreme weather conditions .
Climate change will also reduce water availability and lead to an increase in pests and diseases .
Farmers in Katine , north - east Uganda , are already suffering from the effects of drought and floods .
Forum delegates , who come from around the world , are expected to debate the investment needs , technologies and policy measures that will be needed to secure the world 's food supplies by 2050 .
The FAO calculates that $ 44bn a year in aid will need to be invested in agriculture in developing countries - around $ 7.9bn is currently being spent .
Greater investments from national budgets , foreign direct investment and private sector resources should be made available to fund access to irrigation systems , machinery , storage , more roads and better rural infrastructures , as well as on training farmers .
The FAO said it hopes next month 's summit will agree on " the complete and rapid eradication of hunger so that every human being on earth can enjoy the most fundamental of all human rights - the ' right to food ' and thus to decent life " .

The White Sox ace Lucas Giolito is getting more dominant the deeper he gets into his start against the A's .
He gave up a few well - struck balls in the early innings , none which found the green .
In the sixth , he mowed through Oakland , striking out the side and adding just 13 pitches to his tab .
That 18 up , 18 down and 73 pitches thrown .
The case is In re United States , — F.Supp.2d —-, 2009 WL 3416240 ( D. Or. 2009 ) , by District Judge Mosman .
The issue in the case is whether the government must notify a person when the government obtains a search warrant to access the contents of the person ’s e-mail account .
Judge Mosman concludes that Rule 41 and 18 U.S.C. 2703 ( a ) require the notice to be served on the ISP , not the account holder , as a statutory matter .
He then rules that there is no constitutional requirement of notice to the account holder because the Fourth Amendment does not apply to the e-mails under the third - party doctrine .
[ CORRECTION : SEE BOTTOM OF POST ]
Here ’s the relevant analysis :
The Fourth Amendment protects our homes from unreasonable searches and seizures , requiring that , absent special circumstances , the government obtain a search warrant based on probable cause before entering .
This is strong privacy protection for homes and the items within them in the physical world .
When a person uses the Internet , however , the user ’s actions are no longer in his or her physical home ; in fact he or she is not truly acting in private space at all .
The user is generally accessing the Internet with a network account and computer storage owned by an ISP like Comcast or NetZero .
All materials stored online , whether they are e-mails or remotely stored documents , are physically stored on servers owned by an ISP .
When we send an e-mail or instant message from the comfort of our own homes to a friend across town the message travels from our computer to computers owned by a third party , the ISP , before being delivered to the intended recipient .
Thus , “ private ” information is actually being held by third - party private companies .
This feature of the Internet has profound implications for how the Fourth Amendment protects Internet communications - if it protects them at all .
The law here remains unclear and commentators have noted that there are several reasons that the Fourth Amendment ’s privacy protections for the home may not apply to our “ virtual homes ” online .
First , it is uncertain whether we have a reasonable expectation of privacy in information sent through or stored by ISPs because the Fourth Amendment does not protect information revealed to third parties .
[ Citation to work of bald academic deleted . ]
Here , the defendants voluntarily conveyed to the ISPs and exposed to the ISP ’s employees in the ordinary course of business the contents of their e-mails .
The Google privacy policy explicitly states that Google will share personal information of its subscribers when it has “ a good faith belief that access , use , preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to … satisfy any applicable law , regulation , legal process or enforceable governmental request . ”
Google Privacy Policy , http:// www.google.com/privacypolicy.html ( last visited May 13 , 2009 ) .
The court understands that other ISPs have similar privacy policies .
See , e.g. , Microsoft Online Privacy Statement , http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/fullnotice.mspx ( last visited May 13 , 2009 ) ( stating that personal information may be shared to “ comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process ” ) ; AOL Network Privacy Policy , http://about.aol.com/aolnetwork/aol_pp ( last visited May 13 , 2009 ) ( “ The contents of your online communications , as well as other information about you as an AOL Network user , may be accessed and disclosed in response to legal process ( for example , a court order , search warrant or subpoena ) ; [ and ] in other circumstances in which AOL believes the AOL Network is being used in the commission of a crime … . ” ) .
Thus subscribers are , or should be , aware that their personal information and the contents of their online communications are accessible to the ISP and its employees and can be shared with the government under the appropriate circumstances .
Much of the reluctance to apply traditional notions of third party disclosure to the e-mail context seems to stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of the lack of privacy we all have in our e-mails .
Some people seem to think that they are as private as letters , phone calls , or journal entries .
The blunt fact is , they are not .
When AIDS researchers released results last month from a six - year trial in Thailand of a new AIDS vaccine , they said it showed some promise for new avenues of research , though they freely admitted their data was weak .
Now two published accounts citing anonymous AIDS researchers who were given confidential briefings about the trial results have reported that the data , released on Sept. 24 , may be even weaker than the authors admitted  essentially , instead of being 31 percent better than nothing , the vaccine might be only 26 percent better .
The accounts were on Science magazine ’s Web site and in The Wall Street Journal .
The debate is over which participants in the study should be counted  all 16,395
Thais who participated at some point or only the ones who got all the doses of the vaccine and stayed in the study for the full time .
The researchers said last month that the vaccine seemed to work 31 percent better than a placebo  and there was only a 4 percent chance that that 31 percent difference was simply a fluke .
To some it seemed that a promising step had been made in the long search for a vaccine against AIDS , which has killed more than 25 million people .
Gen . Stanley McChrystal ’s latest insubordination was an act of sheer petulance .
We already know via unnamed reliable sources that McChrystal has threatened to resign if he does n’t get the next wave of escalation in Afghanistan he wants .
The sanctioned leak of his report on Afghanistan to Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and McChrystal ’s 60 Minutes infomercial made it clear to everyone who had n’t already noticed that he and his allies in the long - war mafia were waging information warfare against President Barack Obama , a campaign that has led to a call from the right - wing fringe for a military coup to solve " the Obama problem . "
McChrystal upped the ante with an Oct. 1 address to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London , where he said , “ we must show resolve ” in Afghanistan and that “ uncertainty disheartens our allies and emboldens our foes . ”
Asked if a more limited counterterrorism effort , rather than the full - blown counterinsurgency campaign he has proposed that would involve a half million troops or more , would succeed in Afghanistan , McChrystal said , “ The short answer is : no .
You have to navigate from where you are , not where you wish to be .
A strategy that does not leave Afghanistan in a stable position is probably a shortsighted strategy . ”
That was a slap to the face of his commander in chief , President Barack Obama , who has convened a strategy conference to consider McChrystal ’s proposal along with alternative strategies .
You might ask if McChrystal , the four - star in command of all U.S. and NATO forces in a critical theater of war in Central Asia , did n’t have better things to do on Oct.
1 than give a chalk talk to a warfare - centric think - tank in London .
The horrific answer is that drumming up support for his escalation in Afghanistan is the most important thing Stan McChrystal has to do , at least from the perspective of the long - war mob .
The vaunted counterinsurgency field manual that McChrystal proposes to adhere to is a how - to guide for constructing a country from the molecular level up .
That ’s not just nation building ; it ’s nation birthing .
It might work in a nation that ’s a third the size of Rhode Island .
We ’re as likely to turn Afghanistan into a real country as we are to make a herd of cats march in a straight line .
What McChrystal suggests is that we can transform a corrupt and violent patch of society in a country the size of Texas by pouring bribes and firepower into it .
McChrystal says he needs more U.S. troops to " buy time " for Afghan military and police forces to take control of the country in 2013 .
The Afghan military and police forces are n’t likely to be able to take control of their country by 2113 .
Alexander the Great never really had control there .
Afghanistan has never been a threat to anyone except people who tried to conquer it .
It ’s a sleepy hollow that has been the boneyard of many empires , including the British and the Russians .
Afghanistan ’s connection to 9/11 is fuzzy at best .
Nobody involved in those attacks , including mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , actually came from Afghanistan .
McChrystal admits there is no sign of al - Qaeda in Afghanistan , and what ’s left of al - Qaeda in Pakistan appears to consist of eight or ten Islam - hooligans who live on the run .
To counter this nonexistent threat , McChrystal wants America to make an all - in commitment to Afghanistan .
McChrystal ’s superiors – Gen. David Petraeus , chief of Central Command and Adm . Mike Mullen , Joint Chief of Staff chairman – have endorsed McChrystal ’s madness even though they can’t give a good reason why they ’re behind it .
We need a good , long think , not just about our Afghanistan strategy but American grand strategy , the purposeful employment of all our instruments of power .
The first thing we need to recognize is that our military is out of control .
It drives our foreign and domestic policies and it gives us little in the way of national security .
We have no military peer competitors .
The defense budgets of China and Russia are about 10 percent of ours .
Pismire Iran ’s defense budget is less than 1 percent of ours .
America and its Western allies account for more than 95 percent of global arms sales .
If anyone wants an arsenal that can match ours , they ’ll have to buy it from us .
The dirty little wars we ’re fighting now are n’t making us safer .
Every bomb and bullet we expend creates more terrorists than it eliminates .
The reason we have n’t had another 9/11 is n’t that we ’re " fighting them over there . "
9/11 would n’t have happened at all except for the circle competition culture among the alphabet - soup agencies ( CIA , FBI , FAA , NCA , JFCOM , etc. ) that should have kept it from happening .
Today , preventing a terrorist attack is good for one ’s career .
( Counterterrorism : it ’s not just for losers anymore . )
Ironically , the U.S. military ’s ability to achieve national goals has decreased as its power increased .
We were an also - ran batch of ex-colonials until World War I ( a war I ’ll always maintain we should have stayed out of .
We would have become a global hegemon much sooner if we had let Europe bleed itself white and then offered to feed it for a few decades while it grew , or imported from us , a new generation of fathers . )
World War I led to World War II , which led to the Cold War and the dirty little Third World wars like Korea and Vietnam that accompanied it .
When the Berlin Wall came tumbling down , we were promised a peace dividend that never materialized ( de- materialized ? ) .
Now , a media - savvy Pentagon has dared President Obama to stand up to it .
I ’m hoping he does .
I ’ve said for some time that he needs to demand the resignation letters from every bird colonel and general officer and every Department of Defense official whose job title includes the word " secretary . "
Those measures sound draconian , but they ’re the kind of things Obama has to do if he hopes to get the military back on its leash .
If he can ’t , Allah help us all .
Ardi evolved from the common ancestor we share with chimpanzees and was equally at home walking on the ground and swinging through the trees
The remains of a female who lived and died at the dawn of humanity have been uncovered in Ethiopia , giving the clearest picture yet of the origin of our species .
The partial skeleton , the oldest from a human ancestor ever ­discovered , belonged to a female who walked on two legs but was adept at climbing trees and moving through the forest canopy some 4.4 m years ago .
Experts have described the find as the most important regarding human evolution in the past century .
The female , named Ardi by the researchers who worked on her , belongs to a new species Ardipithecus ramidus and may be the earliest human ancestor ever discovered that was capable of walking upright .
The finding sheds light on a critical but unknown period of evolution at the root of the human family tree , shortly after our ancestors split from chimpanzees more than 6 m years ago .
Remnants of the skeleton , skull , pelvis , hands , feet and other bones were excavated from the reddish - brown sediments of an ancient river system near the village of Aramis in northern Ethiopia , along with fragments from at least 35 other individuals .
Fossil hunters first glimpsed the new species in 1992 when a tooth belonging to Ardipithecus was spotted among pebbles in the desert near Aramis .
Over the next two years , the researchers scoured the area on hands and knees and slowly uncovered pieces of bone from the hand , ankle and lower jaw , and finally a crushed skull .
A total of 47 researchers then spent a further 15 years removing , preparing and studying each of the fragments ahead of the publication tomorrow of an in - depth description of the species in 11 papers in the US journal Science .
Their investigation shows Ardi stood four feet ( 1.2 m ) tall and weighed a little under eight stone ( 50kg ) , making her similar in size and weight to a living chimpanzee .
But many of Ardi's features are far more primitive than those seen in modern apes , suggesting chimpanzees and gorillas have evolved considerably after they split from the common ancestor they shared with humans .
The discovery of Ardi provides vital clues about the earliest human ancestor that lived at the fork in the evolutionary road that led to humans on one side and chimps on the other .
" Darwin was very wise on this matter .
Darwin said we have to be really careful .
The only way we 're really going to know what this last common ancestor looked like is to go and find it , " said Tim White , a lead author on the study and professor of human evolution at the University of California , Berkeley .
" Well , we have n't found it , but we 've come closer than we 've ever come , at 4.4 million years ago . "
The remains of animals , seeds and pollen uncovered at the excavation site reveal it to have been a woodland where colobus monkeys swung in trees full of swifts , doves and lovebirds , and spiral - horned antelope , elephants , shrews and early forms of peacock roamed the forest floor below .
The discovery is being seen as more important than Lucy , the 3.2 m - year - old skeleton of a potential human ancestor which proved at a stroke that early humans walked upright before evolving large brains .
The remains of Lucy , who belongs to the species Australopithecus afarensis , were uncovered in another part of Ethiopia in 1974 .
" We thought Lucy was the find of the century but , in retrospect , it is n't , " palaeontologist Andrew Hill at Yale University told Science .
" It 's worth the wait . "
Measurements of Ardi's skeleton reveal she had a brain the size of a chimp's , but very long arms and fingers , and opposable toes that would have helped her grasp branches while moving through the forest .
Though Ardi would have spent much of her time in the trees , her pelvis was adapted to walking upright when she came down to the forest floor .
Her unusual skeleton led White to comment of her species that " if you wanted to find something that moved like these things , you 'd have to go to the bar in Star Wars . "
Analysis of Ardi's teeth points to a diet of figs and other fruit , leaves and small mammals .
Remarkably , both male and female Ardipithecus had very small incisors and canines , which are enlarged in modern apes .
The finding suggests that unlike chimpanzees , baboons and gorillas , the male did not bare its teeth in battles over females and was already part of a more cooperative social group .
It was probably involved in the parenting process .
" Natural selection has led to the reduction of this male canine tooth very , very early in time , right at the base of our branch of the family tree . "
It may take years to confirm exactly where Ardi fits in the history of human evolution .
One possibility is that she is a direct ancestor of Lucy 's species , Australopithecus .
" The most important thing in the broader sense is that we now no longer have to guess about where we came from ...
We now have an evidentiary basis for understanding that we did n't get here in the form we see today , we evolved , " said White .
Chris Stringer , head of human origins at the Natural History Museum in London , said : " This is as important as the Lucy skeleton in terms of what it tells us about an even earlier stage of human evolution . "
" The assumption among many researchers is that while humans have evolved a lot , chimps have n't changed much , so we can use them as a model of the common ancestor we shared .
But why should n't chimps have changed ?
Everything evolves . "
" We are really trying to establish what set us off on our evolutionary path , " he added .
" What would start the process off ?
That is one of the great mysteries . "

Time is running out to find a solution to the crisis
The ousted president of Honduras has said the latest proposals from the government that replaced him amount to a second coup d'etat .
Negotiations between the two parties have failed to make a breakthrough .
The interim president has said he would step down , but only if Manual Zelaya gives up his claim to the presidency .
Mr Zelaya told the BBC he was being subjected to psychological torture during his refuge in the Brazilian embassy in the capital .
During three weeks of talks with the interim government , Manuel Zelaya and a small group of supporters have remained inside the embassy in Tegucigalpa .
He has been there for a month after being ousted from power in late June .
In an interview with the BBC World Service , he claimed he was being subjected to soldiers playing loud music through the night and refusing to allow in basic comforts , including mattresses to sleep on .
The talks with the interim government of Roberto Micheletti have broken down a number of times , and all over the same central demand .
Mr Zelaya insists that he be allowed to serve out the remaining months of his single term .
But those behind last June 's coup say that is impossible .
Mr Zelaya said that failure to resolve the problem would show up the weakness of the Organisation of American States ( OAS ) and the United Nations .
He has received much vocal support from Washington , Europe and Latin America , but the sanctions imposed have been tepid and not enough to change the minds of those who removed him from power .
The OAS says it has not given up hope of a negotiated solution .
But time is running out .
Elections are due at the end of next month .
If there is no settlement by then , the political crisis could flare up .

Big Oil has attacked a global scientific consensus on climate change ; now some local authors are exposing its tactics .
For many years , University of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver has watched with horror as the deniers of climate change have managed to confuse the public about global warming .
Weaver , a lead author with the Nobel Prize–winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , told the Georgia Straight in a recent phone interview that he has “ lived the misinformation ” and “ lived the propaganda ” that are being fomented by think tanks and advocacy groups financed by oil and coal companies .
Weaver said that on many occasions , he has seen people pretend that they ’re experts on climate science when they ’re not .
“ In the climate - science community , we think we ’ve been screaming inside a closed room and nobody is listening , ” Weaver declared .
So after veteran Vancouver public - relations executive James Hoggan and writer Richard Littlemore finished a new book called Climate Cover - Up : The Crusade to Deny Global Warming ( Greystone Books , $ 20 ) , Weaver said it felt like somebody had pulled an angry gorilla off his back .
“ You feel this big sense of relief , ” he said .
“ Finally , the truth is coming out . ”
Climate Cover - Up is one of two new books written by local authors — the other being Donald Gutstein ’s Not a Conspiracy Theory : How Business Propaganda Hijacks Democracy ( Key Porter Books , $ 22.95 ) — that show how the fossil - fuel industry has sunk millions of dollars into campaigns designed to derail public concerns about human - induced climate change .
Both books demonstrate how the world ’s largest oil company , ExxonMobil , has funded numerous think tanks , including the Vancouver - based Fraser Institute , which later issued reports criticizing the IPCC ’s scientific consensus on global warming .
In December , a major United Nations climate conference will begin in Copenhagen to try to reach a new international treaty on global emissions that will be approved by the United States , China , and India .
Climate Cover - Up and Not a Conspiracy
Theory offer compelling insights for anyone interested in learning why there is so much confusion about this issue in the media .
The Hoggan and Littlemore book focuses exclusively on global warming , touching on such things as the coal industry ’s efforts to sideswipe mitigation measures .
It also focuses on how clever use of language is helping to undermine action on climate change .
In the other book , Gutstein , a retired SFU communications professor , does n’t merely look at how industrial forces have used propaganda to stall action around climate change .
He includes case studies showing how business groups have also influenced the debate about medicare , continental integration , DDT , and other areas through slick public - relations techniques that often zero in on key decision makers and sympathetic national media commentators .
The two books both describe how industry - created front groups — such as the Advancement of Sound Science Coalition , the Global Climate Coalition , Friends of Science , and the Canadian Coalition for Responsible Environmental Solutions — have tried to convince politicians , the media , and the public that there is a vigorous scientific debate about climate change .
Weaver said that these campaigns can yield tremendous returns for industry if they stall emission reductions .
Right now , he suggested , “ ideology ” seems to be driving the debate .
“ You get far more bang for the buck if you can get the Vancouver Sun editorial staff to believe that this global warming is nothing more than a socialist conspiracy to transfer wealth to the developing world , ” he said .
However , according to Weaver , there is little scientific debate , notwithstanding what you might read in Canadian newspapers .
In his 2008 book , Keeping Our Cool : Canada in a Warming World ( Viking Canada ) , he highlights how the IPCC — a collection of 2,000 international climate scientists — has achieved a broad scientific consensus that human beings are changing the climate by burning fossil fuels such as oil and coal , which increases the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
These gases , including carbon dioxide , form a blanket around the earth , trapping heat .
Warmer temperatures have prolonged B.C. ’s mountain - pine - beetle infestation and contributed to forest fires around the world , the melting of glaciers , the shrinking summer ice in the Arctic Ocean , and expanded deserts .
Fisheries and Oceans Canada has even suggested that the loss of Pacific salmon could be linked to warming ocean temperatures .
In 2007 , the IPCC stated in its Fourth Assessment Report that most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the middle of the 20th century “ is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic [ human - generated ] greenhouse gas concentrations ” .
Canada emitted 22.6 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide between 1990 and 2002 .
“ This is almost the same as the 23.1 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted by India , even though its population is thirty - four times greater than ours , ” Weaver writes in his book .
Weaver told the Straight that science is about gathering available information and then developing an explanation for it .
“ It explains all known observations with a theory , ” he said .
“ Propaganda is the opposite — you find the observations that support the theory . ”
To cite one recent example of the latter , Weaver said he was recently given a copy of lesson plans on global warming that were distributed to B.C. schools by the Fraser Institute .
He described these lessons as “ shocking ” and “ shameful ” .
“ It ’s not science that ’s being given out , ” Weaver charged .
“ It ’s propaganda . ”
Hoggan , the author of Climate Cover - Up , told the Straight by phone that average people need to gain a greater understanding of the issue to avoid being misled by the media , which echo the claims of industry - financed groups .
He described these campaigns as “ manipulation of the highest order ” and “ Darth Vader public relations ” , suggesting that consulting firms can generate hundreds of thousands of dollars by coming up with simple phrases like “ junk science ” or “ clean coal ” to downplay the issue .
James Hoggan says Climate Cover-Up
exposes “ Darth Vader public relations ” .
“ This is a very , very serious problem , and the way it ’s being reported on is completely misleading and , I think , irresponsible , ” Hoggan said , singling out the National Post and its owner , Canwest Global Communications Corp. , for special criticism .
Hoggan , who chairs the David Suzuki Foundation , said climate change could have a dramatic effect on people ’s lives around the world .
“ We ’re talking about people starving , ” he said .
“ We ’re talking about mass migrations away from uninhabitable parts of the globe in parts of Africa and Asia , in places like Bangladesh . ”
On the day that Hoggan spoke to the Straight , Globe and Mail columnist Rex Murphy wrote yet another column denying the seriousness of climate change .
Hoggan claimed that all of Murphy ’s points that day were originally conceived by industry - funded front groups .
“ Those are paid arguments , ” Hoggan said .
“ He just happens to pick them up as an ideologue .
I think that [ if ] you repeat disinformation enough , people actually start to believe it . ”
He added that journalists should ask “ very basic questions ” of anyone who suggests that climate change is not a problem .
“ The first question we have to ask is whether or not they ’re actually climate scientists , ” Hoggan said .
“ Then I would ask whether or not they ’re practising climate science .
Are they actually doing climate science ?
Then the third question we have to ask is , ” ˜Are they taking money from industry ? ’ ”
On October 18 at the Hollywood Theatre on Vancouver ’s West Side , the Fraser Institute hosted a screening of Not Evil Just Wrong , which is an attack on former U.S. vice president Al Gore ’s An Inconvenient Truth .
It was a classic example of the type of communication on global warming that Hoggan , Littlemore , and Gutstein warn about in their books .
Created by Irish filmmaker Phelim McAleer and his wife , Ann McElhinney , the film zeroes in on Gore ’s opposition to new fossil - fuel - fired power plants that do n’t capture and store their carbon emissions .
Not Evil Just Wrong suggests that this approach will harm the U.S. economy and impose hardship on working families .
It slickly intersperses images of Gore and an outlandish Christian televangelist , as if to convey that Gore ’s forecasts about global warming are as kooky as anything you might find on Sunday - morning television .
It also takes a run at James Hansen , director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies , who declared in 1988 that he was 99 percent confident that global warming was under way .
Almost everyone quoted in the film is not a practising climate scientist .
Some of the sources — including Fred Singer , Roger Innis , Ross McKitrick , and Steve McIntyre — are covered extensively in Not a Conspiracy Theory .
One practising climate scientist in Not Evil Just Wrong who is a critic of the climate - change consensus — Richard Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — was described as a “ lone voice in the wilderness ” by the Los Angeles Times in 2001 .
McAleer gave extensive screen time to Patrick Moore —a B.C. industry consultant who claims to be a cofounder of Greenpeace — to criticize environmentalists and offer his views on global warming .
“ I do n’t believe there is a climate catastrophe , ” Moore says at one point in the film .
On other occasions , he suggests that environmentalists really do n’t like people , which is why they ’re more concerned about protecting wildlife .
In a discussion with the audience after the screening , Moore said it ’s “ simply wrong ” to think that climate change has become “ almost the only important issue ” in the world .
“ They have tried to make the word skeptic into a dirty word when , in fact , it is every thinking person and every scientist who needs to be a skeptic , ” Moore declared to sustained applause from the audience .
McAleer , who is not a climate scientist , later told the crowd at the Hollywood Theatre that international treaties on climate change are “ the longest and least read suicide notes in history ” because they will wreck people ’s quality of life .
“ No one reads these treaties , ” he claimed .
“ But they ’re going to radically change our lives — radically — you know , because it ’s a tax on everything you do and everything you are .
It ’s a tax on every light switch .
It ’s a tax on every room in your house from the attic to the garage .
It ’s a tax on your car .
It ’s a tax on your insulation .
It ’s a tax on your heat .
It ’s a tax on your thermostat . ”
Then he said it was “ no coincidence ” that environmentalism rose to prominence as communism declined , because environmentalists and communists both “ take money from the middle class , bring it into the government , and then rely on government to distribute it to tax - free job projects run by their own supporters ” .
Dean Pelkey , communications director of the Fraser Institute , later told the Straight by phone that the producers paid for their own travel arrangements and the institute incurred costs for hosting screenings in different Canadian cities .
“ We did not receive any funding for publicizing Not Evil Just Wrong from any oil company or any coal company , ” Pelkey said , noting that the institute is in “ general agreement ” with the film ’s message .
In Not a Conspiracy Theory , Gutstein points out that the Fraser Institute has been challenging the scientific consensus on climate change since the 1990s .
He notes that former staffer Laura Jones , now with the Canadian Federation of Independent Business , edited a Fraser Institute book in 1997 called Global Warming : The Science and the Politics , which included chapters by several U.S. global - warming deniers .
Mother Jones once reported that ExxonMobil provided $ 8.6 million between 2000 and 2003 to a bunch of think tanks and other groups that have raised public doubt about global warming .
Gutstein notes in his book that this included $ 960,000 to the American Enterprise Institute , $ 1.4 million to the Competitive Enterprise Institute , $ 340,000 to the Heritage Foundation , $ 310,000 to the George C. Marshall Institute , and $ 140,000 to the Hoover Institution .
Pelkey said that ExxonMobil contributed $ 63,000 to the Fraser Institute in 2003 , and another $ 63,000 in 2004 .
In his book , Gutstein traces the first media mention of a “ made - in - Canada solution to climate change ” to a 2002 speech by then - outgoing Imperial Oil president Robert Peterson .
Peterson , an opponent of the Kyoto Protocol , told shareholders at the annual general meeting that there were “ too many theories chasing not enough facts to support the theory of global climate change ” .
From that point forward , Gutstein reports , Conservative politicians and commentators began calling for a “ North American solution ” or a “ made - in - Canada solution ” to climate change .
This coincided with National Public Relations launching the Canadian Coalition for Responsible Environmental Solutions with the goal of planting the made - in - Canada solution .
The propaganda campaign included television advertisements and a Canadian Taxpayers Federation –financed study on the impact of the Kyoto Protocol on Canadian paycheques .
It was prepared by Ross McKitrick , an economist and Fraser Institute fellow who shows up in Not Evil Just Wrong .
Gutstein noted that a key operative in the NPR campaign , Guy Giorno , later became Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s chief of staff .
In a phone interview with the Straight , Gutstein said the Fraser Institute ’s budget doubled over a recent five - year period , rising from $ 6.9 million in 2004 to $ 13.9 million in 2008 .
Gutstein said the media “ are enormously at fault ” for not pressing the Fraser Institute harder to reveal who funds its research .
“ I think the Fraser Institute is kind of funding - driven , ” he said .
“ They ’re still inviting these guys like Lord Lawson and Lord Monckton [ two British climate - change deniers ] out here .
Why are they doing that ?
Because they ’ve got the money to do it .
The oil patch wants them to keep doing it . ”
Pelkey , however , insisted that the institute ’s board of trustees and the contributors have no impact whatsoever on what issues come under scrutiny .
“ The research that we do is determined by the directors of the various research departments , ” he said .
For his part , Hoggan said he thinks think tanks and industry front groups should be stripped of their right to hide their sources of funding .
“ Canadians are concerned about climate change in general , although they are confused about it , ” he said .
“ But we also do n’t want to see ourselves embarrassed internationally by our government — and our government failing to live up to its international obligations on the most important environmental issue we ’ve ever faced . ”
So what does Weaver , one of the world ’s top climate scientists , think Canada should do at the Copenhagen climate talks , which begin on December 7 ?
“ I could sum it up very quickly , ” he replied .
“ Canada should just shut up because it has lost all credibility in the last few years on this portfolio .
Nobody respects Canada ’s opinion on this anymore . ”
Weaver said that if he ’d been asked six months ago , he would have said that the Copenhagen negotiations are “ crucial ” for the future of the planet .
However , he explained that China ’s recent public recognition of the problem — and President Hu Jintao ’s promise last month to curb the increase in carbon - dioxide emissions — have given him hope for the future , even if the climate treaty gets hijacked by backroom deals .
“ I actually think China is going to show leadership on this , and the rest of the western world will follow , ” Weaver predicted .
‘ WHOM THE gods would destroy , ’’ the late Irving Kristol once observed , “ they first tempt to resolve the Arab - Israeli conflict . ’’
Maybe “ destroy ’’ was a bit strong , but there is no denying that American presidents seem irresistibly drawn to the belief that they can succeed where others have failed and conjure a lasting peace between Israel and its Arab enemies .
This diplomacy has gone by various names - Oslo , the road map , Camp David , and so on - but time and again it has led not to the end of the conflict but to its intensification .
In his memoirs , former president Bill Clinton describes Yasser Arafat ’s refusal to accept the extraordinarily generous terms for a permanent settlement offered by Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel at Camp David in 2000 .
That refusal led to a Palestinian terror war , the bloody Second Intifada , and when Arafat called Clinton in January 2001 to tell him what a great man he was , Clinton was bitter .
“ I am not a great man , ’’ he told Arafat .
“ I am a failure , and you have made me one . ’’
Of course , if Clinton was a failure so were the two George Bushes .
Each made it his goal to resolve the Arab - Israeli conflict , each convened a grand international conference for that purpose , and each left the situation worse than he had found it .
In his first nine months as president , Barack Obama has shown every sign of succumbing to the same temptation .
Two days after moving in to the White House , he named George Mitchell , the former Senate majority leader , his special envoy to the region .
He pressured Israel ’s prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , into endorsing a “ two - state solution . ’’
He declared that “ the moment is now ’’ to achieve peace in the Middle East .
Unlike his recent predecessors , Obama has gone out of his way to signal a distinct coolness toward Israel and its interests .
At a White House meeting with the leaders of American Jewish organizations in July , he suggested that because there had been “ no daylight ’’ between Israel and the United States when George W. Bush was president , there had been “ no progress ’ ’ toward peace .
In fact , there had often been “ daylight ’’ between Washington and Jerusalem during the Bush years .
There had been plenty of movement , too , from the adoption of the road map to the Israeli “ disengagement ’ ’ from Gaza to the final - status negotiations that occupied much of 2008 .
Still : Obama was right when he said there had been “ no progress ’ ’ toward Arab - Israeli peace under Bush .
Nor had there been any under Clinton .
Nor , as things stand now , will there be any under Obama .
Why ?
Because the “ peace process ’’ to which all of them , their sharp differences notwithstanding , have been so committed is not a formula for ending the decades - long war in the Holy Land , but for prolonging it .
In an important article in the current Middle East Quarterly , Daniel Pipes reviews the terrible failure of the 1993 Oslo accords , and homes in on the root fallacy of the diplomatic approach it embodied : the belief that the Arab - Israeli war can “ be concluded through good will , conciliation , mediation , flexibility , restraint , generosity , and compromise , topped off with signatures on official documents . ’’
For 16 years , Israeli governments , prodded by Washington , have sought to quench Palestinian hostility with concessions and gestures of good will .
Yet peace today is more elusive than ever .
“ Wars end not through good will but through victory , ’’ Pipes writes , defining victory as one side compelling the other to give up its war goals .
Since 1948 , the Arabs ’ goal has been the elimination of Israel ; the Israelis ’ , to win their neighbors ’ acceptance of a Jewish state in the Middle East .
“ If the conflict is to end , one side must lose and one side win , ’’ argues Pipes .
Diplomacy cannot settle the Arab - Israeli conflict until the Palestinians abandon their anti-Israel rejectionism .
US policy should therefore be focused on making them abandon it .
The Palestinians must be put “ on notice that benefits will flow to them only after they prove their acceptance of Israel .
Until then - no diplomacy , no discussion of final status , no recognition as a state , and certainly no financial aid or weapons . ’’
So long as American and Israeli leaders remain committed to a fruitless Arab - Israeli “ peace process , ’’ Arab - Israeli peace will remain unachievable .
Let the newest Nobel peace laureate grasp and act upon that insight , and he will do more to hasten the conflict ’s end than any of his well - meaning predecessors .

Winehouse has launched her own record label , Lioness , with Island
Amy puts best friends in the spotlight on new label
Singer Amy Winehouse 's new album is expected to be completed next year , according to her record label Island .
" I 've heard a couple of song demos that absolutely floored me , " Island co-president Darcus Beese said .
" Hopefully we 'll have her album next year . "
He said the singer had been writing and recording " in fits and starts " .
Winehouse 's last album Back To Black , which has sold 10 million copies and won five Grammy Awards , came out three years ago .
But since its release , the singer has battled drug problems and ill health , and comeback gigs in May had to be scrapped .
She was writing and recording with producer Salaam Remi , who worked on Back To Black , while living on the Caribbean island of St Lucia earlier this year .
Last October , Remi said the pair had " about four songs done " .
The following month , Lucian Grange , head of Island 's parent company Universal Music Group , said her new material was sounding " sensational " .
Winehouse is making a return to TV screens on Saturday , singing backing vocals for her goddaughter Dionne Bromfield on BBC One 's Strictly Come Dancing .
Bromfield is the first signing to Winehouse 's new record label Lioness , which is an imprint of Island .
The 13 - year - old 's debut album is released on Monday .
VENEREAL DISEASE PROPAGANDA
SGM Herb Friedman ( Ret . )
The military has always taught new troops the dangers of sexually transmitted diseases .
Every soldier at some time in his basic training was forced to sit through what we used to call a " Susie Rotten - crotch " film where a soldier is shown out meeting a local female , only to appear at sick call with gonorrhea or syphilis shortly afterwards .
This was depicted in a comedic way in Woody Allen 's Love and Death , where the Russian recruits were forced to sit through a little morality play with a soldier on leave meeting a peasant girl .
Arthur Szyk caricature : Fool the Axis During World War II , the leaders of the Axis powers ( Adolf Hitler , Benito Mussolini , and General ( and Prime Minister ) Hideki Tojo ) were sometimes depicted by Allied propagandists as monsters .
The enemy leaders were caricatured as gorillas , skeletons , rats , or whatever the Allied " psywarriors " could dream up .
This was all part of the process of wartime depersonalization , the destruction of an individual as a human being and the resultant new image of him as vermin good only for killing .
In the above 1942 warning poster about VD , the three Axis leaders are shown with hypodermic needles , ready to give shots to soldiers with sexually transmitted diseases .
The text of the poster is " Fool the Axis  use prophylaxis , prophylaxis prevents venereal disease ! "
During the war the medical corps had a prophylaxis kit that would sometimes be issued to soldiers going into town .
A record of the medical problems of one U.S. Army unit states :
This unit scheduled lectures by the battalion surgeon or exhibitions of venereal disease prevention training films twice a month .
Company commanders lectured on sex hygiene once a month .
Platoon sergeants also lectured once a month .
For purposes of dispelling fear of prophylaxis treatment , demonstration prophylaxis was given in every squad of the organization .
Mechanical prophylaxis kits were supplied to every man going on pass .
Individual kits were given to each man going on overnight pass or furlough .
Each man returning from pass was required to report to the dispensary and state whether or not he needed prophylactic treatment .
The location of prophylactic stations was posted in every barrack .
Posters advertising the value of prophylaxis were widely displayed .
The artist who created the poster , Polish born Arthur Szyk ( 1894 -1951 ) attended art school in Paris before enlisting in the Russian Army in 1914 .
He served for six months and saw front - line action .
After World War I he fought as an officer in a Polish guerilla regiment against the Bolsheviks and eventually located in Paris with his new wife .
With the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939 he began producing cartoons and eventually moved to New York City .
During the war he created numerous covers for Collier 's magazine .
Adolph Hitler put a price tag on Arthur Szyks head .
The American press called Szyk a " one-man army against fascism . "
The Times of London declared his art work to " be among the most beautiful ... ever produced by the hand of man . "
Arthur Szyk caricature : VD
A second poster , copyright 1943 , shows the same three enemy buffoons discussing the disease marked " VD " with actual microscopic pictures of the microbes .
The syphilis spirochete , chancroid gram - negative bacilli , and gonorrhea gram - negative diplococci are all depicted as Tojo says " American soldier could catch it with ease " and Hitler answers , " but prophylaxis prevents disease . "
She is our Sunshine After seeing Arthur Szyks work this poster seems rather lame , but once again it vilifies Hitler and the Japanese and points out that a lovely bathing beauty ,  Miss GI Pickup of  44  will infect you , you , an you with VD .
And me , without a pro !
Here we see that Walt Disney has joined the war against VD .
Donald Duck has been drafted and is thinking of having sex with a beautiful woman but finds himself without the safety of a Prophylaxis .
John Papalas who also studies VD posters told me : I have found the description of the above poster when it sold at auction .
They state that the duck is wearing an Australian soldier ’s uniform and that 4MCD stands for either 4th Marine Corps Division or 4th Medical Corps Division .
I own another poster in the same style ( suggesting a series although there is no numeric indicator to support that ) and by the same artist ( Cyril Jones ) .
It is below .
The Past Becomes the Future
In the second 4MCD poster we see a woman crying over the news that her man has had VD while overseas .
VD in the form of death stands in the background .
A Syphilis Dress ?
John also pointed out that if you look carefully at the dress of the skeleton you will see that the design features spirochetes , the organism causing syphilis .
I doubt any horny soldier would have understood the meaning of the design , but it is right there for all to see .
I mentioned to John that when I was a medic assigned to a VD clinic in the 1950s : I seem to remember that if you wanted to show the students spirochetes you would push a toothpick between your teeth and put the results on a slide .
There were some non-VD spirochetes that naturally occurred in the mouth .
He agreed : Great memory Herb and you are indeed correct .
There are spirochetes that are found in the normal oral flora .
Some are reportedly associated with dental pathology .
Axis Agents
This poster also uses the theme that it helps the Axis when you are infected with a venereal disease .
It implies that it is almost treasonous to have sex with a prostitute because it hurts the war effort .
Pages from War Department Pamphlet No. 21 -15
At the same time that there were printing posters , the U.S. Government also produced a number of pamphlets , flyers , leaflets and other published literature in an attempt to slow the rate of VD among the troops .
The booklet , War Department Pamphlet No. 21 - 15 , depicts American troops hitting the beaches from a landing craft on some foreign shore and warns that VD might take them out of the picture .
One wonders about the effectiveness of this illustration as positive propaganda .
Given the choice of attacking a machine gun nest at Normandy or getting a needle in the butt at a comfortable aid station in the United Kingdom , the latter seems somewhat preferable .
War Department 1943  Sex Hygiene and VD  Brochure This 16 - page War Department brochure is entitled Sex Hygiene and VD  Venereal Disease .
It was first printed in 1940 under the direction of the Surgeon General of the Army with an introduction by Secretary of War Marshall .
It was issued to every new recruit and discusses sexuality in general and attempts to educate the young soldier on all of the emotions and desires he might encounter away from home .
It was issued again in 1943 with a slightly changed cover .
Some of the introduction is :
You have been examined and found physically fit .
You start your career in the Army with a clean , healthy body that will serve you long and well if you treat it right .
You have a good mind and good intelligence .
Beware that you are not robbed of these treasures Read this straight - forward discussion of sex hygiene and venereal disease .
It will tell you some important facts and real dangers you should know about .
Page 12 Some of the VD data is :
The Army can protect you from many diseases but you will have to protect yourself from syphilis and gonorrhea .
The only sure way is to stay away from women .
Dont forget that any woman who lets you use her , or who consents easily , is not safe .
If you wait until you marry , you re safe and keep your self respect .
You also play fair with the girl back home whom you expect to play fair with you .
Theres no substitute for morals .
[ Authors note ]
I found it interesting that at the time they only mentioned syphilis and gonorrhea , while when I was a medic syphilis was rare ( although by far the most deadly ) , while gonorrhea and soft chancre were by the far the most common diseases I treated .
Summary 1 . Manhood comes from healthy sex organs .
2 . It is not necessary to have sexual intercourse in order to keep strong and well .
3 . Disease may ruin the sex organs and deprive a man of his health and happiness .
4 . You have a fine healthy body now .
Keep it that way .
5 . Venereal diseases come from sex relations or intimate contact with a diseased person .
They are very serious .
Gonorrhea and syphilis are two of the worst .
6 . Most prostitutes have venereal disease .
7 . Guard against venereal disease by staying away from easy women .
Dont gamble your health away .
7. Guard against venereal disease by staying away from easy women .
Dont gamble your health away .
8 . If you do not have self - control then do not fail to take safety measures .
9 . If you get diseased , report at once to your commanding officer .
Time is most important .
10 .
Will power and self - control help to keep a mans body and mind healthy .
11 . A healthy body and a healthy mind lead to happiness .
One of the problems in an anti-VD campaign is that when young recruits enter a military environment they find that all their preconceived notions are obsolete .
The average young soldier going overseas believes that a venereal disease is a terrible social stigma .
Instead , he finds himself on a foreign shore where he discovers that the disease is often considered nothing more than a " runny nose . "
He hears that a number of the men in his unit have had such diseases , some multiple times .
Instead of a great curse , it is a simply a case of a shot of penicillin and " no coffee , tea , alcohol , or sex , and report to sick call tomorrow morning . "
It is this lack of fear of becoming a social outcast that makes the disease so prevalent in military situations .
Prophylactic Kit During the war , medics are generally supplied with prophylactic kits in bulk .
These can be used to treat soldiers , or are often just given to the men to take with them on leave .
The kits can contain different items , but during WWII soldiers were often issued an  Individual Chemical Prophylactic Packet designed to allow him to perform prophylactic treatment on himself if he feared he might have had sex with an infected woman .
The individual packet contained a tube containing 5 grams of ointment ( 30 % calomel + 15 % sulfathiazole ) , a direction sheet explaining how to apply the ointment , a soap impregnated cloth and cleansing tissue .
Sometimes the men were issued condoms ( usually three to a pack ) and sometimes they were given sulfa or other pills to carry just in case .
Crossing your fingers
We show the kit above and here we see a poster that advertises prophylaxis .
I thought for a moment that the victim was a butterbar 
Lieutenant from the symbol on his cap , but I knew the Army would never admit that an officer and gentleman might catch VD .
Sure enough , looking more carefully I see what seems to be Technical Corporal Stripes .
Venereal Diseases
This British WWI poster is interesting because at the time they list only two forms of venereal disease .
Now there are about a half dozen known to exist .
Notice they do not list antibiotics .
They were unknown at the time .
In November 1918 , bottles of potassium permanganate lotion and tubes of calomel cream were given to soldiers stationed overseas to use for self - disinfection .
Still , the British had 150,000 admissions to the hospital for VD in France during the war .
Many of the patients had self - inflicted VD .
That is , they chose to catch it hoping it would keep them out of the front lines .
In later wars , troops would sometimes shoot themselves in the foot to become hors de combat .
John Costello talks about the problem with prostitutes and venereal disease in Love , Sex and War : Changing Values , 1939 - 45 , William Collins , London , 1985 .
Prostitutes were made synonymous with venereal disease not just by the Germans , but also by the British and United States army commands , who declared war on the women who had been blamed for the million and a half syphilis and gonorrhea casualties suffered by the Allied armies in World War I .
The German armed forces applied the lessons learned twenty years earlier when the Kaiser 's army strictly regulated the ' sexual logistics ' of the troops and thereby cut its VD casualty rate to half that of the French army by 1918 .
Corpsmen collected the fees at the medically supervised military brothels behind the front lines , imposing a strict ten - minute time - limit per man during the evening ' rush hour ' and providing prophylactic treatments as well as keeping a detailed log of the visitor 's rank and regiment so that fines could be levied from those who failed to report contracted venereal infections .
In World War I the venereal infection rates of the British army were seven times higher than the Germans , principally because national prudery prevented the British high command from acknowledging that there was any problem at all until 1915 , when the Canadian and New Zealand prime ministers forced the chiefs of staff to issue free contraceptives to the troops .
A leaflet which was printed on 1 January 1943 listing the locations of all nearby
prophylactic stations that was issued to all troops stationed at Ft. Benning , GA .
German WWII Soldiers Certificate to Visit a Prostitute
This certificate was issued to WWII German soldiers who wished to have sex with a prostitute in a brothel .
They turned in their identification tag and received this certificate .
They would write the name of the prostitute at the lower right and upon leaving the brothel turned in the certificate to a medic and had their identification tag returned and received treatment if it was deemed necessary .
It is all very Germanic , everything efficiently done by the numbers .
The text is : Entry to the brothel is permitted only with this ID card !
Name of the sanitation room
Continuous number
Date
After leaving the brothel you are ordered to visit the sanitation room at once for protective treatment .
Your identification tag will be returned only after successful sanitation .
Name of the prostitute : ____________________
In Der deutsche Sanitatsdienst 1921 - 1945 , " the following comment appears :
By 1942 , the Wehrmacht was running over 500 so - called  Wehrmachtsbordellen ,  and the setting - up , running , and supply of these establishments was the responsibility of the Area Commander ( Ortskommanturen ) .
Disease control was the responsibility of the area medical officer , and the girls would be checked twice a week by local doctors .
There were special rules for Officer 's facilities , for which a hotel character was to be maintained .
Every Army brothel was required to have a prophylactic station ( Sanierstube ) .
They were to be marked with a small blue light marked with the Red Cross .
Other forms of these passes might contain the following instructions : a Certificate of subsequent prophylactic treatment ; Number and unit on dog tag ; Field - post number of recipient ;
The above received prophylactic treatment at ____ hours under a control number of prophylactic station no .
____ and is thus certified by : Rank , name ; and This document is to be kept for 3 months and is to be presented in the event of sickness .
Street billboard in Korea advising top ten sources ( night clubs ) for VD An example of the problem was mentioned by John B. Ritch III in an article entitled " Korea  Troops on the DMZ " in the Atlantic Monthly in 1970 .
He mentioned a form that was handed to the dozens of troops as they entered the VD clinic each day :
You have acquired , through sexual intercourse , an infection caused by bacteria which recently entered your penis .
This infection is easily cured , provided you follow closely the directions given you In addition to taking prescribed medicine as directed , it is very important that you drink absolutely no alcoholic beverages such as wine , beer , whiskey , etc. , no coffee , and no tea or carbonated beverages such as coke , 7 - up , etc. , while your present symptoms continue and for at least two weeks following the disappearance of those symptoms .
You should also avoid sexual intercourse for that period of time
If you are willing to follow these instructions , and any additional instructions which may be given to you specifically , you will find that the infection you have contracted will be cured quite simply and with a minimum of inconvenience .
Costello mentions VD in WWII : The Italian campaign more than any other in World War II confronted the British and American military commanders with their impotence when it came to coping with endemic prostitution .
A foretaste of the problem was given by British medical officers in Sicily , who were treating forty thousand VD cases a month , twenty times more than the number treated in England .
As one report advised , prostitution is almost universal among all but the highest class of Sicilian women . 
Government - regulated brothels also existed in all of the large towns .
Control had broken down , although General Patton wasted no time trying to restore it by putting US Army medical teams into Palermo 's six large houses of prostitution .
This did not endear him to General Montgomery , his arch rival , whose pride as well as his Puritanism was offended when it was announced that the brothels were open for business again  under US Army management .
The invasion of Italy proper magnified the scale of the problem .
But it was the capture of Naples in October 1943 that pitched the American and British commands into a two - year battle with an army of prostitutes  a battle Allied chaplains and doctors of both armies would later concede they lost .
The British were defeated by the prostitutes and decided that it must be part of a devious Nazi plot :
The British Army , which had no clear strategy other than the ineffective one of placing sections of Naples out of bounds , reacted to the soaring VD rate by blaming it on the Germans .
A circular that arrived in all units by Christmas warned :  From reports that have been received it is apparent that prostitution in occupied Italy and Naples in particular , has reached a pitch greater than has ever been witnessed in Italy before .
So much is this so that it has led to a suggestion that the encouragement of prostitution is part of a formulated plan arranged by the pro-Axis elements , primarily to spread venereal disease among Allied troops . 
Katharine H.S.
Moon discusses venereal disease and prostitution in her book , Sex among Allies : Military Prostitution in U.S. / Korea Relations .
For those who have not served overseas , it might surprise you to know that some members of the American armed forces carry their prejudices with them .
They might travel 9,000 miles together and work and fight side - by - side , but at night many preferred to go to bars , houses of prostitution , and even sometimes entire villages that are either exclusively black or white .
It always amazed me that a soldier walking into the wrong bar in Korea or Vietnam might be beaten by his fellow soldiers for a social faux pas .
Katherine Moon discusses this strange aspect of American sexual relationships with local prostitutes .
I have cut and pasted some of her comments on this subject :
What began as a joint US - Korean venture to improve the discipline , welfare , and morale among U.S. troops in Korea turned Korean camp town prostitutes into instruments of foreign policy .
During the Clean - Up Campaign , the prostitutes bore the burden of reconciling the differences between two races ( blacks and whites ) and two governments .
Joint U.S. - Korean control over their bodies and behavior , through VD examinations and supervision of their interactions with GI customers , became an indicator of the status of community relations and the willingness of the Korean government to accommodate U.S. interests .
The prostitutes were the primary and often sole contact with Korean society that GIs had on a daily basis .
A Human Factors Research Report on troop - community relations stated unequivocally ,  Fraternization [ in the form of prostitution ] is near the core of troop - community relations here .
The U.S. military and the local Korean authorities pinpointed prostitutes as the source of social problems and unrest , especially with respect to racial violence .
Women generally worked in either all - white or all - black bars or clubs and tended not to mix their customers .
Mixing of racial partners sparked often violent reactions among the GIs .
Fights between black and white soldiers were , in a sense , over territory , that is , who possesses which women and who is trespassing on whose women .
Three Korean prostitutes pose for a picture Lottery tickets from two Korean nightclubs Many Korean bars and nightclubs offered lottery tickets free with every drink .
You stood a chance of winning a whole night with one of the club 's prostitutes , a short time " quickie " with a girl of your choice , cash , or a bottle or glass of the local liquor or beer .
Of course if you won the top prizes , ( the " overnight " or " quickie " ) you stood a chance of getting more than you hoped for - a trip to the VD clinic .
By the way , notice the Arirang Club lottery ticket .
That name brings back pleasurable memories to me because Arirang is an ancient Korean folksong .
I once had a bar - girl solemnly explain the meaning to me , " Girl say to boyfriend , ' If you leave me I hope you fall down and break your leg ' . "
I always thought that she was joking but the translated text of the Korean national folksong is the story of a disappointed maiden who hopes that her departing sweetheart will have sore feet before he has gone ten li ( about two and a half miles ) and have to return to her .
Her plaintive words and the charming melody account for its status as the most popular of all Korean songs .
The Seventh Division of the United States Army in Korea used Arirang as its marching song after obtaining permission form Dr. Syngman Rhee , the first President ( 1948 - 1960 ) of the Republic of Korea , in appreciation of the division 's heroic exploits in the Korean War ( 1950 - 53 ) .
Some of the pertinent comments in the article are :
In Korea the Army medics keep a supply of those printed notices close at hand --- in mimeographed stacks .
The VD statistics ebb and flow from time to time as various commanders push prevention campaigns in whatever ways they can , but the basic situation --- rich Army amongst poor people --- remains the same , and the VD stays around .
Eight out of every ten G.I.s will have it at least once during a 13 - month tour , an eon which most count off , day by day , waiting to get back to " the world . "
A 12 - page anonymous report written by a veteran of Camp Humphries in Korea titled 1979 – 1,115 Hookers at Camp Humphries goes into great depth about the prostitutes in Korea .
Identifying the girls into two classes , the poorer , uneducated ones who offered anal or oral sex , and the higher - class educated girls that worked in the better bars , the story says in part :
After work if you wanted to relax there were three on - post massage parlors at Camp Humphries , one of the largest US camps in Korea with about 6,000 - Soldiers .
The massage parlors cost $ 5 for a hot shower with hand scrubbing by a middle - aged Korean woman followed by a 30 - minute massage .
We called the massage parlors , “ Steam and Creams . ”
If you wanted a happy ending , it cost another $ 5 .
Your first encounter with a hooker in Korea was usually a momma-san standing at the entrance to a small alley off the main road .
We called all small allies in Korea , “ blow - job alley . ”
The momma-san ran small brothels out of their homes .
The hookers were called , “ butt - whores . ”
The momma-sans would bark soldiers with , “ You want girl , I have new girl , cherry girl , you come with me , I show you good - time . ”
She would lead you a short walk to her home .
Waiting in the living room , usually watching TV would be about five to ten butt - whores .
You could have your choice .
Butt - whores were in their 20’s , not dressed very well and did not speak English .
For $ 2 you would be led to one of about four bedrooms .
There the girl would take a warm washcloth and clean your genitals and anus .
You would get a blowjob and a rim - job ( round the world , tossed salad , butt - hole licking ) .
The butt - whores were a very good value .
These girls did not have VD cards , so you would not want to have regular sex with them unless you wore a condom .
Butt - whores did not work in the brothels .
Hookers who worked in brothels were called , “ business girls . ”
Some would laugh and point to their vaginas saying , “ This is my business . ”
Business - girls were very high - quality prostitutes .
They had a standard rate of $ 5 for a quickie ( short time ) , or $ 10 for an overnight stay ( long time ) .
All the girls carried a US Army issued VD cards that they updated once a week free .
The goal of the business - girls working in the brothels was not to pull tricks .
The girls wanted to enter a monthly relationship called , “ YoBo . ”
The word YoBo means , “ Wife , ” in Korean .
If you really like any of the business - girls working in the club , you could talk to the momma-san and pay $ 200 per month .
The girl would be your wife .
Most Soldiers did just that .
The girls treated the men like kings , taking care of all their needs except food and alcohol .
The economics of prostitution is interesting .
In 1954 the going price for a wife for a month was $ 30 .
In 1979 above , it was $ 200 .
By 2019 , I am told it was $ 700 .
Inflation !
Taiwan 30 Bars in Taipei Welcome R&R American troops were also stationed in Taiwan or took R&R ( Rest and Recuperation ) there as a break from the Vietnam War .
The booklet above identifies those bars where the girls are inspected and the soldier might be safe from VD .
This book almost looks official , but because of the broken language found in the text , I suspect it was made by Chinese entrepreneurs that banded together to increase business .
Some of the text is : Taipei City has 30 bars approved by the Government .
We are sure that you , from there , will drink nice wine , will enjoy good music , and , of course get a special service from charming girls .
For your personal health , those girls are given a periodic physical check - up every two weeks .
We wish you have a wonderful time during your short period vacation in Taipei .
Stan Lee
Another well - known artist that produced a VD poster is Stan Lee .
Stan is mostly known as the creator of the comic book heroes HULK , Spiderman , and Fantastic Four .
During an interview he was asked about his strangest Army assignment :
Oh , yeah .
The venereal disease poster .
They were having trouble in the army with too many enlisted men coming down with venereal disease .
It s funny , they kept telling me it was enlisted men , so I assumed that officers were so high and mighty they would never get a venereal disease [ laughs ] .
[ I should point out here that Stan is quite correct .
While enlisted men got " the clap " and other nasty diseases , officers usually are diagnosed with non-venereal urinary infections , non-specific urethritis ( inflammation of the urethra ) which is not caused by gonorrhea , or more commonly " sprains . "
It simply would not look good on an Officers Evaluation Report to have a diagnosis of gonorrhea .
Although nowhere near that of the Navy , the U.S. Army does have its own caste system ] .
But at any rate I was asked to do a poster that would admonish the enlisted men , saying every time they had done the wild thing with a girl overseas , they should go to one of the prophylactics stations , which dotted the landscape in Europe .
Set up by the army , they were little places with a green light above the door .
When you walked in there , they did terrible things , which I dont even want to think about  but which apparently cured you , or prevented you from getting an incurable disease .
At any rate it was like mission impossible .
My assignment , if I would accept it , was to do this poster that would warn the soldiers to go to these little pro stations .
I thought : " What on Earth could I do ? "
Then finally I drew a little cartoon figure of a soldier walking through a door with a green light above it .
He looks very smug and self - satisfied , and a dialogue balloon above his head said " VD ?
Not me ! "
They must have printed a hundred trillion of those things .
So in my own humble way , I think I probably won the war single - handedly , because if that stopped them from getting ill then they were all ready and set to fight .
And that s the untold story of how we won the war [ laughs ] .
This officer / enlisted man concept still held true in Vietnam .
One anonymous lieutenant told me about his trip to the doctor with what sounds like a classic case of gonorrhea :
One morning I got up and stepped into the head to urinate .
I was rewarded with incredible pain and red tinted urine .
I basically was close to howling at the pain level .
I reported to headquarters and quickly got on sick call , taking a M151 over to Can Tho Army Airfield dispensary .
The Specialist 4 medic wanted a sample to ' scope ' in the back room , all the while sneering at my insistence that " it could n't be VD " .
" Right lieutenant , I hear a lot of that " .
After another " screamer " in the head , the sample was inspected and minutes later the Capt ( Doc ) came out and said something like : " Well I 'll be damned , it is n't Syphilis but you 've got one hell of a colony of spirochetes boring holes in your urinary tract " .
Instead of a load of Penicillin in the butt , I got an envelope of Tetracycline .
I asked how I contracted this kind of infection and he indicated that it was just one of the bugs that came out of the wash water .
Most likely the bugs were picked up in the underwear , or picked up off the bedding .
Within 24 hours of taking massive doses of tetracycline , the pain had almost gone as the nasty spirochete succumbed to the antibiotic .
By three days , healing had removed all of it .
Only the memory of the 10/10 level pain remained .
From then on , I showered with a hexachloraphine scrub soap called Phisohex .
It 's banned now .
The image of children swimming in the Bassac tributary of the Mekong is vivid in my mind .
How do they all keep from falling victim to the trillions of hungry organisms ?
I can't help but think that maybe mamas an was washing my laundry with special water " just for you GI " .
Captain TG , an artillery officer with H&Hq Battery , 1/21 Artillery , 1st Air Cavalry Division had a similar experience :
One morning in April of 1967 I woke up with painful urination and a small discharge visible on my skivvies .
This was at LZ Pony , west of Bong Son , in the foothills , south of the An Lao Valley .
I was thunderstruck .
I had not done a damned thing to acquire of dose of anything .
Nothing .
Absolutely nada .
The next day I was worse , so off to see the battalion surgeon I went .
When I started to explain that I was pure as the driven snow , the doc waved me off and said that I was maybe the sixth case of this malady he had seen in a few days .
It was n't VD ; he did n't know what it was .
He marked my record " nonspecific urethritis . "
I took a few pills of something , and in a few more days things cleared up .
That 's my story and I 'm sticking to it .
VD was a constant problem in Vietnam .
The Military Assistance Command Vietnam ( MACV ) mentions this in a memorandum dated 1 August 1967 .
They have apparently given up trying to educate the troops and seem to be targeting the women in their venereal disease prevention program : A Typical Vietnam Bar 1 .
Prostitution would not be legally recognized by the republic of Vietnam .
2. Bargirls and streetwalkers could not be controlled for a variety of reasons i.e. lack of resources , personnel etc .
3 . The only effective program would be one controlling females working in houses of prostitution .
Reactions of U.S. authorities seem to range from enthusiasm to disbelief that such a limited program will work or be beneficial .
Syphilis
This brochure was found among a veterans  Welcome to Vietnam papers .
It was clearly issued to the new soldier as a warning .
The brochure opened up to four folded pages and mentioned how syphilis was spread and how it was cured .
It ends with a warning that not every case can be cured .
It says that for those lucky enough to be cured it take 70 injections given for 70 consecutive weeks .
That may be true , but I recall that when we treated the disease it was 10 one - million unit shots of penicillin .
A 1 March 1967 in Air Force Times article entitled " High Viet VD Rate Revealed " says , " The venereal disease rate among American servicemen in Vietnam is 10 times as high as the stateside rate , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Earle Wheeler told Congress recently . "
He added , " It must be admitted that VD prevention campaigns within the services are not eminently successful . "
What kind of numbers are we talking about ?
A " State of the Command " fact sheet dated 29 April 1972 shows that in the 1st Cavalry Division , the sickness rate per 1000 troops was 26.7 malaria , 17.8 viral hepatitis , 5.4 diarrheal diseases , 10.2 skin diseases and 226.3 venereal diseases .
It was a problem !
A 13th Air Force report entitled , " Venereal Disease Rate " dated 27 Oct. 64 complains about the great number of VD cases , and the Unit History of 3rd Tactical dispensary dated 10 January 1966 mentions the Air Force rate at 541 cases per 1000 .
A former Marine checking his battalion records brags that his battalion had just 4 cases per 1000 in the same time period .
Of course , the Air Force had the ability to visit nearby villages while the Marines probably spent most of their time in the field .
We should mention that the real rates were probably somewhat higher .
Many troops went into the local village to be treated , hoping to avoid company punishment .
The problem was that the local native " doctor " often injected the patient with condensed milk or some other solution instead of the promised penicillin .
There are no statistics to tell what ultimate damage was caused by this attempt to circumvent the medical regulations .
Thailand Hotel Card American troops often took R&R in Thailand where it was known that everything goes : singles , doubles , little girls , little boys , you name it .
By the way , I understand none of that has changed .
This card offers the girls at $ 10 a night and what beats it all free transportation .
A Warning Poster Beware of Booby Traps !
This poster was used by the United States during the late 1960s and early 1970s to teach trainees in Basic Training about various dangers found in Vietnam .
It is about 30 inches in width and on particle board .
This poster could have many meanings .
First of all , there is a beautiful Vietnamese girl who might be a spy and offer sex for military information .
Her hand is behind her back .
She might have a pistol or a knife and be about to attack the soldier .
There is a  Chieu Hoi sign on the wall which might indicate that she was a Viet Cong who defected and is now a double agent .
Finally , there is always the implied threat that she has a venereal disease and can infect and disable the trooper .
This poster works on many levels .
I enjoy hearing VD anecdotes and I have heard a lot of them .
This one may be the best I ever heard .
Medics treat friend and foe alike : I was a medic in a Civil Affairs Unit in Vietnam .
I had a foot locker that I kept close my entire tour .
Word spread I stocked antibiotics in the footlocker , and I soon found myself sought after as the last resort for those caught in the grip of an unfortunate social disease but wishing to avoid official medical channels .
In December 1969 , we were in Ban Me Thuot and I worked in the Rhade native villages .
I 'd setup with my footlocker and interpreter near our truck where the Rhade passed while the rest of the team tried to find locals in need of free medical attention .
One afternoon with the rest of the CA team nowhere to be seen , five young men approached .
The men were unarmed , dressed in fresh , completely - unadorned drabs , and wearing boonie hats .
I could n't quite put my finger on their ethnicity , but my interpreter turned green at the gills .
They hailed us in Vietnamese , my interpreter answered , and eventually , I understood the reason for their visit .
The entire group had Gonorrhea ( the Clap ) and needed antibiotics .
I gave them my lecture about the dangers of self - medication and advised they see a doctor .
The group was not impressed and repeated their request .
My interpreter was now ashen .
I looked up the treatment for Gonorrhea in the Merck Manual .
I gave each of them several tablets of oral penicillin with a stern warning and my repeated lecture on the hazards of self - medication .
The group turned friendly after they gulped down their tablets .
One climbed a nearby tree to fetch a hand of green bananas .
All gifted me with some fruit , and behaved like we were best buddies .
After they left , my interpreter informed me the group was North Vietnamese soldiers and no friends of ours .
The moral I suspect , is that when you have the Clap , you will take relief wherever you find it .
The Armed Forces Vietnam Network helped with various anti-VD public announcements .
One asked : Question 
How is your VD lately ?
No , we re not speaking about your vicious dog or your vitamin deficiency .
We re talking about a very personal problem .
The man to see is the medic .
[ The sounds of happy birds chirping ] .
Once you see him your world will once again be a very happy place .
[ Music and more birds chirping ] .
Another announcement had a female group singing a song called  Clap Clap in the background while the announcer asked :
Well , whats this ?
Do you have to hang on to the pipes when you pee ?
If you do , I think it is about time you saw the doctor .
Bar Girls in Vietnam sit outside of their club waiting for their next benefactor .
Mai Lan Gustafsson interviewed 32 bar girls over the course of a decade , starting in 1994 when she began her Masters research on Vietnamese folklore entitled  The War Lore of Vietnamese Bar girls . 
According to the research , many of the girls were happy to be away from the slavery of the farm and loved the independence of being a bar girl in the big city .
One former bar girl said :  You want to hear the truth about the war ?
You dont ask them .
They suckers .
The war , that whole time was the best time for my life .
I loved it .
Happily , 32 of these bar girls remain alive and well , even the oldest of the group , 79 year old Cao .
Cao is certain she will outlive all of the other women in my study , not to mention myself   I never die , Mai Lan !
I write about you after you die , ha ha ! 
I asked for her secret to longevity , expecting her to cite regular exercise , or prayer , perhaps even yogurt .
 Sex !
And whiskey !
And laugh a lot at stupid things .
Ha ha ha ! 
The former bar girls talk of good times and new friendships , fun experiences and freedom .
They are the heroines of a fairy tale set during wartime , not the victims of politics and violence as other refugee women paint themselves .
 If we want to do sex , we do .
No one tell us .
No pimp , you understand ?
What made the war so special and wonderful for these women was the freedom it gave them  freedom from the drudgery of domestic work , from the dominance of husbands and fathers , from the expectations of their culture .
For the bargirls , Saigon was a paradise .
The city offered what their villages could not : excitement , independence , novelty , and the exotic .
They were not alone but were surrounded by more experienced denizens of the Saigon bar scene who showed them the ropes and helped them find housing and work .
Within a few weeks of their arrival , all 32 had found places to live in the bargirl neighborhoods of the city , rooming with women like themselves who had gone to Saigon to find better lives .
 I was never sad in Saigon ,  remembers Khoa , now 56 .
 I had so many friends , and so much money .
I did what I wanted every day .
Fun , fun , fun ! 
Hai jokingly says that had she known how good life would be in Saigon , she would have run away there at age ten .
 No compare ,  she says of the difference between being a country girl and a bargirl .
 I was like a movie star in Saigon ,  bragged Diep .
Like her , the other women tell me that life during the war was sweet ,  exciting ,  and wild . 
The Americans they met as customers and later took as lovers were well - liked marks .
 They treated me like a sister , sometime like a friend ,  remembers Kim Oanh , adding  Vietnamese men look at women like slaves . 
Lieu treasured her friendships with American soldiers , who taught her to swear in English , take pictures , and drink beer :  I was just one of the boys , and I like it .
Thu Loan worked in a bar where her job was to get the soldiers to buy her drinks .
She made half the cost of these outrageously overpriced cocktails , all the while downing the non-alcoholic drinks made specifically for her and the other bargirls .
So , it seems clear that although American culture paints these girls as tramps and prostitutes living in slavery under the rule of men , the girls were the happiest they had ever been ; free and liberated .
The Island of the Black Syph A Vietnam  Get out of Jail certificate
This certifies that you are clean of VD and free to go home , no island for you One of the most interesting Vietnam rumors having to do with venereal disease was that of the mysterious island where service members with the dreaded and incurable " black syph " were sent to spend their last days in exile .
Most of the young men who were sent to Vietnam heard the story at one time or another .
Everyone knew someone who had a friend who had heard from a buddy that there was this deadly incurable strain of syphilis .
They whispered that rather than send a soldier home with this disease which would demoralize his family and the American public if the truth be known , the infected individual would be sent to this secret island where he would spend his last days in pain and dementia until he died .
I did not realize how prevalent this rumor was until I checked " Google Groups Deja Vu " and found that there were no less than 467 posts on the subject of " black syph . "
I am sure that if I worded the query differently many more posts would show up .
As late as May 2010 there were still true believers .
One former warrant officer thought I was part of a cover - up and told me : I served in Okinawa 1965 to 1967 .
There was an official messages posted on the Company Bulletin Board about Black Syphilis being brought from South Vietnam by Soldiers on R&R to Okinawa .
It was a health warning .
During my last 10 years , I served with a Warrant Officer who started his career as a medic in South Vietnam .
We were talking about soldiers missing in action and I asked him if he ever heard the rumor of the Soldiers sent to the Black Syph Island .
He startled me by telling me that he was first party to the evacuation of these terminally ill soldiers as he served as a medic on the Helicopters that were moving these soldiers from mainland South Vietnam to the  Island .
I believe him and have known him over many years .
He had no reason to lie to me and it was a private conversation .
I really think that the story you are publishing is a cover for the truth on what happen to these vets .
A trooper assigned to Okinawa in peacetime told me : I went in a couple of years after the war was over but when I went to Okinawa I heard all these stories about the black VD that if you got you could n't go home .
Said it was the same stuff they had in Nam .
Another veteran added :
We heard the same rumor when I was stationed in Korea in the early '90s .
Evidently there was some island where you had to stay because there was no cure for the black VD .
Another said :
The Island was supposed to be somewhere off Japan and any one that had the Black Syph was sent there as there was no cure and supposedly a letter was sent home that you were missing in action .
That is how the story went in my unit .
In August 2010 I received a copy of Sergeant William J. Kazlauskys self - publish book Vietnam Unclassified .
In the section entitled  Con Son ( Devils ) Island  I found the following comment : I cant confirm this but some military scuttlebutt going around did mention an island that soldiers would be sent to if they had contracted untreatable V.D. and other forms of disease .
Perhaps a scare tactic for the troops to keep their trousers buttoned up .
One veteran told me about the lecture , movie and threat of isolation and death that he received in the military : A very polished Medical Service Corps Major walked in from the front of the class room .
He began to speak in a mechanical monotone .
He was on automatic pilot .
I began to snooze off when he said ,  Pay attention to this short film . 
He left the podium as the 16 mm projector cracked to life .
Now I have seen some gross stuff in my life but this was mind blowing .
In the film several naked men were paraded down a walkway toward the camera .
Each one was inflicted with a specific venereal disease .
Their genitals were dripping pus and tissue was falling off .
Each case was worse than the one before it .
The last one was a young man covered with sores .
His penis was swollen the size of a cantaloupe .
The doctor in the film inserted a shiny pencil size devise into his dick .
Here was a pause and he flicked his wrist .
A four bladed surgical fin that opened like a flower opened inside his dick .
Then the Doctor began to pull the tool .
He tore open all the pus-filled blisters inside the penis and blood and pus poured out .
The projector cracked and popped as the film ran out .
The Major stood up and said :  By the way , we cannot cure this disease .
If you get it you will be sent to Tokyo and put in a quarantined facility until we find a cure .
Or , you will die . 
I dont know if it was the alleged saltpeter in the food , the truly repulsive local women or the film that affected my libido , but I suddenly had no desire for a booty call .
I should add this this is the only soldier I ever heard say that the Military sent people with the disease to Tokyo instead of some barren isolated island .
Tokyo does n't seem half bad .
Most likely , the " black syph " story was invented and promoted by the U.S. military to terrify their young troops , lessen the fraternization with local women , and ultimately lower the rate of VD among the men .
From some conversations with Vietnam veterans I get the impression that the rumor sometimes worked .
There were islands off the coast of the Republic of Vietnam from where American and Vietnamese clandestine forces originated black operations against North Vietnam .
It is possible that the concept of a secret island came from rumors of these operations .
One former PYSOP lieutenant told me , " In 1968 , the special camp for incurable syphilis was common knowledge in 10th PSYOP Battalion .
We also regarded it for what it was , BS .
No one believed it but the fear factor was extremely motivating . "
A former Marine told me :
In our area there were discussions about treatment resistant syphilis , commonly called the black syph . 
The infected troops were believed by medical personnel to be housed in the Subic Bay Hospital Isolation Ward .
There was one case making the rounds of a kid who managed to catch TB and syphilis at the same time .
But as others have said the typical marine did n't have much opportunity until R & R to get a dose of anything .
In Dong ha supposedly the manicurist for a fee would do you in the bunker inside the barber shop .
Coast Guard veteran Charlie Spivey was assigned to the cutter USCGC Half Moon ( Task Force 115  Squadron 3 ) as a Fireman .
He heard about the Island of the Black Syph in Vietnam : That thing about the Black Syph was everywhere .
One story went that if you got it , there was no cure , and you were sent away and a letter sent home that you were MIA or some such thing .
Most of us figured it was just something they put out as a preventative thing to keep from working the Doc to death with a lot of cases of STDs .
Retired Master Sergeant Gregory H. Murry mentions the same old wives  tale in his book Content with my Wages  A Sergeants Story - Vietnam ; No End to Publishing Co. , Austin , Texas , 2013 .
He tells us about an ass - chewing by his Colonel to the entire Company :
He reminded us that some forms of VD in Vietnam couldnt be cured , and if we got one , we would be sent to an island in the Philippines where we would be kept until we died .
 The girls who have not been checked by the medics are working for the Viet Cong .
They re not VC agents , they are VD agents . 
Wassermann Gardens
There was even a 2015 novel entitled Wassermann Gardens by Milo Samardzija that was based on the imaginary island .
The title is interesting because as an old medic I remember doing the Wassermann reaction as an antibody test for syphilis .
That was a clever use of the name of the old VD test in the title .
The author identifies the residents : Most of the living islanders were from the Vietnam era .
All of the World War Two guys had died off years earlier and the few Korean War vets still clinging to life were on their last legs , blind , crazed , rotting within .
It is worth noting that although the " Island of the Black Syph " appears to be a Vietnam creation , older soldiers have stated that similar stories were told in earlier wars .
Some WWII troops believed that there was a secret island off the coast of Greenland where horribly burnt and disfigured American soldiers were sent so as not to destroy the morale of their families at home .
During the Korean War , some soldiers were told of an island off the coast of South Korea where men with incurable venereal diseases were sent to die .
This rumor , or a reasonable facsimile , seems to have been circulating for at least 60 years .
Private Bill Lupton of the 27th Infantry Regiment  Wolfhounds  talks about his personal introduction to the island in a narration entitled  February 1966 .
First Sergeant Letoto addresses the men after one soldier is killed while on a forbidden trip into Cu Chi for sex with a local prostitute :
You men need to use some common sense in dealing with these boom boom girls .
Not only are they treacherous but they carry venereal disease , 
There is another pause .
 Now I know all of you men want to go back to your families safe and sound , and nobody wants to end up on the South Seas Island where they keep men who have venereal disease that will not respond to penicillin .
They are not allowed to go back to the States until their syphilis is cured .
He is persuasive , and none of us knows that the infamous South Seas Island he talks about is simply a made - up fairy tale .
The Army inculcates this yarn to every generation of soldier who ever served in the Army in every prior war .
This strange island is sited somewhere in the world but nobody can tell you exactly where and there lives a colony of soldiers with the incurable Black Syph .
 Nobody ever gets off this island , and you sure as hell do not want to go there yourself .
Because of this , the Colonel is restricting everybody to the battalion area .
You are only allowed off base when we tell you that you can go . "
Marine Lance Corporal Gavin Love says : I was stationed in Vietnam from February 1968 to March 1969 .
I was with 7th Communication Battalion on Hill 34 south of Da Nang .
I am not sure if it was a Company policy to tell us about the black syph or if our Gunny just wanted to us to stay out of " Dog Patch . "
My theory is that the Gunny wasnt " getting any " and did his best to deter us from partaking of the young ladies , sort of a " misery loves company " scenario .
We were warned about the black syph , also known as " Hong Kong Dong . "
Once it was diagnosed they sent you to Guam , where , while you laid there with your dick turning black waiting to die , you could decide if you wanted your family to be told you were killed in action or were missing in action .
Another Vietnam Marine veteran adds : I too was told the story of contracting the " Black Syph " and the consequences .
Man , it was a scary thing to tell an 18 year old .
We heard many stories of what hell it was from Drill instructors ... and we believed that they always told the truth .
An Army veteran who was in Vietnam in 1968 heard the story a bit differently .
It was gonorrhea , not syphilis : I heard stories about the Black Clap in 1968 , and if you got it you were sent to an island off the coast till you died or a cure was found .
Another Vietnam veteran told me : I remember that , but the story I heard was that there was a special medical ship that was 10 miles off the coast of Vietnam that never went home !
Another veteran agreed :
When I was in the Marine Corps in the late 80's in Okinawa ...... even I heard the black clap myth .
Another trooper recalled : I remember hearing that same story , but it was in the 1980's and the disease was supposedly caught in Korea .
A former cavalry man said : I heard the story of the secret island in 1966 when I was stationed in South Korea .
I heard the same story in 1968 when I was in Vietnam .
They told us in glorious detail also about the bullheaded clap . 
This is where your dick swelled up and the medics took an umbrella needle  and ran it up your crank and opened it and then ripped the puss and stuff out of your dick when they withdrew the expanded umbrella needle . 
I only heard that story in South Korea .
A Vietnam combat Marine told me :
When I was asked if I had killed anyone in Vietnam I would say no , I was detailed to take people to the secret Island if they caught the black syph , and do n't have a clue what happened to them after that .
I can say that to this day in a pub and have many believe me .
I have had people ask me how could I do that and I would say , " Put it this way ... would you want your sister to marry someone with that shit ? "
Enough said !
Other troops told me : Yes , this story went around in the 60s in the Republic of Vietnam .
I heard it many times .
I heard it in mid-1970 .
I did n't believe it , but I did n't volunteer for the Western Pacific either .
It is interesting to note that there are still people who believe the story of this secret island today .
In March 2008 I received a letter from a member of a group that was discussing a recent church sermon about the Island of the Black Syph .
My question for you is over something that was preached in a very large and influential church .
The minister mentioned that the reason some of the Vietnam troops could not come home is because the Government left them there .
He said :  I will tell you why some of the MIAs didnt come back from Vietnam , because the venereal disease they had was so terribly , terribly addictive and it could spread so fast we couldnt let them come back .
And those of you in Vietnam know that .
Those little Cambodian and Thai whores soiled our American name of honor and somehow we have done a terrible thing .
We kind of pooh - poohed that .
We kinda said , well , boys will be boys .
Some church members have defended him because they heard about this from relatives who served in the military .
A rumor like this , spread among a large group of people , can turn a falsehood into accepted fact .
When I asked a former U.S. Army intelligence office who served in Vietnam and still has excellent ties with that country about this old myth , he told me :
With tourists swarming all over Indochina , it would be impossible to hide anyone .
They cant keep the tourists and backpackers out of the restricted areas .
The authorities have often stopped even trying to keep them out .
They try to prohibit them not because of hidden VD patients , but because of old explosives that are buried in the ground or hidden in the undergrowth .
They can not convince some people there are dangers .
The Superbug Notice that the round bacteria ( cocci ) are seen in many cases to be a connected pair .
Back in the 50s when I was a medic this was the way we identified gonorrhea .
I would write on the medical record : Gram - negative intracellular diplococci .
The funny part about this story ( if VD can ever be funny ) is that the military went to great pains to make up a convincing story about a superbug that could not be treated by antibiotics .
That seemed like an impossibility , but many decades later it seems to have come to pass .
In 2018 , it was reported that a British man was infected with a superbug after a sexual encounter with a woman in South East Asia .
The main antibiotic treatment - a combination of azithromycin and ceftriaxone - has failed to treat the disease .
The fear is the bug could eventually become untreatable by any antibiotic .
So , if this had occurred in Vietnam in 1965 one wonders if this poor soul would have been sent to a secret island to protect his wife and family .
As for the idea that the girls are some kind of evil filthy creatures , the minister needs to learn about other cultures .
In many Asian cultures those families that are poor and starving will contract a daughter for a specific number of years to a  Mamasan . 
The daughter makes this sacrifice to help feed her parents and siblings .
At the end of her contract she will return home and marry a local man who hopefully appreciates the sacrifice she has made for her family .
This is not to justify the custom of prostitution , but Americans need to understand that in the really poor areas of the world it is often a culturally accepted manner in which to help support a family .
Toilet seat coaster
The anti-VD coaster above was handed out to Military Policeman SP4 Don J. Sinclair of the 716th MPs in Saigon sometimes in 1972 by a medic of the 218th Medical Dispensary as he did his short - arm inspection .
The magic phrase for those who never heard it is ,  Drop it out and milk it down . 
Short Arm Cartoon
The unknown cartoonist that drew this gag got it right .
Sometimes the military has to be proactive instead of reactive .
So , rather than wait until some soldier has such a terrible case of gonorrhea that he is unable to work and might need hospitalization , why not bring him into the dispensary early and check him for that tell - tell drip .
It saved a lot of soldiers a lot of pain when their antibiotic treatment was begun early .
Just to prove once again that what comes around goes around ,  in 2012 I heard from an Army medical doctor in Afghanistan who said : I am giving a talk to our medics about venereal disease and would like permission to use the picture of the toilet seat coaster .
The younger enlisted have never heard of the short arm inspection .
VD - Hello boy friend , coming MY way ?
A colorful 1943 VD poster produced in Great Britain by Reginald Mount depicts a female with the face of a skull in bright pink bonnet .
The text is " VD - Hello boy friend , coming MY way ?
The ' easy ' girl friend spreads Syphilis and Gonorrhea , which unless properly treated may result in blindness , insanity , paralysis , premature death .
If you have run the risk , get skilled treatment at once .
Treatment is free and confidential . "
In the U.S. Army , treatment was free , but it was n't always confidential .
In some units it was an Article 15 ( company punishment ) offense and in others a court martial offense .
While a combat soldier might not fear the repercussions , often military police and cooks did .
The MPs might lose a stripe and the cooks were forbidden to handle food , which could mean two weeks of the dirtiest menial tasks ( ask an old soldier about " the grease pit " ) until all traces of the disease was gone .
I once had one of my cooks beg me not to report him because he was coming up for promotion .
I agreed and told him I wanted him to be very careful , wash his hands regularly , and whatever he did dont serve any food to me .
Costello talks about punishment :
The indignity of being processed through one of these American VD treatment centers was vividly described by army veteran John H. Burns .
The infected GI , he reported , had to put on special fatigues :
On the back of the jacket and on the trouser leg were painted these large and smelly letters : V D....
Finally it came his turn at the end of the file to enter the dispensary .
Inside the screen door the line forked into two prongs and was being funneled past two GIs , each with a hypodermic in his hand .
Along the walls of the room were electric iceboxes .
And many little glass ampoules of an amber liquid .
Ahead of him were men with either arm bared or with their buttocks offered like steak to the needle .
' They give ya a choice on where ya want ya shot , ' the blond boy said .
' If ya take it in the ass , they 'll use a longer needle ta get through the fat .
My advice is ta take ya shots round the clock .
Then none of ya four parts gets too sore .
Ya'll be hurtin anyhow . '
Then ... he felt already the stinging in his other shoulder .
All his life telescoped down to three - hour periods and a hypodermic needle and yellow drops dribbling out of it .
What was it called ?
Pncilin ? Penissiclin ?
Pencillin ?
Mercury
The soldier above was actually pretty lucky to have antibiotics .
When I was a kid all we had was sulfa .
If you got strep throat or some other infection you took the sulfa and were warned to wash it down with a lot of ginger ale .
The antibiotics like penicillin came in with WWII and were a great boon to mankind in general .
In the bad old days one of the treatments was mercury , and that is a poison itself .
The poster was produced for the Ministry of Health promoting the first national campaign about venereal diseases .
It was aimed at warning service men against the health risks of promiscuous sexual behavior .
Women at the time were finding themselves in contrasting situations of sometimes - unprecedented liberty and discipline , often combined with sexual ignorance .
Having to stay faithful while the men were away fighting , in charge of the household for the first time , freed from the presence of a male in their family household for perhaps the first time .
There was limited information available to them on bodily functions , sex or birth control .
A Sorry Ending to a Furlough
In 1946 as the war ended and hundreds of thousands of troops were still overseas , the military tried again to keep them safe from disease .
An artist by the name of Ferree painted a poster that depicted a sad GI sitting on his cot .
The text is , " VD - a sorry ending to a Furlough .
Prophylaxis prevents venereal disease ! "
You Kept Fit and Defeated the Hun
Of course VD did not originate as a military problem in WWII .
In WWI there were numerous campaigns aimed at slowing the spread of this debilitating disease that can stop an army in its tracks .
One colorful poster depicts a smiling doughboy with an American eagle on his shoulder standing on the helmets of defeated Germans .
The text is :
You kept fit and defeated the Hun .
Now set a high standard .
A clean America !
Stamp out venereal diseases .
Weve Fought in the Open
H. Dewitt Welsh created this WWI poster and it was published by the H. C. Miner Lithograph Company of New York .
A semi-dressed female figure , representing Venereal Disease , is shown pouring blood from a wine glass .
Chained to her left wrist is a vulture , standing on a skull .
Beneath her are three macabre figures representing The Black Plague , The White Plague and Yellow Fever .
The headline reads :
Weve fought in the openbubonic plague , yellow fever , tuberculosis .
Now Venereal Disease
Colonel Care Says :
There were also numerous booklets and pamphlets issued for the troops in WWI explaining the danger and even claiming that venereal disease was unpatriotic and unmanly for the Doughboy .
The pamphlet above contains dozens of short comments all aimed at keeping American soldiers away from loose women .
I must say that I do love these comments .
Some examples :
How could you look the flag in the face if you were dirty with gonorrhea ?
Many a painted face camouflages syphilated blood .
Only a poor boob pays his money , loses his watch , gets the syph , and brags that hes had a good time
Which shall it be : to the mat with the Hun or to bed with a chippie ?
You wouldnt use another fellows toothbrush , Why use his whore ?
Keeping Fit to Fight
The second booklet is more technical and actually attempts to teach the soldier the perils of the diseases without any flashy talk or slang .
This booklet is several pages and some of the comments are :
A soldier in the hospital with VD is a slacker .
He keeps equipment idle .
He leaves a break in the line .
If you go with a prostitute , you endanger your country because you risk your health , and perhaps even your life .
You are a moral shirker .
Women who solicit soldiers for immoral purposes are usually disease spreaders and friends of the enemy .
If any soldier in a moment of weakness fails to keep out of the way of temptation and falls for a loose girl or a prostitute , he must take the early prophylactic treatment within a few hours
If he fails to take this treatment and later develops a venereal disease , he will be court marshaled for disobeying General Order No. 17 of 1912 .
Soldier , the country counts on you
VD was also a problem among the French .
In 1916 , Theophile - Alexandre Steinlen printed a poster for French soldiers fighting in WWI .
The title was " Soldat , La Patrie Compte Sur Toi . "
The poster depicted a woman and man embracing , followed by the physically debilitated soldier on his hospital bed .
A skull and crossed bones appear at the bottom of the poster .
Due to prevailing taboos , no mention of syphilis or gonorrhea is made , but the words on the tombstone make a connection between morality and patriotism .
The message reads :
Soldier , the country counts on you - keep healthy .
Resist the temptation of the street where a sickness as dangerous as the war awaits you It carries its victims to decay and death , without honor , without happiness .
. .
Disease is disguised - Do n't gamble with VD !
Poster image courtesy of Miscman.com
This poster was apparently produced in 1946 when the U.S. military was trying to enforce a policy of non-fraternization in the occupation zones between the troops and European women .
It depicts a dark and ominous female hiding behind the mask of a healthy beautiful woman .
The text is " DISEASE IS DISGUISED - DON'T GAMBLE WITH VD ! "
The poster was designed by Forsyth .
Loaded ?
I like this poster because the girls are attractive and almost coy ; not trampy  at all .
And , a Colt 1911 .45 automatic pistol is shown at the top .
That is the personal weapon I carried for many years and still possess .
Notice that the pistol is cocked and ready for firing .
You can read a few puns into that picture .
Going home ?
Do n't be delayed by VD
Poster image courtesy of Miscman.com
This 1946 poster shows a U. S. soldier at the end of the war waiting to return home .
A map of Europe is in background .
He is held in place by a rope that spells " VD " and is around his body .
The text is , " GOING HOME ? DON'T BE DELAYED BY VD . "
The artist is Schiffers .
In every recent war American troops overseas are tested for disease before they are returned home .
Any soldier found to have VD would be held until such time as a doctor pronounced him cured .
He would be allowed to board ship at that time .
Almost
Poster image courtesy of Miscman.com
In one of the most attractive and poignant 1946 posters an American occupation soldier ( probably airborne by his bloused boots ) stands at the dock and watches a troopship taking his buddies home to the U.S.A .
He is held back by a ghostly hand marked " V D . "
The text is " ALMOST ! "
The artist is Schiffers .
I should note that it was not an easy task to tell a man who had not been home for several years that he was " red- lined . "
There were several cases of doctors or medics being threatened , and I personally heard of one case where a G.I. pulled a knife on a First Sergeant after being told that he was held over in Southeast Asia .
Take Care
Poster image courtesy of Miscman.com
This 1946 poster depicts an American soldier running from a lightning storm .
High in the clouds are the ominous letters " VD . "
The text is " TAKE CARE . "
The artist is Schiffers .
U.S. Government WWII Posters for the Military Services
The U.S. Government and its agencies prepared dozens of posters during WWII in an attempt to keep servicemen free of VD .
The following posters were aimed at specific services and show that they were each considered vulnerable and addressed .
Buddy  it s great to know your safe !
The Army is the oldest service , created 14 June 1775 .
This leaflet shows a happy soldier about to go into town .
He has stopped by the dispensary and picked up prophylactics to make his evenings sex safe .
Live up to it soldier
This poster shows a young boy looking up to a soldier who is obviously his hero and telling him to face his responsibility because he is stronger than the various venereal diseases .
In some units such a disease would lead to a loss of rank and punishment so often the men would try to ignore it .
Allowing the disease to get stronger in the body would mean more eventual sick time and a longer loss of the soldier to the military .
It was important to get them treated and back at work .
VD Can be Cured
The Navys Birthday is 13 October 1775 .
The image shows a rather regretful sailor .
We assume he is going home and will have some explaining to do to his wife .
Or , perhaps he faces a Captains Mast and a loss of rank and privileges due to his venereal disease .
Both of these Men had Syphilis
The Marine Corps Birthday is 10 November 1775 .
This poster shows a healthy Marine in his dress blues and explains that he took his drugs when diagnosed , and below an crippled man in civilian clothes who did not take his drugs .
I have not seen any Air Force posters , but during WWII they were not a separate service and were in fact  the Army Air Force . 
She may look Clean  But
In this poster we see a mix of Army , Navy and a civilian together .
In a way , civilians were part of the war effort because they built the weapons and kept the economy moving .
So this poster warns all three of the dangers of having sex with a prostitute .
It can hurt the war effort .
Syphilis
I liked this poster a lot .
Almost all of the artwork we see warns the soldiers to stay away from loose women .
Here , the argument is reversed and they go right to the root of the problem and warn the women to stay away from these over - sexed , over - paid , and over - here  horny American GIs landing in Great Britain in 1944 in preparation for D - Day .
Unfortunately , it is a gag poster .
John Papalas pointed out it originally asked in 1943 : “ Is you trip necessary ? ” I can remember hearing that over and over as a kid during the war .
We could not drive our car because gas and rubber tires were rationed .
The original poster was prepared by the Office of Defense Transportation to remind civilians that railroads were needed to move troops .
By 1943 nearly all leisure travel had been banned due to fuel shortages and the push to conserve rubber by not using automobiles .
1974 Rhodesian leaflet
The threat of the Communist terrorists spreading venereal disease was used by the separatist Government of Ian Smith in the breakaway colony of Rhodesia in 1974 .
This 1974 leaflet depicts an African woman crying in front of a medical clinic .
She has been dishonored and told that she has a venereal disease .
Some of the text is :
The communist terrorists bring nothing but sickness and death to the people
See the woman crying .
She has just learned that the communist terrorists have infected her with V.D.
The mad dog communist terrorists of ZANU / ZANLA have infected many women in Rhodesia with this terrible sickness .
The children of such women will be born blind of crippled
A second 1974 leaflet also mentions V.D. and depicts Communist terrorists about to rape an African woman while her child looks on and cries .
Some of the text is :
Terror and death is the way of the communist terrorists in Rhodesia .
See the communist terrorists about to rape the young woman .
The child is crying because he knows from his mothers screams that she is being hurt .
The communist terrorists will probably leave the woman with V.D. which they caught in Mozambique communist training camps Lieutenant Joseph Smith with Platoon Sergeant Major Wilson
There was VD in Rhodesia , and one American who traveled there to take part in their war told me about his experiences .
Captain Joseph Smith , ( Ret. ) , 1st Battalion , Rhodesian African Rifles told me :
Private Dube told me one morning ;  Ishe ( Boss ) , Ive got VD !
It s 0400 and I am furious .
Our 10 day R & R is just over and this is the first patrol of our six week deployment .
 Why didnt you say something to the medic back at the base ? 
Private Dube has no answer .
We are about to deploy into a hot Tribal Trust Land and I suspect Private Dube just wants an extension on his R & R. Maj .
Lionel Dyck , C. Coy Commander , hears everything and orders the medic rousted from his cot .
 Medic , give Lt. Smith five ampoules of penicillin and five syringes .
( He turns to me ) Lt. Smith I want you to give Pvt .
Dube a shot every morning until the medicine is gone .
Major Dyke is angrier than I am .
He cant let Private Dube get away with this !
We launch the patrol and the next morning at 5 am I am awakened by the sight of Pvt.
Dubes naked right buttock .
 Im ready for my shot Ishe . 
It is a nippy winter morning and I fumble for the cold ampoule and warm it by rolling it between my palms before sucking out the thick white serum with the syringe .
I jab him in the upper thigh but notice the milky white serum trickling down Dubes black leg .
Whoops !
My first shot ever !
Might be Dubes first too .
Not a good beginning for either of us .
Next morning the shot routine is a re-run of the first .
The white penicillin runs down Dube 's rump to his ankle .
Im not getting the thick penicillin warm enough .
It s not getting it into Dubes rump !
Im ever hopeful my technique will improve by the third shot .
Meanwhile the patrol is uneventful .
No sign of communist terrorists and while crossing a wide open area I move everyone into an on - line formation .
To my left I hear a thud and see a small puff of dust .
One of my guys has fallen flat on his face in the open with no cover and no concealment and he is muttering up a storm .
I get everyone down and send my brainy African Platoon Sergeant , Sgt. Maj .
Wilson over to investigate my fallen soldier who is still muttering something into the sand .
A giggling Sgt. Wilson returns and reports that Private Dube is the fallen soldier .
 Why the hell are you laughing and what is Pvt. Dube muttering about ? 
I demand  You dont want to know sir says Sgt. Wilson who is still giggling like a school girl but now has small tears in his eyes .
Something is just too funny for words !
I insist I want to know and he again insists I dont .
Finally I pull rank and demand the truth .
 Private Dube says you re a shit doctor sir !
Sgt. Wilson blurts it out but has to look away he is laughing so hard .
I organize a small patrol to escort a still muttering Pvt. Dube back to base camp .
Luckily I have injected no - one since .
I can feel Lieutenant Smiths pain ( and Dubes too ) .
The military has a terrible way of assuming that every member is proficient in numerous skills , often leading to problems for everyone involved .
When I was in one organization the Army decided that it wanted close to 400 people checked for cholesterol .
Someone noted on my 201 file that I had once been a medic ( although a good 20 years earlier ) .
When I protested that I had not drawn blood in years I was told  You still have a 91B MOS in your 201 file and it is just like riding a bike , it will all come back to you .
I was called into the commanders office , told to pick a team and that I was now the NCOIC of the cholesterol control group .
We managed somehow to get through bleeding 400 people without killing anyone , but it was a close thing .
BLACK VENEREAL DISEASE CAMPAIGNS
Venereal disease has been mentioned in several PSYOP campaigns .
It sometimes appears in white propaganda as a way to keep an Army healthy and moving forward .
It is more valuable as black propaganda where it is used in several ways .
Sometimes , one combatant tries to convince an occupied people that their invaders consider their women immoral and infected .
At other times , one combatant will try to convince and enemy that their ally looks down upon their women .
This was especially true in the Philippines during WWII where the Japanese implied on several occasions that the Americans saw the Filipino women as whores to be used and discarded .
In other cases one combatant will try to destroy the morale of the enemy armed force while they fight at the front by stating that their wives and girlfriends are having illicit sex and being infected at home .
Guard Against Venereal Diseases
This Japanese black propaganda leaflet dropped during their advance in the Philippines alleges to be from the United States Army and warns American soldiers that Filipino women were unclean :
Guard Against Venereal Diseases
Lately there has been a great increase in the number of venereal diseases among our officers and men owing to prolific contacts with Filipino women of dubious character .
Due to hard times and stricken conditions brought about by the Japanese occupation of the islands , Filipino women are willing to offer themselves for a small amount of foodstuffs .
It is advisable in such cases to take full protective measures by use of condoms , protective medicines , etc. ; better still to hold intercourse only with wives , virgins , or women of respective character .
Furthermore , in view of the increase in pro-American leanings , many Filipino women are more than willing to offer themselves to American soldiers , and due to the fact that Filipinos have no knowledge of hygiene , disease carriers are rampant and due care must be taken .
US Army
You Can't Talk V.D. Out of Existence
The German dropped a similar black leaflet on Allied troops on the Western Front during WWII .
Military authorities demanded a nationwide war on vice .
They got a sham battle - a polite blood testing campaign which would not alarm ladies - aid societies and parent - teacher associations .
Nevertheless , police raided a large number of cabarets , dance halls and joints in 21 small , medium , and large cities .
These raids showed that of the 20,000 women investigated a staggering proportion had venereal diseases .
Over 80 % had V.D .
21 % were prostitutes .
Of the 79 % non-professionals
61 % were pickups ,
18 % were girl friends .
17 % were girls under 20 years .
84 % were wives of men serving in the armed forces abroad .
Both groups were mostly members of the growing band of " V " girls who declare that they feel a patriotic compulsion to console troops .
Is YOUR girl among them ?
You can't talk V.D. out of existence - it is there !
The British produced several black leaflets that mentioned VD .
One coded H.336 and entitled Merkblatt - Deutsche Nachrichtenhelferin ! has the following text : Notice German Womens Signals Auxiliaries !
Notice regarding Prevention of Venereal Disease .
German Womens Signals Auxiliaries :
Avoid sexual dalliances !
They reduce your capabilities and do not help your health .
An Auxiliary with venereal disease cannot do her job ; and a self - inflicted inability to serve is unworthy of an Armed Forces Auxiliary .
The Fatherland expects of you not only your complete ability to do your job ; it also wants you to some day become the mother of healthy children .
Avoid the use of alcohol , it weakens your strength of will and can lead you astray !
Avoid contact with casual acquaintances , especially in the occupied territories .
They almost always have venereal disease !
If you have , in an unguarded moment , been tempted into extra-marital sexual intercourse , do not irresponsibly disregard the regulations on disinfection .
If the disinfection process is done as soon as possible after sexual intercourse , it prevents venereal disease .
If done too late , it is worthless .
Pay attention to your commander and follow the orders which have been issued on prevention of venereal disease .
Take to heart the health instructions and warnings of your unit doctor !
Never conceal your disease and under no circumstances try to treat yourself !
Do not pay attention to the whisperings and advice of the layman .
Any treatment of venereal disease by a layman is legally forbidden .
Inappropriate or inadequate treatment can often have a high price in irremediable results for you and your future family .
If you notice indications on your body which look suspicious or disease - like , report immediately to your unit doctor .
Any venereal disease is treatable if it is taken care of promptly and professionally .
So do not hesitate when you are sick , instead rely on your unit doctor ; he will make sure your get healthy again .
Published by the High Command of the Armed Forces Notice how this leaflet implies that citizens other than German are infected , and also hints that the wife or sweetheart of the soldier might have a " dalliance " while he is away .
This certainly did not help the morale of the German soldier or the citizen of a foreign country either allied to Germany or sending workers into the Reich .
A second British black propaganda 4 - page booklet coded H.359 and entitled Deutsches madel !
Vorsicht ( German Girl !
Caution ) attacks the foreign worker ( who sometimes volunteered to work in Germany to help the war effort ) as a diseased individual .
The text is : GERMAN GIRL !
Caution !
Be careful in your selection of men friends .
Avoid associating with Foreign Workers !
LANZ Armorer of the German Farmer .
A candid word A candid word has become necessary .
Like every war , even this one that has been forced upon us has brought about a large increase in venereal disease .
The desolate conditions in the occupied territories , which make a mockery of any real health care , have become the most dangerous reason for the increase in venereal disease among the soldiers , and threaten to become a similarly great danger for the homeland , unless you carefully obey the instructions which have been given regarding your conduct with foreign workers .
The Reich Health Administration has however become aware that these regulations are ever more frequently being grossly neglected .
Contrary to the existing prohibitions and despite the shameful punishments prescribed by them , relationships with foreign workers continue to be formed .
The reports that the Reich Health Administration has regarding the state of health of the employees in the war industries provide absolute proof of this .
The level of venereal disease among factory employees has tripled in the past two years .
Here is just one example .
In a factory in an average - sized city in the Rhineland , which has a large population of foreign workers , a medical examination of the employees in the summer of 1940 found that , among 2,000 factory workers : 4.2 % were diagnosed as having venereal disease ,
2.9 % of them having gonorrhea , and
1.3 % of them having syphilis .
A repeat examination of the same factory two years later , with the same number of employees , showed : 13.5 % of them had venereal disease ,
9.7 % of them having gonorrhea , and
3.8 % of them having syphilis .
In some cases , the rate of increase in venereal disease among female employees exceeded that of the men .
The youngest females represented the largest proportion of these .
Many of these were irresponsible enough to avoid medical treatment out of fear of punishment .
Before the Reich Health Administration takes further measures against these dangers to our national health , it wishes to bring the current regulations to the heightened attention of female factory workers .
If any have had intercourse with foreign workers , it should be brought to the attention of the factory doctor immediately .
Anyone who can provide the full name of the foreign worker with whom intercourse took place can avoid punishment , even if any infection had previously occurred .
Only the foreign workers will be held responsible .
If these renewed warnings prove ineffective , compulsory enforcement through regular health inspections is planned .
Further directives will be issued shortly .
Venereal disease is an enemy of Germanys future !
Avoid use of alcohol , it weakens the strength of will and can lead you astray !
Avoid casual acquaintanceships .
They almost always have venereal disease !
If you , in a careless moment , have been lead into extramarital sexual intercourse , do not irresponsibly avoid medical care !
Never conceal your disease , and by no means try to treat yourself !
If you notice signs on your body that look suspicious or disease - like to you , report to the factory doctor immediately !
Any venereal disease can be healed , if it is treated promptly and professionally !

I owe a special thanks to Lee Richards , www.psywar.org , for supplying information about the above two black items from his forthcoming book Black Propaganda .
Translations courtesy of William S. Robinson .
The Rumor Campaign Besides leaflets , in an attempt to raise the morale of occupied Europe and lower the morale of the German military , civilians and their allies , the secret British Underground Propaganda Committee produced well over eight thousand rumors , ( they called them  Sibs from the Latin sibalare  to hiss ) .
Researcher Lee Richards mentions the whisper campaign and many of these rumors in his book Whispers of War , Psywar.org , 2010 .
In regard to British propaganda rumors about sexual activity within the Third Reich and its occupied territories he lists dozens of moral - destroying rumors .
I have selected a few of the more interesting ones : 4 July 1941  German officers know the address of all the prostitutes in Amsterdam that have VD .
They use them to get medical leave .
It is called  krank durch Freude ,  ( Illness through joy ) .
19 September 1941 
The girls in the Brest brothels have infected so many U - Boat crews with VD that it is now called  Malady V. 5 May 1942  Of 50 Spanish workers who just returned from Germany , 37 have venereal disease .
February 1943 - All women factory workers in Germany are to have a weekly VD inspection , carried out by medical students .
11 June 1943  The Germans have reduced the punishment for U - Boat crew members catching VD from a court martial to three days confinement .
4 August 1944 
In order to slow the spread of VD in the German Army , boys under 16 have been forbidden to enter brothels .
Soviet leaflet 1857 Courtesy of Klaus Kirchner info@propaganda-leaflets.com
Kirchner 's leaflet website is www.propaganda-leaflets.com
The leaflets prepared by the Soviet Union for Germany were often insulting , occasionally sexual in nature , usually long winded , and sometimes contained a safe conduct pass .
Soviet leaflet 1857 contains all of these attributes .
This Russian leaflet is aimed at destroying the morale of the German soldier by informing him that while he is at the front Hitler replaces them by foreigners who are taking their jobs , their land and their women .
The leaflet is entitled Auslaender nehmen Deinen Platz ein !
" Foreigners are taking your place . "
The first paragraph mentions the various nationalities that have been sent to Germany to work on the farms and in the factories ; French , Italians , Slovaks , Dutch , and more .
Two pictures are depicted on the front , a soldier holding his rifle at the top of the leaflet with the caption " While he squats in the bunker , " and a female in the arms of another man at the bottom with the text , " his wife amuses herself with a foreigner . "
There is a photograph of her husband in uniform on the wall behind them .
This was a common image on many Russian leaflets .
The back is all text .
Two letters are depicted from lonely German wives to their husbands at the front .
The letters are designed to intensify the feeling of uneasiness among the German soldiers .
One says that the foreigner plows his field now that he is away at the front .
It says that foreigners sleep in the beds of German women , and many of them are the wives of soldiers .
The second letter says that Berlin is now so international that the German language is hardly ever spoken or written .
On the reverse , the leaflet tells in no uncertain terms , " Yes soldier , you should know : there are women who like to get involved with foreigners .
You should also know : People who are gathered from all parts of the world will infect German women with venereal diseases of every kind .
Family life will break up should you , soldier , ever come home , you might be received by your wife with a black curly - headed Italian half - breed in her arms , and it will be your joy to raise this illegitimate child " The leaflet offers hope .
After the appeal " German soldier !
Must this be ?
No !
Your place is at home Dont take the war any longer !
Your family is waiting for you ! "
The message encourages the German soldier to leave the war .
Hitler is blamed for everything .
He has forced the German people into the war and taken everything that makes life worthwhile .
The leaflet ends with " No longer take part in the war !
Your family waits for you ! "
There is a passierschein safe conduct pass in German and Russian at the bottom of the leaflet .
The entire concept of producing posters and leaflets of the subject of sexually transmitted diseases is one that must be approached with great care .
There was a time when such things were not even discussed by proper gentlemen and ladies .
In times of warfare when men are away on distant shores under stress , and women find themselves home alone perhaps for the first time , the subject must be broached .
We have seen that some of the posters ask the men in uniform to use precautions as a form of patriotism so that they can continue to fight for their nation .
Others imply that catching such a disease is almost treason in a time of war .
The black leaflets pretend to be helpful and offer hints on medical care , but are written in such a way as to demoralize the front line soldier worrying about his wife or girlfriend back home .
The leaflets are almost all black and as a result are difficult to locate .
Modern Uses of VD in a PSYOP Campaigns
The 12 May 1987 issue of the British newspaper Guardian mentions North Korean Cold War leaflets that threaten AIDs to women who come in contact with American soldiers .
The Simon Winchester article entitled  Calling the Shots says in part : Balloons drift over the frontier whenever there is a northerly wind dropping small blizzards of leaflets the size of cigarette cards ...
The latest in bright poster colors , shows a bare - chested and obese American soldier , his chest alive with crawling bugs labeled  Aids . 
He is leering from cherry - red lips , about his passion for Korean women .
 Ladies of Korea !  the card advises .
 The only way to ensure you do not catch this fatal illness is to demand the immediate and total withdrawal of all American personnel from Korea .
Yankees go home !
The North Koreans have been broadcasting this message in a variety of forms ever since the war ended in 1953 .
The Americans , they claim , are to blame for Koreas tragic problem .
An Official U.S. Army Public Health Center Anti-HIV Poster
The battle against sexually transmitted diseases goes on today in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In June 2010 , there was a report in the British newspaper The Sun of a statement by Tory Minister of Parliament and ex-Army officer Patrick Mercer .
He claimed that in the Afghanistan badlands of Helmand Province the Taliban was placing syringe needles from HIV patients in roadside bombs .
The needles , it is claimed , could infect Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technicians sent to dismantle the bombs .
In addition , if the bomb goes off , the needles become deadly flying shrapnel .
The story seems absurd since the bombs can sometimes take out a city block and a needle , probably superheated by the blast , is unlikely to infect anyone .
More likely , this is Taliban propaganda meant to lower the morale of bomb experts and make them more cautious and prone to error .
As always , if any reader cares to comment on the article or has data that would make the story more meaningful , he is encouraged to write to the author at sgmbert@hotmail.com .

Addendum :
VD " War Stories "
Medics do have a Sense of Humor
This unofficial patch is for the survivor of 10,000 ( Gonorrhea ) drips
U - Tapao Air Base , Thailand
Apology : I promised the webmaster a serious article , but there are so many comical moments in regard to this subject that I feel a need to add a little section of " war stories . "
For those readers who demand a serious research project .
Read no further .
There were the strange things that the troops would say when questioned .
One soldier was doubled over with pain and said that he had not " pissed " in three days .
" Why did n't you see the doctor sooner " I asked ?
" I was too sick to go on sick call ! "
How do you answer that ?
An Unofficial U - Tapao AFB Nurses Patch
Then , there was the soldier who came in with a penis swollen about twice its normal size .
His only request ?
" Can they cure the disease but leave the swelling ? "
A medic reminds me of the time a captain reported for sick call and said , " I think I have a case of the enlisted men 's disease . "
Another medic explains his own discovery of a miracle preventative , : In 1966 Vietnam out in the boonies where I was , we did n't try to educate , just treat .
And boy , did we treat !!
Sick call was almost always about 50 % VD .
We supported an oil tanker Battalion and the guys always stopped at truck washes and got their ashes hauled .
When we had it , we gave out preventative doses of Tetracycline .
Of course , we kept a supply for ourselves .
We would take off to Binh Hoa or occasionally Saigon if we had any money .
We used up a lot of Tetracycline .
I took it routinely before sex and never had a problem .
I do n't know why the army could n't have just issued the stuff .
I have a good immune system , but probably the main reason I never caught VD was because before sex I always drank huge quantities of Beer .
Now that 's a fine tasting prophylactic !
500 cc  No sweat
A famous Bar Girl saying was  No Sweat GI 
One lab technician told me When a patient came in with soft chancre we took a scalpel blade , gave the sore a little scrape to get a sample and put it under the microscope for identification .
One guy came in and saw the blade .
He asked me " what you gonna do with that blade Doc ? "
Being a joker , I told him " that thing is infected and no good anymore , I 'm gonna cut it off . "
The guy 's eyes roll up in his head and he falls over backwards in a dead faint and splits his head open .
He is laying there in a puddle of blood and I see my career in the toilet and me with an article 15 or worse .
Luckily the guy revives and is too embarrassed to talk about what happened .
The moral ?
Never kid a guy about cutting off his cock .
They do n't react well .
Stop VD  Jack Off
An unofficial Patch for the Troops
Because it resembled the Black Power salute , some called it  Red Power 
Some of the men liked to give the girls pet names .
I was filling out a form on where one soldier got the disease and asked him the name of the girl : I dont know her real name but I calls her my little Goothiegoogoosexiemama .
OK and exactly how do you spell that ?
Penicillin Powered
This locally made patch was designed and sometimes worn by the medics at
Nakhon Phanom , Thailand .
Zap the Clap
This locally made patch was designed and sometimes worn by the medics at
the 545th General Dispensary
Then there was the week when about a dozen men reported for sick call with bad cases of soft chancre .
Every single one stated that he got it from  Susie Wong ,  a name obviously stolen from the 1960 movie , The World of Susie Wong .
So , a night or two later I am in the ville just outside the base having a cold beer when this really beautiful girl with prominent breasts ( rare in Asian women at the time ) sits down next to me to inquire if I would like a good time .
 What is your name ,  says me .
 Susie Wong ,  says she .
Darn , I now understand how she was able to take out almost a full squad .
She is a one - woman wrecking crew .
 No thank you Susie , maybe another time . 
Medic Dave Berry used to like to break up the monotony a little bit .
He told me :
At the Battalion Aid Station we had glass 50 ml syringes and 4 inch chest needles , which could be used to evacuate blood or air from the chest .
During my last month in Vietnam I was taken off line and it was pretty boring at the Aid Station .
We got tired of getting repeat visitors with the clap and decided to conduct some psychological warfare .
We filled the syringe with Phisohex disinfectant , which was thick and white , like Procaine Penicillin , and put it in the medication refrigerator with that 4 inch needle .
When a guy came in with a second or third dose of clap we would tell him that it called for a stronger dose of penicillin than what he had before .
One medic would get him to drop his drawers while another got that monster syringe out of the refrigerator .
We 'd go as far as swabbing his butt and then make sure that he saw what we were holding .
I saw soldiers jump farther than an Olympic long - jumper .
They 'd say " You 're not sticking me with that ! " and we 'd counter with ,  Well , I 'm not sure the regular dose will work , but we 'll try it one more time . 
As far as I know , that had absolutely no impact on the VD rate , but it was cheap entertainment .
Private First Class V. Lizza of Headquarters Company , Walter Reed Army Medical Center , told me his VD war story in regard to the U.S. invasion of Panama .
Apparently the rumor of the highly virulent drug - resistant form of VD still permeated the Medical Corps in the 1980s :
In 1983 I was a medical equipment technician assigned to Walter Reed Army Medical Center .
One day I got a repair order for a bed in one of the wards .
When I got there I had to don a Tyvek jumpsuit , latex gloves , booties , and wear a surgical mask .
The patient was too ill to be removed from the bed while I worked on it .
He had just arrived from Panama .
He was part of the brief invasion , and had contracted a fiercely virulent form of VD .
The only thing they knew about it was that it thrived under penicillin prophylaxis .
I have no idea what happened to him , but he really looked to be at death 's door .
Retired Master Sergeant Gregory H. Murry cracked me up with this story .
His entire unit is called to attention before the commander and they are not sure what has happened .
Are they in trouble ; are they being sent on a dangerous mission ?
Their colonel stands before them very solemnly .
He says : Men , I want to talk to you about a very serious situation involving this battalion Men , this battalion has the highest venereal disease rate in the entire 1st Infantry Division Murry continues :
It was dead quiet for a moment , and then the company broke out in loud cheers and laughter Men were giving each other five , the brothers were dapping and the platoon leaders were looking horrified The Colonel exploded in anger and began cursing .
The point of the story is that although the Army hated VD because it took soldiers out of the field and into a dispensary or on sick call , and civilians hated VD because it is considered dirty  and immoral .
Soldiers always considered about as dangerous as a runny nose .
And to make it better , it was a way of getting over on the military .
No matter where they sent you , you managed to get laid and even better , got a few days out of the field to lie on your bunk as the penicillin did its magic .
The Colonel basically told his men  We are number one !  and that is why they cheered .
You have to be very careful what you say to the troops .
I once visited a New York City firehouse where Engine 73 and Ladder 42 call home , and on the dining room wall was a gigantic mural of a steaming pot of shit at the end of the rainbow .
It was just awful , but extremely accurate in every detail .
I asked one of the firemen what it all meant .
He told me : The Chief of Department came down here , walked around and told us ,  This place is a shit house . 

OTTAWA–Canada 's former top soldier waged war on many fronts during his long march to the post of chief of defence staff – but the most intense were the counterinsurgencies on Parliament Hill .
Gen .
Rick Hillier has for the first time revealed his battle against Conservative officials who wanted him silenced and bureaucrats who tried to stifle his ambitious agenda to rebuild the military .
" We in the Canadian Forces and the Department of National Defence were at war but the rest of the government was not , and sometimes our war felt like it was in Ottawa , not Kandahar , " he writes in his memoir A Soldier First : Bullets , Bureaucrats and the Politics of War , a copy of which was obtained by the Star .
Hillier recounts the rocky recent history of the Canadian military from the perspective of the ultimate insider .
The former tank commander was executive assistant to the vice - chief of defence staff , the country 's No. 2 soldier , when two Canadian troops tortured and killed a Somali teenager in 1993 , an event that shook the force and prompted the Liberal government to disband the airborne regiment .
Hillier was deputy commander of the army when Canadians first went to Afghanistan after 9/11 , head of NATO operations in the country in 2003 and chief of defence staff when Canadian soldiers moved from Kabul into their current role in volatile Kandahar .
So deeply was Hillier involved in the efforts to rebuild the country , as the head of the International Security Assistance Force , that President Hamid Karzai turned to him before the 2004 Afghanistan elections for advice on a running mate .
Hillier steered clear of picking the country 's vice - president , but personally warned Fahim Khan , a warlord and former defence minister , that his finances would be frozen and his passport rejected around the world if he turned against Karzai in response .
Khan was picked as Karzai 's vice - president in this year 's national elections that have been marred by ballot - box stuffing .
A large part of Hillier 's final years was spent shuttling between Canada and Afghanistan , but his legacy will be in Ottawa , where he is credited with single - handedly reviving the confidence of the Canadian Forces following what he termed the " Decade of Darkness " – the 1990s – that was defined by budget cutbacks and crushed morale .
His folksy manner and ease with the media masked a laser - guided vision for the Forces when he was selected chief of defence staff by former Liberal prime minister Paul Martin in January 2005 .
But Martin 's successor , Prime Minister Stephen Harper , was n't as comfortable with Hillier 's ease in front of the television camera .
Hillier says Harper was a " very quick study " when the two men first sat down to discuss the Afghan mission after the Conservative election victory of 2006 .
" He grasped the military situation quickly and had obviously been following the mission , though he did n't have as many details as I was now giving him , " he writes .
" It quickly became apparent to me that he supported the mission and what Canada was doing in Afghanistan . "
Gordon O'Connor , Hillier 's former commanding officer , was a different matter .
O'Connor had an " out - of - date understanding " of the military and went around senior officers when seeking advice " to get the answer he wanted . "
While Hillier says they were able to resolve most of their differences , interference from officials in the Prime Minister 's Office was a constant during his 3 1/2 - year - term as chief of defence staff .
It began on March 4 , 2006 , after a series of newspaper and television interviews to promote the Canadian Forces and try to boost recruiting efforts .
Hillier was pulled into O'Connor 's office for a private chat .
" We want to see less of you , " O'Connor told a stunned Hillier .
" While he was never specific about who had been complaining about my profile , there was no doubt in my mind this `request ' was coming from the Prime Minister 's Office staffers and that Gord was acting as the front man , loyal soldier that he was . "
Hillier stuck to his guns , insisting on the importance of building the relationship between the military and the public and says he would rather have resigned than change course .
He was never again asked to lower his profile .

That did n't put an end to the pestering , however .
He was regularly questioned about decisions to give speeches or grant interviews .
But the biggest pushback came after a decision to hold a full and open ceremony when the bodies of soldiers killed in Afghanistan returned to Canada and make the sombre trek down Highway 401 , now known as the Highway of Heroes .
" Our new policy faced a few hiccups , particularly when we had pressure from PMO staffers suggesting ... that we should keep the aircraft with soldiers ' remains out of sight , or we should do it late in the evening or early in the morning , " he writes .
" This was a line in the sand for me . "
He reserves a chapter of his book to rail against the military 's " enemies throughout the Ottawa bureaucracy . "
He noted the huge flow of taxpayers ' money for things like guns and equipment led to resentment in other departments .

Brute force rather than aerodynamic efficiency is the key to bumblebee flight , Oxford University scientists have discovered .
In recent years scientists have modelled how insect wings interact with the air around them to generate lift by using computational models that are relatively simple , often simplifying the motion or shape of the wings .
" We decided to go back to the insect itself and use smoke , a wind tunnel and high - speed cameras to observe in detail how real bumblebee wings work in free flight , " said Dr Richard Bomphrey of the Department of Zoology , co-author of a report of the research published this month in Experiments in Fluids .
‘ We found that bumblebee flight is surprisingly inefficient – aerodynamically - speaking it ’s as if the insect is ‘ split in half ’ as not only do its left and right wings flap independently but the airflow around them never joins up to help it slip through the air more easily . ’
Such an extreme aerodynamic separation between left and right sets the bumblebee [ Bombus terrestris ] apart from most other flying animals .
" Our observations show that , instead of the aerodynamic finesse found in most other insects , bumblebees have a adopted a brute force approach powered by a huge thorax and fuelled by energy - rich nectar , " said Dr Bomphrey .
" This approach may be due to its particularly wide body shape , or it could have evolved to make bumblebees more manoeuvrable in the air at the cost of a less efficient flying style . "
Professor Adrian Thomas of Oxford ’s Department of Zoology , co-author of the report , said : " a bumblebee is a tanker - truck , its job is to transport nectar and pollen back to the hive .
Efficiency is unlikely to be important for that way of life . "
Observing insects in free – as opposed to tethered – flight is a considerable challenge .
The Oxford team trained bumblebees to commute from their hive to harvest pollen from cut flowers at one end of a wind tunnel .
They then used the wind tunnel to blow streams of smoke passed the flying bees , to reveal vortices in the air , and recorded the results with high - speed cameras taking up to 2000 images per second .
From these images the team were able to visualise the airflow over flapping bumblebee wings .
The old myth that " bumblebees should n’t be able to fly " was based on calculations using the aerodynamic theory of 1918 - 19 , just 15 years after the Wright brothers made the first powered flight .
These early theories suggested that bumblebee wings were too small to create sufficient lift but since then scientists have made huge advances in understanding aerodynamics and how different kinds of airflow can generate lift .
A plan by the city of El Paso , Texas to extend domestic partner benefits to gay and unmarried heterosexual partners of city employees was the centerpiece of a contentious City Council meeting on Tuesday night attended by " 25 pastors , churchgoers and self - described ' angry citizens ' " , according to the El Paso Times :
" Opponents of the plan , many quoting the Bible , spoke during the public portion of Tuesday 's council meeting .
Most
said the council 's plan to extend domestic partner benefits to city
workers did not reflect the views of mainstream El Pasoans .
' You 're opening up a Pandora 's box , ' said Tom Brown , pastor of Word of Life Church .
Council
members last week voted 6 - 1 , with Carl L. Robinson dissenting , to
include the benefits in the new city budget .
Final approval of the
spending plan is scheduled for a vote Aug. 25 . "
Gays and lesbians and those who voted for the measure did have one vocal defender in resident Lisa Turner , who gave an impassioned speech at the microphone calling out the " preachers of hate " while many laughed at her .
Said Turner : " Their parishioners , these are the people who teach their kids , and
teach … ( pauses )
I 'm sorry , I 'm getting emotional .
These are the
people in their church who say it 's wrong and they teach this … this
is why an 11 - year - old goes and hangs himself , because the children of
these ministers and people who go to the church have berated this
child , because he 's perceived to be different , he 's perceived to be
gay , and there 's so much pressure the child hangs himself .
And he's
11 - years old .
You tell me where in your Bible that 's OK .
It 's not . "

GINA Requires Employers to Post Notice , Review Policies
Stoel Rives LLP , Attorneys at Law
Dennis Westlind , Portland ,
The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act ( GINA ) takes effect November 21 , 2009 .
Is your workplace ready ?
Employers will soon be required to post a notice stating that they do not discriminate on the basis of genetic information , under proposed regulations interpreting GINA .
If you do n’t already have one , click here to download the full “ EEO is the Law ” poster , which describes all of the Federal laws prohibiting job discrimination based on race , color , sex , national origin , religion , age , equal pay , disability and genetic information .
If you already have a copy of “ EEO is the Law , ” then you can download and print the “ EEO is the Law Supplement , ” which contains GINA information .
( If you do n’t want to print it yourself , or if you need the poster in Arabic , Chinese or Spanish , click here to order a copy from the EEOC . )
What else should employers do to prepare for GINA ?
Here ’s a short , non-exhaustive list of things you can do to get ready :
– Add appropriate language to your EEO and anti-discrimination policies stating that you do not discriminate on the basis of genetic information ;
– Review your employment applications and employee questionnaires to make sure you are not intentionally or inadvertently requesting information about an applicant ’s / employee ’s family medical history ;
- If you need to get information about a family member ’s illness for purposes of determining whether a request for leave qualifies for Family and Medical Leave Act or state law leave coverage , make sure it is limited to only what you need to know to make the determination ;
– Determine whether incoming medical information you receive on an employee contains genetic information ( defined as : genetic tests of an individual or his / her family members ; the manifestation of a disease or disorder in family members of an individual , genetic services and participation in genetic research by an individual or his / her family member ) and if so , maintain and treat the information as you would a confidential medical record for ADA purposes – i.e. , maintained in a separate confidential medical file with proper limitations on disclosure .
– Make sure appropriate policies and procedures are in place to prevent inadvertent disclosure of genetic information when responding to a litigation discovery request , like a subpoena .
If you require a court order compelling disclosure before releasing the information , this should protect you .
– If you are a self - insured entity , make sure that you do not request or require or use purchased genetic testing or information for purposes of underwriting or to determine an individual ’s contribution / premium amounts .
Note that you can use genetic test results for purposes of making a determination regarding payment , though .
– Also note that genetic information is included as “ protected health information ” for HIPAA purposes and should be treated accordingly .
Broiling hens are kept in a completely enclosed environment About 136,000 hens died after their air supply was cut off during break - in at a poultry farm near Edinburgh .
Police said the ventilation to 12 poultry sheds was turned off , which led to the birds suffocating .
The incident happened at the Beechgrove Farm near Balerno in August , but details have only just been released .
Animal charity the Scottish SPCA said the hens would have suffered a " slow death " filled with " fear and pain " .
The farm is owned by Vion Food Group .
A police spokesman said 12 sheds containing live chickens were broken into and the environmental controls tampered with , causing the deaths of approximately 136,000 birds .
This is a dreadful incident and the scale of suffering is simply immense
Ross Minett
Advocates for Animals Officers do not believe the crime is the work of animal rights activists .
Ross Minett , campaigns director with Advocates for Animals , said he was not aware of any targeted action against local farms or the Vion Food Group as a whole .
Mr Minett said : " This is a dreadful incident and the scale of suffering is simply immense .
" It 's hard to imagine why anyone would deliberately cause tens of thousands of birds to die an awful death from overheating and asphyxiation .
" Unfortunately , intensively - grown chickens crowded together in huge factories are terribly vulnerable to any interference with environmental controls , whether deliberately or by accident . "
Farming experts said that the size and population of the sheds indicated that they were likely to be broiling chickens , normally packaged for consumption as roast chicken .
' Extremely callous '
The birds were thought to be worth about £ 400,000 in total .
Group communications officer at Vion Food Group , Rob Smith , said : " I can confirm that on the night of 17 - 18 August there was a break - in at Beechgrove Farm .
" Nothing was stolen , but the action of the culprits resulted in a high number of bird fatalities .
" A police investigation is presently under way and we are co-operating with their inquiries . "
Scottish SPCA chief superintendent Mike Flynn said : " This was either an extremely callous or thoughtless act that has resulted in thousands of animals suffering what must have been a very uncomfortable and slow death filled with pain and fear .
" Whoever is responsible for this clearly showed no consideration for the welfare of the birds .
Anyone with any information should contact the police . "

Phoenix 's KPHO - Channel 5 broke the news yesterday :
The FBI is looking into accusations that Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is using his position to settle political vendettas .
Over the past year , 5 Investigates examined more than two dozen complaints against the sheriff from business owners , government workers , mayors and law - enforcement officials .
They claim they spoke out against Arpaio , and shortly after , deputies paid them unwelcome visits .
Among the public officials who have been victimized by Arpaio 's little reign of terror in Maricopa County :
-- Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon , who sicced the Justice Department on Arpaio for his racial - profiling practices .
-- Mesa Police Chief -- Dan Saban , who ran against the sheriff in 2004 and 2008 -- Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard -- Maricopa County Manager David Smith -- The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors -- Superior Court Presiding Judge Barbara Mundell -- ACLU attorney Daniel Pochoda
We described Arpaio 's incredible thuggery late last year in his dealings with the public , especially those who dare criticize him .
An anti-Arpaio group called Maricopa Citizens for Safety Accountability , which formed last year in response to investigative reports and studies demonstrating that Arpaio 's insane obsession with illegal immigrants was destroying his office 's ability to actually deal with real law enforcement work , began showing up at county board meetings and asking to speak .
Arpaio actually sent out his deputies in force to patrol these meetings , and they arrested people for merely applauding Arpaio 's critics .
If that sounds fascist to you , that 's about right -- after all , some of the local neo -Nazis are Arpaio 's biggest fans -- and he 's been known to return the love .
The KPHO reporters also talked to former U.S. Attorney David Iglesias , made famous as one of the people fired by Karl Rove for failing to be political enough in his prosecutions .
His assessment was damning indeed ;
" I 've been in and around law enforcement for about 20 years -- state , local and federal level ( and ) even some military prosecution work .
I 've never seen anything like this , " Iglesias said after he looked through 5 Investigates ' research and did some on his own .
If he were handling the case , Iglesias said , " I would work very closely with the civil rights division in Washington , D.C. , and based on the information I have , I would seek an indictment . "
Arpaio did offer a response in his inimitable smear - the - critics style :
There were a number of blatantly false and incorrect assertions in Thursday night ’s incredibly long and laborious TV story on Channel 5 in which the reporter insinuated that Sheriff Arpaio and his office are breaking the law by “ investigating anyone who criticizes the Sheriff . ”
Rather than dignify the reporter and his piece with a lengthy response to assertions made , we will simply respond with a few ‘ facts ’ of our own .
Their expert interview who insisted that an indictment be sought against Sheriff Arpaio also said that no where in America should Arpaio ’s tactics ever be tolerated .
His name is David Iglesias .
This is the same attorney who was fired in 2006 by the US Attorney General for several different reasons .
Iglesias was criticized for looking the other way in an investigation involving ACORN , an organization that embraces illegal immigration and is currently under intense scrutiny and investigation by the US government for fraudulent schemes .
Paul Charleton , a colleague of Iglesias and was often quoted in the Channel 5 piece , was also a U.S. Attorney fired in that same 2006 house cleaning by the U.S. Attorney General .
Now he is the attorney of record for Don Stapley in his fraud investigation which obviously leaves Charleton as an impartial and bias observer of the facts .
Channel 5 has a few reporters and photographers working there who have an axe to grind against this Office .
That ’s fine .
But when it shows up as obviously as it did in last night ’s report , it underscores why many today feel that fair and impartial journalism has gone the way of the dinosaur .
I somehow do n't think carping about reporters is going to hold much water with the FBI and the Department of Justice , though .
Karma is headed Joe Arpaio 's way .
It wo n't be pretty , but it 's long , long overdue .

Now that gives me a good idea .
You know those story games , where everybody adds a word / sentence / paragraph and then the next person has a go ?
Well , how about the same thing with comics : each artist adds another panel ( or 3 ) to the bottom .
Look me in the eyes and tell me that 's not awesome .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A debate is emerging over how curbs on energy market speculation may impact oil prices , with at least one major bank boldly expecting the new rules will trigger a 30 - percent price plunge .
The outcome holds wide - ranging implications for G20 developed nations collectively spending as much as $ 4.8 trillion to stimulate their economies through the worst global recession in decades .
“ Regulators do n’t and should n’t talk about trying to influence prices , ” said John Brodman , a former Deputy Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Department of Energy .
“ But there ’s a growing political imperative out there .
An oil price rise of $ 30 a barrel would offset 40 percent of the stimulus spending .
That ’s not what these countries are looking for . ”
The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is moving to tighten regulation , working with more than a dozen overseas regulators to apply rules on exchanges where commodities trade .
The CFTC is expected to impose federal position limits in oil and natural gas markets soon .
The new rules may end exemptions that allow banks , funds and retail investor groups to build large positions unchecked .
So far , the CFTC push has n’t kept most analysts from forecasting oil prices will rise , spurred by higher fuel demand as the world ’s biggest economies regain steam .
“ Overall , we think that it is way premature to call a market collapse due to potential limits in energy markets , ” said Olivier Jakob at consultants Petromatrix in Switzerland .
But some believe the new rules could hit oil prices hard .
“ It ’s a bold view , ” said Eugen Weinberg , head of commodities at Germany ’s Commerzbank .
“ But we ’re convinced that regulation is coming and markets will react . ”
Commerzbank reduced its oil price forecast 27 percent , predicting oil may fall from more than $ 70 a barrel now , to $ 50 by the end of the year , and an average $ 55 in 2010 .
Commerzbank ’s outlook is uncommon .
A Reuters poll of 30 analysts this week showed the consensus oil price forecast rose for a fifth straight month , with barrels expected to fetch $ 73 in 2010 .
< O/ POLL >
U.S. bank Goldman Sachs GS.N , a giant oil trader itself , sees oil rising unfettered to $ 92 a barrel over the next 12 months .
Analysts are n’t sure how regulation will affect trading volume , or whether lower volumes would affect prices at all .
But some believe prices are bound to fall when speculators , or noncommercial traders , get squeezed by the new rules .
“ The writing is on the wall now .
If real position limits are put in place , the price of commodities will fall , ” said Michael Greenberger , a University of Maryland law professor and former director at the CFTC .
Noncommercial traders have come to dominate oil trading on New York Mercantile Exchange , or NYMEX CME.O .
As of April 2008 , three months before oil rose to a record $ 147 a barrel , they accounted for 71 percent of buying , up from 34 percent in 2000 , according to a 2008 CFTC report .
About 50 percent of traders in the U.S. oil futures market today are speculators , up from around 20 percent before 2002 , according to a Rice University study published on Thursday .
Exemptions have let operators like the U.S. Natural Gas Fund UNG.P -- an exchange - traded fund ( ETF ) that allows retail investors bet on rising natural gas prices -- to control the majority of buying in some key NYMEX gas contracts .
But UNG said recently it would scale back its position in natural gas contracts to comply with looming regulation .
UNG ’s announcement came days ahead of a rout in natural gas prices , which fell to new seven - year lows .
“ New , tighter volume limits have a far greater chance of pushing prices sharply to the downside , ” said one veteran oil market consultant in Connecticut , who requested anonymity .
LCM Commodities managing director Ed Morse said if CFTC rules do limit liquidity , less trading volume could make bearish fundamentals harder to ignore .
A recent rise in Saudi Arabia ’s oil output capacity may help keep oil prices in the $ 40 to $ 75 a barrel range , Morse wrote recently .
Most analysts warn it ’s impossible to draw clear oil price implications from CFTC ’s moves so far .
“ Obviously if the ( CFTC ) actions are large and misguided , you can have a knee - jerk reaction , but one really needs to wait for the details , ” said Amrita Sen of Barclays Capital .
Policymakers have made clear the push to oversee oil trading is n’t going away , after the G20 this year approved a combined $ 4.8 trillion in stimulus spending through 2010 .
Leaders of the G8 economies asked international bodies to study ways of intervening in oil markets when they met in Italy in July .
Finance ministers and central banks may revisit the issue when they gather in London September 4 - 5 .

The success of the programs is built , in part , on food writers like Michael Pollan , who have said , essentially , it ’s O.K. to satisfy your pork - chop cravings if you limit your intake and turn away from industrial meat practices , as well as chefs like Gordon Ramsay and Dan Barber , who have featured slaughtering and butchering as an intrinsic part of the food experience .
Image Credit ... Richard Haas
Mr. Ramsay famously portrayed the slaughter of pigs on his television show in England a few years ago , which outraged animal - rights activists in that country .
Mr. Barber , who has included the on - site slaughterhouse ( at least the outside ) on the public tours of his restaurant , Blue Hill at Stone Barns , has said that patrons generally tell him that knowing that animals were slaughtered on the premises adds to their dining experience ; giving them a new level of connection to their meals .
And yet , for student butchers , absolution can still feel a long way off , especially when butchering class can make you look like an extra for “ Saw III . ”
In Ryan Farr ’s whole - hog classes in San Francisco , students use hacksaws and hatchets to remove hooves and brains .
One volunteer in every class  lucky if you want to call it that  gets to chop off the head .
“ That always sort of breaks the ice , ” Mr. Farr said .
Mr. King ’s class is n’t for the squeamish , either .
“ When you come to class , wear your rain gear and boots , because there ’s going to be blood , ” he said .
Christian Rusby , who lives with his vegetarian girlfriend , did find the dinner afterward a bit unsettling .
As they feasted on pork , the odor of the slaughter came back .
Bachmann : We Have to ‘ Slit Our Wrists , Be Blood Brothers ’ Against Health Care Reform
Created : August 31 , 2009 21:50 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The Colorado Independent ‘s Ernest Luning passes along this rather remarkable quote from Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) , speaking earlier today at an event in Colorado .
“ This can not pass .
What we have to do today is make a covenant , to slit our wrists , be blood brothers on this thing .
This will not pass .
We will do whatever it takes to make sure this does n’t pass . ”
She ’s talking about health care reform .
Update : Luning passes on some more background .
Bachmann was speaking at a fundraiser , described as a “ personal legislative briefing , ” for the Colorado - based Independence Institute , which describes itself as a “ free - market think tank . ”
In a fiery speech that had the audience cheering , Bachmann railed against the dangers of health care reform and other Democratic initiatives , saying the proposals “ have the strength to destroy this country forever . ”
2nd Update : The Colorado Independent has more on Bachmann ’s appearance here .

Thomas Hampton , a teenager from Leeds , England , moved to South Australia in 1922 in order to work as a Barwell Boy on a farm , owned by a Mr. Poysden .
A year later he sent the following letter to the South Australia Immigration Department with a view to bringing his 12 - year - old brother over from an orphanage in Leeds .
Incredibly – according to the Australia Post website – his little brother George eventually made the enormous journey from England to Australia – unaccompanied – and was reunited with his brother in Adelaide .

It appears Chuck Todd did n't take too kindly to Jeremy Scahill 's drubbing he received on Real Time the other night .
From Glenn Greenwald :
According to Scahill ( via email ) , Todd approached him after the Maher show and the following occurred : Right as we walked off stage , he said to me " that was a cheap shot . "
I said " what are you talking about ? " and he said " you know it . "
I then said that I monitor msm coverage very closely and asked him what was not true that I said on the show .
He then replied : " that 's not the point .
You sullied my reputation on TV . "
Media stars are so unaccustomed to being held accountable for the impact of their behavior -- especially when they 're on television -- that they consider it a grievous assault on their entitlement when it happens .
Check out the entire post where Glenn 's got much more on some similar events going on lately besides just his own dust up with Chuck Todd .
Joe Klein got into it with Aimai of NoMoreMisterNiceBlog who happens to be I.F.
Stone 's granddaughter .
Glenn and Marcy Wheeler had an ongoing feud with Marc Ambinder of The Atlantic .
And now we 've got Scahill and Todd 's back and forth on Real Time .
Glenn summed all of this up much better than I could ever hope to :
Todd 's condescending responses illustrate the same point as the above episodes with Klein and Ambinder : in the eyes of Beltway mavens , those who warned about and worked against the radicalism and lawbreaking of the Bush administration are the fringe , crazed , out - of - touch radicals .
While Todd was fiddling around with pretty colored maps and fun polling games , Scahill was courageously investigating one of the most corrupt , dangerous and lethal private corporations in the world , yet it 's Todd who understands and must solemnly explain the hardened realities of politics to Scahill , the confused and silly Leftist .
There 's little question that when people look back at this period in American history , it will be difficult to comprehend what happened in the Bush era -- and especially how we blithely started a devastating war over complete fiction , while simultaneously instituting a criminal torture regime and breaking whatever laws we wanted .
But far more remarkable still will be the fact that , other than a handful of low - level sacrificial lambs , those responsible -- both in politics and the establishment media -- not only suffered no consequences , but continued to wield exactly the same power , with exactly the same level of pompous self - regard , as they did before all of that happened .
Looking back several decades or more from now , who will possibly be able to understand how that happened : the almost perfect inverse relationship between one 's culpability and the price they paid for what they unleashed ?
In fairness to Chuck Todd , he was not one of the ones out there cheerleading for the war and I really liked him when I 'd see him on C - SPAN 's Washington Journal about every morning when he was working for The Hotline .
He 's a numbers guy .
He was one of the best in the business at reading and sorting through the numbers on how our elections were going to turn out .
I do n't think coming to MSNBC however , has been good for Chuck Todd .
And now he's on there with the rest of them repeating the narrative of how terrible for the Democrats it would be if any investigations are allowed to happen , and if anyone from the Bush administration is held accountable .
It 's all politics to Chuck .
Here are my thoughts on that .
One of the reasons it would be turned into a game of politics is because Chuck Todd and the rest of the beltway media would report it as such , instead of a legal matter .
What Chuck Todd is relaying is what the Republican Party would like to see happen if the Democrats or this Department of Justice goes after the law breaking .
It would be the choice of those in the media to validate the Republicans ' sniping , which would inevitably follow ( and already has for that matter ) , or to dismiss them as playing partisan politics in order to cover up law breaking for political gain .
Of course since the media was part and parcel in allowing the atrocities of the last eight or nine years , that 's never going to happen .
In a study commissioned by NASA , a research team at the University of Missouri has made a mouse levitate , using nothing but magnetic fields .
As a result , the poor mouse floats in mid-air , wondering where the ground went .
Advertisement
The researchers put the three - week - old mouse in a specially designed chamber then applied an external magnetic field .
The field lifts up all of the water inside the little mouse 's body , apparently with no ill effects .
Well , there is one ill effect : during levitation , the mouse was visibly confused , scrambling around to try to find a wall or the ground .
The result of all of that scrambling was that the mouse began to spin wildly in the apparently zero - gravity chamber .
The next test subject was given a mild sedative to prevent this probably very difficult to watch disorientation .
Advertisement
Apparently , after only a few hours in the little levitation cage , the mice were fully able to acclimate to their new floating state , eating and drinking normally .
All of this mouse - floating is in the name of science , of course .
The team is running long term studies , set to be published in Advances in Space Research , on bone loss in zero gravity environments .
Scientists have previously levitated live frogs and bugs , but these levitating mice mean that scientists can observe the effects of weightlessness on a more human - like creature .
The team seems not to realize that an anti-gravity mouse is far more interesting than a microgravity study , but hopefully there are more cute floating animals in our future .

Before I say anything about America 's healthcare reform boondoggle , I 'd like you to behold my brilliant plan to end hunger once and for all ( and then , after you behold it , go and kick yourself for not thinking of it first ) .
Providing food to those without is simple , really : we 'll just pass a strict law requiring all hungry people to buy some , and if they do n't , fine them harshly enough to persuade even the most recalcitrant ones it's in their best interest to eat something once in a while .
Now change " food " to " health insurance , " and behold : you have what Congress and President Obama want to inflict upon hapless constituents like me .
Forget health insurance – what sick or struggling Americans need is healthcare .
They 're not the same thing .
You know that oft - quoted statistic that more than 60 % of American bankruptcies are caused by medical costs ?
More than half those made medically bankrupt had health insurance before they ever fell ill .
The problem with American health insurance is that the second you come down with anything more expensive than a head cold , your insurer will squirm through any loophole it can find to deny paying for your coverage .
And my government wants to reward these companies with a captive customer base , via purchase mandates enforced by our draconian legal system .
This is where my British friends say : " That 's why you need a single - payer government program like our NHS !
You do n't want corporate accountants deciding your medical treatment , let government accountants do that instead . "
This did n't work too well for Oregon resident Chrissy Steltz , subject of a recent feel - good news story about doctors and charities who devoted time and money to rebuild her face after a blast from a drunk - wielded shotgun literally blew it off ten years ago .
So much scar tissue clogged her nasal passages that she could n't even breathe through them until her surgery last month .
But her insurance provider – the state - run Oregon Health Plan – refused to fund reconstructive surgery on the grounds it was merely " cosmetic . "
I do not want my healthcare decisions made by bureaucrats who think that having a face with a nose you can breathe with is no health issue but a mere matter of vanity .
My current healthcare plan is called " Do n't get sick unless you can treat it with over - the - counter medicine . "
This system has worked so far , and I even have a backup plan in case I catch something too severe for treatment by a pharmacist : a few thousand dollars stashed away in case I need to become a " medical tourist " to India or Thailand , buying treatments I can't afford back home .
And if that does n't work , I 'll try placing personal ads in various European newspapers : " Red -haired American seeks British , French or Scandinavian national for matrimony and medicine .

Q . Why did my wood door just get bigger ?
A . You ’re not imagining things .
Wood doors can indeed experience seasonal affective disorder .
They are porous and , if not protected properly , can contract in dry air and expand in humidity  sometimes considerably  which is why the bathroom and front doors are often the tightest fits in the house .
This so - called “ door swellage ” is a topic of particular passion for those in the door industry , who look at the world as a collection of spaces separated by hinges , wood and jambs .
According to them , too much moisture and not enough water - repellent finish is a combination to avoid at all costs .
“ I like to say that a wood door is only as good as the finish that ’s on it , ” said Duane Berger , a manager of Frank Lumber Door Store in suburban Seattle .
Beyond that , there ’s also the location of the door  and of the house itself  to consider .
For starters , regions with heavy moisture in the air are trouble spots , Mr. Berger said .
“ Southern humid states and northern snow states both have big problems , ” he said .
“ And it matters where the door is  southern and western exposures get a lot of sun , and it can bake the finish right off , even if it ’s only 30 degrees out .
People do n’t realize that . ”

Smart Choices companies are n't so smart choices
What integrity really means
Science
( Natural News )
The big food companies have dreamed up yet another clever con to sell processed junk foods to parents and children : A " Smart Choices " label that implies the food product is a smart choice for health and nutrition .
The problem is that the standards for qualifying for this designation were set by the food companies themselves , and processed junk foods like Froot Loops ( a sugary breakfast cereal ) qualify .
Froot Loops is 41 percent processed white sugar .
It also contains processed flour and .
But that 's not all you 'll find in the box : Froot Loops is also made with synthetic coloring chemicals , including Red # 40 , Blue # 2 , Yellow # 6 and Blue # 1 .
The No. 1 ingredient of Froot Loops is , and each serving contains 12 grams of sugar .
So how , exactly , did Froot Loops qualify for the " Smart Choices " label ?
I 'll tell you how : Because .
It 's a manipulative , dishonest food package labeling system that is intentionally designed by the processed food companies to mislead and misinform consumers into buying processed food products , in my view .
You'd have to be deeply misinformed about nutritional basics to think that a processed breakfast cereal made of 41 % sugar , partially - hydrogenated oils and artificial coloring chemicals is a " smart choice " for any child .
A more appropriate label might beor , but certainly not " Smart Choices .
"
In my opinion , this marketing fraud is little more than a marketing gimmick .
It makes you wonder who , exactly , came up with it .
The president of the Smart Choices board is Eileen T. Kennedy , dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University .
( http://nutrition.tufts.edu/1174562918741/Nut...
Eileen Kennedy and other Tufts University faculty members have established ties with the Kellogg 's company , having participated in a " Children 's Health " forum that was co-sponsored by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation .
That event , held in June of this year , was entitled : .
It claimed to offer in - depth discussions on topics like " childhood obesity , nutrition standards , global child nutrition and school food . " ( http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/...
( Did their discussions ever mention that perhaps children should n't eat breakfast cereals made with 41 % processed sugar ? )
In promoting the event , Eileen Kennedy was quoted in a joint press release , admitting how closely her university works with food companies :
She certainly accomplished that .
Now , products made with 41 % refined white sugar are fraudulently marketed as " Smart Choices .
" Guess who else was invited to speak at the event ?
Dr. Cathy Woteki from Mars , Inc. , makers of candy bars and other sugar processed foods that are aggressively marketed to children .
It all makes you wonder :
With all these corporate junk food giants being so heavily involved in this event presented by Tufts University , what exactly does this university really stand for in regards to healthy food for children ?
Does Tufts University itself stand behind the promotion of sugary junk foods for children ?
Does it endorse products like Froot Loops being labeled as " Smart Choices " for kids ?
Here are the ingredients of Froot Loops : SUGAR ; WHOLE GRAIN CORN FLOUR ; WHEAT FLOUR ; WHOLE GRAIN OAT FLOUR ; OAT FIBER ; SOLUBLE CORN FIBER ; PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL ( ONE OR MORE OF : COCONUT , SOYBEAN AND /OR COTTONSEED OILS )  ; SALT ; SODIUM ASCORBATE AND ASCORBIC ACID ( VITAMIN C ) ; NIACINAMIDE ; REDUCED IRON ; NATURAL ORANGE , LEMON , CHERRY , RASPBERRY , BLUEBERRY , LIME AND OTHER NATURAL FLAVORS ; RED # 40 ; BLUE # 2 ; TURMERIC COLOR ; YELLOW #6 ; ZINC OXIDE ; ANNATTO COLOR ; BLUE #1 ; PYRIDOXINE HYDROCHLORIDE ( VITAMIN B6 ) ; RIBOFLAVIN ( VITAMIN B2 ) ; THIAMIN HYDROCHLORIDE ( VITAMIN B1 ) ; VITAMIN A PALMITATE ; BHT ( PRESERVATIVE ) ; FOLIC ACID ; VITAMIN D ; VITAMIN B12 .
Is , really going to tell us -- with a straight face -- thatReally ?
She might answer , of course , that " it meets U.S. government nutritional guidelines . "
Those are the same guidelines that have already made the United States of America a nation grappling with a pandemic of obese children and adults .
Clearly , U.S. government nutritional guidelines are a public health disaster .
If we hope tothe health of our children , it only stands to reason that we mustbeing followed to feed our kids .
And you can't improve nutritional guidelines if you 're in bed with the very same corporate food giants who are making and peddling their sugary , chemically - enriched breakfast cereals that promote diabetes and obesity in the first place .
You also can't improve kids ' health if you 're nutritionally ill - informed and yet you 've somehow found your way into a position of influence over nutritional policy ... as seems to be the case with Dr. Eileen Kennedy .
Here 's her gosh - darned explanation of why Froot Loops deserves the " Smart Choices " label , in her own words : " You 're rushing around , you 're trying to think about healthy eating for your kids and you have a choice between a doughnut and a cereal .
So Froot Loops is a better choice .
" Huh ?
Is she serious ?
Froot Loops gets a Smart Choices label becauseIs this the limit of the nutritional awareness ofof a nationally - recognized school that 's part of the Tufts University system ?
This all really reminds me of the movie , where the whole nation is run by complete idiots and water fountains have been replaced with sugary sports drinks because everybody knows that " water is only for toilets .
"
In terms of really idiotic thinking , check out this quote published in the New York Times : " Dr. Clark , who is a member of the Smart Choices board , said that the program 's standard for sugar in cereals was consistent with federal dietary guidelines that say that ' small amounts of sugar ' added to nutrient - dense foods like breakfast cereals can make them taste better .
That , in theory , will encourage people to eat more of them , which would increase the nutrients in their diet .
" Break down this logic for a moment : Sugar is GOOD because it encourages children to eat MORE processed breakfast cereals !
How on earth could this be a legitimate answer in a nation wherein the first place ?
The utter abandonment of basic common sense by the people in this program is truly awe - inspiring .
It really makes me wonder how we can ever turn around the health problems of this nation when we have such nutritionally illiterate people being quoted in the New York Times as nutritional experts .
( Or perhaps the NY Times was just trying to point out how nutritionally ignorant these people are , and on that point it succeeded wildly ... ) Tufts University is an outstanding academic institution .
It 's done a lot of good work and produced many important studies on nutrition and health .
But this pro-sugary - cereals stance by its nutrition school dean is , well , just flat out embarrassing .
It makes Tufts University look like the best little corporate nutrition whorehouse in Boston .
They might as well just remove the word " science " from the name of the school : That name should probably be replaced with this one , which is more accurate : I 'm pretty sure the Friedmans would n't appreciate that name , but neither would they likely appreciate a deeply misinformed dean potentially compromising the reputation of their school by seemingly selling out to the very companies whose products undeniably contribute to our kids becoming obese and diabetic in the first place .
Do n't let 'em get away with this sell out .
Contact the School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University and tell 'em what you think about their dean endorsing Froot Loops for children ( among other processed junk foods ) under the " Smart Choices " label .
This is inexcusable !
Their contact page is right here : http://nutrition.tufts.edu/1174562918741/Nut...
Not all top university nutritionists are hopelessly ignorant when it comes to nutrition , by the way .
The chair of the nutrition department at the , Walter Willett , told the New York Times that many products carrying the " Smart Choices " label " are horrible choices . "
In fact , quite a number of influential nutrition leaders have spoken out publicly against Dr. Kennedy .
In case you 're curious , here 's the list of the companies participating in this " Smart Choices " label program : Kellogg 'sKraft FoodsConAgra FoodsUnileverGeneral MillsPepsiCoTyson
Foods ... it reads like a who's who of processed food and junk food giants .
In terms of making truly smart choices at the grocery store , by the way , , in my view .
Michael Jacobson , the public health watchdog from CSPI , participated as a panel member in the early days of the Smart Choices program , but he soon quit , explaining " It was paid for by industry and when industry put down its foot and said this is what we 're doing , that was it , end of story . "
In other words , Jacobson rightly refused to sell out his conscience to a group of corporate junk food promoters .
That 's a rare display of genuine integrity in our world .
I applaud Jacobson for quitting the Smart Choices program , which is obviously just a fraudulent marketing gimmick devised by these companies to intentionally mislead consumers .
It 's too bad the dean of Tufts University 's nutrition school could n't find the backbone to adhere to similar principles .
In a nation suffering from runaway health care costs , widespread nutritional deficiencies and an epidemic of childhood obesity , it 's truly disheartening to see an influential nutrition leader from one of the nation 's top universities blatantly promoting processed junk foods for children .
I 'm appalled , saddened and somewhat surprised to see this in 2009 .
While the nutritional advice of Eileen T. Kennedy might have passed muster in the 1970's era of bleached white Wonder Bread and chemically - enhanced TV dinners , today we know a lot more about the links between the dietary intake of sugars and childhood obesity , diabetes , heart disease and behavioral disorders .
We know that feeding a nation of children sugared - up breakfast cereals and soft drinks is a sure recipe for raising a generation of obese , diabetic children and teens .
As the dean of the school of nutrition at Tufts University , how is it possible that Mrs. Kennedy could have missed this ?
Has she been in an aspartame - induced coma since 1975 ? ... and now she suddenly awakens from her decades - long slumber to slap on a pair of polyester pants and champion Froot Loops for children as a prominent dean at Tufts University ?
Is this some bizarre rejected screenplay from a " B " movie script ?
Will her head now spin around as she spouts devilish verse from a demonic spirit that has occupied her body and filled her head with thoughts of sugary cereals ?
The whole thing just defies reason .
It 's difficult to believe this is happening today , in America , in a top- rated university .
So read the sources below .
Check it out for yourself as you confirm the truth of what I 'm reporting here through articles in the NY Times , CBS News and Reuters .
See for yourself just how corrupt and / or ignorant the top nutrition leaders in our nation 's universities can be on this crucial issue of the diet of children .
And when you see this clearly , you 'll finally understand why America has more fat , diabetic children than any other nation in the world .
It 's that simple .
In my opinion , corporate money has bought off key influencers who set public nutrition policy , and they have conspired to feed our kids more sugar , more processed foods , more junk and more lies about nutrition even while their selfish actions may very well bankrupt our entire nation through runaway health care costs .
One final truth comes out in all this :
The USA 's national nutrition policies precisely mirror its national food supply -- they 're both processed , bleached , adulterated and wholly devoid of any useful substance .

Thom Hartmann :
Here ’s where we stand .
When King John signed the Magna Carta at Runnymede in 1215 in England , there were 500 million humans on Earth .
We had filled every continent , every continental space on this planet except Antarctica , and the world was not lightly populated .
By 1800 we hit our first one billion , one thousand million , one billion people .
All of human history , one billion people , in 1800 .
2nd billion took only 130 years , 1930 .
3rd billion took only 30 years , 1960 .
4th billion took only 14 years , 1974 .
5th billion took only 13 years , 1987 .
6th billion took only 11 or 12 years , 1999 .
And we are now pushing 7 billion within the next 3 years .
Every American child born adds 9,441 metric tons of carbon dioxide to the carbon legacy of their parents .
A child born in the U.S. has 160 times the impact on the planet , not even global warming , just total impact on the planet of a child born in Bangladesh .
And a child born in Bangladesh is a problem for Bangladesh now , because most of the , about half of the population in Bangladesh does not have access to safe water , drinking water , food supplies or sanitation .
An extra child is almost 20 times more important than some of the other environmentally sensitive practices .
You want to drive a high mileage car , recycle , use energy efficient appliances , replace light bulbs .
You can do everything and become as super efficient as you think possible , and having one child is going to wipe that out 20 times .
And yet we have voices like John Gibson over at Fox News , pointing out : " Now , it 's time for " My Word . "
Do your duty .
Make more babies .
That 's a lesson drawn out of two interesting stories over the last couple of days .
" First , a story yesterday that half of the kids in this country under five years old are minorities .
By far , the greatest number are Hispanic .
You know what that means ?
Twenty - five years and the majority of the population is Hispanic . "
Oh my God !
" Why is that ?
Well , Hispanics are having more kids than others .
Notably , the ones Hispanics call " gabachos " -- white people -- are having fewer . ... "
No , we can't have this !
Hispanics ?
" To put it bluntly , we need more babies . "
White babies .
" Forget about that zero population growth stuff that my poor generation was misled on .
Why is this important ?
Because civilizations need population to survive . "
Especially white people .
" So far , we are doing our part here in America but Hispanics can't carry the whole load . "
No , we need white people .
" The rest of you , get busy .
Make babies , or put another way -- a slogan for our times : " procreation not recreation . "
That 's " My Word . "

Marc Morano is with us , ClimateDepot.com his website .
Marc Morano , you ’re not with James Inhofe 's office any more ?
Marc Morano :
No , I left in March of this year to go out on my own and very happy with that .
I ’m unleashed from the U.S. Senate ’s bureaucracy .
So I ’m having a great time at ClimateDepot.com .
Thom Hartmann :
Want to tell us any deep dark secrets about your former employer ?
Marc Morano :
No , actually , he was absolutely great to work for .
You ’d be surprised though , the U.S. senate is a bureaucracy .
Thom Hartmann : Oh , sure .
Marc Morano :
And as much as I got out , in terms of global warming , controversial articles on global warming and all that , I had a lot of internal battles to get that out , even , you know , on the Republican side .
So it was you know , Senator Inhofe has been a leader on this but I ’m now heartened to say that especially during this last debate , many congressman now are taking on the science .
I think Gore ’s film had momentarily scared people away and the United Nations report , but I think now that they are coming around and they ’re realizing that the United Nations and Al Gore are not the final word on Global Warming .
But I enjoyed my time in the senate , particularly the junkets .
I took a junket with Barbara Boxer to Greenland in July of 2007 .
And that was incredible .
Huge carbon footprint .
Equivalent of having a kid , we chartered planes , helicopters , boats , a lot of fun .
Thom Hartmann :
The irony of it all is pretty mind boggling , sometimes , Marc .
The issue of population .
We are pushing seven billion humans .
I would submit to you that to the extent that we have a global warming problem , and you want to say that there ’s no global warming problem , I think that you must agree with me that we have a problem with a billion human beings having Tuberculosis , with three and a half billion human beings living on less than $ 5 a day , with three to four billion human beings not having access to reliable water supply , safe water supplies , that we are pushing the carrying capacity of this planet pretty hard .
Marc Morano :
Well I will say this .
When you have , as you just mentioned , a lot of lack of development , there are too many people for areas that ca n’t support them with their infrastructure .
And the solution to that , is not to have less people , the solution is to bring in cheaper abundant carbon based energies and allow the 1.6 billion people or so who do n’t have running water , who do n’t have electricity , who live naturally , to get all of that .
Thom Hartmann : Give them all coal !
Marc Morano : Forget all that !
Coal is carbon based , including coal , one of the liberators of mankind in the history of our planet .
So if you are worried about the plight of humans you need more carbon based energy .
Thom Hartmann :
In the 1980s we exceeded termites as the largest single specie mass of protoplasm on earth .
And that was you know , all the different species , I guess the largest genus .
Marc Morano :
Well I think your battle is with rich people .
There ’s a study out overpopulation of the wealthy , the richest half billion people responsible for 50 % of the world 's CO 2 .
If we eliminate half of the rich people , we could eliminate ...
Thom Hartmann :
Well , let ’s put the U.S. population back , when Jack Kennedy was sworn in as President , the world population was only three billion , we are now over six .
And the U.S. population was in the neighborhood of 150 million , we are now over 300 million .
And I was alive back then , and my recollection is , things were pretty good and we were well populated .
Why not shoot for negative population growth .
Not precipitous I ’m not calling for , you know , euthanasia or you know , God forbid a plague or anything like that , but let 's start dialing back the number of human beings on this planet .
There are a whole bunch of good reasons , including climate change .
Marc Morano :
Well first of all , no , there ’s no reason .
In fact , Grist Magazine , I think it was back in late 2005 , had an article “ Is Too Few People The Population Problem ? ”
And if you look at some of the UN estimates , some of them show , the low end shows , if I have these numbers right , 7.9 billion by 2050 and at the end of the century , by the low end , we could have a drop of population at current , by current levels .
You ca n’t look at the population , you keep going back to Magna Carta , John Kennedy , it ’s like looking at your child 's growth rate .
From an infant to a teenager , the growth rate is huge , from a teenager to a toddler it 's huge .
But you can't extrapolate that out into the future .
And the same is true with population .
Population stabilizes as countries get wealthier , as countries get more infrastructure , their populations stabilize .
Thom Hartmann : Actually population stabilizes when women get power .
Marc Morano :
To the point now where Europe is n’t even replacing its population levels .
So as the developing world , the billions I mentioned , not with electricity and running water , as they get infrastructure , their population rates too will decline .
So what happens , it ’s a red herring argument .
Thom Hartmann : Well , what happens , actually ...
No , it ’s not Marc Morano , it ’s not .
And there are many countries that are very , very well developed , Doha , the UAE , Saudi Arabia .
You ’re looking at a lot of countries where there 's a lot of money , theres a lot of development , there ’s no lack of infrastructure , there ’s no lack of birth control and they ’re still having 11 kids .
And the reason why is because ...
Marc Morano :
It will come .
Thom Hartmann : Because in countries where women have power , population stabilizes .
Now women having power is usually a consequence of women having education .
And education usually , you ’re right , does follow development of some sort .
But at a very fundamental level , as Greg Mortenson has pointed out with his book “ Three Cups of Tea , ” in the Taliban regions of Pakistan building schools for girls , which is not development , is not increasing their carbon footprint , is reducing population explosions and is also getting the Taliban thrown out .
It ’s doing away with Muslim extremism , fundamentalism , religious extremism .
So , you know , that ’s a good thing .
But how about in the United States , we just said you know , we ’re going to stop subsidizing children with a tax deduction .
We ’re giving people a couple thousand bucks a year off their taxes to have a baby .
That ’s crazy .
Marc Morano : I do n’t know about , you know , you get into mortgage interest deduction , all that stuff , I do n’t want to get into a tax codes , but the bottom line is there is no reason for us to limit our population .
Thom Hartmann :
Why not get into the tax code ?
Marc Morano : I ’m saying , I ’m not going to get into an argument over what to tax .
I mean I ’d probably favor a flat tax with no deductions or no income tax .
But my point is .
Thom Hartmann : I see .
Well let me challenge your point that we ’ve got a problem with negative population growth .
In those countries where population goes down the price of labor goes up and the middle class gets stronger .
Marc Morano :
Well that ’s probably a consequence of wealth and development and human interest factors .
Thom Hartmann :
No , it ’s a consequence of the market for labor .
Marc Morano :
But when you do n’t need to have as many kids because they do n’t survive a childhood you tend to have less kids if you ’re not thinking I need to have X amount because high infant mortality rates , which is what we ’re seeing around the world which are ...
Thom Hartmann :
That ’s not what ’s driving it in the UAE .
It ’s the power of women .
Marc Morano : Right , I mean there ’s a whole bunch of different factors .
There ’s actually , Caltech scientists just came out in June of this year , and said more people , over population may save the earth from global warming .
Their theory is more nitrogen , people take nitrogen out of the atmosphere and cooling the planet .
The more of us there are , the cooler the planet .
So , you oughtta be out there saying be fruitful and multiply .
Thom Hartmann : Marc , whatever you ’re smoking , I do n’t want any of it .
Marc Morano .
I ’m sorry , I did n’t mean that .
I ’m glad you took that in good nature .
ClimateDepot.com , Marc ’s new website .
Marc , always great sparring with you .
Marc Morano :
Thank you very much .

In many parts of India you can see people enjoying bhang / hashish ( or cannabis / marijuana ) by the roadside without attracting a look of surprise or disapproval .
It is only when the Western world began to raise hue and cry that people in the urban areas began to smoke / drink it discreetly at the occasional activation of the dormant laws .
In nearly 80 per cent of India it is still openly consumed ( generally in moderation ) ; some places even have legal shops .
India does not suffer from the Western world ’s obsession with “ sin ” and “ evil ” that invariably leads to suppression , excesses and confusion .
A recent Western study again serves to create unnecessary alarm instead of creating a healthy debate on this issue .
The Independent of Britain reports : “ Today , an estimated one in 25 adults of working age – 166 million people around the world – has used cannabis to get high , either in ignorance or defiance of its damaging effects on health .
Now , the extraordinary popularity of the drug is posing a significant public health challenge , doctors say .
“ Writing in The Lancet , Wayne Hall of the University of Queensland and Louisa Degenhardt of the University of New South Wales , Australia , say cannabis slows reaction times and increases the risk of accidents , causes bronchitis , interferes with learning , memory and education and , most seriously , may double the risk of schizophrenia .
Yet these effects have failed to dent its popularity . ”
A comment that followed this article is pertinent : “ If there has been an increase of schizophrenia at all in the West , and it can be established that there is a correlation with cannabis , could n’t it be that cannabis makes a person see things more clearly ?
And seeing things more clearly , makes a person vulnerable and uncertain .
“ And considering the utter and sheer stupidity of modern politics , I would definitely become schizophrenic if I had to grow up in these times .
I would like to suggest that schizophrenia is first of all caused by a political system that is based on lies , distortion of reality , egoism , greed and most of all , a consistent lack of morality .
“ If our enlightened leaders had put just as much effort in fighting the disastrous effects of alcohol abuse , just think how many lives could have been saved … . ”
Read the details about the study here …
And here …
So what can be done ?
Despite stringent laws that the Western world has , a country cannot put such a huge population behind bars .
In fact , the first question to be asked is why so many people are turning to drugs ?
Is there something basically wrong with the manner these countries are being run ?
We generally look at the symptoms and not at the real disease .
Or , is there a conspiracy to make such a highly popular natural drug illegal so that the mafia , and their benefactors in high places , rake in the mullah ?
British actor David Niven recalled in his wonderful book “ Moon ’s A Balloon ” how he indulged in bootlegging in America during the prohibition days there .
No one dare question the dangerous side - effects of certain drugs produced by the pharmaceutical industry , which is said to be most powerful and , in terms of profit - making , next only to the arms manufacturing industry .
Alcohol and medical drugs manufacturers are encouraged to glamorize their products and seduce the most vulnerable population .
It is only recently that stricter warnings have been implemented on cigarette packets .
So we now have powerful alcohol , medical drugs and tobacco lobbies who would not allow any competition .
These well - entrenched lobbies influence decision - making at the top worldwide .
Says a Wikipedia entry : “ Cannabis was criminalized in the United States in 1937 due to Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 .
Several theories try to explain why it is illegal in most Western societies .
Jack Herer , a cannabis legalization activist and writer , argues that the economic interests of the paper and chemical industry were a driving force to make it illegal .
“ Another explanation is that beneficial effects of hemp would lower the profit of pharmaceutical companies which therefore have a vital interest to keep cannabis illegal .
Those economic theories were criticized for not taking social aspect into account .
The illegalization was rather a result of racism directed to associate American immigrants of Mexican and African descent with cannabis abuse . ”
Wikipedia also provides details about various issues under discussion .
For example : “ No widely accepted study has ever demonstrated a cause - and - effect relationship between the use of cannabis and the later use of harder drugs like heroin and cocaine .
“ Cannabis is indigenous to Central and South Asia .
Evidence of the inhalation of cannabis smoke can be found as far back as the 3rd millennium B.C. , as indicated by charred cannabis seeds found in a ritual brazier at an ancient burial site in present day Romania .
“ Cannabis is also known to have been used by the ancient Hindus of India and Nepal thousands of years ago .
The herb was called ganjika in Sanskrit .
The ancient drug Soma , mentioned in the Vedas as a sacred intoxicating hallucinogen , was sometimes associated with cannabis … ”

If governments and the United Nations are seriously worried about public welfare / health they should work towards stopping illegitimate wars , hunger and famine that create mass suffering , killings and tragedies .
Thoughtless , shortsighted and greedy acts and deeds of governments create ripe climate for increased consumption of intoxicants , the more potent the better .
Ad Age ’s answer to a fascinating question ( Why do people favor crap beer PBR over other crap beers ? ) is no surprise : “ Back in 2004 , Pabst executed a highly effective word - of - mouth campaign that made the long - declining brand an ‘ ironic downscale chic ’ choice for bike messengers and other younger drinkers who viewed the beer as a statement of non-mainstream taste . ”
Hipsters boosted PBR sales by 17 percent that year , and sales are up a good 24 percent this year , more than other “ subpremium ” beers that have spent more advertising dollars trying to appeal to recession slummers .
But here ’s the joke : PBR raised its prices this year , and a case of the truckers ’ piss now costs as much as $ 1.50 more than brands like Keystone , Natty Light , and High Life .
Which means the folks who used to feel punk - rock chugging the cheap stuff now have to face the fact that they ’re paying to buy into the hype .
Not very cool .

Understand Ruby ’s Load Path
When you call load or require a new file , Ruby searches through the files in its load path .
This allows you to require files relative to the load path without specifying the files full system path .
The initial load path contains paths for Ruby ’s standard library .
There are three aliases that point to Rubys global load path array : $ : , $ - I , $ LOAD_PATH .
You can append or prepend you own libraries to this list .
The load path can also be modified from the command line with the - I flag .
Here is the initial load path on my Mac .
>> $ LOAD_PATH => [ " / Users/josh/.rip/active/lib " , " / Library / Ruby / Site / 1.8 " , " / Library / Ruby / Site/1.8/powerpc-darwin9.0 " , " / Library / Ruby / Site/1.8/universal -darwin9.0 " , " / Library / Ruby / Site " , " / System / Library / Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8 " , " / System / Library / Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/powerpc-darwin9.0 " , " / System / Library / Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/universal-darwin9.0 " , " . " ]
There are a few far - too - common mistakes people make with load paths .
Respect the global load path
When you package up your new rubygem to share with the world , you need to be careful with the files you place directly in lib / .
Rubygems ( and almost all other ruby package mangers ) will add your gem ’s lib/ to the load path .
This means any file placed in the top level of lib / will be directly requirable by anyone using the gem .
Bad gem example :
`-- lib |-- foo | `-- cgi.rb |-- foo.rb |-- erb.rb `-- set.rb
It may seem harmless to call files whatever you ’d like in your package because you are “ namespaced ” in your own package .
But if lib / is prepended to $ LOAD_PATH it will clobber Ruby ’s built in erb and set libs .
require ' erb ' would no longer require Ruby ’s builtin erb library , but this package ’s version of it .
The safe ( and correct ) way would be to namespace your files under another directory .
Its conventional to create a folder within lib with the same name as your gem .
Then we would put all our dependency files under lib / foo/ instead of at lib/ root .
This is sort of a gray area .
There is no strict rule that you must put all your files under a folder with your package name .
It is okay to have multiple files at your root lib directory as long as you intend for people to require them separately .
Namespace internal dependency files that you do n’t expect for people to require directly .
Requiring other files relative to each other
require File.join( File.dirname(__FILE__ ) , " foo " , " bar " ) # or require File.expand_path( File.join( File.dirname(__FILE__ ) , " foo " , " bar " ) )
If you ’re using File.dirname ( __FILE__ ) with require , you ’re doing something wrong .
The fix is simple , require files relative to the load path .
require " foo /bar "
Its interesting that the 3 previous require examples are totally different .
Ruby is only able to track which files it has required by the exact path you gave it .
The first is relative your current directory ( ” ./lib/foo/bar ” ) , the second is the full expanded system path ( ” /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/foo/lib/foo/bar ” ) , and the third is relative to the load path ( ” foo / bar ” ) .
require treats each as a different file , so it may end up loading the file multiple times .
Depending on files outside the load path
This is a more severe case of the previous example .
module Rack module Test VERSION = :: File.read (:: File.join (:: File.dirname(__FILE__ ) , " .. " , " .. " , " VERSION " ) ) . strip # ... end end
Your gem ’s folders may be separated and reorganized on install .
If someone wants to “ vendor ” your library , they should only have to copy everything under lib / .
Everything outside lib/ is not important for running the code .
Never expect your lib or test folders to be one level up .
A minimalist installer , such as rip , will only install your bin and lib directories .
Any file your package needs to access should be under lib and properly namespaced in a folder to avoid collisions .
If you try install this version of rack - test with rip , require ' rack / test ' will fail because ../ VERSION does n’t exist .
Libs do n’t need to mange $ LOAD_PATH
Its not the package ’s responsibility to setup and manage the load path .
Instead rely on the package manger to set it up for .
When rubygems activates a gem , it adds your package ’s lib folder to the $ LOAD_PATH ready to be required normally by another lib or application .
Its safe to assume you can relative require any file in your lib folder .
unless $ LOAD_PATH.include ?( File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__ ) ) ) $ LOAD_PATH.unshift(File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__ ) ) )
end
It should be safe to remove code like that .
TIP : Setup your test runner to configure your paths for local development
If your trying to develop your lib locally , dealing with all this load path stuff seems like a pain in the ass .
This is where rake tests come in handy .
Rake ’s test task will automatically push lib into your path when your test unit tests .
So you do n’t need File.join ( File.dirname( FILE ) , ” .. ” , “ lib ” , “ foo ” ) anywhere in your tests .
You may want to consider adding the test directory to your path if you have “ test_helper ” that you need to require .
Rake :: TestTask.new do |t| t.libs << ' test ' end
Unfortunately Rspec does n’t even add lib to your path for you .
You can fix this with :
Spec:: Rake:: SpecTask.new do |t| t.libs << ' lib ' end
If you want to run a single test , you can add lib to the $ LOAD_PATH with a command line flag .
( This started a long debate when the change was made to Rails )
ruby - Ilib test / test_foo.rb
Provide a VERSION constant
If you release the Awesome gem , provide Awesome : : VERSION .
When using Rubygems , it ’s possible to ask Rubygems for the version of the gem you ’re using , but when using an alternate package manager , the only way to find out what version is loaded is by introspection into the Ruby code itself .
Do n’t depend on rubygems
When I use your library , deploy your app , or run your tests I may not want to use rubygems .
When you “ require ‘ rubygems ’ ” in your code , you remove my ability to make that decision .
I cannot unrequire rubygems , but you can not require it in the first place .
– Ryan Tomayko
Its safe to remove require " rubygems " from your lib since code loading it probably did this already .
It makes it harder ( but not impossible ) for people to use alternative ways of setting up the load path because there is no way to “ unrequire ” rubygems .
There are many other package management solutions out there , like rip , bundler , or managing $ LOAD_PATH by hand .
Avoid declaring rubygem dependencies in lib / .
This means removing gem " foo " .
This creates a hard dependency on Rubygems when you should be specifying you gem dependencies in your gemspec .
Rubygems already hooks into require and will automatically resolve these dependencies at runtime .
A simple require will trigger the lookup via rubygems , or will just require it if it ’s been added to the load path by another system .
Moving dependency specification outside the lib is more flexible for other package managers can do so at install time .
In addition to removing gem , do not wrap your load checks with rescue Gem : : LoadError or rescue Gem : : Exception .
If you need to gracefully skip over load errors , Gem : : LoadError inherits from LoadError so replacing it with rescue LoadError will work .
# Bad begin gem " rack " require " rack " rescue Gem :: LoadError puts " Could not load ' rack ' " exit end # Good begin require " rack " rescue LoadError puts " Could not load ' rack ' " exit end
Why should I care ?
I was n’t aware of any of these issues until Ryan wrote up his post on why requiring rubygems is wrong at the beginning of 2009 .
And I feel many other rubyists have just overlooked these issues since rubygems has been our only solution .
The foundation of Ruby library management is built on the load path system and its important for every ruby gem author to understand how it works .
We ’re working on it
Fixing every ruby library is easier said than done ( There are 12,000 + hosted on RubyForge at the time of posting ) .
Rails is currently in violation of a few of these rules .
But we ’re working hard to fix them .
We also need to fix all the gems that we depend on .
Ideally , we ’d like Rails 3 to boot w/o rubygems and allow you use to whatever package management strategy you ’d like .

7 The Dog that Saved Napoleon
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Today " Waterloo " is synonymous with a massive , cataclysmic defeat .
It was the last clash of the Napoleonic Wars and a spectacular end to the career of a man who wanted to rule all of Europe .
And it would n't have happened if not for a random , unnamed dog .
A few years before all that , things started going downhill for Napoleon ( something to do with his deciding to invade Russia , with the mindset of a man going to hunt grizzly bears with a bouquet of freshly picked parsley ) .
After he was roughly cornholed in Russia , Bonaparte was exiled to the small island of Elba .
However , in 1815 , Napoleon , being Napoleon , had enough of that shit and slipped past the guards and set sail off the island .
But legend has it that during a particularly rough storm at sea , the fleeing Napoleon was thrown overboard .
The tale of one of the most important figures in history would have ended right there , had not an unnamed Newfoundland dog plunged into the water to save him .

It sounds like something from a Disney cartoon , but Newfoundlands are known for this ( it 's probably why one was on the boat in the first place ) .
And , where in a Disney movie this is when Napoleon and the ( talking ) dog would strike up a friendship that teaches them both about the value of accepting people different from themselves , in real life Napoleon returned to France and started killing people , setting off his famous Hundred Days , a military campaign to regain power .
The final stage of this campaign was the famous Battle of Waterloo where Napoleon 's career as a conqueror came to an end once and for all .

Nazi imagery is a big nein - nein in Germany , and the localized version of Wolfenstein was supposed to have removed all of it .
A small swastika slipped through , and Activision is said to be recalling the game from shelves there .

The news , sourced back to 4 players.de ( translation ) attributes a statement to Activision saying that " although it is not a conspicuous element in the normal game ... we have decided to take this game immediately from the German market . "
Whether that means the content is n't in the game but is on the PC version for modders to exploit , or if it 's a swastika as part of a background somewhere , who knows .
Planet Wolfenstein notes that the Wolfenstein teams from Endrant and Raven already have been laid off , putting a revised localization into doubt .
Update : Raven 's workforce reductions were across the board , not specifically targeting the Wolfenstein team .

Update : Via twitter , Kotaku reader Spunior pointed me back to one of the sites also linking to 4 player .de .
Schnitterbericht has a ton of screenshots showing differences in the U.S. and German versions of Wolfenstein .
The final one ( scroll alllllll the way down ) shows a faint swastika at the bottom of a poster .
If that really triggered a voluntary recall , Mein Gott in himmel !
We 've emailed Activision for comment .
Should any be provided , it 'll be updated here .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A total of 690,000 new vehicles were sold under the Cash for Clunkers program last summer , but only 125,000 of those were vehicles that would not have been sold anyway , according to an analysis released Wednesday by the automotive Web site Edmunds.com .
Still , auto sales contributed heavily to the economy 's expansion in the third quarter , adding 1.7 percentage points to the nation 's gross domestic product growth .
The Cash for Clunkers program gave car buyers rebates of up to $ 4,500 if they traded in less fuel - efficient vehicles for new vehicles that met certain fuel economy requirements .
A total of $ 3 billion was allotted for those rebates .
The average rebate was $ 4,000 .
But the overwhelming majority of sales would have taken place anyway at some time in the last half of 2009 , according to Edmunds.com .
That means the government ended up spending about $ 24,000 each for those 125,000 additional vehicle sales .
" It is unfortunate that Edmunds.com has had nothing but negative things to say about a wildly successful program that sold nearly 250,000 cars in its first four days alone , " said Bill Adams , spokesman for the Department of Transportation .
" There can be no doubt that CARS drummed up more business for car dealers at a time when they needed help the most . "
In order to determine whether these sales would have happened anyway , Edmunds.com analysts looked at sales of luxury cars and other vehicles not included under the Clunkers program .
Using traditional relationships between sales volumes of those vehicles and the types of vehicles sold under Cash for Clunkers , Edmunds.com projected what sales would normally have been during the Cash for Clunkers period and in the weeks after .
Edmunds.com 's estimate of the ultimate sales increase generally matches what industry experts had thought , said George Pipas , a sales analyst with Ford Motor Co ( F , Fortune 500 ) .
But that misses the point , he said .
" The whole purpose of the program was to provide some kind of catalyst to kick - start the economy , " he said , " and by all accounts the extra production that was added this year was a boost to the economy . "
Ford was one of the biggest proponents of the Cash for Clunkers program and several Ford models were among the top sellers under the program .
While auto sales in September were hurt because auto dealership inventories were drained of products by the program , sales this month are already back on track or better , Pipas said .
" I think the October sales results will show Clunkers is behind us and there 's no more payback or inventories issues . "
Emunds.com 's projection indicates that , without Cash for Clunkers , October 's sales increase would be even higher .

One night in Khartoum , Sudan , Osama bin Laden decides to take his family — four wives , 14 children — on a camping trip .
He drives into the desert , finds an isolated spot , then has his oldest sons dig ditches in the sand , long enough to fit each person .
It ’s the early 1990s , and bin Laden believes there ’s a war coming between Muslims and the Western infidels .
This is training .
“ You must be gallant .
Do not think about foxes or snakes , ” he says .
“ Challenging trials are coming to us . ”
Each child , including a few 1 - and 2 - year - olds , lies in a hollow .
There is no water or food .
As night falls , a child ’s voice whispers in the darkness , “ I ’m cold . ”
“ Cover yourself with dirt or grass , ” bin Laden snaps .
“ You will be warm under what nature provides . ”
Bin Laden ’s first wife , Najwa , does n’t like that idea , but , “ I reminded myself that my husband knew much more about the big world than any of us .
We were all pearls to my husband , and he wanted to protect us . ”
That ’s what it was like “ Growing Up bin Laden , ” the title of a forthcoming memoir ( St. Martin ’s Press ) co-written by Najwa , who remains married to the monster , though she now lives apart from him in an undisclosed Middle Eastern location , with her fourth son — of 11 children — Omar .
It ’s a world where women are never allowed outside the house , 12 - year - old daughters are married off to 30 - year - old al Qaeda fighters , pet dogs are used for target practice and the biggest household fight is over whether Islam allows refrigerators .
“ Jon & Kate Plus 8 ” it ai n’t .
It is not the life that Najwa , now 51 , would necessarily have chosen for herself , though she accepts it because “ my husband says it is so . ”
She neither defends nor lashes out at Osama .
Terrorism is what he does for a living ; all she needed to worry about was keeping his house in order .
Despite her neutrality , her story is still an indictment — showing us a terrorist leader who is embarrassed easily , obsessed with a long - dead father , terrified of women , and who thinks of his children as nothing more than cannon fodder .
Najwa grew up a rebel in the port city of Latakia in Syria .
She refused to hide her hair and wore colorful dresses that did n’t cover her face or arms .
She attended school , played tennis and was a fledgling artist who painted portraits and landscapes .
She met her first cousin Osama , the 9 - year - old son of her father ’s sister , when she was just 7 .
“ He was such a serious , conscientious boy , ” she writes .
“ He was proud , but not arrogant .
He was delicate , but not weak .
He was grave , but not severe . ”
He was also “ shyer than a virgin under the veil . ”
Osama was the son of Mohammed bin Laden , a construction kingpin and one of the wealthiest men in Saudi Arabia .
He had the habit of calling his sons for inspection , then whipping them with a cane if they did not line up exactly by height .
Though conservative in most other ways , Mohammed delighted in having his wives re move their veils , then asking his nervous servants to pick the most beautiful one .
Osama ’s mother , tired of these shenanigans , divorced him .
Osama had a one - on - one conversation with his father only once .
At age 9 , he decided he would like a car .
Escorted by his stepfather , he petitioned Mohammed .
“ I will not give you a car .
I will give you a bicycle , ” the father replied .
Osama went home crushed and gave the bike to a younger brother .
Then , as Osama recounted to his son Omar years later in the Tora Bora mountains of Afghanistan , “ one day several weeks later I received the biggest shock of my life .
A shiny new car was delivered .
For me !
That was the happiest day of my young life . ”
Soon after , Mohammed was killed in a plane crash , an event Omar believes left deep scars .
“ Although my father was never one to complain , it is believed that he keenly felt her lack of status , genuinely suffering from his father ’s lack of personal care and love . ”
Osama concentrated on reli gious schooling , becoming more conservative by the year .
His way of flirting was by saving the best grapes from Najwa ’s back yard for her .
Their wedding in 1974 — she was 15 , he was 17 — was a telling precursor to a joyless marriage .
Dancing , joking and laughing were forbidden at the nuptials .
They immediately departed for Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , where she was forced to wear the “ dreaded veil ” and full - length black robes .
Her schooling was discontinued , tennis lessons canceled , her artwork forgotten .
Najwa was almost perpetually pregnant , as Osama said it was important to make many warriors for Islam .
She lived a life in purdah , where females socialize only with members of their family .
In nearly 30 years of marriage , she left the confines of her home only to visit relatives and to move to a different house .
Air conditioning , televisions , phones were all banned .
Toys given as gifts to the children were destroyed .
Omar ’s asthma was treated with honeycombs and onions , since modern medicine was n’t allowed .
Everything the family ate had to be bought the same day , since refrigerators were out of the question .
Bin Laden took three more wives — one picked by Najwa , though she admits that “ few women dance with joy when they contemplate sharing their husband with other women . ”
In 1979 , the couple visited America .
Bin Laden went to see Abdullah Azzam , a teacher and mentor of bin Laden who preached about jihad in Los Angeles , while Najwa stayed in Indianapolis with a family friend .
She recalls how a man stared at her black Saudi robes , veil and head scarf as they waited for a return flight to Saudi Arabia at the airport .
“ With a jaw dropped open in surprise , and curious eyes growing as large as big bugs popping out of his skull , he actually stopped to gape at my veiled face , ” she says .
“ I wondered what my husband was thinking .
I took a side glance at Osama and saw that he was intently studying the curious man . ”
Najwa says Americans were kind and friendly , but the country was not to her conservative tastes .
“ My husband and I did not hate America , yet we did not love it , ” she writes .
Bin Laden became a hero in Saudi Arabia because he fought the Russians in Afghanistan .
But he began to clash with the royal family after they ignored his offers of military aid and instead let Americans liberate Kuwait in 1991 .
The final straw , Omar writes , was when his father saw female American troops on his soil .
“ Women ! Defending Saudi men ! ” he cried .
Under pressure from the king , Osama went into a self - imposed exile in the Sudan .
Najwa and Omar describe two Osamas here .
One happily tends his garden , delighting in sunflowers .
The other walks with a Kalashnikov and a cane , wielded if any of his sons showed their eye teeth while smiling .
One is so embarrassed when his boat goes out of control that he slips into the water so no one can see him .
The other rants into a Dictaphone , spouting epithets about America and Israel , pausing only to listen to his favorite station — the BBC — on a small radio .
One is a legend who has radicals visiting “ to breathe the same air . ”
The other is a wounded man , secretly blinded in his right eye by a flying chunk of metal in his youth , who trained himself to use his left hand rather than being seen as weak by a culture that rejected the disabled , Omar says .
Pets met horrible ends .
A monkey the children loved was run over by one of Osama ’s men .
Bin Laden had told him that “ the monkey was not a monkey at all , but was a Jewish person turned into a monkey by the hand of God . ”
A litter of puppies the boys adopted was gassed by al Qaeda fighters to see how long it would take them to die .
Finally , under pressure from the royal family and after assassination attempts , Sudan kicked Osama out .
In 1996 , he found shelter with the Taliban and set up camp in earthen huts in the mountains of Tora Bora .
Najwa ’s kitchen consisted only of a portable gas burner to make food for 10 kids .
The children slept on cotton mattresses on the concrete floor , and there was no furniture .
Bin Laden drafted his sons to be suicide bombers .
“ Listen , my sons , there is a paper on the wall of the mosque .
This paper is for men who are good Muslims , men who volunteer to be suicide bombers , ” Omar recalls him saying repeatedly .
One of Osama ’s youngest sons ran to the mosque to sign up ; his father did nothing to stop him .
When Omar responded with anger , bin Laden told him , “ You hold no more a place in my heart than any other man or boy in the entire country . ”
Omar once approached his father about his jihad obsession .
“ My father , when is this killing and war going to stop ? ” he asked his father .
Bin Laden responded , “ Would you ask a Muslim when he was going to stop praying to God ?
I will fight until my dying day !
I will fight until I breathe my last breath !
I will never stop my fight for justice !
I will never stop this jihad ! ”
As for why bin Laden focused on America , he said : “ Remember this : America and Israel are one bicycle with two wheels .
The wooden wheel represents the United States .
The steel wheel represents Israel .
Omar , Israel is the stronger power of the two .
Does a general attack the strongest line in battle ?
No , he concentrates on the weakest part of the line . ”
A 20 - year - old Omar eventually fled Afghanistan and begged his mother to do the same .
Najwa decided to leave ; her husband reluctantly conceded .
In the first week of September , Najwa handed Osama a ring as a token of her love .
“ No matter what you might be told , I will never divorce you , ” he said .
As she stepped foot in Syria a few days later with three of her children , the world changed .
She watched the television in horror as the Twin Towers fell , claiming the lives of 2,991 people .
Though she refuses to criticize — or even implicate — her husband , she says : “ I can only think and feel with my mother ’s heart .
For every child lost , a mother ’s heart harbors the deepest pain .
None can see our sons grow to men .
None can see our daughters become mothers . ”
Najwa says she has not spoken to Osama since the attacks and does not know where he is .
Omar , who has completely rejected his father and is petitioning to live in England , was at his uncle ’s house in Saudi Arabia when he learned of the attacks .
“ Come quickly ! ” his uncle said .
“ Come and see what my brother has done !
See what your father has done !
He has ruined our lives !
He has destroyed us ! ”

PEJ New Media Index September 28 - October 2
The September 27 arrest of director Roman Polanski in Switzerland — more than 30 years after he pled guilty to having sex with a minor and then fled the U.S. — energized the blogosphere last week .
An overwhelming majority of commentators wanted to see Polanski punished for his crime and harshly criticized his supporters in the entertainment industry .
For the week of September 28 - October 2 , more than a third ( 34 % ) of the links to news - related stories from blogs were focused on the Polanski saga , according to the New Media Index from the Pew Research Center ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism .
That was more than three times the attention that the second - largest story , health care , received from bloggers last week .
While other entertainment industry luminaries have garnered attention in blogs , often when they have passed away , the attention to Polanski was the most devoted to any such celebrity since the NMI was introduced in January .
Polanski even outpaced Michael Jackson ’s passing , which received 27 % of the links the week of June 22 - 26 .
Another element that stood out was how long the story lasted in the blogosphere .
Most weeks , storylines — especially those involving celebrities — have a one or two - day lifespan before another news event takes over .
In this case , however , the conversation lasted all week long , evolving over time from admonishment of Polanski to condemnation of Hollywood to sympathy for the victim .
The second largest story last week , at 11 % , was the ongoing debate over health care reform .
Most of the attention in the blogosphere focused on the fate of the so - called “ public option ” and specifically on votes by the Senate Finance Committee to reject amendments that would have included such a proposal .
Many bloggers linked to a Washington Post article that indicated the chances for a public option had dimmed .
Health care also ranked highly in the mainstream press news agenda last week , according to PEJ ’s News Coverage Index .
It was the top subject at 11 % of the newshole .
Polanski ’s arrest did generate some coverage in the traditional press .
It registered as the No. 8 story , filling 4 % of the newshole , but that was only a fraction of the attention it received among bloggers .
The next three stories in the blogosphere represented a diverse set of topics that did not receive much attention in the mainstream press .
Third , at 9 % , was a BBC report on a claim made by a former speech writer for President George W. Bush , Matt Latimer .
According to Latimer , the author of the wildly popular Harry Potter books , JK Rowling , was never awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom because some in the Bush administration believed her books promoted sorcery .
The fourth - largest subject , at 8 % , was another BBC report , this one about two British police officers who were told they were breaking the law by taking care of each other ’s children .
According to authorities , their actions violated the English Childcare
Act which demands that people who are providing regular “ childminding ” for other people ’s kids must register with the government .
And the No. 5 story ( at 5 % ) was a controversy stirred by the Empire State Building in New York , which shone red and yellow lights in honor of the 60th anniversary of China ’s communist revolution .
On Twitter last week , users continued to focus their news links on technology .
The most popular subject , with 16 % of the news - focused links on tweets , was that of Google Wave , a new product from Google that promised to “ revolutionize online communication . ”
The application , which began beta testing last week , includes elements of blogs , email , chat , photo - sharing sites , and other types of Wiki documents , and aims to replace other forms of online communication .
The second subject ( 12 % ) was made up of two articles that speculated that Apple will release a tablet computer in early 2010 .
And the third subject ( 11 % ) was a collection of stories about the social networking site Facebook .
Much of that attention was focused on a CNET.com report that a movie about the founders of Facebook will begin shooting next month .
Polanski’s Arrest
After the news of Polanski ’s arrest became public , a few commentators and some prominent names in Hollywood suggested he should not have been detained .
They argued that too much time had passed since his 1977 guilty plea of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor and that there were problems with how the courts originally handled the case .
These voices of sympathy for Polanski received little support online as bloggers quickly countered that he should have to serve time for his actions .
“ I just do n’t understand how people can defend him , ” posted Jackbenimble .
“ His wealth and celebrity allowed him to escape having to face the consequences of his actions .
Time has run out and now he needs to deal with the problem he ran from .
The victim of his actions ca n’t excuse him for his actions .
He did n’t steal a pack of gum or a couple of dollars .
He stole innocence and left a trail of destruction .
It was wrong and inexcusable . ”
“ Mr. Polanski has suffered great hardship in his life , ” added William the Coroner referring to difficulties in the director ’s upbringing , including being a Holocaust survivor .
“ Tragedy , however , does not give someone a free pass to be a criminal .
Neither does talent or celebrity .
I reserve my sympathy for his victim .
Mr. Polanski has evaded justice for decades , and it is time for it to end .
Justice delayed is justice denied . ”
By Wednesday , after a number of filmmakers , including Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese , signed a petition calling for Polanski ’s release , the online commentary continued with a different angle .
It shifted from denouncing Polanski ’s actions to chiding Hollywood in general .
“ Whatever the personal or professional reasons , Polanski ’s supporters have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are morally bankrupt , ” stated Steve at One Citizen Speaking .
“ The individual celebrities who have come out to support Polanski should now be viewed in a new light .
Now we know why they are liberal democrats – because they eschew family values and personal accountability , often while spinning even outlandish events to their own benefit . ”
“ Boycott anything coming out of Hollywood for , oh , the rest of my life , ” added Jay G at Stuck in Massachusetts .
And by Friday , many bloggers linked to a column by Steve Lopez in the Los Angeles Times that included segments of testimony from the original criminal trial and tried to shift the focus back to the “ true victim ” of the crime rather than on Polanski .
“ What Roman Polanski did to that 13 - year - old girl happens hundreds of times a day to other girls all over America , ” responded Starcat Jewel .
“ Many of them have no one to advocate for them …Someone who says that Polanski has ‘ suffered enough ’ is saying that it ’s perfectly okay for a 40 - year - old man to rape a 13 - year - old girl , over her repeated protests …
I do n’t care how long ago it happened .
He did it , he admitted it , and he has never paid a lick of atonement for it .
That changes now . ”
Health Care Vote on the Public Option
A September 30 article in the Washington Post entitled “ Prospects for Public Option Dim in Senate ” reported on two key votes in the Senate Finance Committee which went against including a public option in the bill .
The online discussion that followed debated the prospects for a public option , with passionate commentary from both sides .
“ The chances appear stronger that the public option is simply dead , ” wrote Pejman Yousefzadeh at the New Ledger .
“ There are plenty of other provisions in the emerging health care reform legislation that are objectionable , but one of the most objectionable pieces of the legislation seems to be in its death throes . ”
“ As dead as dead can be , serious health care reform that is , ” proclaimed Gorilla ’s Blog .
“ Unserious reform will pass this year , some fruit loopy co-ops or some phony trigger , or nothing at all if the progressives decide to stand tall …
One hopes our President will learn from this experience , because he ’s blown it big time . ”
Yet others on dueling sides of the issue cautioned that the committee votes were not necessarily the final word .
“ The public option is not dead yet , ” suggested Jake Today , a blog in support of health care reform .
“ There will be amendments to the Senate bill .
Then the bill will go to conference .
In both cases , it can be added .
If the final bill lacks a public option , then it will be past time for a new party to be formed . ”
“ The Washington Post claims that the Senate Finance Committee ’s rejection two amendments to create a government - run health insurance plan … dealt a ‘ crippling blow ’ to the hopes of liberals seeking to expand the federal role in health coverage as a cornerstone of reform , ” pointed out Karl at the conservative blog Hot Air before outlining several scenarios in which the public option could still survive .
“ The reality is a bit murkier than that , and likely connected to to overall fate of ObamaCare . ” *

The most viewed news video on YouTube last week was the same one that also dominated the previous week — a first - person account of an encounter during protests in Pittsburgh at the G20 Summit on September 24 .
The second video was a brief clip from the comedy program Saturday Night Live in which new cast member , Jenny Slate , accidentally swore during her first broadcast .
The show , famous for its live broadcasts , could not censor the incident during its original airing .
The third video was an interview by filmmaker Michael Moore on the September 24 edition of CNN ’s Situation Room .
Moore , whose previous interviews on cable shows have become popular YouTube clips , was promoting his new documentary “ Capitalism : A Love Story . ”
The interview grew tense when Wolf Blitzer asked Moore about charges that he is being hypocritical for having earned significant amounts of money in a system he is now criticizing .
Moore responded with a spirited , if somewhat sarcastic , defense of his work .

The New Media Index is a weekly report that captures the leading commentary of blogs and social media sites focused on news and compares those subjects to that of the mainstream press .
PEJ has launched the New Media Index as a companion to its weekly News Coverage Index .
Blogs and other new media are an important part of creating today ’s news information narrative and in shaping the way Americans interact with the news .
The expansion of online blogs and other social media sites has allowed news - consumers and others outside the mainstream press to have more of a role in agenda setting , dissemination and interpretation .
PEJ aims to find out what subjects in the national news the online sites focus on , and how that compared with the narrative in the traditional press .
A prominent Web tracking site Icerocket which , monitors millions of blogs , using the links to articles embedded on these sites as a proxy for determining what these subjects are .
Using this tracking process as a base , PEJ staff compiles the lists of links weekday each day .
They capture the top five linked - to stories on each list ( 50 stories in all each week ) , and reads , watches or listens to these posts and conducts a content analysis of their subject matter , just as it does for the mainstream press in its weekly News Coverage Index .
It follows the same coding methodology as that of the NCI .
This process allows us to compare the New Media commentary , based on the Icerocket list of links , with the commentary in the traditional press .
Note :
When the NMI was launched in January 2009 , another web - tracking site Technorati was similarly monitoring blogs and social media .
PEJ originally captured both Technorati ’s and Icerocket ’s daily aggregation .
In recent months , though , this component of Technorati ’s site has been down with no indication of when it might resume .
The priorities of the bloggers are measured in terms of percentage of links .
Each time a news blog or social media
Web page adds a link to its site directing its readers to a news story , it suggests that the author of the blog places at least some importance on the content of that article .
The user may or may not agree with the contents of the article , but they feel it is important enough to draw the reader ’s attention to it .
PEJ measures the topics that are of most interest to bloggers by compiling the quantitative information on links and analyzing the results .
For the examination of the links from Twitter , PEJ staff monitored the tracking site Tweetmeme .
Similar to Icerocket and Technorati , Tweetmeme measures the number of times a link to a particular story or blog post is tweeted and retweeted .
Then , as we do with Technorati and Icerocket , PEJ captured the five most popular linked - to pages each weekday under the heading of “ news ” as determined by Tweetmeme ’s method of categorization .
And as with the other data provided in the NMI , the top stories are determined in terms of percentage of links .
( One minor difference is that Tweetmeme offers the top links over the prior 24 hours while the lists used on Technorati and Icerocket offer the top links over the previous 48 hours . )
The Project also tracks the most popular news video on YouTube each week .
* For the sake of authenticity , PEJ has a policy of not correcting misspellings or grammatical errors that appear in direct quotes from blog postings .
Note : PEJ ’s weekly News Coverage Index includes Sunday newspapers while the New Media Index is Monday through Friday .
This is a book that I started at least a year ago ( may have been longer , I ’m not sure ) and only completely finished just now .
It ’s strange for a project of mine to take that long , but this one went through so many different changes as I learned more about book - making and pop up books .
There is a real ceiling when you ’re making things where your abilities and your ideas sort of clash ; for me , that ceiling of ability kept constantly changing ( I ’d learn something new and it would go soaring up or I ’d totally screw up another project and it would scare me enough to basically have it clamp down ) .
And I am really , really trying to find a way to combine this idea of the pop-up , which I absolutely love , with my work so that it ’s not just gimmicky or cute but instead refers to this interior space which is infinite .
Anyway .
At very long last , here is the book .
The cover :
Side view :
Here is a picture of my gimpy hand opening it ( not sure why I always show my hand in these pics but I do so why stop ? ) :
Inside the cover :
Then you turn the page and you reach this part you have to assemble :
So it ’s not a pure “ pop up ” in that you have to do some of the work , but it is incredibly easy to assemble .
The five - sided cobweb basically comes out at you and all you have to do is latch the side into a little perforated latch I created .
When you do , and interior part naturally falls down and it looks like this from above :
… and like this from head - on :
You fold it up to read the rest of the story , but from there on it ’s just symmetry in terms of the design part :
and the last spread :
I worked like crazy trying to get the hinges on the pages so that it could be opened and assembled over and over and over ( 100s of times ) with no worries about damaging it … and in the end , I think it has to sort of remain a fragile work of art .
Ok , I ’m excited !
I think this is a big step !!

Remember Jamie Leigh Jones , the Halliburton / KBR contractor who alleged she was gang raped by her co-workers in Iraq and then imprisoned in a shipping container after she reported the attack to the company ?
Well , it looks like she ’s finally get to sue the company , in a real courthouse , over her ordeal .
Her legal saga started after Halliburton failed to take any action against her alleged attackers , and the Justice Department and military also failed to prosecute .
Jones then tried to sue the company for failing to protect her .
But thanks to an employment contract created during the tenure of former Halliburton CEO Dick Cheney , Jones was forced into mandatory binding arbitration , a private forum where Halliburton would hire the arbitrator , all the proceedings would be secret , and she ’d have no right to appeal if she lost .
Data from the American Arbitration Association showed that Halliburton won more than 80 percent of its cases in arbitration , and when I looked at the data two years ago , it showed that out of 119 cases Halliburton arbitrated over a four - year period , only three resulted in the employee actually winning any money .
The deck was clearly stacked against Jones from day one .
After 15 months in arbitration , Jones and her lawyer realized the same thing and went to court to fight the arbitration agreement in the hopes of bringing her case before a jury .
Jones argued that the alleged gang rape was not related to her employment and thus , was n’t covered by the arbitration agreement .
Finally , two years later , a federal court has sensibly agreed with her .
Tuesday , the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals , in a 2 to 1 ruling , found her alleged injuries were not , in fact , in any way related to her employment and thus , not covered by the contract .
One of the judges who ruled in her favor , Rhesa Hawkins Barksdale , is a West Point grad , Vietnam vet , and one of the court ’s most conservative members , a sign , perhaps , of just how bad the facts are in this case .
It ’s a big victory , but a bitter one that shows just how insidious mandatory arbitration is .
It ’s taken Jones three years of litigation just to get to the point where she can finally sue the people who allegedly wronged her .
It will be many more years before she has a shot at any real justice .
In the meantime , her case may bolster pending legislation that would ban mandatory arbitration clauses in employment and other consumer contracts .
Jones ’ victory comes as yet another body blow to a practice that has come under serious fire in recent months as heavily rigged against consumers .
In July , the Minnesota attorney general sued one of the nation ’s biggest arbitration firms , the National Arbitration Forum , after discovering that it had financial ties to debt collection companies that used its services to collect credit card debts .
Not surprisingly , the NAF ruled in favor of the credit card companies in virtually every case , and fired arbitrators who sided with consumers .
The lawsuit led to NAF ’s agreement to stop arbitrating consumer debt collection cases .
Since then , Bank of America and other financial firms have said they will stop using arbitration clauses in their credit contracts .
All that has n’t stopped the U.S. Chamber of Commerce from continuing to insist that forced arbitration is still “ cheaper , faster , and fairer ” than the civil courts , and from fighting the federal legislation .
But with Jamie Leigh Jones as the poster child for the opposition , it ’s hard to see how the business group can continue with the pretense .
One of Cuba 's many neighbourhood health clinics , centrepieces of Cuba 's health system .
By Tim Anderson
Cuba has achieved the lowest rate of HIV infection and the highest level of AIDS treatment in the Caribbean region .
Yet the Cuban HIV program — part of its famous health system — has been subjected to many criticisms , usually linked to the themes of “ freedom ” and “ rights . ”
These criticisms must be seen in the broader context of demands for economic “ freedoms ” in Cuba and in the context of US demands for the dismantling of Cuban socialism and for widespread privatisation , including privatisation of the public health system .
Outside understandings of the Cuban health system are further undermined by the US economic blockade of Cuba , roundly condemned each year by the United Nations General Assembly , which prevents normal scientific and cultural exchange between the US and Cuba .
In view of the global search for lessons on best practices for containing the HIV / AIDS pandemic , particular criticisms of the Cuban HIV program deserve closer attention .
A rights - based analysis could be one useful way of examining the Cuban experience .
Such an approach might address some of the criticisms directed at Cuba , whether through a selective focus on particular rights issues or through general , utilitarian notions that Cuba has forced “ trade offs ” between personal liberties and the protection of public health .
This paper introduces the Cuban experience with HIV / AIDS by reference to historical developments and recent Cuban perspectives .
It draws on data from interviews with a number of Cuban peer educators and HIV professionals in 2005 – 2006 .
Following discussion of these interviews , the paper then uses the United Nations International Guidelines on HIV / AIDS and Human Rights to apply a rights - based analysis to several themes in the way Cuba approaches HIV / AIDS treatment : quarantine and personal freedom ; privacy in testing and tracing ; education , participation , and non-discrimination ; and the availability of AIDS treatment .
It concludes with a rights - based assessment of the Cuban program .

HIV / AIDS in Cuba : lessons and challenges
By Tim Anderson
Cuba , a relatively poor , socialist , developing country has the lowest rate of HIV infection in the Caribbean subregion and a rate among the lowest in the world .
Yet when we look at the published explanations for this , outside Cuba , we face a wall of controversy and disdain .
A fair amount of the criticism seems due to ideological wars and the economic blockade by the United States of America ( US ) imposed on Cuba .
The latter certainly undermines communication , scientific exchange and understanding .
Cuba ’s achievements in public health and its relative success in containing the HIV / AIDS pandemic deserve restating , but they are relatively uncontroversial .
This paper suggests that it is Cuban methods and the understandings of those methods that deserve greater attention .
Particular ideas persist , outside Cuba , about the Cuban HIV program : that its success has been due to policies of isolation , coercive testing and an anti-homosexual approach .
Very little of this forms part of the perspective of contemporary Cuban health professionals , who typically say that their program has both drawn from and contributed to global themes of health promotion , participatory education , sexual inclusiveness , contact tracing , and targeted and voluntary testing .
There is also a broader Cuban theme called “ intersectoral cooperation ” that stresses a coordinated social response to health challenges .
This paper takes a historical perspective on Cuba ’s achievements in HIV / AIDS control , seeking to identify key elements of its relative success .
The analysis covers international literature , Cuban medical reports , epidemiological data , and current health promotion materials and manuals , as well as interviews with Cuban health professionals and HIV - positive patients .

As we have noted over the past few months , “ less bad ” is not the same as “ good ” :
“ In an ominous sign for the economy , much of the profit is being eked out through cost cuts .
Executives say they are hesitant to reinvest such profits into their businesses .
With large portions of their factories , fleets and warehouses sitting idle , some say they probably wo n’t see reason to do so for a year or more .
That means job growth and any significant rise in business spending could be a long time coming .
That creates a chicken - and - egg problem at a time when the unemployment rate is already nearly 10 % : Without more jobs , U.S. consumers will have a hard time increasing their spending ; but without that spending , businesses might see little reason to start hiring .
Already , the economy is being starved of investment it needs to spark growth .
Net private investment , which includes spending on everything from machine tools to new houses , minus depreciation , fell to 0.1 % of gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2009 , according to the latest government data .
That ’s the lowest level since at least 1947 . ”
Unlike the last one , which finished off the dinosaurs some 65 million years ago , this one is not caused by a wandering asteroid or comet , super - volcano or other natural phenomenon .
It is caused by us .
Dr Tim Flannery .
As the sixth mass extinction progresses , the thylacine disappeared from the continent , about 3000 years ago , leaving only the Tasmanian tiger population still co-existing with the early Aborigines .
Since European colonization on Tasmania in 1803 , the ' tiger ' was exhaustively shot or trapped by sheep farmers paranoid of the marsupial predator .
Whole - scale extermination was encouraged by private and state bounties , and lucrative rewards from international museums and zoos .
Competition with feral dogs and diseases among the remaining , weakened populations , all contributed to its demise .
The last confirmed record of a wild tiger came from a farmer who killed the animal in 1930 .
Six years later , the thylacine was finally granted legal protection .
This came far too late .
In the same year - on September 7 , 1936 - the last surviving Tasmanian tiger on Earth died in Hobart ’s Beaumaris Zoo after 12 years of captivity .
The thylacine was gone merely 131 years after the first European encountered it . , in commemoration of this tragic loss .
More recently , in 1981 , the Southern Gastric Brooding Frog of South - East Queensland also became extinct .
In the second half of the 20th century , Queensland cleared more land than in the preceding 150 years .
The female of this species had for milleniums an ingenious way of ensuring the survival of its offspring .
It swallowed its tadpoles , stopped producing digestive acids temporarily and brooded the tadpoles inside its stomach .
In less than two months , little froglets emerged as the female regurgitated .
Despite such a reproductive marvel , and the apparent healthy stream habitats of the Conondale and Blackall Ranges north of Brisbane where the species once thrived , it has vanished .
Its close relative , the northern gastric brooding frog in Eungella National Park , followed suit soon after .
It took years before scientists concluded that chytrid fungus caused the demise of the gastric brooding frogs , decline of several other frog species in the Wet Tropics , and indeed havoc in many other amphibians worldwide .
The introduction of the fungus into Australia is likely a result of poor quarantine procedures associated with the exotic amphibian pet trade .
Another introduced disease of national significance is the Phytophthora root rot , caused by the soil fungus Phytophthora cinnamomi .
Imported unknowingly with citrus trees from Asia , the fungus has caused ' dieback ' of many native plants and affected natural ecosystems as well as agricultural crops .
Australians probably have more stories to tell than most other nations when it comes to introduced pests , many of which were initially considered ' super - heroes ' , ' magic fixers ' , or simply brought in as hunting targets , new food sources or familiar companions .
While the prolific rabbit , toxic cane toad and cunning fox have stolen the spotlight , countless other animals and plants have been introduced , deliberately or not , causing irreversible damage to our fragile environment and wildlife .
Predation by red foxes and feral cats , competition with native species and land degradation by feral rabbits , pigs and goats , are all listed as Key Threatening Processes under the federal government ’s EPBC Act .
Of the 28,000 plant species ( ornamentals , pasture grasses , horticultural species ) that arrived with early Europeans , 2800 have become problem weeds .
Each year , management of weeds and feral animals and agricultural losses accounts for more than $ 4.7 billion .
Interestingly , native species out of their natural ranges can also become pests .
Examples include the tropical cadaghi ( a eucalypt ) and the umbrella tree .
Both have become weeds in populated areas on the east coast .
The latter , with its abundant seeds , is out - competing native species , even in national parks and reserves .
Native fauna and flora need habitat .
Yet , in the second half of the 20th century , Queensland cleared more land than in the preceding 150 years .
Under the federal and state government ’s Brigalow Scheme , three million hectares of native bushland were cleared , using bulldozers and metal chains strung between powerful tractors .
Furthermore , a report commissioned by WWF - Australia outlined that Queensland ’s clearing rate between 1997 and 1999 was estimated at around 446,000 hectares per year , a rate equivalent to one hundred football fields every hour , according to Dr Nicola Markus of Bush Heritage Australia .
Despite stricter clearing regulations in recent years , land clearing has continued on a smaller yet devastating scale , especially in SE Queensland .
To many native wildlife , the combined impacts of loss of food , shelter and territory , habitat loss or fragmentation , the spread of weeds , fire , susceptibility to diseases and increased mortality to road traffic , dogs and cats , have become too much to cope with .
A case in point : " - Redland City Council .
According to the Australian Koala Foundation , some 25,000 koalas have died from disease , dog attacks , cars and , increasingly , starvation in the past decade in South - East Queensland .
Despite such grim findings and strong recommendations from the local council , numerous environmental groups and researchers , the koala ( in particular the SE Queensland population ) remains unlisted on the EPBC Act .
Without national level protection , the many isolated populations of this iconic Australian species , and ultimately the species itself , will be doomed .
Indeed , the 6th mass extinction has taken its toll on tens of thousands of species worldwide and is , with each passing year , growing in intensity .
In Australia , the EPBC Act lists 426 threatened fauna species : 55 Extinct , one Extinct in the wild , 36 Critically Endangered , 134 Endangered , 197 Vulnerable and 3 Conservation dependent .
Alarmingly , 1324 species of plants and 46 ecological communities are also considered threatened and warrant protection .
Marine species are not immune , either .
Dugong , whales , turtles , sharks , fishes , even corals are now Endangered or Critically Endangered - globally .
As populations decline , risks from isolation , inbreeding , diseases , habitat degradation , catastrophes , climate change and other impacts increase .
Species become increasingly trapped in an ' extinction vortex ' from which there is no escape .
Ironically , the listing of a species on the EPBC
Act does not necessarily mean that they are safe from harm ’s way .
A few examples still found in South - East Queensland include the Northern Quoll , Grey - headed Flying - fox , False Water Rat , Coxen ’s Fig Parrot , Regent Honeyeater , Black - breasted Button - quail , Wallum Sedge Frog , Mary River Turtle , Australian Lungfish , Humpback Whale , Grey Nurse Shark , Orange Roughy and four marine turtles .
The State government ’s proposed Traveston Crossing Dam on the Mary River alone , if approved , would further endanger some 20 already threatened species .
The proposal has been described as environmentally , hydrologically and socially irresponsible by a wide range of international , national and regional organisations , scientists and individuals .
The recent approval of the Gorgon Gas Project on Barrow Island off WA , despite being home to many threatened species , raises further questions about the agendas of governments , both national and state .
So is there hope ?
From the achievements of some 2009 Australian Museum Eureka prize winners , the answer has got to be ' yes ' .
Notably , Dr Conrad Hoskin came to fame with the discovery of seven new reptiles in tropical Queensland , and with his colleagues , rediscovery of a frog species that was thought to be extinct .
Dr Hoskin also discovered a new frog and shed light on how new species might evolve rapidly .
Evolve they must , with global warming threatening every corner of the globe .
Is it not our moral obligation to protect at least some of what is left of the natural ecosystems and their services for future generations ?
Functioning ecosystems , with the species and genetic diversity they nurture , will provide the essential ingredients and opportunities for adaptation to change .
Perhaps more heartwarming is the announcement of the Eureka People ’s Choice Award to Dr Katherine Belov .
She revealed how the lack of genetic diversity among the dwindling populations of the Tasmanian Devil has caused the current cancer ' plague ' , and is on the way to finding the gene needed to reverse the situation .
Perhaps Australians ’ hearts are still with our ' natural treasures ' – who would want to see the ' devil ' go the same way as the ' tiger ’ – appearing only as a symbol of loss or on beer bottles ?

Scientists around the world are known for being geniuses , but sometimes they can walk the fine line of insanity .
Why they conduct some of the bizarre experiments they do , one will never know , but the learning that comes from these experiments will never be forgotten .
1 .
The Masked Tickler
This experiment was the brain child of Professor Clarence Leuba .
He wanted to know of laughter was a learned response to being tickled or an inborn response .
He had two children and convinced his wife that she was not allowed to laugh during tickling to see what happened .
During the experiments on the newborns , he would wear a mask that had blank stares .
What he discovered was by month seven of the newborns lives they were over come with laughter when they were being tickled .
So , the conclusion to his experiments was that laughter is indeed an inborn trait when it comes to the realms of tickling .

Reversing Death
While conducting research at Berkley , Robert E. Cornish believed he had discovered a way to restore life into something that had been dead for ten minutes , just as long as there was no vital organ damage .
He began conducting his experiments on dogs at the college .
Once the college was alerted to it , he was banned .
He continued his work at home , where he failed the first two times , but succeeded the last two times .
He wanted to conduct it on an actual human and found a death row inmate who wanted to volunteer for it .
The state denied his request to perform this experiment .
So , whether this could have been one of the greatest discoveries known to man we will never know .

Slumber Learning
Professor Lawrence LeShan wanted to know if a person is able to learn while they are asleep .
He conducted an experiment on a group of constant nail biters .
Using a phonograph the phrase “ My nails taste terrible bitter , ” was repeated 300 times during the course of a night .
Seven weeks into the experiment the phonograph broke , so he began standing in the room and repeating the phrase .
After several weeks forty percent of the nail biters had stopped biting their nails .
He concluded that it is possible to learn while you are sleeping .

The Doctor Who Drank Vomit
Doctor Stubbins Ffirth had made the observation that yellow fever was only rapid during the summer months and lay dormant during the winter months .
So , he claimed that it was not a contagious disease and wanted to prove his point .
He began his experiments by making small incisions in his skin and pouring the vomit from yellow fever patients into them .
He remained healthy .
He made deeper incisions and continued to pour the freshly obtained vomit into them , still remaining healthy .
He poured it in his eyes , made a vomit sauna and only experienced some head pain , nausea , and perspiration , but was still healthy .
For his final experiments , he began ingesting the vomit .
He made pills from fresh specimens and even mixed some with water and drank it down .
He stayed healthy and concluded that it was not a contagious disease .
As a society we all know that yellow fever has to be directly transmitted into a blood stream by a mosquito in order from the person to be infected .

Elephants on Acid
Researchers Louis Jolyon West , Chester M. Pierce , and warren Thomas wanted to know what would happen to an elephant that was on acid .
They shot a cartridge - syringe of 297 milligrams , 3000 times more than any human would take , of the stuff into the hind quarters of an elephant and proceeded to record the event .
They claimed that the experiment was being conducted to find out whether the drug would induce aggressiveness that male elephants where they will secrete a sticky type of fluid from their temporal glands .
This elephant acted like he was shot by a gun and died .
He walked around his pen a few times wailing .
The researchers tried their best to revive him using anti-psychotic drugs , but to no avail .
When they went public and faced scrutiny they claimed that the elephant must have been sensitive to the drug .

There also exist partially paid dating sites .
Registration on these sites is mostly free , but some additional features need to be paid for .
This can be in the form of having an access to the VIP single ladies , raising profiles , or the option to add more pictures .
Often there are sites that are free for women , but men have to pay .
The fee may be charged for a membership and for each letter send or received from Russian lady .
It should be mentioned that the dating industry it is also a business , and like any business , it requires investment .
And if the site is completely free , respectively , it does not bring any income .
And as a conclusion – at the site , owners do not have the financial means for its development .
Therefore , free dating sites often reveal themselves to be of poor quality .
If you are looking for a serious relationship in the future for a marriage you should be active , t to take the initiative first .
If you like Russian lady – you can inform her about that , send a postcard or write a letter .
You should visit your page every day to be in the top of man list .
The more often you will be chatting on a dating site , the higher your status and profile .
How do you choose the best dating site for marriage ?
You choice can be based on the recommendations of your friends and acquaintances , which have found a wife with the help of a dating site or just may have an account there .
Another way to find such site is to use searching systems , read reviews of dating sites in the forums .
Summary on dating sites
Firstly , this is an excellent way to meet a lot of pretty wives staying at home ( or workplace ) .
Secondly , you have time to get to know the person , his interests and so on .
Even if you do not develop a beautiful relationship , you can be sure you will gain a lot of real friends and some experience .
Life has proved that love has no boundaries .
Let us use the opportunities that the Internet gives us .
The chunks of ice and dust that make their home in the Oort cloud , far beyond the orbit of Pluto , sometimes become dislodged and head into the solar system as streaky comets .
Some disruptions , caused by passing stars and other interactions with the Milky Way galaxy , are severe enough to send Oort comets into orbits that buzz or even collide with Earth .
New simulations have revealed a novel mechanism for their entry into our part of the solar system , a method that also suggests that comet showers may not have been strongly involved in major extinctions on Earth .
Comet dynamics depend heavily on Jupiter and Saturn : their huge gravitational fields tend to keep objects away from Earth .
Comets that manage to skirt Jupiter and Saturn , the conventional thinking goes , had to have originated in the outer reaches of the Oort cloud , where perturbations from outside the solar system can be felt most strongly and are writ large across vast cometary orbits that take hundreds of years to complete .
Only during comet showers caused by close stellar passages , the theory holds , have extreme gravitational disruptions brought inner
Oort cloud comets into the mix .
A computer simulation by Nathan Kaib and Thomas Quinn , both at the University of Washington , have upended this thinking .
They have found that the comets that manage to cross the Jupiter - Saturn barrier do in fact originate in large numbers in the inner Oort cloud , even in the absence of a large disruption causing a comet shower .
Specifically , they found that the relatively nearby objects of the inner Oort cloud can be kicked into the reaches of the outer cloud via interactions with the massive planets .
Those newly far - flung comets , suddenly enjoying a longer orbit and greater gravitational perturbations from interstellar space , can find their orbits so changed that , by the time they pass through the planetary region again , they slip past the gas giants .
“ They can basically hop over the Jupiter - Saturn barrier , ” Kaib says .
Kaib and Quinn estimate that more than half of the comets we observe streaking in from the Oort cloud reach our neighborhood via this route , and other researchers agree the simulation appears valid .
“ This mechanism , this dynamical path , as we call it , could work and could be a significant contributor , ” says Paul Weissman , a senior research scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
The new research presents a route for comet production “ that goes some way ” toward resolving discrepancies between the standard model and the observations , says Scott Tremaine , an astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Prince­ton , N.J. “ One of the issues is that [ the conventional view of ] the cometary formation process is so inefficient ; in order to produce the number of comets that we see , you ’d need a really massive protoplanetary disk , one that appears to be incompatible with our best estimates from other sources , ” Tremaine says .
Kaib and Quinn used their newfound mechanism , as well as the number of observed comets , to estimate an upper limit on how much material could be in the inner Oort cloud .
They then produced a statistical model of how many comets would have hit Earth in comet showers in the past several hundred million years .
Their conclusion : large cometary showers were few and hence probably did not cause more than one extinction event .
Using cometary dynamics to unwind the extinction history on Earth will likely meet with some controversy .
Weissman notes that the extinction implications of Kaib and Quinn ’s analysis would involve comet showers , not comets in general , and that even a diminished profile of showers does not rule out the role of comets in extinctions .
One big strike , rather than a shower of small ones , is all that ’s needed to trigger extinctions , he points out .

A massive rescue and relief operation is under way in southern India after severe flooding left about 250 people dead and millions without homes .
More than 350 villages are still marooned after five days of heavy rain in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka states .
Rainfall has eased in the worst affected state of Karnataka but many farms have been destroyed .
The rains have come late .
Only last week the government said India had been hit by the worst drought in 40 years .
Indian air force aircraft are being used to drop relief materials to the hundreds of thousands of villagers stranded by rising flood waters .
Soldiers have been trying to reach those affected in boats .
' No shelter '
Officials say billions of dollars are needed for relief and reconstruction .

Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddyurappa said 10 million people had become homeless and nearly two million houses had been destroyed across 14 districts in the state .
Thousands of livestock , which many farmers depend on to make a living , have also perished in the torrential rains that lashed the state for nearly a week .
More than 300,000 people have taken refuge in about 1,000 relief camps set up by the government .
" It is a serious situation , " Mr Yeddyurappa told reporters .
The death toll rose to 194 in Karnataka alone , state officials said on Monday .
The BBC's Habib Beary in the state capital , Bangalore , says that thousands are living without shelter or electricity .
In Andhra Pradesh , about 50 people have lost their lives in the flooding and more than a quarter - of - a- million people are in relief shelters .
Vast tracts of agricultural land are under water and crops have been destroyed .
Cyclone
The floods worsened after the authorities were forced to release water from dams and reservoirs to prevent them from bursting their banks , correspondents say .
India 's home minister P Chidambaram visited flood - affected areas of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh to assess the situation on Monday .
Irate villagers in Karnataka have protested against late relief and targeted vehicles carrying politicians .
Health officials said measures were being taken to prevent the outbreak of water - borne diseases in the affected areas .
The rains have been blamed by weather experts on a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal .

Google has pulled its Google Groups development team out of the basement broom closet and begun patching up its long - broken Usenet library , in response to our story Wednesday highlighting the company ’s neglect of the 700 million post archive .
“ Searching within a newsgroup , even one with thousands of posts , produces no results at all .
Confining a search to a range of dates also fails silently , bulldozing the most obvious path to exploring an archive .
“ Want to find Marc Andreessen ’s historic March 14 , 1993 , announcement in alt .
hypertext of the Mosaic web browser ?
‘ Your search — mosaic — did not match any documents . ' ”
From Google ’s Abandoned Library of 700 Million Titles
“ It turns out there was a bug , a specific bug , that affected search within a specific group , ” Google spokeswoman Victoria Katsarou told wired.com late Wednesday .
“ That bug is something we ’re working on fixing , and I think that will be fixed by tomorrow .
Thanks for writing this , because that ’s how we discovered this specific bug . ”
Epicenter decided to wait to see results before reporting on Google ’s change of heart .
Come Thursday morning , we find that Google has , indeed , corrected one of the most serious usability problems with its Usenet search .
Searching within a specific newsgroup now works fine .
Within alt .
hypertext , for example , Google now finds “ 844 results for mosaic ” instead of zero .
Google was widely hailed as heroic in late 2001 when it rescued two decades of orphaned Usenet posts and put them in Google Groups .
But in the years since , meaningful access to the archive became all but impossible as search and indexing bugs proliferated on the site , a situation that was only passingly acknowledged by Google until Wednesday night .
Searching or browsing a range of dates is still broken , but the company says it has begun working in earnest on making Google Groups usable again .
“ We ’re aware of the larger issues with Groups search , and we ’ll continue to work on improving the product , ” said spokesman Jason Freidenfelds , in a follow - up e-mail .
The neglected archive has been the subject of widespread online discussion for over a year , including in a Slashdot thread in November 2008 .
Additionally , we detailed the now - repaired bug , with instructions on how to reproduce it , in an e-mail exchange with the company one month ago .
Last night , though , Google did good .

The UN has told Japan it must ban adult games and erotic manga featuring themes of rape , calling Japan ’s protection of fictional women from fictional rape “ inadequate . ”
The demands come by way of the UN ’s radical feminist arm , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women , or CEDAW .
Extreme feminist pressure group Equality
Now previously vowed to make them seek such a ban , and it seems CEDAW happily complied .
Calling Japan ’s treatment of women “ inadequate ” and “ regrettable , ” CEDAW formally demanded Japan end “ human rights violations ” against women by banning games and manga featuring themes of “ rape and sexual violence . ”
It is not clear whether they extend their demands to anime , AV or literature , though this seems likely .
The suggestion that fictional works such as manga serve to promote sexual violence is entirely unproven ; it is notable that Japan has some of the lowest rates of crime and sexual violence in the world , and yet some of the most abundant pornography , much of which deals with such themes .
This is of course undoubtedly tied to the intervention of busybody international feminist groups in Japanese politics after the Rapelay scandal …

The extreme stress of torture harms the memory Torture techniques used on suspected terrorists by the Bush administration may have failed to get to the truth , researchers say .
Professor Shane O'Mara of Trinity College , Dublin , said the interrogation techniques had a detrimental effect on brain functions related to memory .
He listed 10 methods of what he called torture used by the US , including stress positions and waterboarding .
His review is published in the journal , Trends in Cognitive Science .
' Lack of control ' Professor O'Mara said US Department of Justice memos released in April showed that the Americans believed that prolonged periods of shock , anxiety , disorientation and lack of control were more effective than standard interrogation in extracting the truth .
He said : " This is based on the assumption that subjects will be motivated to reveal truthful information to end interrogation , and that extreme stress , shock and anxiety do not impact on memory .
Techniques used by US Walling - captive is placed with heels touching the wall and is pulled away and pushed back into it with force Wall standing - captive stands four to five feet from wall with fingertips supporting all the body weight to induce muscle fatigue Cramped confinement - captive place in small box in darkness for up to two hours , in a larger box for up to 18 hours Sleep deprivation - captive is deprived of sleep for up to 11 days Stress positions - captive sits on floor with legs straight out in front and arms raised above head or is made to kneel on the floor while leaning back at a 45 degree angle Waterboarding - captive is bound head down on an inclined bench with a cloth over the eyes .
Water is applied to the cloth for 20 to 40 seconds at a time inducing fast breathing and perception of drowning " However this model of the impact of extreme stress on memory and the brain is utterly unsupported by scientific evidence . "
He said studies of extreme stress with special forces soldiers had found that their recall of previously learned information was impaired afterwards .
" Waterboarding in particular is an extreme stressor and has the potential to elicit widespread stress - induced changes in the brain . "
Professor O'Mara said contemporary neuroscientific models of human memory showed that the hippocampus and prefrontal cortices of the brain were very important .
The stress hormone , cortisol , binds to receptors in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex increasing neuronal excitability which compromises the normal functioning of the brain if it is sustained .
And other stress hormones called catecholamines could lead to an increase in blood pressure and heart rate which could cause long - term damage to the brain and body if they were maintained at a high level for a long time .
Conditioning Professor O'Mara said a common argument in favour of torture was that it would reliably elicit truthful information from the captive 's long - term memory .
But psychological studies had suggested that during extreme stress and anxiety , the captive would be conditioned to associate speaking with periods of safety .
And because torture was stressful for the torturers the fact that the captive was speaking also provided a safety signal to the captor .
" Making the captive talk may become the end - not the truth of what the captive is revealing .
" These techniques cause severe , repeated and prolonged stress , which compromises brain tissue supporting memory and executive function .
" The fact that the detrimental effects of these techniques on the brain are not visible to the naked eye makes them no less real . "
Memory disruption Dr David Harper , a clinical psychologist from the University of East London , said the study appeared to be consistent with previous research on memory and trauma and with evidence of previous torture survivors and those in the intelligence community critical of psychological torture techniques .
" Believers in coercive interrogation tend to believe that people will ' tell the truth ' as a result but much evidence suggests that people will , in fact , tell those conducting the torture what they think will make the torture stop .
" This has been noted as a danger by commentators from the Spanish Inquisition , through the Moscow Show Trials of the 1930s to the present day . "
Dr Stuart Turner of the Centre for the Study of Emotion and Law said : " There is now very strong evidence that torture and harsh interrogation techniques may disrupt normal memory processes .
" With this in mind , it is also unreasonable to expect torture survivors to be able to give consistent and complete accounts of their experiences .
" This is highly relevant , for example , to the process of decision making for asylum seekers , arriving in the UK seeking refuge and for whom credibility is often a central issue .
" It appears that O'Mara 's review paper supports the contention that to expect consistent memories in asylum applicants is unreasonable and therefore that inconsistencies should certainly not automatically be interpreted as evidence of fabrication . "

Getting the most out of treasure
By Trevor Timpson
BBC News
A conservator at the British Museum cleans a coin with a porcupine quill Porcupine quills and cactus spines are among the tools used to prepare a £ 1 m hoard of Viking treasure to go on public show in York on 17 September .
We will never know if the Vikings who buried a princely hoard of silver in a gilded cup near Harrogate in the 10th century expected to see it again .
They surely did not anticipate that the treasure would emerge from the earth after 1,100 years , to be set upon by highly - skilled conservators wielding items such as quills and ultrasound vibrators .
But that is what has happened .
After a " quick turn - round " in the conservation department of the British Museum ( BM ) the hoard - or some of it ; only some 100 of 617 coins have yet been cleaned - is ready to go on show at the Yorkshire Museum .
The " muddy ball " ( inset ) turned out to be highly ornate and inlaid with niello Much more work remains to be done , say the conservators - but already they are enthusiastic about the quality of the find .
" We had a very tight turn - round time and very few people to deliver it .
We were trying to get this to look as good as possible in the least time possible ...
We only had two or three weeks , " says Fleur Shearman , a metals conservator at the BM .
But , she adds : " apart from soil encrustations and the corrosion related to the lead and a little bit related to the copper in the cup , it 's in superb , really outstanding condition . "
The lead casing and the encrustation have kept the silver pristine - it has emerged shining when the coatings were removed .
" Under the surface you can see all sorts of finishing and manufacturing marks - even little nicks the Vikings had made to test the quality of the silver , " says Miss Shearman .
THE VALE OF YORK HOARD Metal detection enthusiast David Whelan and his son Andrew discovered the hoard in a field in 2007 .
David later told the Northern Echo : " We got some lead out , and this round ball covered in mud . "
The muddy ball was a ninth - century silver - gilt vessel made on the Continent in the Empire of Charlemagne .
Packed in and around it were 617 coins and 67 other objects .
Some of the silver came from the Middle East and Afghanistan .
The treasure has been bought jointly by the York Museums Trust and the British Museum .
More than half the money came from the National Heritage Memorial Fund .
The independent Art Fund charity granted £ 250,000 ; £ 200,000 was raised by public subscription .
David and Andrew Whelan share half the treasure 's value ; the rest goes to the ( unnamed ) landowner .
The ' wonderful , wonderful ' hoard In Pictures : Vale of York Hoard
The hoard came to the BM first , soon after its discovery , for preliminary examination so it could be valued .
Then , when the money had been raised , it came back for more thorough cleaning in August .
All pieces have to be treated with extreme care , the conservators stress - so as to avoid any damage to the items , and to preserve historical evidence .
So keen are they to preserve the history of the cup , for instance , that they will not clean away the marks left by the coins on its inside .
Some of the more robust pieces can be treated by immersion in water or in mild chemical reagents , or by ultrasound vibration which loosens the coating which the centuries have left on them .
But others - such as the delicate decoration on the cup , and some of the coins which are extremely thin - must be treated with even more care .
In these cases " if you 're using chemicals everything 's applied on a very small scale , and any residues are washed off afterwards , " says Miss Shearman .
Binocular microscope
" So if you have to put a chemical on - which we 've had to do in some cases - you would use something like a cocktail stick and a little swab of cotton wool and just moisten it with the chemical , allow it to do its work and then wash off the residues . "
A lot of the work consists of holding the pieces under a binocular microscope and working the coating loose with ultra-sensitive hand tools .
This is where the porcupine quills come in .
Cactus spines are also sometimes used .
The hoard contains jewellery , coins , ingots and silver cut into pieces
As she and her colleagues worked on the silver - gilt cup , Miss Shearman says , more and more of its secrets were revealed : " It just looked grey , featureless - in fact it 's highly decorated " .
Beautifully engraved with animals and foliage , it also turned out to be inlaid with niello - a black metallic compound .
" Although many aspects of the job are very repetitive and routine it also does have this extraordinary special quality of discovery about it , " she points out .
" Discovering the truth about something is the most important thing , not producing something that looks beautiful ; so if you can get something that looks beautiful as well then you 've really won ; you 've won on all counts . "

From such a perch , astronauts could use …
Since the huge move in equities off of March lows , especially as of late , portfolio managers have been bidding up stocks by buying on the dips in an effort to make up for dismal 2008s and remain competitive , which is tough when benchmark averages are up 40 - 60 % .
Reminiscent of liquidity - fueled bubbles past , especially the dot - com bubble , common equity in effectively insolvent companies is showing record volume , as daytrading this greater - fool game is the only functioning strategy .
But chasing beta can only work for so long , as a market whose participants are exclusively chasing each others ' momentum trades is doomed for a drastic change in its landscape .
The key of course is to find the greater fool before it becomes you , and the inevitable reversal of this rally is going to be twice as sharp as the way up .
The S&P 500 is down about 5.1 % since its recent top at 1080 on September 23 .
Many are questioning whether this is a pullback that will eventually resolve into a continuation of the rally or the beginning of a reversal ( the reversal ) that will send stocks declining .
I am in the reversal camp and think that this is the beginning of a sharp , drastic sell - off in stocks .
In attempting to identify this mini-selloff as a pullback or reversal , it is important to trace the catalysts of the rally itself and analyze their sustainability , at these levels specifically .
By far the most significant factor regarding the rally is the newly - injected liquidity driving it .
As monetary supply increases , as do asset prices , through currency debasement .
This can become a self - fulfilling positive feedback loop via the carry trade , as the USD depreciates further , financing demand for higher - yielding assets ( such as equities ) .
Also important to the rally are the bank earnings and economic data " supporting " an economic recovery , as they are being used as post - hoc fundamental basis to the move in equities .
The " monetization liquidity " fueling the rally comes from the $ 300B in long - dates Treasuries announced back in March as part of the Fed 's QE .
The POMOs executing the injection have been covered extensively , and the end result is primary dealers end up sitting on the cash .
Only about $ 7B ( about 2.3 % ) of the original $ 300B remain to be injected .
Without this liquidity ( which correlates very well with the S&P 's performance since spring ) , the rally loses its legs and momentum switches to the downside .
Though liquidity is the primary catalyst to the rally , the move has been magnified by the USD carry trade and by portfolio underperformance against benchmarks .
The carry trade , which magnifies the move down in the dollar and the move up in equities , relies on a USD supply increase ( liquidity injections ) offsetting a demand increase ( deleveraging / debt liquidation ) .
Because the liquidity is drying up , deleveraging should regain control of the USD 's price movement and an unwinding of the carry trade should result , leading to a spike up in the dollar and a sharp drop in stocks and commodities .
The underperformance of portfolios against benchmark indices showing 50 - 70 % rallies in half a year has led to a crowded momo beta - chasing trade as PMs attempt to offset 2008 losses in a blatant greater - fool game ( AIG and CIT volume explosions prove that much ) .
An exponential stream of freshly minted dollars is required for the momentum to continue and for the momo trade to work , and as liquidity dries up , the momentum on the way up will reverse to the downside -- and may accelerate .
And then there 's the " fundamental " basis to this rally .
Bank earnings have been a bunch of accounting shenanigans , boosted with AIG CDS unwinds , trading / i- banking profits due to an engineered market rally in which every company is issuing boatloads of secondaries that all need underwriting and lack of trading competition ( Lehman , Bear , Merrill RIP ) , and a steep yield curve in Q1 - Q2 2009 .
" Extend and pretend " accounting only works temporarily , and as option ARMs reset and borrowers default , assets marked at par tank down very , very quickly , eating away bank equity and ruining 10 - Qs .
Banks went on a spree in their Q1 and Q2 earnings reports with accounting tricks and those will come to bite them twice as hard in Q3 and Q4 .
The trading and i-banking profits are dependent on a continuing rally ( positive feedback loop ) as well as lack of competition ( which is now 100 % priced in ) .
The yield curve is flattening , as long bond yields topped out in June , and this should hurt bank earnings as well in Q3 and Q4 earnings reports .
As for economic indicators , look no further than this to tell you why there 's no recovery .
So liquidity is drying up and that effectively screws up all of the engines to the rally , leading to a sharp sell - off .
But what 's to say the Fed wo n't pump more liquidity into the market ?
Well , for one , it decided against expanding its QE , so the liquidity injections have stopped , at least for now .
Moreover , the USD is back to last summer 's levels , and further decline could break important support and send it spiraling into substantial debasement .
Most importantly , if injected liquidity continues expanding , bond yields ( which are currently forecasting deflation in the short run , at odds with equities ) will skyrocket , leading to very unsustainable interest burdens and a debt crisis .
The controlled demolition of the USD requires liquidity financing inflationary rallies , sharp corrections via deleveraging , and then continued bleeding of the USD to prop up other assets .
Let the USD hit free - fall , you have a monetary crisis .
Let monetary supply remain stable and the USD to rally on demand via debt liquidation and you have deflation ( arch nemesis to Ben Bernanke ) .
The plan is to debase the dollar slowly , with an episode of deleveraging as the political capital for bailouts / QE / USD depreciation dries up , until bank deleveraging has hit a pivot point , excess reserves can be unsequestered for use besides mopping up asset depreciation , and holders of Treasuries / USD ( who see unique systemic and crowded demand each deleveraging episode through the " safe haven " thesis ) are reduced to bagholders .
Thus , the USD is ready for its next wave up , and this means a big reversal in equities .
As my readers know , I do n't offer any timing without the use of charts and technicals .
The chart below quite comprehensively summarizes all that needs to be said about equities :
Credit markets were terrific forecasters for the impending trouble back in 2007 and again are showing signs of big trouble ahead .
Just look at some of the distribution in these bond ETFs .
These are reversal candles , not pullbacks on low volume :
LQD is my favorite development of all -- IG corp bond ETF breaking obvious rising channel since March on huge distributive volume ?
Taaaaank tiiiiiime .
The New Science of Causation
It seems like each new day brings another one of those headlines : regular sleep “ linked to ” life expectancy , playing video games “ associated with ” surgical prowess , bullies “ at risk ” of becoming criminals , and “ does breastfeeding reduce a baby ’s blood pressure ? ” ( the old rhetorical question gambit ) .
Sometimes the articles are clear : the research has only found a correlation between two variables — breastfeeding and low blood pressure were found together .
But more often , they imply that causation is at work — that breastfeeding causes lower blood pressure .
You ’ve surely heard that old statistics adage : correlation does not imply causation .
Just because breastfeeding and low blood pressure are found together does n’t mean the first caused the second .
Perhaps the second caused the first ( moms might prefer to keep breastfeeding calmer babies ) or some other thing caused both of them ( maybe moms who do n’t work both tend to breastfeed and stress their kids less ) .
You ca n’t tell from correlation alone .
Indeed , the philosopher David Hume argued that we could never know whether causation was at work .
“ Solidity , extension , motion ; these qualities are all complete in themselves , and never point out any other event which may result from them , ” he wrote .
But not causation : “ One event follows another ; but we never can observe any tie between them .
They seem conjoined , but never connected . ”
And , as philosophers since Plato and Sextus Empiricus have argued , such evidence can deceive us .
Imagine finding a button and , each time you press it , a beep is heard .
Normally , we ’d assume that the button always causes the beep .
But we ’d be wrong — one day the power goes out and the button does nothing .
Which is why , centuries later , Karl Pearson , the founder of mathematical statistics , banned the notion of causality from the discipline , calling it “ a fetish amidst the inscrutable arcana of modern science ” and insisting that just by understanding simple correlation one “ grasped the essence of the conception of association between cause and effect . ”
His followers have kept it banished ever since .
“ Considerations of causality should be treated as they have always been in statistics : preferably not at all , ” wrote a former president of the Biometric Society .
“ It would be very healthy if more researchers abandon thinking of and using terms such as cause and effect , ” insisted another prominent social scientist .
And there the matter has stayed .
Causality is a concept as meaningless as “ the soul ” and just as inappropriate for modern mathematical science .
And yet , somehow , this does n’t seem quite right .
If causation is nothing but a meaningless word that laypeople have layered over correlation , then why the ceaseless insistence that “ correlation does not imply causation ” ?
Why are our thoughts filled with causal comments ( he made me do it ! ) and never correlational ones ?
The result is exceptionally strange .
Statistics has no mathematical way to express the notion “ mud does not cause rain ” .
It can say mud is correlated with rain ( i.e. that there ’s a high probability of seeing mud if you see rain ) , no problem , but expressing the simple causal concept — the kind of thing any five - year - old would know — is impossible .
Statisticians may have never had to confront this problem but , luckily for us , Artificial Intelligence researchers have .
It turns out if you ’re making a robot , having a notion of causality is essential — not just because it ’s the only way to understand the humans , but because it ’s the only way to get anything done !
How are you supposed to turn the lights on if you do n’t know that it ’s the light - switch and not the clicking noise that causes it ?
The result is that in recent years several teams of AI researchers have turned their focus from building robots to building mathematical tools for dealing with causality .
At the forefront is Judea Pearl ( author of the book Causality , Cambridge University Press ) and his group at UCLA and Clark Glymour ( author of The Mind ’s Arrows , MIT Press ) , Peter Spirtes , and their colleagues at Carnegie Mellon .
The result is a quiet revolution in the field of statistics — one most practicing statisticians are still unaware of .
They started by dismissing Plato ’s skepticism about the problem .
Granted , they say , we may never know for sure whether the button always causes the beep , but that ’s too stringent a demand .
Science never knows anything for sure — the best we can hope for is extracting the most knowledge from the evidence we have .
Or , as William James put it , “ To know is one thing , and to know for certain that we know is another . ”
Next , they created a new mathematical function to formalize our notion of causality : do (… ) .
do expresses the notion of intervening and actually trying something .
Thus , to mathematically express the notion that mud does not cause rain , we can say P( rain | do( mud=true ) ) = P( rain ) — in other words , the chance of rain given that you made it muddy is the same as the chance of rain in general .
But causes rarely comes in pairs like these — more often it comes in complicated chains : clouds cause rain which causes both mud and wet clothing and the latter causes people to find a change of clothes .
And so the researchers express these as networks , usually called causal Bayes nets or graphical causal models , which show each thing ( clouds , rain , mud ) as a node and the causal relationships as arrows between them :
( clouds ) | | v ( rain ) /\ / \ / \ v v ( mud ) ( wet ) | | v ( change )
And all this was just the warm - up act .
Their real breakthrough was this : just as kids can discover causes by observation , computers can discern causes from data .
Now obviously the easiest way to do this is just to measure what happens when you do ( X=x ) directly — this , for example , is what randomized controlled trials do .
Kids do it by dropping a fork on the floor and seeing if this causes
Mom to pick it up ; scientists do it by randomly giving some people a real drug and others just a placebo .
The result is that we can be sure of the cause — after all , it was we who dropped the fork and gave out the drug ; nothing else could be sneaking in and causing it .
But in most cases we do n’t have this luxury .
We ’d like to know whether a new tax policy will cause the economy to tank before we enact it ; we ’d like to know whether smoking causes cancer without forcing kids to smoke ; and even in randomized controlled trials , we can give half the patients the real drug , but we ca n’t make them take it .
If the drug being tested makes someone so horribly sick that they stop taking it and then get better , drug trials still count that as a victory for the drug !
Obviously we can’t always know such things just from observing , but in a surprising number of cases we can .
And the researchers have developed a mathematical method — called the do - calculus — for determining just when you can .
Feed it a Bayes network of variables , their relationships , and their values , and it will return back what it knows and with what certainty .
Thus , in an example Pearl frequently uses , tobacco companies used to argue that the correlation between smoking and cancer was simply because there were certain genes that made people both more likely to smoke and more likely to get cancer .
It did n’t matter if they quit smoking — their genes would lead cancer to get them anyway .
Pearl shows that if we assume only smoking causes tar deposits on the lungs and the tar deposits are the only way smoking causes cancer , we can simply measure the tar deposits and calculate whether the tobacco companies are right .
Or , in another example in his book Causality , he analyzes data from a study on a cholesterol - reducing drug .
Since whether people got the placebo or not is unassociated with any other variables ( because it was randomly assigned ) if we merely assume that receiving the real drug has some influence on whether people take it , we can calculate the effectiveness of the drug even with imperfect compliance .
Indeed , we can even estimate how effective the drug would have been for people who were assigned it but did n’t take it !
And that ’s not all — Peter Spirtes and Clark Glymour have developed an algorithm ( known as PC , for Peter - Clark ) that , given just the data , will do its best to calculate the causal network behind it .
You can download the software implementing it , called TETRAD IV , for free from their department ’s website — it even has a nice graphical interface for drawing and displaying the networks .
As an experiment , I fed it some data from the IRS about 2005 income tax returns .
It informed me that the percentage people donate to charity is correlated with the number of dependents they have , which in turn correlates with how much people receive from EITC .
That amount , along with average income , causes how many people are on EITC .
Average income is correlated with the tax burden which is correlated with inequality .
All interesting and reasonable — and the result of just a few minutes ’ work .
The applications for such tools are endless .
As Pearl points out , they have the possibility to radically improved how statistics are used in medicine , epidemiology , economics , sociology , and law .
And , as Glymour observes , it lets us better understand results in neuroscience and psychology .
Take The Bell Curve , the 1992 bestseller that argued blacks had lower IQs , causing poorer performance in school and thus lower - paying jobs and more crime .
Glymour shows , by applying the do - calculus , these results only hold if you assume that there are no other interactions between the variables ( e.g. that parental attitude toward learning does n’t affect both IQ and performance in school ) .
But the PC algorithm and TETRAD IV can demonstrate otherwise .
Such results may be a revolution in social science , but compared to building human - like robots , they ’re child ’s play .
That ’s certainly the impression one gets from Pearl .
Discussing his work at a conference of Artificial Intelligence researchers , he said :
One of the reasons I find these areas to be fertile grounds to try out new ideas is that , unlike AI , tangible rewards can be reaped from solving relative small problems .
Problems involving barely 4 to 5 variables , which we in AI regard as toy - problems , carry tremendous payoffs in public health and social science .
Billions of dollars are invested each year on various public - health studies :
Is chocolate ice - cream good for you or bad for you ?
Would red wine increase or decrease your heart rate ?
etc. etc .
The same applies to the social sciences .
Would increasing police budget decrease or increase crime rates ?
Is the Colorado school incident due to TV violence or failure of public education ?
The Inter - university Consortium for Political and Social Research has distributed about 800 gigabytes worth of such studies in 1993 alone .
Unfortunately the causal - analytical methodology currently available to researchers in these fields is rather primitive , and every innovation can make a tremendous difference . [… ]
This has been changing recently as new techniques are beginning to emerge from AI laboratories .
I predict that a quiet revolution will take place in the next decade in the way causality is handled in statistics , epidemiology , social science , economics , and business .
While news of this revolution will never make it to DARPA ’s newsletter , and even NSF is not equipped to appreciate or support it , it will nevertheless have enormous intellectual and technological impact on our society .
For science ’s sake , I hope he ’s right .

Louisiana Senator David Vitter is facing criticism over his apparent unwillingness to speak out against a justice of the peace who refused a marriage license to an interracial couple .
After several days of political pressure on the Republican senator to condemn the actions of Keith Bardwell , a Hammond , Louisiana , justice of the peace , Vitter ’s spokespeople released a statement on Wednesday that declared the senator “ thinks that all judges should follow the law as written and not make it up as they go along , ” according to Washington Post blogger Greg Sargent .

For many observers , the vagueness of the statement — neither Bardwell nor the issue of interracial marriage was mentioned — has raised as many questions as it has answered .
Both Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and US Senator Mary Landrieu ( D - LA ) have condemned Bardwell ’s actions and words .
Jindal has called for the justice ’s dismissal , while Landrieu , a conservative Democrat , condemned Bardwell ’s decision as “ an example of the ugly bigotry that divided our country for too long . ”
On Tuesday , blogger Mike Stark at The Crooked Dope posted a short video of Vitter silently stepping into an elevator and smiling as he was questioned about his views on Bardwell .
The video , which can be viewed below , made Vitter the subject of intense scrutiny with respect to his views on race .
Political observers are wondering whether Vitter sees some political benefit to staying quiet on the Bardwell controversy .
“ Apparently some of us are awfully worried about losing the votes of southern racists , ” quipped John Aravosis at AmericaBlog .

“ David Vitter ’s failure to condemn Keith Bardwell says all you need to know about David Vitter , ” the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said in a statement .
“ To compensate for his own experience , Vitter has moved fast and furiously to the fringe of his party and is now squarely outside of the Louisiana mainstream . ”
The DSCC statement appears to refer to the sex scandal in which Vitter has been embroiled for the past two years .
In 2007 , Vitter was outed as a client of the “ DC Madam , ” Deborah Jeane Palfrey , who was convicted in 2008 on charges relating to her prostitution business .
Keith Bardwell became the subject of intense controversy last week when news reports revealed he had refused to grant an interracial couple a wedding license because he believed that it would harm the bi-racial offspring of such marriages .

Bardwell has since said he is not a racist , and will not resign .

What I ’ve Earned and Learned From Writing A Popular ( ish ) Ruby Book
By Peter Cooper
A few days ago I received the latest in a long line of royalty statements for my book , Beginning Ruby ( as published by Apress ) .
Long time readers might recall that Ruby Inside was started principally to promote the book , but turned into so much more that the book took a back seat .
Well , the whim came over me to share the murky details of being the author of such a book , including how the royalty statements work ( or not ) , how much is earned , sales figures , and so forth .
So I wrote What I 've Earned ( And Learned ) From Writing " Beginning Ruby " over at the new , official Beginning Ruby promotional site .
I was n't planning on mentioning it here , but the post became popular on Hacker News and Reddit to such an extent ( almost 10,000 pageviews so far ! ) that it must be a story people want to read - so check it out .
For those who are interested , Beginning Ruby 's 2nd edition was published just a couple of months ago with lots of updates , new sections , and two all - new chapters on Web application frameworks ( Rails , Sinatra , and Ramaze ) and GUI app development ( using Shoes - erk ) .
You can buy it at Amazon.com here or learn more at the official Beginning Ruby site .
It 's a great book for people who are new to Beginning Ruby ( or programming generally , even ) and you can see tons of reviews on Amazon 's listing for the 1st edition ( we 're waiting for them to be merged into the 2nd edition 's page ! ) or at the official site .

Introduction
JEE development , though challenging and exciting , most of the JEE developers are vexed of redeploying the application , restarting the container even for a small change in the code .
This eats up major development time of the developers causing lesser productivity , increase in resource count , project cost , schedule and many more .
When we think of the present day programming era , lots of technologies evolved to facilitate the software developer program development easier .
But still we could see most of the developers ( Java developers especially ) struggling to deploy , restart container for little changes in the code .
In a thought to kick this overhead from the developer ’s shoulders and improve development productivity and overall project cost , ZeroTurnAround team has come up with an archive on the name JavaRebel which helps developers during program development changes .
Digging Java Rebel
JavaRebel is a JVM plugin that enables reloading the changes made to Java class files on - the - fly , hence saving developers ’ time to redeploy an application or perform a container restart .
It is a generic solution that works for Java EE and Java standalone applications .
JavaRebel installs as a JVM plugin ( - javaagent ) and works by monitoring the timestamp of class files .
When a class is updated ( e.g. when a developer saves a class from the IDE ) JavaRebel will reload the changes to the class code and structure while preserving all existing class instances .
This means that changes to classes and configurations can be seen immediately , without the need to redeploy an application or perform a container restart - typically saving 5 - 10 minutes per hour of development time .
The loading is lazy and will happen upon usage of the class ( method call on an instance , static call on the class , field lookup etc ) .
JavaRebel brings Ruby and PHP style dynamic reloading of classes to Java .
While it currently has several limitations it can speed up development dramatically .
The following classes will be reloaded when they are changed and compiled :
All “ .class ” classes inside the usual classpath ( WEB - INF / classes , etc ) .
Using this with exploded deployment will provide the best JavaRebel experience .
, etc ) .
Using this with exploded deployment will provide the best JavaRebel experience .
All “ .class ” files in directories specified by - Drebel.dirs ( comma - separated list ) JVM command line property .
With this you can deploy in unexploded development mode ( EAR or WAR ) and still reload classes instantly .
For example - Drebel.dirs=/path/to/eclipse/project-one/bin , /path/to/eclipse/project-two/bin .
However new classes ( or renamed old classes ) will not be loaded before they also appear in the classpath ( e.g. after the build in JAR files ) .
One of the selling points of PHP , Ruby , Python and other interpreted languages is their faster development .
This is not based on the superiority of the language constructs , but instead on the minimal turnaround time in development environments .
JavaRebel aims to provide the same productivity in Java .
In short the below two figures show what JavaRebel does :
Features of JavaRebel
JavaRebel1.1 comes up with the following features :

Normal Deployment Process :
Typical JEE developer spends his day in the development - compile - deploy - test cycle .
As developers perform this cycle several times a day it is a significant loss to SWD departments , additional risks appear and developers typically get bored .
Using JavaRebel :
As opposed to usual deployment process JavaRebel does not spend any time on reinitializing the application and does not interrupt the developer routine .
Instead it reloads the code for updated classes only and continues to run application as is .
Hence the below best benefits can be reaped using JavaRebel
Add the following to JVM command line ( note that it is important that the JAR would be named “ javarebel.jar ” )
- noverify - javaagent:/path/to/javarebel.jar
Windows examples
java - noverify - javaagent:C:\libraries\javarebel.jar - Drebel.dirs=c:\workspace\project\classes com.domain.Application
java - noverify - javaagent:C:\libraries\javarebel.jar - Drebel.dirs=c:\workspace\project\classes - jar application.jar
Linux examples
java - noverify - javaagent:/home/john/libs/javarebel.jar - Drebel.dirs=/home/john/workspace/project/classes com.domain.Application
java - noverify - javaagent:/home/john/libs/javarebel.jar - Drebel.dirs=/home/john/workspace/project/classes - jar application.jar
The installation for Java 1.4 has two parts :
Generating a bootstrap jar
Adding command line options to the JVM
Generating the bootstrap jar
Running java - jar / path/to/javarebel.jar will generate a javarebel - bootstrap.jar .
This file is generated to the folder where javarebel .
jar resides .
IMPORTANT !
javarebel - bootstrap.jar is JVM and JavaRebel version specific !
If you upgrade your JVM ( even a minor version ) or upgrade JavaRebel you have to regenerate javarebel - bootstrap .jar .
IMPORTANT !
Make sure that the JVM version used to generate javarebel - bootstrap .jar is the same your application will run with !
Example
java - jar C:\libraries \javarebel.jar - will generate a javarebel - bootstrap .jar into the folder C:\libraries \
- will generate a javarebel - bootstrap . jar into the folder C:\libraries \
java - jar / home / john / lib - will generate a javarebel - bootstrap .jar into the folder / home / john / lib
NOTE
The easiest way to ensure JVM and JavaRebel version consistency is to add the javarebel - bootstrap . jar generation to the startup script of your application server .
This means that on every startup the javarebel - bootstrap . jar is generated with the JVM that is used to start the server .
This is an inexpensive invocation and will not be noticeable .
Adding command line options to the JVM
JavaRebel requires the javarebel - bootstrap.jar and javarebel .jar to be prepended to the Java bootclasspath as well as the - noverify JVM flag :
- noverify - Xbootclasspath/p:/path/to/javarebel-bootstrap.jar:/path/to/javarebel.jar
Windows examples
java - noverify - Xbootclasspath/p:C:\libraries\javarebel-bootstrap.jar;C:\libraries\javarebel.jar - Drebel.dirs=c:\workspace\project\classes com.domain.Application
java - noverify - Xbootclasspath/p:C:\libraries\javarebel-bootstrap.jar;C:\libraries\javarebel.jar - jar - Drebel.dirs=c:\workspace\project\classes application.jar
Linux examples
java - noverify - Xbootclasspath/p:/home/john/libs/javarebel-bootstrap.jar:/home/john/libs/javarebel.jar - Drebel.dirs=/home/john/workspace/project/classes com.domain.Application
java - noverify - Xbootclasspath/p:/home/john/libs/javarebel-bootstrap.jar:/home/john/libs/javarebel.jar - Drebel.dirs=/home/john/workspace/project/classes - jar application.jar
Configuration
Configuring properties related to JavaRebel can be done in two ways :
a ) Global Configuration
b ) Using rebel.xml
a ) Global Configuration
JavaRebel can be configured using Java system properties or the SDK API .
To find out more about the configuration API please visit the SDK home and the API Javadoc .
A description of available system properties follows .
- Drebel.packages=PACKAGE1 , PACKAGE2 , ...
This should be set to a comma-separated list of Java packages .
JavaRebel will then only reload classes in those packages and their subpackages .
This is mainly used to restrict reloading to only a limited subset of classes , e.g. to improve performance .
- Drebel.packages_exclude=PACKAGE1 , PACKAGE2 , ...
This should be set to a comma-separated list of Java packages .
JavaRebel will not reload classes in those packages and their subpackages .
This is mainly used to exclude classes that produce errors with JavaRebel reloading .
JavaRebel will reload classes that are not in the exclude packages and are in an include package .
By default all .class classes will be reloaded .
- Drebel.allow_bytecode_proxy=true
Enables support for bypassing bytecode - based proxies created with CgLib or Javassist .
- Drebel.plugins=jar1 , jar2 , jar3 , ...
Set this to absolute path of the plugin jars to enable 2.0 plugins .
- Drebel.log=true
Enables debug logging to the JavaRebel.log file .
Use when you are having some problems with the JavaRebel and you need to get more context .
- Drebel.log.perf=true
Enables additional logging of the performance statistics to the JavaRebel.log file .
Requires JDK1.5 +.
- Drebel.log.trace=true
Enables trace logging to the JavaRebel.log file .
Generates a very detailed , but extremely big log .
- Drebel.log.stdout=false
Disables all JavaRebel output to standard output , e.g. the console
b ) Using rebel.xml
rebel.xml gives the developers a well defined and easily interpreted fine - grain control in dynamic reloading of changed classes .
It supports < jar / > , < jarset / > , < dirset / > , < war / > and many more which help developers configure JavaRebel to perform its best .
Starting with JavaRebel 2.0 rebel.xml file must used for web applications that use packaged deployment ( i.e. WARs , JARs and EARs ) .
Instead of the WAR / JAR / EAR file deployed all resources will be picked up from the locations provided in the rebel.xml .
Also these directories and archives will be monitored for changes .
The rebel.xml must be placed in the WEB - INF / classes directory of the deployed WAR file .
For class path configuration rebel.xml can also be placed in a root directory of a JAR file or in the root of EJB JAR modules .
A rebel.xml file should be provided per each module in the application that you want to change on - the - fly .
The contents of the file are divided into the following sections :
classpath - directories and JARs used for classes and other classpath resources .
web - directories and JARs used for Servlet Context resources such as JSPs as well as static resources .
war - directory or WAR file being the root of the whole web application .
A sample configuration file with documentation is below .
This file can be copied to your project and appropriate sections deleted or customized .
The contents of the rebel.xml is defined by the schema attached herewith :

Farmville users want to be able to fly the Indian flag online
More than 20,000 people have called for India 's national flag to be added to a popular web game which allows users to develop and manage a farm online .
Farmville is the most popular application on the social networking site Facebook .
Players are able to personalise their farms and mark their location by adding flags to their territory .
At the moment , players from just a few countries , including the UK and US , can mark territory with a national flag .
Players have lobbied San Franciso - based developers Zynga saying many of the game 's 56 million fans are Indian .
By Friday , at least 20,300 supporters added their name to a petition asking Zynga to add the tricolour flag .
Discussions
More than three million Facebook users live in India and there are many more Farmville players of Indian - origin who have backed the cause .
The topic was also discussed on blogs and forums .
One commentator said users would even be prepared to pay to be able to use their flag , while on a Zynga community forum , another said a large number of Indians played the game and were disappointed by the missing flag .
The campaign has inspired other players to request that their flags are also added .
Ankush Deshpande is one of those co-ordinating efforts online to persuade Zynga to add the Indian flag .
He said Farmville 's developers had " insulted " India by ignoring the demand .
Since the game launched in June , an average of more than one million new daily active users a week have joined Farmville .

WESTVLETEREN , Belgium —
The news that two prestigious online guides declared your ale the world ’s best beer would be cause for celebration at most microbreweries .
The prospect of booming sales , bulging export orders and the glare of international media attention ought to be the perfect excuse to crack open a bottle or three .
But Cistercian monks , dedicated to a life of silence , seclusion and manual toil , do n’t quite see it that way , even when their work includes maintaining a centuries - old tradition of brewing heavenly ales .
“ The monks do n’t want to brew more , ” said Philip de Backer , whose In de Vrede cafe is one of the few bars where you can sup the elusive Westvleteren beers .
“ They want to be monks , not brewers , ” de Backer explained in an interview outside the abbey walls .
“ They do n’t want to live for their beer , they only live for God . ”
The St. Sixtus abbey in the village of Westvleteren is one of seven Trappist breweries that still maintain a tradition of monk - made beers dating back to the Middle Ages .
However , while the other six — five in Belgium and one over the border in The Netherlands — market their beer through stores , bars and websites , the 30 monks of Westvleteren refuse to commercialize their beer or increase production .
Officially , the beer many connoisseurs consider the finest suds on the planet can only be bought direct from the monks or in de Backer ’s cafe across the road from the Abbey .
Even for beer lovers who make the pilgrimage out to Westvleteren deep in the flat Flemish countryside , the only way to be sure of getting some beer to take home is calling in advance on the monks ’ “ beer phone ” and making an appointment .
Sales are strictly limited to one crate of 24 bottles per car .
Buyers can check in advance on the Abbey website to see which days the beer will be available , but they are often fully - booked for weeks in advance .
“ It ’s very worth it , ” said Rudi Slechten about the 400 - kilometer ( 250 - mile ) round trip from his home in northeastern Belgium to buy a crate of Westvleteren No. 12 .
“ It ’s a very special beer . ”
On a bright summer Saturday , the terrace of de Backer ’s cafe was crowded with drinkers quaffing goblets of ale to accompany some other fruits of the monks ’ labor : pate , cheese , bread , even beer - flavored ice - cream .
Outside , a stream of cars wound its way through the fields of potatoes and beets to line up at the abbey gate .
The Westvleteren monks produce three beers : the Blond , a tangy , honey blond thirst quencher ; the No. 8 , a malty , chestnut - hued brew with a hint of brown sugar sweetness ; and the legendary No. 12 , a chocolate - dark cup of seduction that leaves beer fans gushing .
“ Near perfection in a bottle , ” writes Jason Alstroem , co-founder of beeradvocate.com , which together with www.ratebeer.com ranks Westvleteren 12 as the world 's No. 1 .
“ Suggestions of plump golden raisins , anise , herbal tea , buckwheat honey , caramel , lemon rind , fresh baked short bread … clove with a mellow medicinal phenol , ” Alstroem adds .
“ Christmas pudding also , with alcohol and candied fruit . ”
When a beer is this good and this hard to find , it ’s no surprise that there ’s a thriving black , or at least gray , market in the elusive ales , despite the monks ’ strict no resale policy .
In the nearby town of Poperinge , center of Belgium ’s hop - growing region , you ’ll find plenty of fine local beers on show in shop windows , but no Westvleteren .
A quiet word with local storekeepers can , however , lead to a clandestine case being retrieved from their backroom stash .
Nasser Eftekhari is less shy .
The Iranian - born entrepreneur runs the best - known ale store in Brussels .
The shelves of Beer Mania hold an intoxicating array of over 400 Belgian brews , from sour - cherry infused krieks , to organic brown ales , pale spiced wheat beers and the full range of Trappist ales — including Westvleteren .
“ When I started having Westvleteren here , it was exactly 11 years ago [ when ] no one knew about that beer , no one , ” said the one - time teenage refugee .
“ It was my discovery … .
I said this beer should be famous . ”
Back then , Eftekhari said , the abbey was producing a surplus , which allowed him to return to the capital with as many as 70 cases .
He thinks the monks should be grateful to him for making them an international success .
The monks disagree .
“ They sued me .
They say ‘ we hate you , because of you we do n’t have an easy life now , ’ ” he said .
“ Now I ’m buying from the black market , I ca n’t go there . ”
Confident of winning a lawsuit launched by the monks , Eftekhari continues to sell the beer , even to fans across the Atlantic .
At a hefty 12 euro a bottle , plus shipping , buying from Eftekhari is a tad more expensive than paying the monks 1.5 euro per bottle of No. 12 .
Eftekhari said the high prices are necessary because he ’s forced to pay off middle men since the monks ban him from buying direct .
Despite the price , Eftekhari said the Westvleteren ales remain among his best sellers .
And despite his dispute with the monks , he acknowledged they make a divine brew .
“ Someone told me Americans say : I ’ll share my car with a friend , yes ; my wife , maybe ; my gun , never .
And I say this : my car , yes ; my wife , maybe , my Westvleteren , never . ”
Brown eyes are anything but bland , in fact they ’ve got something that blues and greens usually do n’t : there are so many variations of
brown that if you look closely you can usually find flecks and sparkles of other colors intermixed , making them not ‘ just ’ brown , but a veritable rainbow of browns , golds , ambers , and even some green .
Take a very close look at your eyes and figure out what different color tones you see : the other colors that you see besides brown are the ones you ’ll want to bring out
with your eye makeup .
I ’ve got two videos here for you instead of a wall of text because it ’s SO much easier to learn from watching a video of a professional makeup artist ( the women in both videos are ) demonstrate the proper procedure on someone while actually explaining what they ’re doing at the same time .
Have a look , and pay attention , here ’s the first one courtesy of Pur Minerals :
A few tips before we go to the second one : you should use bright colors that contrast with your beautiful brown eyes like bright purples , golds , greens , blues , burnt oranges , etc .
What ’s great about brown eyes is
that they ’re so versatile because they are so neutral and therefore go with lots of different colors .
You should play around with some of these colors , and use a black eyeliner that will further illuminate your eyes due to the black / brown contrast .
If you ’re a brunette with a cooler skin tone , your eyes will really be brought out by
bright primary colors like royal blue , lime , and crimson red .
You ’re also one of very few women who can totally pull off bright yellow as a complete outfit–wearing yellow with lightly tanned skin will really cause your beautiful browns to stand out .
Here ’s the second video :
Additional Tips and Resources
Definitely have a look at my previous post that I did on how to makeup eyes in general , that ’s also got an excellent video and some additional tips for you .
Someone asked how they could make their brown eyes stand out and got some great responses on Yahoo !
Answers , have a look .
eHow.com also has some really good tips on how to enhance brown eyes , definitely worth a look .
TORONTO ( Reuters ) - North America ’s professional sports leagues are all a twitter over tweeting and have pushed through guidelines to ban player access to social networking sites during games .
An undated screenshot of Twitter.com .
REUTERS/www.twitter.com
Following the lead of the NFL and NBA , the NHL said it was close to making recommendations that will prohibit players from using communicational devices for social media activity -- including Twitter and Facebook -- 30 minutes before and after games , practices , meetings and media access periods .
The ban would extend to coaches , trainers and all game - related personnel .
“ I looked at what the NBA was doing and what the NFL was doing and used those as a basis for my own recommendations , ” NHL director of social media marketing Mike Dilorenzo told Reuters on Thursday .
“ We ’ve drafted a set of guidelines that are in the process of being vetted by the senior management so they can be rolled out to the teams . ”
The NBA sent a memo to teams on Wednesday informing them that coaches , players and other basketball operations personnel would be forbidden from accessing social media sites from 45 minutes before tipoff until after the post - game media availability .
The Miami Heat and the Toronto Raptors are among a number of NBA teams that have been even tougher on tweeters .
Raptors head coach Jay Triano has banned the use of smartphones and laptops from practice , including all management staff and media .
Even general manager Bryan Colangelo is required to leave the facility to respond to text messages .
MEDIA PLATFORMS
The NFL , which zealously protects its on - field product , was the first of North America ’s big four professional sports leagues to put a twitter policy in place , banning players from using social media platforms from 90 minutes before kickoff .
Major League Baseball ( MLB ) has no specific guidelines but pointed to a longstanding policy regarding communicational devices that prohibits their use 30 minutes before the start of a game .
The attempt by the leagues to gain control over the Twitter phenomenon comes after a number of controversial tweets .
While coaches worry reckless tweets may provide inspirational bulletin board material for opposing teams , leagues are working to protect broadcast rights holders from tweeters getting too close to play - by - play .
Buffalo Bills wide receiver Terrell Owens has engaged in a couple of explosive twitter feuds this season involving former Dallas Cowboys team mate Tony Romo and Rodney Harrison .
Earlier this season little - known Washington Redskins backup linebacker Robert Henson labeled booing fans “ dim- wits ” before apologizing and shutting down his Twitter account .
“ The culture in our dressing rooms , I do n’t think , is conducive for someone stepping out of line with these things , ” said Dilorenzo .
“ I just completed a round of interviews with 17 players who almost to a man do n’t use Twitter and two of 17 said they once had a Facebook page but no longer .
“ I just do n’t think it is in the DNA of our players .
In their minds they do n’t consider this marketing but self promotional , ” he added .
The Department of Defense has identified 811 American service members who have died as a part of the Afghan war and related operations .
It confirmed the deaths of the following Americans this week :
LAYTON , James R. , 22 , Petty Officer Third Class , Navy ; Riverbank , Calif. ; Combined Security Transition Command .
MEADOWS , Joshua S. , 30 , Capt. , Marines ; Bastrop , Tex. ; First Marine Special Operations Battalion .
The New York Times has a nice article on the recent Communications of the ACM article on P=NP ( article at author Lance Fortnow ’s site ) .
I had read Fortnow ’s article last month , and really liked it .
In fact , I am surprised I did n’t blog it : I guess I was too busy worrying about false proofs of P=NP ( or not ) .
The Times article does a good job of summarizing the problem in a non-technical way :
The challenge , in its simplest , but not most understandable phrasing , is to determine whether or not P equals NP .
P stands for the class of problems that can be solved in polynomial time , or reasonably quickly .
NP stands for the class of problems that can be verified in polynomial time — quickly .
If it can be shown that P=NP , then it is possible that the world will be a very different place .
The main thrust of the New York Times article is simply how popular the paper is :
The editors of the journal said they were tickled to have a hit article on their hands .
” I do n’t think we ’ve ever had an article that started off with this kind of a bang , ” said Moshe Y. Vardi , a Rice University computer scientist who is editor in chief of the journal .
” Our e-mail blast went out and thousands of people felt they had to click . ”
The author of the article , Lance Fortnow , a computer scientist at Northwestern University McCormick School of Engineering , initially told Dr. Vardi that the article would be a short one .
” Still open , ” he writes , was in first reaction to writing about the state of the work on solving the problem .
But the article does point to one possible new direction for attacking the problem :
There remains a glimmer of hope , he noted .
An esoteric branch of mathematics known as algebraic geometry may offer an avenue to prove or disprove the problem , which was first outlined by Stephen A. Cook , a University of Toronto computer scientist , in 1971 .
That prospect feels a bit intimidating .
As Dr. Vardi said , “ It ’s a bit scary because we have to start learning a very difficult mathematical field . ”
The Times did a good job on this one .
Readable and accurate : good work John Markoff !
And thanks Ted for the pointer .

As a reddit commentator noted , “ algebraic geometry ” is hardly “ an esoteric branch of mathematics ” , so perhaps there is room for improvement in the article .
“ The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society , or how much it will grow , but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and , above all , the durability of that advantage . ”- Warren Buffet .
The right time to get back in the market may be just around the corner .
With global economies sinking , sometimes dramatically , it can be a scary thought to put your hard - earned money on the line .
However , a smart investor will realise that golden opportunities are appearing if proper research is done .
It has not dropped dramatically since the financial collapse of 2008 - 2009 , but it is still in familiar territory .
It may take another another year or more for a large upswing in the markets , but at least we hope that the Dow will not drop below previous lows .
That may bring hope and some peace of mind about starting to invest again .
For investors , the operative question is simple , albeit very broad :
In the midst of this crisis , what do we do ?
A good rule of thumb :
If a stock you are considering for investment depends upon a speedy return to normal , you should be looking elsewhere .
Warren Buffett has often said that you should invest in businesses that you would n’t mind owning if the stock market were closed for an extended period .
Dollar Cost Averaging
The concept of Dollar Cost Averaging comes to mind in the current market situation .
It is the process of buying stocks or similar investments on a regular basis , such as once a month , using a fixed amount of money .
When prices are low , you are able to buy more shares .
When prices are high , you buy fewer .
In this way , you are able to take advantage of temporary low prices .
This is especially helpful for long - term investments , such as retirement accounts .
It may go against human nature to buy stocks when everything is falling and red but in fact it can lead to a bigger payoff if done correctly .

Do n’t Wait Too Long
When will this Corona - 19 Pandemic end ?
Who knows ?
But , I am confident that this too shall pass .
We have been through wars , terrorist attacks , inflation , stagflation , deflation , SARS , Ebola , AIDS ; the list goes on .
Through all of that , people suffered ; as a society , we always pulled through .
This time should not be different .
As soon as you believe the markets will not drop much more , that is the time to start investing .
When an upswing begins , it may happen so fast that you will miss a good portion of it .
There are literally billions of dollars of cash on the sidelines , just waiting to go back into the market when the time is right .
You can imagine what impact that might have on prices because of a surging demand but limited supply of stocks and mutual funds .
Do n’t wait too long !
Which Companies to Buy
There are a lot of low - priced stocks right now .
Do n’t jump into any old stock just because the price is low .
There may be good reasons for it , such as the company being dangerously close to bankruptcy .
One popular example is GM .
Their stock price has dropped incredibly far .
Is it a good deal ?
The government will probably not allow them to go into bankruptcy because that could have catastrophic affects on the country .
Even if they survive , though , they may not thrive , and the stock price might hold its value or drop even more .
This is just an example of how difficult it can be to make a trading decision at the present time .
You also need to consider how the company is adapting to the economy .
Are they offering low - price items to their customers ?
Are they reducing expenses significantly , such as layoffs , to stay in business ?
Do they have access to enough credit to stay operational ?
These are very important questions to consider before making a trade .
Will the Economy Get Worse ?
This is probably the single most important factor that traders are considering right now .
Why put your money into investments if they are just going to drop again ?
The government is trying hard to stabilize the economy , but there are many experts who believe there is more doom and gloom in the future , with more foreclosures , bank failures , and lost jobs on the way .
A lot of this depends on how the government handles the situation and how the public perceives their actions .
If the public believes things are stabilized , they will begin to spend and invest again , businesses will have more money and they can hire more people , and the economy can begin to thrive again .
When this will happen ?
Nobody knows for sure .
Hopefully soon it will , but it may be much later .
Lastly do n’t FOMO get the better of you .
( Fear of missing out )
Keeping sensitive information secure is important for everyone but there are some specific considerations required for small businesses .
Not only is the personal information of staff involved , but also that of customers , financial transactions , proprietary data … the list goes on and on !
As such , it may come as no surprise to learn than cyber criminals often see Small to Medium Enterprises ( SME ) as easy targets in scams .
Compared to their larger counterparts , SMEs typically have a limited budget , which means that they do n’t have a dedicated IT resource for their security system .
That means there may be fewer obstacles between a hacker and the payoff of a quick scam to get access to private information and other valuable data .
So , what can you do to keep your small business safe ?
We ’ve put together some tips for best practice in digital safety that can be used by any small business .
You wo n’t need to shell out for expensive consultants – just some time well spent .

Toyota 's Formula 1 chiefs have been assured that the Japanese manufacturer is not planning a shock withdrawal from the sport later this year - but the team has been warned to prepare itself for major costs cuts .
The Cologne - based outfit has been told it must wait until a board meeting in Tokyo on November 15 to get it 2010 budget signed off - which has prompted fears that Toyota could follow Honda and BMW out of F1 .
However , high level sources inside the Toyota Motor Company have told AUTOSPORT that the message from Tokyo is that the car maker plans to remain committed to F1 , but it does want to spend less in doing so .
It is understood that Toyota may be looking to cut its input into the F1 team by as much as 40 percent - which , added to sponsorship finance the team gets , could reduce its budget by up to one third compared to this year .
The lack of guarantee over next year 's budget is why the team has been unable to make firm financial commitments to its drivers for next year .
It is also believed that any staff needed to be cut from the F1 programme may be shifted onto a sportscar Le Mans project which is being considered for 2011 .
The source told AUTOSPORT : " The message from Tokyo is that we will be staying in F1 - and Toyota remains committed to the sport .
However , there will likely be big budget cuts . "
Toyota had come into the season admitting that only a race victory would be enough to guarantee its future in F1 - but the situation has changed now with the signing of a Concorde Agreement that commits the team for the next three years .
John Howett , Toyota 's F1 president , said that now the main factor was not individual results but the overall state of health of F1 .
" For me the bigger issue is the total value of F1 , and issues like that , " he said .
" We have proven [ in Spa ] that we have got a very competitive car - certainly on medium to high speed tracks . "
Although Toyota has fallen short of a victory this year , the team is pushing hard on bringing a major development step ahead of its home Japanese Grand Prix that could help it secure that elusive win .
" Suzuka looks good , " said Howett when asked about which of the final five races would provide the team its best chance of a victory .
" It is similar downforce requirements to Spa , so we could be strong there .
We are trying to get a fairly big upgrade for Singapore or there , but we will see where we can get it . "
Today 's Lessons of Daniel Ellsberg Editor ’s Note : Several recent events have highlighted the importance of speaking truth to power in the context of the " war on terror " – see , for instance here and here – but a new documentary also recalls the heroic actions of former Pentagon official Daniel Ellsberg who helped stop the Vietnam War by leaking out its true history .
But the bigger problem today is that the safeguards for the American Republic have almost completely broken down , including the news media which played an important supporting role in Ellsberg ’s heroism but now is more part of the problem , as David Swanson notes in this guest essay :
On Thursday night , I had the privilege of viewing a premiere of a film together with its star .
The theater was in the U.S. Capitol , and the film was " The Most Dangerous Man in America : Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers . "
Email
Printer friendly
This is a powerfully and engagingly constructed film about one of the most effective instances of whistle - blowing in our nation 's history .
Ellsberg risked life in prison to expose the lies that had taken this nation into war in Vietnam , lies from Eisenhower , Kennedy and Johnson .
And Nixon believed that Ellsberg had incriminating documents on his own lies , which led Henry Kissinger to call Ellsberg " the most dangerous man in America . "
Like most whistle - blowers , Ellsberg was not an outside reformer .
He had promoted and advanced the war from inside the Pentagon .
He had tried to be a force for moderation .
But peace activists reached his conscience and persuaded him that he could and must do more .
Those close to him supported his decision .
Colleagues took similar risks to assist him .
Major media outlets risked their futures to publish what Ellsberg gave them and to interview him while he was in hiding from the law .
A member of Congress ( former Sen. Mike Gravel , who was present on Thursday ) risked his future to read the Pentagon Papers into the congressional record .
The Supreme Court ruled against the President of the United States .
And Ellsberg became a brilliant spokesman for his cause .
A lot of factors combined to create an incredible impact from the leaking of one 7,000 - page pile of documents .
This exposure helped end the war in Vietnam , and helped put some spine into our media outlets , our Congress , and our courts ' treatment of the First Amendment .
However , Ellsberg expected more .
He expected Americans to change their thinking about wars .
He expected us not to fall for obvious lies about wars anymore .
He thought that people would digest and synthesize the untold story he exposed .
So , in some ways , he was of course disappointed .
And , of course , what good he did for the media and Congress quickly wore off .
In the film we 're told that the New York Times decided to publish top secret documents because it thought it would not be able to survive the disgrace of the world eventually learning that it had acquired the documents and not published them .
This sounds like something out of Alice in Wonderland today in our world where the New York Times buries most interesting stories , where it dutifully kept a warrantless spying story secret for a year , where it still has n't reported on most of the stories found in the book by Times reporter James Risen that forced that story out , and where it pushed war lies about Iraq and now does the same for Iran .
Most crimes today are public .
Bush and Cheney brag about torture on television .
Nothing happens .
Documents like the Downing Street Minutes are studiously ignored .
Whistleblowers post their stories on the Internet .
Congress no longer impeaches or even issues subpoenas .
And the RAND Corporation , from which Ellsberg leaked his documents , held a propaganda - fest about escalation in Afghanistan on Capitol Hill the same day as the movie premiere .
In the film , we 're told that Americans were enraged to learn from the Pentagon Papers that the Vietnam War was being fought to " save face . "
At RAND 's forum on Thursday , Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution openly argued for an escalation in Afghanistan , because withdrawal would mean a " huge PR victory for al Qaeda . "
Our crimes , like our system of campaign bribery or our degradation of journalism , are mostly out in the open now .
No doubt there are documents in the White House or the Pentagon or RAND indicating knowledge of the hopelessness of quagmire continuation in Afghanistan .
But who would ever dare leak them ?
Who would ever dare help that person do so ?
Once posted online , who would compel a newspaper or a television network to notice ?
Once the information was in the corporate media , who would force Congress to care ?
Once Congress cared , who would shut down Washington D.C. until the powers of subpoena and impeachment were revived ?
It seems to me that what we need is not a new Dan Ellsberg for our generation .
We need a whole new generation .
We need dozens of Dan Ellsbergs and Dan Ellsberg accomplices throughout our government , and we need them to act frequently and with eternal vigilance .
Luckily for us , Ellsberg has provided an ideal model for how to conduct yourself when in a position like his .
Ellsberg has also written the foreword to a book by Ann Wright ( who was there on Thursday ) that provides more recent role models : http://voicesofconscience.com
And those of us who are not in possession of classified crime records can help as well .
We can raise bloody hell until Congress passes a media shield law and a whistle - blower bill of rights .
We can befriend war - makers , modern - day Ellsbergs , and reach their hearts .
And we can build media outlets that do real reporting .
We must do these things .
Let ’s do them for the most dangerous man in America .

On Monday morning , marijuana activist Marc Emery held what could be his last news conference in B.C. for several years .
Emery is facing extradition to the United States -- and a five - year jail term -- for selling pot seeds to customers south of the border .
The self - proclaimed " Prince of Pot " arrived at the B.C. Supreme Court for his extradition hearing shortly after 9 a.m .
Standing unrepentant before a crowd of supporters , Emery delivered an address of defiance and civil disobedience .
" I 'm proud of everything I 've done .
I do n't feel bad about anything , " Emery said .
" I wo n't be apologizing to any judge .
I wo n't be making account for my work .
I only regret that I was n't able to do more . "
Emery described his treatment as " draconian " before accusing the provincial and federal government of supporting organized crime by refusing to legalize marijuana .
" It wo n't hurt you .
It wo n't kill you .
It wo n't do what so many legal things will do like tobacco , alcohol , prescription drugs , sugar , salt -- basic commodities that kill people every day in this country that are perfectly legal , " the rabble - rousing activist said .
After a few tearful goodbyes , Emery headed inside to surrender himself to authorities .
Jodie Emery 's plea for public support
Emery 's wife Jodie expressed her grief in an interview with ctvbc.ca Monday morning .
" I 'm absolutely devastated and distraught that my husband is being taken away from me , " she said .
" It 's a betrayal of our sovereignty and citizenship . "
Emery said she is still hopeful that public outcry can halt her husband 's extradition .
" The Conservative government is outsourcing our justice system , " she said .
" If there 's enough public pressure , perhaps Marc could still be sentenced here instead . "
The " Prince of Pot " says he hopes to be back on the streets of B.C. a year from now if he 's allowed to serve his time in a Canadian prison .

The JIT compiler in JRuby is a relatively new creation for JRuby .
Of course , the initial approach taken for the JRuby platform was the most straightforward : parse and interpret the code incrementally as the program executes , traversing the AST .
As time went on , the JRuby team have taken a bunch of steps to improve the performance of JRuby , most of which have involved shortcutting the consistent , but also slow and indirect interpreter model .
The JIT compiler is probably one of the most aggressive and technically complex steps taken to date .
JIT compilers are a novel idea : take some code in an “ intermediate form ” , and , given some heuristics , compile it into a “ more native ” representation , with the expectation that the more native version will perform faster , and allow for more optimizations by the underlying platform .
If some optimizations can be thrown into the more native form in the process , all the better .
Java , as an example , has had a JIT compiler for several years now .
In fact , Java was , for many developers , the first time they heard the term JIT ; so much so that many developers I know think the “ J ” in JIT stands for “ Java ” .
In fact , JIT stands for Just - In - Time .
Smalltalker ’s may recognize the term “ Dynamic Translation ” instead .
Anyway , when the Java runtime determines code is eligible for native compilation ( frequency of execution is one of the primary parameters ) , it diverts the execution of the code , so it can perform some fancy hoop - jumping to turn the Java bytecode into platform - specific native instructions , thereby removing any cost of bytecode interpretation , and also throwing some nifty optimizations into the compiled code .
From that point forward , the native code will be used for execution , unless and until it has been invalidated by changing assumptions .
JRuby ’s JIT compiler is similar in nature , the primary difference being the source and destination formats .
In Java the source format is Java bytecode , and the destination format is native machine instructions .
Conversely , in JRuby , the source format is the JRuby AST , and the destination format is Java bytecode .
Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the JRuby JIT compiler is that it benefits from both the initial compilation into Java bytecode , and then later , when Java may attempt to translate the JRuby - generated bytecode into native machine instructions .
So effectively , it is possible to get a double - JIT on your executing code .
Generating Java bytecode from interpreted Ruby code is no small feat , however ; so , without further ado , let ’s start the tour of JRuby ’s JIT !
There ’s Compilers , and then there ’s Compilers
Before we go to deep , we should do a quick overview of what is really meant by “ compiling ” in JRuby .
Some of this discussion is n’t specific to the actual concept of “ JIT ” compilation ; there are a few different code - paths to getting to compiled code in JRuby .
One of those is definitely Just - In - Time method compilation , however JRuby can compile entire scripts as well ( with Modules and Classes , and other fancy - shmancy stuff ) .
So as this article proceeds , I will try to make a distinction on this .
When I refer to the JIT Compiler , I ’m really referring to the component that is responsible for tracking method invocations and compiling them when appropriate .
On the flip side , the term “ Compiler ” by itself belongs to the component in JRuby that can compile any Ruby script into an executable chunk of Java .
There are several tuning parameters in JRuby for the compiler as well ; setting the maximum number of methods to compile , how many method calls before the compiler should be invoked , the maximum lines to compile into a single string of bytecode , etc .
These settings affect different parts of the infrastructure , but for the most part , you should n’t have to care whether it is JIT - specific or not ; in most cases it does n’t matter .
Stay Classy , Java
So , JRuby is compiling Ruby into executable chunks of Java - that much we know ; but what are they , actually ?
Java , as you may or may not be aware , prevents the modification of any loaded classes in the VM ( security or some such nonsense ; dang buzzkills ) .
This rule prohibits JRuby from using the same class file to represent a live class in Ruby .
Intuitively , it might seem logical for JRuby to group all of the methods for a single Ruby class into a single Java class ; however , because of the aforementioned restriction in Java , and the facts that a . )
Individual method are only compiled by the JIT at thresholds ( meaning some of a class may be compile - eligible , while other parts are n’t ) , and b. )
Ruby allows for runtime method manipulation , this single - class paradigm is n’t possible .
So instead , the JRuby - to - Java compiler infrastructure is designed to turn any given JRuby AST into a generated Java class .
In other words , any time a hierarchy of AST nodes that represents a Ruby script is compiled in JRuby , a new Java class is derived to match , built , loaded , and otherwise made awesome .
Unlike the actual meta-class in Ruby , the AST is as static as the block of code from which it was built .
If another script comes along with more AST that modifies the same class , Ruby does n’t care - it will simply have compiled method hooks pointing to two entirely different Java classes .
The classes generated by the JRuby compiler ( note I did n’t mention the word JIT here ) , implement the JRuby interface ‘ org.jruby.ast.executable.Script’.
We ’ll see later how this is actually used .
That ’s Some Crazy JIT !
In the first Distilling - JRuby article I detailed the class ‘ DynamicMethod ’ .
This class represents the “ implementation ” of a method in JRuby .
As I discussed in that article , there are a ton of implementations ; Figure 1 is the class - hierarchy again for those of you who ’d rather not dig back to the old article .
One of the arrows I have drawn on the diagram is pointing to an innocuous little class called ‘ JittedMethod ’ .
What this really represents is the cusp of the rabbit hole we are about to go down .
Before we go too far down that hole , however , let ’s do a quick recap .
Hello , Again Old Friend
When JRuby wants to invoke a method , it has to find an implementation of that method .
I talked all about that in part 1 .
When it finally does find that implementation , it is going to be one of these DynamicMethod objects .
One of them that I mentioned previously is the “ DefaultMethod ” , which I referred to as the ‘ shell game ’ method implementation .
DefaultMethod is a consistent implementation for callers that internally delegates to one of two implementations : InterpretedMethod ( ol’ faithful ) and JittedMethod ( a primary patient for today ) .
Method invocation is the point at which code is JIT ’ed in JRuby ( but not the only way it gets compiled ) .
DefaultMethod keeps an internal counter representing the call - count for that particular method .
This number will be used by JRuby to determine whether or not the method is “ JIT eligible ” .
There are somewhere between ten and four million overloaded variants ( I got tired of counting ) of the ‘ call ’ method on DefaultMethod , but needless to say they all do something like this :
1 @Override 2 public IRubyObject call ( ThreadContext context , IRubyObject self , RubyModule clazz , String name , [... ] ) { 3 if ( box .
callCount >= 0 ) { 4 return tryJitReturnMethod ( context , name ) . call ( context , self , clazz , name , [... ] ) ; 5 } 6 return box .
actualMethod .
call ( context , self , clazz , name , [... ] ) ; 7 }
( In this case , “ box ” is just a container for the delegate method and the call count integer pair , and the [ … ] denotes where the various “ Arity ” - supporting implementations diverge . )
s long as call count is a positive integer , the “ tryJitReturnMethod ” call is made , which will check in with the JIT subsystem , and will attempt to build a new method implementation .
When that call completes , it returns a method implementation which this method can use , and that implementation is then invoked .
If call count is negative , however , the method cached on this receiver is simply called .
The call - count integer serves multiple purposes .
By simply being set negative , it effectively turns off the attempts to JIT - compile this particular method , but it also represents a counter for the number of invocations this method receives prior to JIT compilation actually being attempted .
Call count is the primary metric JRuby uses to throttle JIT compilation .
The “ tryJitReturnMethod ” simply looks up the JITCompiler implementation using a call to Ruby # getJITCompiler ( ) .
From here , we are entering the JIT universe .
“ You are in a maze of twisty passages , all alike . ”
The actual org.jruby.compiler.JITCompiler class represents the heart of the entire JIT process .
This class is the manager for the primary JIT compilation efforts ( It is also one of JRuby ’s registered MBeans - a topic I plan to discuss soon ) .
The primary invocation point is a method called “ tryJIT ” , which takes the DefaultMethod instance we were just working with , as well as the method name and the current ThreadContext ( there ’s that context showing up again ) .
From here , a number of contextual checks are made to see if this particular invocation is eligible for JIT :
Is the JIT compiler enabled ?
Is the method call count above the threshold for the JIT ?
Is the JIT method - cache full ?
Has the method been excluded from JIT’ing ?
After all of this , if the method still checks out , it ’s time to begin the real fun of compiling ( or at least , trying to ) .
At this point I ’m going to ( temporarily ) do some hand - waving , and let us all pretend that we ’ve passed a bunch of JRuby AST to our magic fire - breathing compiler monster , and out the back - side we were given a bunch of Java bytecode that acheives the same result as the AST .
To help with the transition , I have made a high - level diagram for this portion of the code .
Assuming you are still on board , remember that the goal at this point is to have a Ruby method be converted into a loadable chunk of Java code , so the bytecode we were given ( which represents a Java class ) needs to be loaded into a Java class at runtime .
JRuby needs an efficient and ‘ appropriate ’ way to load the Script sub-classes into Java , and keep a handle on them so we can create new instances of our ‘ method ’- powering class .
The component ‘ org.jruby .
ClassCache ’ performs both of these tasks , and is responsible for respecting the cache configuration parameters specified at startup .
The method ‘ cacheClassByKey ( … ) ’ is called , and is given the bytecode from our fire - breathing monster .
To load the class into the runtime , a small class called OneShotClassLoader is used , which as the name implies , is only used once .
The classloader is a child of the primary JRuby class - loader ( in the normal case , anyway ) , which means that the code generated in the script has visibility to all of the JRuby classes and dependencies ( this will be important later ) .
At the same time , it means that the class is isolated from the other scripts in its own classloading domain .
Interestingly , this class - cache does not actually hand out references to the class .
It returns the class from the initial cache call , but then simply retains references to the classes in a weak - reference form , so that if a method goes out of scope ( like if a call to ‘ remove_method ’ was made on a class ) , the reference will be dropped , and the cache will shrink by one .
In other words , the primary goal of the cache is to act as a throttle , as well as an endpoint for JMX monitoring .
To create a key to represent the class in the cache distinctly S - expressions are used .
A class called SexpMaker is given the various AST elements representing the method , and it in turn generates an S - expression that represents the method .
If you ever want to get a good feel for the methods stored in the ClassCache during a Ruby program execution , putting a break - point and looking at the S - expressions in the cache can be enlightening .
As an example , I created a very simple Ruby class that looked like this , and made a call to it in my script elsewhere :
1 class MyClass 2 def do_something 3 c = 3 4 d = c 5 end 6 end 7 8 # ... 9 10 obj = MyClass . new 11 obj .
do_something
I then set up the JIT compiler to run in such a way that this method would be JIT’ed .
Here is the S - expression generated for that method ( formatting mine ) :
( method do_something ( argsnoarg ) ( block ( newline ( localasgn c ( fixnum 3 ) ) ) ( newline ( localasgn d ( localvar c ) ) ) ) )
As you can see , it ’s a short - hand representation of the actual AST , and it is unique for that AST structure .
Method Swapping
So we ’ve made it through the journey of the compiler , and our JIT ’ed code is now contained in a nice handy - dandy Script class .
The JIT compiler class proceeds to create a new instance of our Script , and along with some various bookkeeping , calls DefaultMethod.swithToJitted( Script , CallConfiguration ) , passing in the Script object that represents the logic for this method .
This method assigns a new JittedMethod object to the default method container , and sets the call - count to a negative value , disabling subsequent JIT attempts .
Assuming the compilation has worked correctly , the actual invocation of the script is fairly straightforward .
There are a variety of ‘ Arity ’ implementations on the Script API to line up with the DynamicMethod call methods , but for the most part they all do the same thing :
1 try { 2 pre ( context , self , name , block , 1 ) ; 3 return jitCompiled Script .
__file__ ( context , self , [... ] ) ; 4 // handle exceptions omitted .
5 } finally { 6 post ( runtime , context , name ) ; 7 }
Effectively , the Script API is analogous to a general ‘ Runnable ’ representing a block of code ; it has been specialized to handle a number of call configurations , but for the most part , it simply is a logic containing object .
From this point forward , that method is now JIT ’ed unless / until it is removed from scope .
I ’d Like a Side of Bytecode With My Bytecode
Okay , time for the good stuff .
We ’ve done enough hand - waving , it ’s time to explore the compiler .
Before I go any further , I should mention the – bytecode switch .
If you ever want to see the bytecode JRuby generates for a chunk of Ruby code , you can simply by invoking JRuby :
1 jruby -- bytecode my_script.rb
It was immeasurably helpful to me in writing this article .
Compiler Components
There are several pieces and parts that all participate in the compilation process ( and incidentally , many have the word ‘ compiler ’ in the name ) .
That makes it a fairly complex creature to understand .
If the compiler is a big furry fire - breathing monster , we ’re about to dissect it and poke at the internal organs .
So , let ’s start with a quick break - down :
org.jruby.compiler.ASTInspector -
The ASTInspector class is effectively a statistics - gathering tool for the AST ; a detective looking for certain conditions .
The AST is given to this class at the start of compilation , and it looks for certain conditions in the AST that influence the overall behavior of the resulting code .
One of those conditions that is scanned for is the concept of scope ( which #{post ‘ distilling - jruby - tracking - scope ’ }we talked about last time # { / post} ) .
Scope becomes very important , because if the code in question does n’t need an explicit scope , the compiled code can be made much simpler ; likewise if it does have some intense scoping , the compiled code has to make sure it respects that so variables are n’t leaking all over the place .
org.jruby.internal.runtime.methods.CallConfiguration -
This is an enumeration representing the type of method invocation involved at a certain level , and is calculated and returned by the ASTInspector , depending on the structures it finds .
The call configuration is n’t unique to the compiler process ; in fact it really is part of the scope management ; but was a bit too detailed for the previous discussion .
This enumeration is the actual object that performs the ‘ pre / post ’ invocations on the ThreadContext to setup any scope that is necessary ; different work is done depending on the requirements of method being invoked .
Some example call configurations are FrameFullScopeFull ( meaning it needs a frame and a scope ) and FrameNoneScopeNone ( meaning it needs neither ) .
We have n’t discussed the concept of ‘ frame ’ , however it basically represents the invocation of a method in a certain context : the call frame .
It keeps track of information that allows Ruby to manage the call stack beyond the scope , which we previously discussed .
org.jruby.compiler.ASTCompiler -
The ASTCompiler knows specifically how to traverse the AST , and how to then consult with other objects to translate it into an alternate representation .
To handle the actual bytecode generation , the ASTCompiler hands responsibility off to the bytecode generating parts .
The ASMCompiler handles the busy work of setting up the compiler hierarchy when traversing method entry / exit , closures , etc .
org.jruby.compiler.ScriptCompiler -
The ScriptCompiler interface defines the high - level hooks into the underlying bytecode generation process used by the ASTCompiler .
The sole implementation of this API currently is StandardASMCompiler , which as you could guess is backed by the ASM bytecode library
This class will create “ sub - compilers ” that know how to deal with the recursive nature of the compilation process .
org.jruby.compiler.impl.BodyCompiler - BodyCompilers are the ‘ sub - compilers ’ I just mentioned .
Specifically , each BodyCompiler deals with blocks of code that may carry their own scope / set - of - variables ( good thing we already discussed scope ! ) .
Here is the current class - hierarchy of body compilers :
The two primary categories are “ root - scoped ” and “ child - scoped ” .
In our scope discussion , we called these two scenarios “ local ” and “ block ” respectively .
Here is the root - scope javadoc : 1 /** 2 * Behaviors common to all " root - scoped " bodies are encapsulated in this class .
3 * " Root - scoped " refers to any method body which does not inherit a containing 4 * variable scope .
This includes method bodies and class bodies .
5 */
org.jruby.compiler.VariableCompiler -
The variable compiler API knows how to generate bytecode for loading and storing variable values from the Ruby runtime .
Body compilers create variable compilers appropriate for their scope .
Certain scope rules allow for certain optimizations which will be described below .
org.jruby.compiler.InvocationCompiler -
The invocation compiler is a component that knows how to generate bytecode for invoking methods on Ruby objects in the Java memory space .
All body compilers have these .
This will be described in more detail below .
org.jruby.compiler.CacheCompiler -
Compiler that can translate certain references in the Java bytecode into quick lookups on the AbstractScript .
RuntimeCache object , rather than having to do full lookups into the Ruby runtime ( for methods , fixnums , etc ) .
This allows the JVM more opportunities for optimization via inlining and other good stuff .
org.jruby.compiler.impl.SkinnyMethodAdapter -
Delegating implementation of the ASM MethodVisitor interface that has several convenience methods for making typed bytecode calls ; this makes the code that is generating bytecode much easier to trace through than it otherwise would be ( not as easy as Bitescript , but we ca n’t always be idealists ) .
Here is another view of these elements , roughly categorized by responsibility , showing some interactions :
( This is only one of many ways to show the interactions at this level , however it should give you some idea of the segregation of these components by responsibility )
The AST analysis components work with the bytecode generation libraries to recursively build up a representation of the algorithm .
In the process , the bytecode generation libraries are going to “ wire in ” to the bytecode calls into several JRuby runtime libraries , including many we ’ve already seen , such as the ThreadContext , the scope objects , and a bunch of other helper libraries that are implemented as statics everywhere .
The Nature of the Generated Code
As with everything in JRuby , there are all kinds of special fast - path hooks built into place that complicate the code for quick scanning , however we can talk about the “ general ” case first , and work our way into the special cases .
With our previous code walkthroughs , we saw that the interpreted AST code performed the invocation using a combination of recursive node traversal and invocations of calls into the ThreadContext to manage and lookup scoped variables ( creating scopes , storing values , etc ) .
The generated code often stores and retrieves variable values the same way as we have already discussed - via collaborative lookups on the current dynamic scope .
In other words , let ’s say we have this method :
1 a = 5 2 b = a
At this point , it ’s going to be easier for me to write pseudo - Java - code to express what the generated code could do to solve certain problems .
Remember that JRuby is generating Java bytecode to effectively do the same thing I ’m doing here .
The pseudo - Java for this particular example could look something like this :
1 ThreadContext . getCurrentScope ( ) . setValue ( " a " , new RubyFixnum ( 5 ) ) ; 2 ThreadContext . getCurrentScope ( ) . setValue ( " b " ) , ThreadContext . getCurrentScope ( ) . getValue ( " a " ) ) ;
Now , I took several liberties with this code to make it easier to read ( this is n’t valid code ) , but it should look a lot like the API we discussed previously in the scope article .
In fact , this is the general idea of the code that is generated in many cases by JRuby .
It gets more complicated than this , obviously , but this shows the most naive implementation of the JIT compiler - basically : turn the steps taken at runtime by Ruby into hard - wired Java .
If we start poking through the various compilers , we ’ll see that they often make extensive use of the Ruby libraries that the AST uses ( as we would expect ) .
Here is an example from the HeapBasedVariableCompiler.assignLocalVariable ( int index ) method ( we ’ll analyze the variable compilers more deeply below ) :
1 method .
aload ( methodCompiler . getDynamicScopeIndex ( ) ) ; 2 method . swap ( ) ; 3 method .
invokevirtual ( p ( DynamicScope . class ) , " setValueZeroDepthZero " , sig ( IRubyObject .
class , params ( IRubyObject . class ) ) ) ;
In this case , “ method ” is a SkinnyMethodAdapter object as described above .
This method is telling the current enclosing Java method to load the DynamicScope object from the local variable table , swap the “ value to set ” back onto the top of the stack , and then invoke the “ setValueZeroDepthZero ” method on it ( which is a hardwired method for setting the variable at position 0 , depth 0 with a value ) .
That means that the DynamicScope variable has to be somewhere on the local variable stack ( we ’ll see how below ) , but beyond that it ’s fairly straightforward ( as these things go , anyway ) .
Stack vs. Heap
All of this talk about DynamicScope and looking up variables is a bit over - simplified .
The JRuby JIT compiler has support hard - wired into it for dealing with variables exclusively on the local stack .
This is provided via the StackBasedVariableCompiler ( you can see the variable compiler hierarchy here ) .
The various body compilers ( which , if you recall , represent methods , classes , blocks , and so forth ) checks with the associated ASTInspector .
If the inspector says that there is no special use of closures or scope - aware method calls , the scope will then create a special stack - based variable compiler .
This stack - based variable management is a pretty significant optimization .
Java is much more efficient when dealing with stack - based variables as opposed to heap references , stack memory access is bound to be faster .
In interpreted JRuby execution mode there is no such thing as a stack - based Ruby variable ; all of the variable tracking is synthesized by the JRuby runtime via use of the Java heap and the scope objects we previously discussed .
Here is what the local - variable assignment looks like for the stack - based variable compiler :
1 method .
astore ( baseVariableIndex + index ) ;
We ’ve dropped the DynamicScope lookup , not to mention the invokeVirtual on dynamic scope .
In this particular scenario , we have entirely bypassed the JRuby libraries altogether , and are simply using native Java stack to track the Ruby object / value instead .
In this particular scenario , JRuby has managed to convert an operation into the direct Java counterpart , with no compromises .
That is , of course , lightning fast variable assignment ( much faster than several hops through methods in the DynamicScope , and doing in - heap array lookups , etc ) .
One of the things that the VariableCompilers are responsible for is setting up variables at the start of a method or closure .
There are a number of methods on the VariableCompiler API that are consulted at the introduction of these top - level elements - here are three of those elements :
1 public void beginMethod ( CompilerCallback argsCallback , StaticScope scope ) ; 2 public void beginClass ( CompilerCallback body Prep , StaticScope scope ) ; 3 public void beginClosure ( CompilerCallback argsCallback , StaticScope scope ) ;
The HeapBasedVariableCompiler is going to get all of the lookup objects it needs ( most notably , the DynamicScope ) and stuff them into the method as local variables .
More concretely , at the top of the heap - generated methods in JRuby , the bytecode generated by ‘ beginMethod ’ looks something like this :
1 public IRubyObject __file__ ( ThreadContext ctx , IRubyObject self , [... ] )
{ 2 DynamicScope scope = ctx . getCurrentScope ( ) ; 3 // actual algorithm goes here 4 }
( I feel the need to re-stress that this Java code is my extrapolation of the compiled bytecode - JRuby does not currently actually generate Java source , and instead has the “ luxury ” of dealing with Java bytecode variable indexes and the like .
If you were to decompile the bytecode , it might look a little something like this , however . )
There are , of course , other things that the heap - based variable compiler may choose to do at this point to optimize itself , but those specifics are n’t particularly relevant to the idea .
If you go back to our “ a=5 ; b=a ” example , you ’ll see that the pseudo - Java can then simply reference ‘ scope ’ , as opposed to calling ctx.getCurrentScope ( ) every time .
On the other side of the fence , the StackBasedVariableCompiler ( which knows it can deal with variables entirely on the Java stack ) , loops over all of the variables and declares them at the top of the method , assigning them to JRuby ‘ nil ’ .
In this example , if the method is going to deal with three variables ( we ’ll call them ‘ a ’ , ‘ b ’ , and ‘ c ’ ) , then the stack - based compiler would start the method like this :
1 public IRubyObject __file__ ( ThreadContext ctx , IRubyObject self , [... ] ) { 2
Object a = ruby .
getNil ( ) ; 3 Object b = ruby .
getNil ( ) ; 4 Object c = ruby .
getNil ( ) ; 5 // actual algorithm goes here 6 }
This allows the subsequent code to just deal with variable declaration implicitly , just like Ruby does - since the variables are already on the Java stack , they can simply be blindly assigned a value by the rest of the native bytecode - so going back to our ‘ a=5 ; b=a ’ example , it is not unreasonable to consider JRuby generating another set of lines that looks like this :
1 a = new RubyFixnum ( 5 ) ; 2 b = a ;
Not too shabby !
In reality , JRuby can optimize even further than this ( like dealing with fixnums smarter than that ) , but that ’s beyond this discussion .
Invocation Compiler
The InvocationCompiler is responsible for create bytecode that can invoke another method .
In the current JDK world , that means loading the appropriate variables on the stack to then invoke the method “ IRubyObject.callMethod ( … ) ” on the “ receiver ” object .
In other words , if the Ruby code was :
1 a . do_something
The pseudo - Java code we want to generate would look something like this :
1 IRubyObject a = // ... ( from somewhere ) 2 IRubyObject result = new NormalCachingCallSite ( " do_something " ) . call ( a ) ;
Of course , this is a major simplification of the actual call - site management provided by the invocation compiler , and all of this actually implemented in scary bytecode , but you get the idea .
From here , the Ruby runtime takes over the method invocation , which goes through the DynamicMethod dispatching we ’ve previously discussed .
In that process , it may compile more code and create more class - files , but they are effectively disconnected from each other via the call - site indirection through the Ruby runtime method dispatching .
In the “ amazing future ” we have the concept of “ invokedynamic ” , which is a Java 7 bytecode instruction that allows for invocations to dynamically - generated methods in the Java space , allowing a language like Ruby to hook into the JVM ’s method dispatching , in turn allowing method dispatching in the JIT - compiled code to be fully optimized .
Charlie Nutter has described this far better than I can , and his article ties in nicely with the method dispatching I previously discussed .
How JIT Participates
The JITCompiler class effectively has to ‘ jump in the middle ’ of this compilation routine - taking a single Ruby method and translating it into an entire JIT - compiled class .
The class JITClassGenerator ( an inner-class to JITCompiler ) is responsible for handling this special scenario .
Remember , we already have all of these concepts built for compiling arbitrary scripts - the ASTCompiler and ScriptCompiler are fully capable of handling the introduction of a method .
Therefore , most of the work actually happens via the ScriptCompiler .
Where - as the general compilation will make calls to “ compileRoot ” or “ startRoot ” - the JIT process makes calls to “ startFileMethod ” .
The primary distinction between the two invocations is described in the ScriptCompiler Javadocs :
1 /** 2 * Begin compilation for the root of a script named __file__ .
3 * 4 * @param args Arguments to the script , as passed via jitted wrappers 5 * @param scope The StaticScope for the script 6 * @param inspector
The ASTInspector for the nodes for the script 7 * @return A new BodyCompiler for the body of the script 8 */ 9 public BodyCompiler startFileMethod ( CompilerCallback args , StaticScope scope , ASTInspector inspector ) ; 10 11 /** 12 * Begin compilation for a the root of a script .
This differs from method compilation 13 * in that it does n't do specific - arity logic , nor does it require argument processing .
14 * 15 * @param javaName
The outward user - readable name of the method .
A unique name will be generated based on this .
16 * @param arity
The arity of the method 's argument list 17 * @param localVarCount
The number of local variables that will be used by the method .
18 * @return An Object that represents the method within this compiler .
Used in calls to 19 * endMethod once compilation for this method is completed .
20 */ 21 public BodyCompiler startRoot ( String rubyName , String javaName , StaticScope scope , ASTInspector inspector ) ;
Basically , startFileMethod performs a special pre-configuration on the generated class to make is self - sufficient for this single method , and entirely invokable through the ‘ Script.run ’ API .
The JITClassGenerator is going to exercise the ASTInspector on the top - level of the method ( just like the ASTCompiler would when it hits a method ) , and is going to then pass all of that information into the ScriptCompiler for construction .
From that point forward , the method is digested as it normally would be by the recursive inspection / compilation process .
Compiler Cookbook
At this point in this article , the general concepts have been thoroughly hashed out , but we ’re simply missing some examples of what Java is actually built when certain scenarios are hit .
So let ’s walk through some .
I ’m going to use the same scheme from above , describing at a high - level the code that JRuby generates , and then possibly using pseudo - Java examples .
General AST Class
We ’ve talked about it quite a bit already , but to cement things - if you have a ‘ test.rb ’ script and you compile it , you ’re going to get back a class representing that script .
The most natural Java code representation looks something like this :
1 public class test extends org .
jruby .
ast .
executable .
AbstractScript { // implements Script indirectly 2 public test () { 3 // some basic initialization here 4 } 5 public IRubyObject __file__ (... ) { 6 // top - level script code here 7 } 8 }
There is , of course , other stuff that goes on .
But that ’s the general ‘ framework ’ in which the rest of the generated code works .
Creating a Method
Generally speaking , Ruby methods are translated into Java methods .
However , where - as the Ruby methods are typically associated with some parent class , in Java they are simply on the Script - class for which they are compiled .
When a method is hit , Ruby combines all of the stuff we previously discussed to create that method .
Let ’s consider this Ruby script :
1 def my_method 2 a = 5 3 b = a 4 end 5 6 my_method
JRuby is going to declare the method , embed the logic , and then invoke it .
In this particular case , JRuby will be able to use stack - based variables .
Let ’s build on our previous class ( trimming some of the irrelevant bulk ) :
1 class test extends AbstractScript { 2 @JRubyMethod ( name = " my_method " , frame = true , ...) 3 // not the actual generated method name , but close .
4 public IRubyObject RUBY$my_method ( ThreadContext ctx , IRubyObject self ) { 5 Ruby r = ctx .
getRuntime ( ) ; 6 Object a = r . getNil ( ) ; 7 Object b = r . getNil ( ) ; 8 a = RubyFixnum . five ; 9 b = a ; 10 return b ; 11 } 12 13 public IRubyObject __file__ ( ThreadContext ctx , IRubyObject self ) { 14 RuntimeHelpers . def ( ctx , self , this , " my_method " , " RUBY$my_method " , new String [ ] { " a " , " b " } , ... ) ; 15 // in reality , this would be cached by the CacheCompiler , but for ease - of - reading , I 'm creating a new one here .
16 return new VariableCachingCallSite ( " my_method " ) . call ( ctx , self , self ) ; 17 } 18 }
Wow , a lot going on here - let ’s break it down .
First , we create a Java method as a peer to a Ruby method .
We also assign an annotation to it so it can be tracked in a number of ways by the running system .
The method name is generated ; I ’ve simplified it slightly here , but you get the idea .
Then , using the logic we ’ve discussed previously regarding the variable management , our method body is compiled and has a rough sketch of what we did with A and B in the ruby implementation .
The file method ( which represents the invokable part of the script ) is created , and is invokable through the Script API
method ( which represents the invokable part of the script ) is created , and is invokable through the Script API file declares our method first .
It uses a static call to RuntimeHelpers to do this , which basically looks up the class , and stuffs in a new DynamicMethod object into the RubyClass definition that can call into this script .
( Keep in mind in the JIT scenario , this ‘ declaration ’ is skipped , and instead the body of the method is compiled into the file method , which is then referenced inside a JittedMethod object ) .
declares our method first .

( Keep in mind in the JIT scenario , this ‘ declaration ’ is skipped , and instead the body of the method is compiled into the method , which is then referenced inside a JittedMethod object ) .
Next , we get a handle on a CallSite object , and then call invoke on it .
From here , Ruby is going to wind back through the call - process to our compiled method object we just put in the RubyClass .
Naively , this invocation can use reflection to make the call .
However , remember from the first discussion that call - site objects often result in pre-compiled “ mini- classes ” that have a single purpose - calling the method on an object .
These mini-classes can often be jitted out of the execution , making our indirect call - site invocation nearly as fast as a direct method call - cool !
Creating a Class
Class creation in Ruby scripts is not necessarily creation ( it could be augmentation / modification ) .
As such , creating a Java Class is not actually what needs to be done in this case .
Besides , even if the class is created in a compiled script , it still needs to be in the JRuby class namespace so that non-compiled code can reference it .
Therefore , a method is created that can perform the class construction .
Here ’s a basic modification of our example :
1 class MyClass 2 def my_method 3 a = 5 4 b = a 5 end 6 end 7 8 x = MyClass . new 9 x . my_method
Our example grows again in this case :
1 class test extends AbstractScript { 2 public RUBY $ MyClass ( ThreadContext ctx , IRubyObject self ) { 3 RubyModule m = RuntimeHelpers .
prepareClassNamespace ( ctx , self ) ; 4 RubyClass cls = m .
defineOrGetClassUnder ( " MyClass " , null ) ; 5 LocalStaticScope scope = new LocalStaticScope (... ) ; // for the class 6 ctx .
preCompiledClass ( scope , ... ) ; 7 try { 8 RuntimeHelpers . def ( ctx , self , this , " my_method " , " RUBY$my_method " , new String [ ] { " a " , " b " } ) ; 9 } 10 finally { 11 ctx .
postCompiledClass ( ) ; 12 } 13 } 14 15 @JRubyMethod ( name = " my_method " , frame = true , ... ) 16 // not the actual generated method name , but close .
17 public IRubyObject RUBY$my_method ( ThreadContext ctx , IRubyObject self ) { 18 Ruby r = ctx .
getRuntime ( ) ; 19 Object a = r . getNil ( ) ; 20 Object b = r . getNil ( ) ; 21 a = RubyFixnum . five ; 22 b = a ; 23 return b ; 24 } 25 26 public IRubyObject __file__ ( ThreadContext ctx , IRubyObject self ) { 27 DynamicScope scope = ctx . getCurrentScope ( ) ; 28 RubyClass cls = RUBY $ MyClass ( ctx , self ) ; // invoke the class - creation method .
29 // in reality , this would be cached by the CacheCompiler , but for ease - of - reading , I 'm creating a new one here .
30 scope .
setValue ( " x " , new NormalCachingCallSite ( " new " ) . call ( ctx , self , cls ) ) ; 31 return new NormalCachingCallSite ( " my_method " ) . call ( ctx , self , scope .
getValue ( " x " ) ) ; 32 } 33 }
So what ’s changed since our basic method - only example ?
Well , the generated “ my_method ” is identical .
However , we now have a method to create the class as well .
Let ’s analyze this method :
First , given the current context , find the appropriate RubyModule .
Ask the module to get or define the class with the given name ( remember , we could be updating an existing class .
Adjust the ThreadContext to have the class as the primary scope .
Define the method ( which will be defined on the current class in scope ) .
Reset the ThreadContext
If we look at our file method , you ’ll see the first thing it does this time is call this “ class constructor ” .
Note also that the file method is now using heap - based variable management because the AST has classes mixed in , causing the inspector to throw out stack - based management due to the risk of leaky vars .
After calling the construct method , the method then invokes setValue for the current scope , passing in the result of calling ‘ new ’ on the new class .
Then , the invocation of “ my_method ” is performed on the object held in “ x ” on the scope .
Other scenarios are just extensions of all of these same ideas .
Future Plans
As fancy as this current compiler architecture is , the JRuby team is not sitting still .
Currently in JRuby master , there is a significant effort underway to reimagine the underlying compilation process .
One of the problems with the current approach is that the AST does not lend itself well to analysis and optimization .
The current work underway derives a new intermediate representation from the AST , providing an entirely separate object hierarchy .
This new representation can then be shuffled and reorganized ; patterns can be derived and compressed , and all sorts of other gooey goodness can be found .
The IR is designed to be analyzed by the compiler ; something that could never be said for the AST .
From a component standpoint , the plan ( as best as I have derived ) is to replace the true “ compiler ” component as described above , allowing the higher - level constructs that embed that compiler into the JIT process , leaving the rest of the infrastructure around it ( like the JITCompiler class ) mostly unchanged .
In other words , much of the existing ASTInspector / ASTCompiler goes away , in favor of something that is more compiler - friendly - an IR scanner .
This new IR code structure will bring the JRuby JIT one step closer to what is possible in the Java JIT , where optimizations can be made by analyzing the code structure ; entire branches of code ( and the associated conditions ) can be eliminated , loops can be optimized , etc .
Of course , the options for what can be optimized in a Ruby program are often different than Java - some of the language differences could be advantageous for optimization , and some may cause serious limitations - time will tell , but I have confidence it will be interesting to see the results .
Nevertheless , the work is fairly new on this , and I ’d hate to spend too much time analyzing and documenting a work in progress , but it is something to revisit in a few weeks / months .
At a minimum , I suggest following the JRuby committer blogs ( for a start : Charlie Nutter , Tom Enebo , Nick Sieger ) .
Conclusion
This article was by far the longest yet , coming in well over 6000 words ( and that means if you ’ve read this far you are a patient , patient individual ) .
Short of making this a “ two - parter ” , I ’m not sure how I could have shortened it and truly hit the hotspots of the compilation process in Ruby ; however I do think my next exploration might be a touch more ‘ focused ’ .
I have n’t entirely decided yet what ’s on the chopping block next for these JRuby internals articles , but I have a couple ideas ; and of course , I ’m always taking input at My Contact Page .
Stay tuned .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Sarah Palin , last year ’s Republican vice - presidential candidate who became a figure of global fascination , is to release her memoir just four months after her book deal was announced .
Alaska Governor Sarah Palin is pictured while serving hot dogs at the annual Governor 's Picnic in Fairbanks , Alaska , July 26 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Nathaniel Wilder
Publisher HarperCollins said Palin ’s memoir , titled “ Going Rogue : An American Life ” , would be published on November 17 after originally being scheduled for release in spring 2010 .
The book will have a large first printing of 1.5 million copies , according to a statement from HarperCollins , a unit of Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp .
Senator Edward Kennedy ’s memoir “ True Compass ” , published soon after his August 25 death , also had an initial print run of 1.5 million hardcover copies .
Palin , 45 , the brash and deeply conservative former governor of Alaska , burst onto the U.S. and international scene last year when Republican presidential nominee Senator John McCain picked her as his running mate in the 2008 election campaign .
She has not disclosed how much she would be paid by the publisher for her memoir .
At the time the book deal was announced , Palin said in a interview published in Alaska ’s Anchorage Daily News that it would be good to have an “ unfiltered forum ” as “ there have been so many things written and said through mainstream media that have not been accurate . ”
During the electoral campaign she was criticized for being inexperienced and for describing herself as a “ hockey mom ” , joking that the difference between a hockey mom and a pitbull was lipstick .
The former beauty queen was ridiculed for saying her foreign policy experience was bolstered by Alaska ’s proximity to Russia across the Bering Strait .
Her family also came under scrutiny when her 18 - year - old unwed daughter Bristol had a baby .
Palin abruptly resigned as Alaska ’s governor in July , citing a variety of reasons for quitting - the burden of fighting nearly two dozen ethic charges which she had dismissed as “ frivolous ” , her desire to avoid being perceived as a powerless “ lame - duck ” governor , and a “ higher calling ” , among others .
A new value - added tax ( VAT ) is " on the table " to help the U.S. address its fiscal liabilities , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) said Monday night .
Pelosi , appearing on PBS's " The Charlie Rose Show " asserted that " it 's fair to look at " the VAT as part of an overhaul of the nation 's tax code .
" I would say , Put everything on the table and subject it to the scrutiny that it deserves , " Pelosi told Rose when asked if the VAT has any appeal to her .
The VAT is a tax on manufacturers at each stage of production on the amount of value an additional producer adds to a product .
Pelosi argued that the VAT would level the playing field between U.S. and foreign manufacturers , the latter of which do not have pension and healthcare costs included in the price of their goods because their governments provide those services , financed by similar taxes .
" They get a tax off of that and they use that money to pay the healthcare for their own workers , " Pelosi said , using the example of auto manufacturers .
" So their cars coming into our country do n't have a healthcare component cost .
" Somewhere along the way , a value - added tax plays into this .
Of course , we want to take down the healthcare cost , that 's one part of it , " the Speaker added .
" But in the scheme of things , I think it 's fair look at a value - added tax as well . "
Pelosi said that any new taxes would come after the Congress finishes the healthcare debate consuming most lawmakers ' time , and that it may come as part of a larger overhaul to the tax code .
The Speaker also emphasized that any reworking of the tax code would not result in an increase in taxes on middle - class Americans .

BERLIN , Oct 10 ( Reuters ) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday criticised the efforts of Google Inc GOOG.
O to build a massive digital library , saying the Internet should not be exempt from copyright laws .
In her weekly video podcast , before Tuesday ’s opening of the Frankfurt Book Fair , Merkel appealed for more international cooperation on copyright protection and said her government opposed Google ’s drive to scan libraries full of books .
“ The German government has a clear position : copyrights have to be protected in the Internet , ” Merkel said , adding there are “ considerable dangers ” for copyright protection in the Internet .
“ That ’s why we reject the scanning in of books without any copyright protection -- like Google is doing .
The government places a lot of weight on this position on copyrights to protect writers in Germany . ”
Google has already digitised 10 million books .
Merkel , who will open the world ’s largest book fair in Germany ’s financial capital , said there was a need to discuss the issue in greater detail in international institutions .
She did not , however , offer any concrete solutions .
Google ’s plan to create a massive digital library has been praised for bringing broad access to books but has also been criticised on antitrust , copyright and privacy grounds .
In New York , a judge said on Wednesday that changes to a settlement that would allow Google to put millions of books online should be presented in court by Nov. 9 .
The settlement is an effort to resolve a 2005 lawsuit brought by the Authors Guild and others against Google ’s effort to scan libraries full of books .
In that suit , authors and publishers had accused Google of copyright infringement .
Under the terms of the original settlement , Google would pay $ 125 million to create a Book Rights Registry .
Authors and publishers could register works there and be paid for books and other publications that the search giant would put online .
German book publishers are up in arms about the deal , and on Sept. 24 they criticised European regulators for failing to take a stand against the settlement .
Also last month , French publishing house La Martiniere , the French Publishers ’ Association and authors ’ group SGDL asked a Paris court to fine Google 15 million euros ( $ 22 million ) and 100,000 euros for each day it continued to violate copyright by digitising their books .

An underground cartoonist whose intimate knowledge of LSD inspired his wild creations and who elevated the phrase " Keep on Truckin ' " to the level of an American institution may not be the obvious candidate to draw a comic book version of the Book of Genesis .
But then nothing Robert Crumb has done has been obvious .
In the 1960s , he came to pre-eminence in alternative circles for his sexually explicit and bizarre comic characters Fritz the Cat and Mr Natural .
His latest venture , five years in the crafting , is an illustrated rendering of the first 50 chapters of the Bible .
" Nothing left out ! " the book boasts on its cover , and certainly , every word of Genesis is faithfully recorded .
Nor are there embellishments - Crumb had no need of them , given that Genesis 's ample quotient of murder , rape and incest gave plenty for the darker side of his art to dwell on .
But the book does carry the warning " adult supervision recommended for minors " .
On Saturday all the original black - and - white drawings that have been packed into 201 pages will go on display at the Hammer museum in Los Angeles , before embarking on a nationwide tour .
The project has emerged out of Crumb 's peculiarly divided background .
His father , a former marine , was an atheist and his home secular , but the young Crumb was sent to Catholic school in order to receive a disciplined education .
" I do n't believe it 's the word of God , " he told Associated Press , referring to the Bible .
" At the same time , I think the stories are very powerful .
I 'm not out to ridicule them or belittle them . "
Crumb , who lives a reclusive existence in the south of France , has said that the book took so much out of him he is now in recovery .
Asked about his next project , he replied : " I guess next I 'll tackle the Qur'an .
See how that goes over . "

According to reports from Afghanistan , New York Times reporter Stephen Farrell and his driver / interpreter have been kidnapped while attempting to cover the story of the NATO airstrike on the two Taliban - hijacked tankers in Kunduz , Afghanistan .
The local Afghan press is reporting that a reporter has been kidnapped , although Farrell was not directly named ; however , the international press and the wires services have been silent on this issue .
Multiple sources in Afghanistan tell me that The New York Times is attempting to suppress the reporting on Farrell 's kidnapping .
The New York Times did the same thing when journalist David Rohde was kidnapped in eastern Afghanistan late last year .
Rohde escaped from a Haqqani Network compound in North Waziristan earlier this year .
While Rohde 's kidnapping was not publicized , his escape was the subject of abundant reporting .

It is easy to be duped into following this type of ' logic . '

The lens of the human eye , in addition to being complex and facinating , is not something that a dollar amount can be assigned to .
The human ear , reduced to being described as ' the sound device , ' being ripped off would be more painful than some people could endure .

Beer review of Guinness 250 Anniversary Stout
Guinness 250 Anniversary Stout
Beer Reviews / Food & Drink Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
Arthur Guinness signed the lease for his famous brewery at St. James 's Gate way back in 1759 , and they 've been cranking out the beloved beer ever since .
They are celebrating that longevity this year by releasing a special 250th Anniversary Stout .
It 's only a limited release , so there 's not the whole new Coke versus old Coke controversy to worry the traditionalists .
The Black Stuff will still be offered , with any luck , forevermore .
My only quibble , and it 's slight , is why bother tinkering with the stout recipe for this release ?
That has proven itself to be nearly perfected – just ask any self - respecting Irishman .
Besides , one of the first beers they released was an ale .
It would have made more sense to celebrate by offering that again .
Or , the other early offering , a porter .
The good news is , the Anniversary Stout is not at all bad .
If it were anybody but Guinness brewing it , it would be a decent addition to the stout options on the shelf .
But , it would never do as a replacement for their original stout – not even the Guinness Draught version that we have to settle for in the States .
The first thing to note is that this beer is n't ' nitrogenated ' like the Draught .
No need to bother with the fancy pours , or look for the beautiful tumbling , tiny bubbles .
This stout is just typically carbonated and pours like any other beer .
The head is still slightly off - white , but the larger bubbles give it a less - creamy look .
Other than that , the appearance is much the same .
The aroma , too , is similar , except for the surprise introduction of a few extra hops .
Those hops are most evident in the flavor .
This 250 version has a crisp little edge that the original lacks .
Most of the rest of the old Guinness flavors are still in this thing , but those extra hops give it a refreshing bite and balance out some of the malt .
There 's a lighter feel , despite there being a touch more alcohol .
If you equate smoothness with creaminess , then this version sacrifices a bit of that for what they are calling the extra ' zing ' of the hops .
Still , it 's a fine beer that goes down especially well in the summer .
Just different enough to call it special , but familiar enough to keep the old Guinness drinkers happy .
Most people would never think the original stout is heavy , even though something about it tends to scare some people .
The color , maybe , but probably just ignorance .
Just walk into any Irish pub and it's obvious that Guinness is a session beer .
This one is even more of the same in that regard .
Neither gets in the way of any food you may want to nibble on during your session , but Guinness stout is all about getting plenty of beer down your neck .
It 's for sitting about with the old friends and telling the stories , then singing along when the songs start .
It 's a good times , fun - in - the - pub style beer .
The beer snobs will tell you there are better tasting , better this , better that , style beers out there .
Non -beer drinkers will still be afraid of the stouts , and stick to their watery rubbish .
There are beers that pair much more precisely with particular food but , for just hanging out with friends or making new ones , Guinness is the stuff .
So , the Anniversary Stout is certainly worth a go .
If you 're an old , dyed - in - the - wool Guinness drinker , it wo n't make you want to switch , but you 'll like it well enough .
If you 're new to Guinness and have been leary of it till now , or were one of the ones who thought that the extra stout version was what everybody was on about all this time , this might be the time to give it a try .
The extra hops might appeal to you .
For me , the 250 is just not different enough from the original .
If I want a Guinness , the original is still the one I 'm going to grab every time .
I 'm just hoping for the 251st anniversary , they come out with a nice , proper Irish ale .
Then , it might be time to celebrate .
Chris Cleave has been a hands - on father since his children were born , but as a man he has often felt like an outsider at the nursery or school gates .
Why do men feel unable to take on an equal role in childcare ?
When our first child was born , I vowed to spearhead a movement of fathers who would take an equal share in bringing up children , participating in schooling , and generally being awesome .
As my wife pointed out at the time , a woman will just do something , whereas a man must spearhead a movement .
According to the Fatherhood Institute , 82 % of full - time , working dads say they 'd like to do more childcare .
But it 's not easy .
My own retreat from spearhead to spear butt is instructive .
At first , as I was a writer ( read " unemployed " ) , I looked after our firstborn while my wife worked .
By the second month of this arrangement , I had become exhausted and gained undying respect for full - time parents , and so a childminder was found .
We slowly figured out that she was just parking the children in front of the television set , so we tried a nursery .
The nursery staff were all moonstruck , staff turnover was rapid , and I got weirded - out that the mums at the nursery gate would n't acknowledge my presence .
The place was so ditzily feminine that we did n't want our boy there .
So we found another nursery .
It was exactly the same , only pinker .
When our second child was born , my wife went part - time .
Shortly afterwards we were amazed to discover that a part - time nanny costs roughly the same as two nursery places .
We hired a wonderful nanny , and she was not a man .
My defeat had become a rout .
Now we have three children and I have a flexible job that lets me spend a good number of hours with them , but it 's hardly the fatherhood revolution I envisaged .
In an effort to redeem myself , I thought about volunteering as a class rep at our child 's school .
I even got as far as attending a fact - finding meeting .
The teacher looked directly at the three mothers and one father ( me ) therein assembled and said brightly : " OK , mums , let 's get started ! "
Now my wife is a class rep , and I get to read her newsletters .
Siân Rowland , the former deputy head of a primary school who now coordinates a healthy schools programme in south - west London , acknowledges that even great schools are not necessarily set up to involve fathers .
" Dads are disenfranchised , " she says .
" There 's a culture of ' Take your book home and read it to Mummy ' .
You have to be quite delicate , because not every family has a male role model in it .
So we try to get male role models in , because otherwise the only people kids see reading , writing , and eating carrots and hummus , are women . "
But this is where another set of problems begins .
In the aftermath of the Soham murders in 2002 , the level of public suspicion against those – especially men – who come into contact with children prompted the government 's new vetting scheme , which is likely to require any adult spending more than one day a month with children to register with the Independent Safeguarding Authority .
The general atmosphere of suspicion may lead to men in particular being put off from volunteering .
There is certainly a shortage of men lining up to help out .
" You end up wheeling in the local vicar , " says Rowland , " just so the kids can watch a man reading a book .
We 're so paranoid about paedophilia and the safety of children that perhaps we 're nervous of bringing in men .
A biological dad might just scrape the grade , but if it 's a stepdad or an uncle , people get paranoid . "
Less dramatic than the paranoia , but no less insidious , is a feeling harboured by many that there is something effeminate , and effeminising , about fathers who seek to develop caring relationships with their children .
Responding to an article I wrote for the Guardian a couple of years ago , arguing that dads should get more involved , one man wrote : " Over 30 years ago , I changed nappies , nestled infant heads against my breast while lightly pulling on a bottle , talced pink bums and bathed soiled infants .
Now as I contemplate my son's trajectory I wonder if I might not have done better to remain aloof , swoop down upon him when he turned 12 and drag him into the forest to make his first kill and smear his face with blood .
It is conceivable that if sons do need fathers , it is because they are not mothers . "
Suspicion and traditionalist views of fatherhood , it seems , conspire to prevent fathers from getting more involved with their children , at home and at school .
On top of these are the economic factors that operate to keep fathers in work and force mothers out .
Rob Williams , the chief executive of the Fatherhood Institute , thinks that parental leave is key .
" Now maternity leave is so much longer than paternity leave , " he says , " it has led to the woman becoming officially viewed as the child carer , which actually gives women less equality in the workplace .
It 's counter - productive .
Before a working couple has children , the woman earns 91 % of the man 's salary .
After kids , it drops to 67 % .
The driver is the leave system , which makes a break in women 's careers but not in men's .
The leave system itself is deepening gender inequality .
The rational decision for any couple is for the mother to stop work and be the carer .
This will be true until maternity leave and paternity leave are more equal . "
The inequality of the leave system is arguably the sign of the government 's failure to make the imaginative leap between its long - held policy of getting more mothers into work with its corollary : getting more fathers involved with childcare .
And if that is bad news for fathers who want to look after their children , then surely it is equally bad news for mothers who want or need to work – at over 60 % , the substantial majority .
Indeed , the closer one looks at how unfair the system is to fathers , the more one realises how tough it is on mothers .
In the eyes of modern Britain , mothers seem able to do no right .
A study published to fanfares last week found a very modest statistical correlation between mothers working and their kids imbibing fizzy pop and spending time in front of the TV .
Naturally , the media sexed it up into Mammageddon .
" Working mothers ' children unfit " was BBC Online 's headline .
The same day 's BBC News at Ten delivered a damning verdict on the children of working mums : they were sitting in front of the TV , eating too much and doing too little .
Why , in 2009 , was our nation 's mouthpiece scolding mums and ignoring the role of dads ?
Working mums see this stuff and are invited to feel guilty .
They also look at their non-working or part - time peers volunteering as school helpers and class reps , and maybe feel even more guilty .
That 's right , working ladies of Britain : now you 're not only going home to your fat children , but also you 're going to have to read about what your fat children did at school in a newsletter produced by women with thin children who never watch TV or drink fluid with bubbles in it .
Oh , and full - time mums : despite the fact that you are doing an amazing job and making our schools work for us at the same time , you can feel guilty that you are not fulfilling your career potential or providing a professional female role model for your children .
It seems that the media , the schools , the spectre of paedophilia , the prevalence of absent fathers , the policies of the government and perhaps even our own machismo conspire to prevent dads taking an equal share in bringing up our young children .
Meanwhile , working women are demonised as unfit mothers , while full - time mums are made to feel left - out or unfulfilled .
Is n't modern Britain groovy ?
On the bright side , there 's always the global economic meltdown .
" With the recession , " says Siân Rowland , " we 're starting to see more dads picking up kids at the school gate .
So maybe they 'll start a male gossip revolution and it will change the way dads get involved . "
When I put this to a friend , he suggested that the male gossip revolution will begin on the day that beer is served at the school gate .
Another friend has done the next - best thing .
He has organised a dads ' night for our children 's school , and had the foresight to stage it at the local pub .
Once a month we go along and , while it 's hardly a school governors ' meeting , it 's an informative first step .
It 's here that I 've learned how much more involved fathers would like to be in schools and childcare , and how frustrated both mothers and fathers feel at their exclusion .
Most parents , I think , hope that we are at the start of an era that will be more inclusive of fathers and less judgmental about mothers .
Maybe one day , mums and dads will go to the parents ' meeting – or the pub – together .
Assuming , of course , that a babysitter can be found .
CAIRO , Egypt —
It was graduation night .
Sarah el - Sirgany had just wrapped up her studies at the prestigious American University in Cairo , and she was ready to celebrate with friends .
Sirgany , from a well - to - do Egyptian family , made her way to the center of town , a veil — or hijab — wrapped loosely , yet carefully , around her head .
She walked the gangplank of one of the Nile ’s posh boats and asked the manager of the restaurant inside to lead her to her friends ’ table .
“ The bouncer at the door told me I ca n’t get in , ” she said .
“ Honestly , it was too late into the night to get into an argument .
But it was infuriating .
I just told my friends to come out to meet me . ”
The reason she was denied entry ?
Her veil .
Sirgany had dared step into the battle between Egypt ’s secular past and increasingly religious present .
She had sought entry to a restaurant filled with wine drinking upper - class Egyptians , many of whom still eschew the veil .
This young Egyptian herself exists somewhere in the middle of a growing cultural divide .
She has the money to eat at the high - end restaurants and many of her friends do n’t don the veil .
Increasingly , though , women like Sirgany are finding themselves without a place as the Egyptian upper class fights to keep conservative strains of Islam from gaining access to its social circles .
“ I think certain places want to paint a certain image about their clientele , ” she said , “ and having veiled women inside is seen as a potential contradiction to this image . ”
The trend toward veiling in Egypt began 20 or 30 years ago among Egypt ’s lowest economic rungs .
The reasons for this , say scholars , was varied .
After the fall of Arab nationalism , which reached its peak in the 1950s and ' 60s , many here saw the region ’s culture as a rudderless ship , without clear identity or relation to the West .
So many turned to Islam , rallying around it as a means of creating a unique regional character .
It was also around this time that many women abandoned their traditional roles as homemakers and entered the work force .
Some women took on the veil to maintain a measure of the privacy afforded to them in their past lives as stay - at - home wives .
And wearing a veil also took care of a practical problem for low - income Egyptian women .
“ Some women ca n’t afford 2 million dresses , ” said Isis Nusair , a professor of women ’s studies at Denison University in Ohio , “ and wearing the hijab is cheap . ”
Over the years , the conservative form of Islam that compelled women to wear a veil crept slowly through the socioeconomic ranks .
Estimates are that upwards of 90 percent of Muslim women in Egypt today wear the veil .
And now Egypt ’s elite upper class , the well - traveled sorts who tend to sneer at what they view as a backwards practice , is fighting to keep secularism alive in its ranks .
While some high - end restaurateurs turn veiled women away at the door , they are hardly the only warriors in this cultural skirmish .
Many of the beaches that line Egypt ’s north coast follow similar practices , forbidding veiled women from enjoying their sands .
Some establishments encourage veiled women to visit nearby women - only beaches , where they can lounge and swim under tents that extend far into the Mediterranean .
Even so , not all veils are created equal .
Some establishments will let veiled women enter as long as their veil is considered trendy .
A loose scarf with fashionable clothes might get a pass , while a niqab — the kind of dress that exposes nothing but the eyes — might not be welcome .
The Egyptian government has had mixed reactions to the controversy .
Strictly speaking , it embraces Sharia law as supreme .
As such , it bans all Egyptians from drinking on religious holidays and forbids , absolutely , Egyptians from entering casinos .
But these nods to Egypt ’s Islamic legacy are not without critics , even from within the highest ranks of government .
In 2006 , long - serving Culture Minister Farouk Hosni openly complained about movement toward the veil .
“ There was an age when our mothers went to university and worked without the veil .
It is in that spirit that we grew up .
So why this regression ? ” he said in the controversial interview .
Egypt ’s conservative factions and a number of newspapers lambasted him for months following the comments , keeping alive Egypt ’s scandal of the year .
In this cultural brawl , though , it ’s clear that Islam has the momentum since members of the upper class are increasingly taking on the veil .
But a vocal minority from the upper class is committed to continuing the fight and keeping people like Sirgany out of the bars , restaurants and beaches they consider to be their final bastions of secularism .
" Sorry , but that ’s up to me to decide , not anyone else , " said El Sirgany , discussing where she chooses to spend her evenings .
" If I want to go to a pub with friends or on my own , if I want to drink alcohol while wearing the veil — I do n’t drink by the way — it ’s only up to me .
" People who find a problem with that , really need to get over themselves .
If they ca n’t reconcile their own stereotypes with new realities , then it ’s their problem , not mine . "

After months of internal debate , mounting impatience among U.S. activist groups , and rapidly approaching deadlines in the Sudanese Comprehensive Peace Agreement ( CPA ) , the Obama administration yesterday unveiled its strategy toward Sudan , calling for frank dialogue with the government in Khartoum and promising " calibrated steps to bolster support for positive change and to discourage backsliding . "
The realities of Sudan itself appear to have forced an end , at least for the moment , to protracted internal bickering and deadlock between hard - liners - most notably , U.S. ambassador to the UN Susan Rice - and realists - U.S. special envoy to Sudan General Scott Gration .
Sudan 's national elections are slated for April 2010 .
Less than a year later is a national referendum in which the citizens of southern Sudan will be asked to choose whether to secede .
The new policy officially turns away from isolation and condemnation , reduces ambiguity and potential for misinterpretation of U.S. strategy going forward , and raises confidence that the various factions within the administration ( for now at least ) are working from the same single playbook .
The review endorses a policy based on realism and pragmatic engagement , with strong emphasis on implementation of the North - South Comprehensive Peace Agreement .
It is based on an acknowledgement that to avert the unraveling of the CPA and a potentially destabilizing regional crisis , the United States must maintain a sustained , adult dialogue with the Khartoum government and find common ground with a broader set of multilateral partners .
It openly acknowledges the strong possibility that southern Sudan will secede and the urgency of building a modicum of governing capacity within the southern government .
The strategy places the United States in greater alignment with critical international partners concerned with Sudan - the United Kingdom , the European Union , Canada , France , and key African partners - and opens the way for greater collaboration and consensus building with China and other key global powers .
Lack of consensus within the administration has confused potential partners who have for some time seen the United States policy as hostage to zealous domestic pressures .
Greater alignment with international partners also has the benefit of strengthening the credibility and effectiveness of any pressures the United States might bring to bear .
There are few realistic options left for stronger U.S. " sticks , " particularly if undertaken unilaterally .
A concerted effort by international partners , that builds agreement around redlines and opportunities for targeted pressure may significantly enhance U.S. leverage with key Sudanese actors .
The approach is also far more consistent with President Obama 's preferred policy of engagement with the world 's rogue governments - in Myanmar , North Korea , Syria , Iran - and the desire to create a new dialogue with the world 's Muslim population .
For each of these malgoverned , intractable countries , U.S. domestic campaigners have likened engagement to appeasement or legitimization of the respective regimes , but in each case the urgency of finding a solution has moved the Obama administration to push for frank and more systematic discourse .
As the stakes in Sudan have risen and gained urgency , there is growing acknowledgement that isolation and condemnation of the Khartoum regime are no longer viable options , and a greater willingness to push back on domestic groups ' distaste for dialogue .
Implicitly , the shift in policy is also an acknowledgement that the high levels of violence against civilians in 2004 - 2005 have passed .
The policy document does attempt to assuage some of the concerns of the U.S. activist community , which has been highly critical of U.S. special envoy Scott Gration .
Priority targets of these groups have been Gration 's description of the security situation in Darfur as " remnants of genocide " and an approach that has inaccurately been characterized as giving preference to unconditional incentives .
There is continued uncomfortable wordsmithing around the term genocide , reflective of a still unresolved internal debate .
The administration 's review calls for a " definitive end to ... genocide in Darfur " ( with the implication that genocide is ongoing ) ; quarterly interagency reviews of progress or regression ; and incentives based on " verifiable changes in conditions on the ground " - all implicit reassurances to potential critics .
The benchmarks for progress and slippage , as well as the matrix of potential pressures , remain classified , a source of consternation to domestic groups , who will be impatient to see concrete results from an engagement strategy and who just prior to the release of the policy called for General Gration to be fired .
General Gration will not have long to answer his critics on this front and will need consistent backing from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and , at critical junctures , President Obama himself to urge patience and adequate space for negotiation .
There are signs that divisions within the administration are still very much alive , and the secretary would do well to keep internal disputes from bubbling over into the public domain and distracting from the key tasks at hand .
A series of damaging leaks from within the White House and elsewhere have embarrassed and infuriated senior levels .
There are no quick wins in Sudan , and the administration 's strategy does not guarantee success .
The review document provides a clear articulation of a measured strategy that commits the United States to the long , hard slog of sustained diplomatic engagement and mediation .
How strong a mandate General Gration will have remains unclear .
To date , no new resources have been attached to the effort , which will require sustained attention by a cadre of seasoned State Department personnel .
There is much uncertainty in how the strategy will ultimately be implemented and how it will hold up under the stresses and complexities of what is looming in Sudan on the one hand and the scrutiny and impatience of domestic skeptics on the other .
And at this point it remains difficult to predict what the United States will deliver if Sudan meets U.S. demands : Removal from the terror list ?
Lifting of sanctions ?
Normalization of relations ?
Nor is it evident what harsh measures will follow if Sudan is obstinate .
These formulations - the heart of the matter and the root of U.S. credibility moving forward - remain obscure .
The Designer 's Cover Letter ( from Josh Perry )
One of the great things about the graphic design profession is that your first impression to employers — your résumé — is often your strongest .
Unlike programmers , who generally have wait until the technical interview to show off their chops , designers get the chance to show off their background and skills in one little sheet of paper .
That said , we 've posted a number of different graphic design positions over the years , and have been blown away by the response .
Quite a few résumés have been on par with these ones .
But there was one that stood out from the rest .
It came via fax ( which , was n't even posted on the job description ) and had the following cover letter .
Needless to say , that " graphic designer " was never considered .
Temporary Web Siter ( from Eliot )
After leaving home and moving to Big City , it was time for me to get a real job .
I was only 17 ( did n't finish high school ) and had no professional experience , so I was not expecting a fantastic job .
In fact , I would have taken anything .
After a bit of searching , I spotted a job on the local job board for a " temporary web siter " .
Details were few , but the position ( 10 - 15 flexible hours ) sounded like a good way to get my toes wet and build my résumé a little bit .
I emailed my résumé and contact information , and soon I had my first interview .
I parked as close to the address as I could , and then walked past a row of what must have been either crack - or frat - houses .
As I walked up the steps of the address I was given , I was helpfully reminded " Do n't forget to poop " by spray paint on the sidewalk .
The guy who greeted me was obviously in college and , when I walked in , the house smelled like an odd combination of legal and controlled substances .
He led me to a room , completely full of empty beer cans .
He offered me beer , which was disturbing considering I was 17 , and even more disturbing considering I looked closer to 15 .
Then they explained their " business plan " to me .
They were going to get video submissions , choose one , and play it during the Super Bowl .
They said the website was going to be " really big " , with " millions of hits " per day .
They needed to have room for banner ads because they were going to have " really big sponsors " .
They just needed me to program the " web site " .
I left as soon as I could , but with a lesson : I would n't take just anything .
How to Scare - off Female Candidates ( from Josh Perry )
At a company I once worked at , several of the developers would cycle into work each day .
It was an exercise / eco-friendly thing , I guess .
One of the more hard - core cyclists would often wear a full - body Lycra cycling suit for his ride ... and would usually not bother changing out of it .
He 'd just hang out all day , wearing his spandex suit , and writing his code .
Being a heavily male - dominated office ( like most in the IT world ) , he could get away with this .
When it came to hiring a new developer , we found that rarest of gems : a qualified female candidate .
Being female , she was pretty much guaranteed a job offer as soon as she sent in her résumé , but they brought her in for an interview just in case .
While she was in the interview , one of the interviewers casually joked , " so , how do you feel about working with men wearing full - body spandex suits ? "
An uncomfortable silence ensued .
They offered her the job .
She declined .
By 2020 , the U.S. government predicts that America ’s nursing shortage will be between 800,000 and one million nurses .
By 2020 , the U.S. government predicts that it will be short between 800,000 and one million nurses .
( Close to 117,000 short in California alone . )
Before that – 2015 – the U.S. Department of Health projects that 400,000 new nurses will be needed just to fill vacancies left by retirees .
The problems
While lucrative incentives are being offered for Americans to enter nursing college and for existing nurses to go back to school to become nursing college faculty , a longer - living , less - healthy population is already starting to weigh on the American healthcare system .
The up - side
Already strained by an out - of - control deficit of trained nurses , stressful shifts for the nurses who are holding down the fort , and – unbeknownst to many – a shortage of teachers to open - up class sizes at nursing colleges , the deal has never been sweeter for anyone with the smarts to make the grade .
The trouble spots
Not surprisingly , Alaska has the largest nursing shortfall as a percentage of nursing positions left vacant : Beautiful as the endless summers and Northern Lights of the winter are , not every nurse wants to make the trek up to the 49th state :
Only 58 percent of nursing positions there are currently filled …
And a paltry 40 per cent are expected to be filled in 2015 .
More surprisingly , Hawaii is also facing one of the nation ’s highest vacancy rates for nursing positions .
So too is Connecticut .
Overall , California is short the largest number of overall nurses : nearly 48,000 right now , a projected 81,000 in 2015 and as many as 116,600 by 2020 .
Not far behind those numbers are Florida and – to a lesser extent – Georgia and New Jersey .
Flaws in the data
What ’s even more troubling is that state - level data on the nursing shortage is n’t even accurate all the time : Vermont used government - gathered data to plan ahead , thought they had all the nurses they needed , and ended up with a sizable shortage ( PDF ) .
The numbers are daunting ;
For example , in order to meet the projected future health care needs of the state , New Jersey needs to triple the annual number of nursing school graduates from 2000 per year to 6,000 per year .
What are the solutions ?
Government studies have proposed everything from asking existing nurses to delay retirement for up to four years , increasing the number of nursing college teaching staff , and inviting more nurses from other countries to fill vacant jobs .
Projected FTE RN Supply under Alternative Wage Growth Scenarios
But perhaps most interesting option for anyone considering a career in nursing is a government study that explores the notion of raising nursing salaries nationwide an additional 1 - 3 per cent .
Such a move would theoretically increase the number of people graduating from nursing college , though still not quite enough to meet demand .
A silver lining , if you ’re interested …
Thanks to upcoming recruitment and retention programs as well as a number of educational incentives , becoming a nurse in America over the next few years will likely be cheaper than is has been in a while , and working as a nurse will likely be more lucrative than its ever been .
If undecided college - bound teens are up for it , they may just find the recession - proof jobs they ’ve been looking for .

The Nobel War Prize
10 October 2009
Friday ’s announcement by the Nobel committee in Norway that Barack Obama had been chosen to receive its 2009 Peace Prize was met with expressions of astonishment around the globe .
Many questioned how Obama could be chosen after less than nine months in office , with no discernable achievements on any front .
He was inaugurated just 11 days before the cut - off date for nominations for the prize .
More significant , however , is what Obama has done in office , which has nothing to do with peace .
Obama appeared in the Rose Garden in the mid-morning to deliver remarks that began with a declaration that he was “ surprised and deeply humbled ” to receive the Peace Prize .
He then marched back into the White House to meet with his war council and discuss sending tens of thousands more troops to Afghanistan and escalating the bombing in that country and across the border in Pakistan .
Using his statement to issue veiled threats against Iran , Obama went out of his way to declare himself the “ commander - in - chief ” and refer to the two wars and occupations over which he presides .
While the Nobel committee praised him for his “ vision of a world free from nuclear arms , ” Obama commented that this goal “ may not be completed in my lifetime . ”
Given that in talks with Moscow his administration has demanded the right to keep a minimum of 1,500 nuclear warheads , he knows whereof he speaks .
“ We have to confront the world as we know it , ” said Obama , making a clear distinction between his supposed “ vision ” and the reality of his administration ’s bellicose policies .
On the surface , awarding a peace prize to the US president is farcical .
There are widespread warnings that the selection may well prove only an embarrassment for the Obama administration .
How is it possible to proclaim a “ commander - in - chief ” who is responsible for war crimes , such as bombing the civilian population of Afghanistan — one such attack having claimed the lives of over 100 men , women and children just last May — as the champion of peace ?
Yet , receiving the Nobel Peace Prize has always been a dubious distinction .
Its reputation has never really recovered from the decision to award it in 1973 to Henry Kissinger , who is today unable to leave the United States for fear of being arrested as a war criminal .
His co-recipient , Le Duc Tho , the Vietnamese leader who negotiated the Paris peace agreement with Kissinger , refused to accept the award , pointing out that the accord had brought no peace to his country .
A few years later , Menachem Begin was chosen for the prize .
The Nobel committee chose to ignore his long career as a terrorist and killer , honoring him for reaching the Camp David deal with Anwar Sadat of Egypt , his co-recipient .
Jimmy Carter , whose administration instigated a war in Afghanistan that claimed a million lives , was given the same award in 2002 .
The committee cannot be accused of violating its own principles , such as they are .
The founder of the prize , Alfred Nobel , was the inventor of dynamite .
He would no doubt be intrigued by the Pentagon ’s efforts to speed up production of the Massive Ordnance Penetrator ( MOP ) , a 30,000 - pound bomb designed to obliterate underground targets .
The weapon is being readied for possible use against Iran .
Despite its praise for Obama ’s “ vision ” and for having “ captured the world ’s attention and given its people hope for a better future , ” the Nobel committee did not choose Obama based on illusions in his campaign rhetoric .
The Nobel Peace Prize is , and always has been , a political award given with the aim of promoting definite policies .
The selection was made by a committee composed of five members of the Norwegian parliament drawn from the main parties , ranging from the far - right to the social democrats .
Its decisions reflect positions prevailing within the European ruling elite as a whole .
Thorbjorn Jagland , the committee ’s chairman and a former Norwegian prime minister , defended the choice of Obama in an interview with the New York Times Friday , expressing the cynicism underlying the choice .
“ It ’s important for the committee to recognize people who are struggling and idealistic , but we cannot do that every year , ” he said .
“ We must from time to time go into the realm of realpolitik . ”
Realpolitik doubtless played the decisive role in the recent selection of two other prominent American politicians for the prize : Carter in 2002 and Al Gore in 2007 .
Carter was picked on the eve of the US war against Iraq in a rebuke to the belligerent unilateralism of the Bush administration .
The prize went to Gore , the Democratic presidential candidate in 2000 , in advance of the 2008 election , a not - so - subtle hint that Europe wanted a break from the Bush administration .
While in those years the prize was employed as a critique of US foreign policy , this time it represents an endorsement .
As Jagland put it , “ We hope this can contribute a little bit to enhance what he is trying to do . ”
The glaring contradiction in giving the peace prize to Obama as he prepares to send more troops into Afghanistan is more apparent than real .
The award is meant to legitimize Washington ’s escalation in Afghanistan , its attacks on Pakistan and its continued occupation of Iraq , giving them Europe ’s seal of approval as wars for peace .
It serves to undermine popular opposition within the United States and internationally to the wars being waged under the Obama administration , as well as to future ones still being planned .
The European powers support the war in Afghanistan , a position that is more frequently finding its expression in the press .
The British daily Independent , for example , published an editorial Thursday declaring that it “ in principle ” supports the call for sending as many as 40,000 more US troops into the war .
Meanwhile , Germany , France and other countries have shifted their positions on Iran as well , backing Washington ’s campaign for tougher measures .
What ruling circles in Europe see in Obama is not a champion of peace , but rather a shift away from the unilateralism of the Bush administration and a willingness to factor European support into the pursuit of US imperialism ’s strategic aims .
No doubt , Europe ’s governments calculate that their backing of the US military interventions will translate into a stake in the exploitation of the energy reserves of Central Asia and the Persian Gulf .
Moreover , in legitimizing these wars and promoting a return to multilateralism in US foreign policy , the European powers see a means to legitimize their own turn to militarism and to suppress opposition to war within their own populations .
Obama ’s Nobel prize , far from signaling hope that the world ’s greatest military power is turning toward peace , is itself an endorsement of war and serves as a warning that the intensifying crisis of world capitalism is creating the conditions for resurgent militarism and the threat of widening international conflicts .

Twenty - one people were roughed up and called anti-gay slurs by a Chicago police officer who trumped up bogus charges against lesbian and gay motorists , says the Gay Liberation Network -- and video released Tuesday appears to dispute the officer 's report of a June arrest .
Officer Richard Fiorito has 21 federal suits filed against him , with 10 - 20 more expected within weeks , according to a release from Erickson & Oppenheimer , the firm representing the plaintiffs .
Attorneys accuse Fiorito of making the false arrests for the last six years in a scheme to earn extra overtime pay .
" He intends to be dual motivated , " said attorney Jon Erickson during a Tuesday morning press conference .
" One , for the money , and two , to target gays and lesbians . "
Fiorito continues to work as an officer , make arrests and testify under oath , all while being investigated by the Cook County State 's Attorney 's Office and the Independent Police Review Authority , Erickson said .
In dash cam video from Fiorito 's squad car , he is shown conducting field sobriety tests against a driver , Michael Vaughn .
In each of the tests , Vaughn performed " perfectly , " Erickson said , yet Fiorito noted in the official report that Vaughn had failed them .
The recording was made June 21 , 2009 , months after the 21 federal suits had already been filed and after the accusations against Fiorito were well - known by the police department .
In a case filed in February , a man named Shawn Rauch said he was " manhandled " by Fiorito and called anti-gay names , the Chicago Tribune reported .
Rauch was charged with DUI , his lawyer said , but Fiorito never performed field - sobriety tests , nor did he conduct a breathalyzer test .
Fiorito has been honored by Mothers Against Drunk Driving for the 313 DUI arrests he made between Jan. 1 , 2007 and June 6 , 2008 .
He said that if he 's called to testify in these cases , he will assert his 5th Amendment rights .
Fiorito is the third Chicago cop accused of trumping up DUI charges .
Last year , prosecutors dropped more than 50 cases after accusing Chicago officer John Haleas of perjury .
Earlier this year , dozens of DUI arrests by officer Joe Parker came under scrutiny .

Italian police have captured one of the country 's most wanted mafia fugitives during a raid on a chicken farm near the southern city of Naples .
Salvatore Russo , 51 , is the head of a Camorra clan which bears his name .
He has been on the run since being sentenced in 1995 to life in jail for murder and links to organised crime .
Police said he was found with weapons including a machine gun and a pistol , hiding behind a thick wall at the farm near the town of Somma Vesuviana .
Along with his brother - 62 - year - old Pasquale - Russo is believed to have completely re-organised the operations of the clan - based crime syndicate since the 1990s .
" This is a heavy blow for the Camorra , " said Interior Minister Roberto Maroni of Russo 's capture on Saturday morning .
" We are closing the net on the super - fugitives . "
The Russo clan , based in the town of Nola , had an iron grip on criminal activity in some 40 towns in the Naples areas , police said .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
Let those other filmmakers focus on world destruction or masked superheroes or beautiful people doing beautiful things .
Jason Bateman plays the owner of an extract factory in " Extract , " Mike Judge 's latest .
Mike Judge prefers to deal with real life .
Judge , writer and director of " Office Space " and co-creator of the TV series " King of the Hill , " has long liked to set his work in the world of malfunctioning copiers and beer - drinking propane salesmen .
Even his wicked satire of the future , " Idiocracy , " focused on the inanities of everyday life , just set 500 years from now .
His new film , " Extract , " is no exception :
It 's about a factory owner , Joel ( Jason Bateman ) , who must deal with a host of employee problems as well as a chilly wife .
Of course , Joel 's solutions are n't exactly the stuff of Solomon , but such is the way of comedy .
Bateman understands Judge 's motivations .
" He likes to keep everything very middle - of - the - road common people , small town , small problems , relatable , blue - collar , " said the actor , who called Judge " a ninja of comedy . "
" And those people , they run extract factories ; they make drywall .
I mean , it 's the stuff that we all need often goes unnoticed ; he likes to write about those people , and I 'm glad he does . "
" Extract , " which also stars Mila Kunis , Kristen Wiig , J.K. Simmons and a long - haired and heavily bearded Ben Affleck , opens Friday .
Judge talked to CNN about his subject matter and his cast .
The following is an edited version of the interview .
CNN : Where did this idea come from ?
I 'd read that you worked in a factory before .
Mike Judge : Yeah , it kind of came from all over the place .
I 've worked many jobs , and I did work in a factory a couple times -- a place that made guitar amps , and then I worked in a place in Albuquerque [ New Mexico ] , where I grew up , that stuffed those snack boxes with Fritos and candy bars and stuff .
CNN : Casting for the film , how did that come together ?
Did you have a set idea in your head ?
Judge :
When I first wrote the first draft , I was n't thinking about anybody in particular and , then I saw " Arrested Development " years later .
I [ 'd ] put the script on the shelf and thought Jason Bateman would be perfect , so I did a rewrite thinking about him but no one in particular for the other characters .
I just wrote it and then just did kind of the normal casting process .
But then , we were reading people for the character of [ Joel 's friend ]
Dean , and my casting director comes in one day and said , " Ben Affleck is interesting . "
And I thought , " Really , I 've never met the guy . "
And I [ also ] thought , " Yeah , but he 's like strapping , handsome leading - man guy . "
Then I started thinking about it , and I love him when he's a character actor like in " Dazed and Confused " or " Shakespeare in Love , " and then I met him , and he just got it .
He had this take on him based on a guy he went to high school with .
We did a read - through the script , and him and Jason just killing me , I just thought it was just really funny .
You know , he was willing to get out of his leading man look and grow a beard .
It was really fun .
CNN : It was fun to see him do that .
It was a different dynamic .
Judge : Yeah .
I think Ben , actually , I think he enjoyed being this character .
I think he has n't gotten to do something like that in a while .
In fact , we had a big break [ during shooting ] .
...
And he has one scene in the factory , so he had like maybe two or three weeks between the bulk of it and that last scene in it .
I got the sense he was really happy to come back and put on his " Dean " get - up and get back into that character .
He was just really fun .
CNN : And Joel , he 's a nice guy who just wants to have sex with his wife .
It seems pretty simple .
Judge : Yeah , and I think he , you know , he , he wants kind of simple things , and he 's worked so hard .
It 's maybe be a little bit of a mid-life crisis he 's going through , I think .
And he just sort of tests the waters , dips his toe in , doing something a little crazy , and then just everything goes to hell for him .
CNN : We saw this with " Office Space , " too , making the workplace funny .
What 's that process like ?
Judge :
Well , to me , I think there 's a lot of interesting characters [ at work ] , and just the dynamics of a workplace are really ... funny to me .
I 've had a lot of jobs , and I think there 's a lot of material there and , I just remember thinking , growing up in the ' 80s , thinking like everyone on TV shows and movies , these characters seem to have like endless cash .
You never see , [ when you ] become an adult and even as a teenager , it 's like , " OK , I gotta pay my car insurance , and I gotta do this and that . "
And then you get a job , and it 's like , you 're there all day .
...
I do n't know , I think if your soul does n't get stomped out of you , you can still see the comedy in all of it .
So I 'd wanted to do something that 's set in more a blue - collar place like a factory , and it 's told from the point of view of the guy who owns it and sympathetic to him instead of the employee angry at the bosses .
CNN : Why extract ?
Are you an extract expert ?
Judge : ( laughs )
Well , there was a couple of reasons .
There was a book lying around my freshman year in the college dorms that was about food flavoring , and I actually just thought it was kind of interesting .
Then years later , south of Austin [ Texas ] , there used to be this really great building ; it was the Adams Extract Factory .
...
My Realtor one day , we were looking at a house , and he points to a really nice house in this neighborhood , and he says , " That 's where the Adams Extract people live . "
It 's just this odd item that 's in every grocery store in the country , but you do n't think about it much , and when I 'd say that that 's what it 's about , people start laughing .
So I figured I 'm one step ahead of it there .

The police box in Newport has now been fenced off for safety reasons A community is trying to save a listed Tardis - style police box which has fallen into disrepair .
The box in Somerton , Newport , is the only one to survive in the city and one of the few remaining in the UK .
But it is now falling apart and will need thousands spent to restore it to its former glory .
During much of the 20th Century , the boxes were used to contact police officers by phone before personal radios made them redundant .
They are now perhaps better known as Doctor Who 's time machine , or Tardis , in the popular television series .
The boxes were dotted around all over Newport and were the only way to contact the policemen long before they had personal radios
Councillor John Guy Former police officer John Guy , 65 , now the local councillor for the area where the police box is situated , estimated it would cost thousands of pounds to bring it up to scratch .
" What we want to do is get it back to what it was .
It 's started to fall apart really , " he said .
" It 's got concrete cancer in it and that 's been the undoing of it .
" At the moment we 're waiting for a surveyor to look at it and give us some idea what it 's going to take to get it back to how it was . "
Somerton community group Rascals is attempting to secure the necessary funds to preserve the box , which is currently fenced off for safety reasons .
Rascals chair Pat Moore said : " It 's a real landmark .
Older people like me like it but so do the children too .
" It would be a crying shame if it should disappear because we 're quite proud of it .
I think if we do n't preserve it pretty soon , it would go . "
Mr Guy remembers the boxes from his days as a police officer and says the light on top would flash when a call for an officer came through .
" I never used them specifically but I remember checking on them before they were all knocked down , " he said .
" The boxes were dotted around all over Newport and were the only way to contact the policemen long before they had personal radios . "
He said he hoped that once it was restored , it could attract fans of Doctor Who interested to see what a real police box looked like .

Critics contend that zero - tolerance policies like those in the Christina district have led to sharp increases in suspensions and expulsions , often putting children on the streets or in other places where their behavior only worsens , and that the policies undermine the ability of school officials to use common sense in handling minor infractions .
For Delaware , Zachary ’s case is especially frustrating because last year state lawmakers tried to make disciplinary rules more flexible by giving local boards authority to , “ on a case - by - case basis , modify the terms of the expulsion . ”
The law was introduced after a third - grade girl was expelled for a year because her grandmother had sent a birthday cake to school , along with a knife to cut it .
The teacher called the principal  but not before using the knife to cut and serve the cake .
In Zachary ’s case , the state ’s new law did not help because it mentions only expulsion and does not explicitly address suspensions .
A revised law is being drafted to include suspensions .
“ We did n’t want our son becoming the poster child for this , ” Ms. Christie said , “ but this is out of control . ”
In a letter to the district ’s disciplinary committee , State Representative Teresa L. Schooley , Democrat of Newark , wrote , “ I am asking each of you to consider the situation , get all the facts , find out about Zach and his family and then act with common sense for the well - being of this child . ”
Education experts say that zero - tolerance policies initially allowed authorities more leeway in punishing students , but were applied in a discriminatory fashion .
Many studies indicate that African - Americans were several times more likely to be suspended or expelled than other students for the same offenses .
I ’m happy to admit that I underestimated how strongly governments would respond to this financial crisis .
Dramatic reductions in interest rates , huge fiscal stimuli and — in the USA and UK — expansion of government - created money , have all had a positive impact on the economy and asset markets ( both shares and houses ) .
In his recent essay , Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Kevin Rudd esti­mat­ed that the res­cues were the equiv­a­lent of rough­ly 18 per­cent of glob­al GDP over a 3 year peri­od , which is an unprece­dent­ed lev­el of expen­di­ture by gov­ern­ments .
Eichen­green and O’Rourke ’s com­par­i­son of today to the Great Depres­sion gives the most bal­anced assess­ment of how effec­tive these poli­cies have been at the glob­al lev­el .
They have clear­ly turned around stock mar­kets .
Six months ago , world stock mar­kets were 50 % below their peak , a far worse per­for­mance than dur­ing the Great Depres­sion when , at the same time after the peak , they had only fall­en 10 % .
By the begin­ning of Sep­tem­ber , mar­kets had recov­ered to be only a cou­ple of per­cent below the com­pa­ra­ble 1930 posi­tion of a 30 % fall .
Indus­tri­al out­put has also turned around .
Six months ago this was 13 % below the peak lev­el , worse than the 1930s posi­tion of an 11 % decline .
Since then it has risen to be only 10 % below , while at the equiv­a­lent time in the 1930s , indus­tri­al out­put had fall­en 20 % from its 1929 high .
So has the gov­ern­ment cav­al­ry rid­den to the res­cue ?
If the cri­sis were one sim­ply of liq­uid­i­ty , the answer would be yes .
A gov­ern­ment stim­u­lus can over­whelm the impact of a cred­it crunch , and the innate dynam­ic of a pro­duc­tive econ­o­my can re-assert itself after such a cri­sis , lead­ing to renewed growth .
But this not mere­ly a cri­sis of liq­uid­i­ty .
It is one of exces­sive pri­vate debt , on a scale that is also unprece­dent­ed : the USA is car­ry­ing US $ 41.5 tril­lion in debt on the back of a US $ 14 tril­lion econ­o­my , pro­por­tion­ate­ly 70 per­cent more debt than it had at the start of the Great Depres­sion .
In Decem­ber 2007 , the pri­vate sec­tor swung from ramp­ing up debt lev­els as it chased spec­u­la­tive gains on asset mar­kets , to retreat­ing from debt as the asset bub­bles burst .
In the space of a year , pri­vate debt went from adding US $ 4 tril­lion to aggre­gate demand , to sub­tract­ing US $ 165 bil­lion from it .
Pri­vate debt had ceased being the economy ’s tur­bocharg­er and had instead become its flood­ed engine .
While eco­nom­ic out­siders like myself , Michael Hud­son , Niall Fer­gu­son and Nas­sim Taleb argue that the only way to restart the eco­nom­ic engine is to clear it of debt , the gov­ern­ment response , has been to attempt to replace the now defunct pri­vate debt eco­nom­ic tur­bocharg­er with a pub­lic one .
In the imme­di­ate term , the stu­pen­dous size of the stim­u­lus has worked , so that debt in total is still boost­ing aggre­gate demand .
But what will hap­pen when the gov­ern­ment stops tur­bocharg­ing the econ­o­my , and waits anx­ious­ly for the pri­vate sys­tem to once again splut­ter into life ?
I am afraid that all it will do is splut­ter .
This is espe­cial­ly so since , fol­low­ing the advice of neo­clas­si­cal econ­o­mists , Oba­ma has got not a bang but a whim­per out of the many bucks he has thrown at the finan­cial sys­tem .
In explain­ing his recov­ery pro­gram in April , Pres­i­dent Oba­ma not­ed that :
“ there are a lot of Amer­i­cans who under­stand­ably think that gov­ern­ment mon­ey would be bet­ter spent going direct­ly to fam­i­lies and busi­ness­es instead of banks – ‘ where ’s our bailout ? , ’ they ask ” .
He jus­ti­fied giv­ing the mon­ey to the lenders , rather than to the debtors , on the basis of “ the mul­ti­pli­er effect ” from bank lend­ing :
the truth is that a dol­lar of cap­i­tal in a bank can actu­al­ly result in eight or ten dol­lars of loans to fam­i­lies and busi­ness­es , a mul­ti­pli­er effect that can ulti­mate­ly lead to a faster pace of eco­nom­ic growth .
( page 3 of the speech )
This argu­ment comes straight out of the neo­clas­si­cal eco­nom­ics text­book .
For­tu­nate­ly , due to the clear man­ner in which Oba­ma enun­ci­ates it , the flaw in this text­book argu­ment is vivid­ly appar­ent in his speech .
This “ mul­ti­pli­er effect ” will only work if Amer­i­can fam­i­lies and busi­ness­es are will­ing to take on yet more debt : “ a dol­lar of cap­i­tal in a bank can actu­al­ly result in eight or ten dol­lars of loans ” .
So the only way the rough­ly US $ 1 tril­lion of mon­ey that the Fed­er­al Reserve has inject­ed into the banks will result in addi­tion­al spend­ing is if Amer­i­can fam­i­lies and busi­ness­es take out anoth­er US $ 8 –10 tril­lion in loans .
What are the odds that this will hap­pen , when they already owe more than they have ever owed in the his­to­ry of Amer­i­ca ?
The next chart inverts the usu­al por­tray­al of America ’s debt to GDP ratio by invert­ing it : the top of the graph rep­re­sents zero debt , the bot­tom , a debt to GDP ratio of 300 percent — which is just shy of the cur­rent ratio of 292 per­cent .
If the mon­ey mul­ti­pli­er was going to “ ride to the res­cue ” , pri­vate debt would need to rise from its cur­rent lev­el of US $ 41.5 tril­lion to about US $ 50 tril­lion , and this ratio would rise to about 375 % — more than twice the lev­el that ush­ered in the Great Depres­sion .
This is a res­cue ?
It ’s a “ hair of the dog ” cure : hav­ing booze for break­fast to over­come the feel­ings of a hang­over from last night ’s binge .
It is the road to debt alco­holism , not the road to tee­to­tal­ism and recov­ery .
For­tu­nate­ly , it ’s a “ cure ” that is also high­ly unlike­ly to work , because the mod­el of mon­ey cre­ation that Obama ’s eco­nom­ic advis­ers have sold him was shown to be empir­i­cal­ly false over three decades ago .
The first econ­o­mist to estab­lish this was the Amer­i­can Post Key­ne­sian econ­o­mist Basil Moore , but sim­i­lar results were found by two of the staunchest neo­clas­si­cal econ­o­mists , Nobel Prize win­ners Kyd­land and Prescott in a 1990 paper Real Facts and a Mon­e­tary Myth .
Look­ing at the tim­ing of eco­nom­ic vari­ables , they found that cred­it mon­ey was cre­at­ed about 4 peri­ods before gov­ern­ment mon­ey .
How­ev­er , the “ mon­ey mul­ti­pli­er ” mod­el argues that gov­ern­ment mon­ey is cre­at­ed first to bol­ster bank reserves , and then cred­it mon­ey is cre­at­ed after­wards by the process of banks lend­ing out their increased reserves .
Kyd­land and Prescott observed at the end of their paper that :
Intro­duc­ing mon­ey and cred­it into growth the­o­ry in a way that accounts for the cycli­cal behav­ior of mon­e­tary as well as real aggre­gates is an impor­tant open prob­lem in eco­nom­ics .
I could n’t agree more , but unfor­tu­nate­ly they — and neo­clas­si­cal econ­o­mists in general — did bug­ger all about it .
On the oth­er hand , the Post Key­ne­sian group , of whom I am one , have con­tin­ued to try to con­struct mod­els of the econ­o­my in which cred­it plays an essen­tial role .
I ’ve recent­ly devel­oped a gen­uine­ly mon­e­tary , cred­it - dri­ven mod­el of the econ­o­my , and one of its first insights is that Oba­ma has been sold a pup on the right way to stim­u­late the econ­o­my : he would have got far more bang for his buck by giv­ing the stim­u­lus to the debtors rather than the cred­i­tors .
The fol­low­ing fig­ure shows three sim­u­la­tions of this mod­el in which a change in the will­ing­ness of lenders to lend and bor­row­ers to bor­row caus­es a “ cred­it crunch ” in year 25 .
In year 26 , the gov­ern­ment injects $ 100 bil­lion into the economy — which at that stage has out­put of about $ 1,000 bil­lion , so it ’s a pret­ty huge injec­tion , in two dif­fer­ent ways : it injects $ 100 bil­lion into bank reserves , or it puts $ 100 bil­lion into the bank accounts of firms , who are the debtors in this mod­el .
The mod­el shows that you get far more “ bang for your buck ” by giv­ing the mon­ey to firms , rather than banks .
Unem­ploy­ment falls in both case below the lev­el that would have applied in the absence of the stim­u­lus , but the reduc­tion in unem­ploy­ment is far greater when the firms get the stim­u­lus , not the banks : unem­ploy­ment peaks at over 18 per­cent with­out the stim­u­lus , just over 13 per­cent with the stim­u­lus going to the banks , but under 11 per­cent with the stim­u­lus being giv­en to the firms .
The time path of the reces­sion is also great­ly altered .
The reces­sion is short­er with the stim­u­lus , but there ’s actu­al­ly a mini-boom in the mid­dle of it with the firm - direct­ed stim­u­lus , ver­sus a sim­ply low­er peak to unem­ploy­ment with the bank - direct­ed stim­u­lus .
Why does this mod­el show that it ’s bet­ter to give the mon­ey to the debtors than the lenders , in con­trast to the case that Oba­ma was sold , that it ’s bet­ter to give it to the bankers ?
Because the “ mon­ey mul­ti­pli­er ” mod­el is effec­tive­ly a mechan­i­cal , sta­t­ic , equi­lib­ri­um mod­el of the econ­o­my .
Give the banks excess reserves , and they will lend them to the pub­lic , which will hap­pi­ly take on the debt .
Once the reserves are ful­ly lent out , the econ­o­my is back to equi­lib­ri­um again .
In con­trast , my mod­el is a dynam­ic , non-equi­lib­ri­um one , where the “ cir­cu­lar flow ” of mon­ey and goods is prop­er­ly account­ed for .
In this sys­tem , you can think of the dif­fer­ent bank accounts in the sys­tem as like dams with pipes con­nect­ing them of vast­ly dif­fer­ent diam­e­ters .
When a cred­it crunch strikes , the pipes pump­ing the bank reserves to the firms shrink dra­mat­i­cal­ly , while the pipe going in the oppo­site direc­tion expands , and all oth­er pipes remain the same size .
If you then fill up the bank reserves reservoir — by the gov­ern­ment pump­ing the extra $ 100 bil­lion into it — that mon­ey will only trick­le into the econ­o­my slow­ly .
If how­ev­er you put that mon­ey into the firms ’ bank accounts , it would flow at an unchanged rate to the rest of the economy — the workers — while flow­ing more quick­ly to the banks as well , reduc­ing debt lev­els .
So giv­ing the stim­u­lus to the debtors is a more potent way of reduc­ing the impact of a cred­it crunch — the oppo­site of the advice giv­en to Oba­ma by his neo­clas­si­cal advis­ers .
This could also be one rea­son that the Aus­tralian expe­ri­ence has been bet­ter than the USA ’s : the stim­u­lus in Aus­tralia has empha­sized fund­ing the pub­lic rather than the banks ( and the mod­el shows the same impact from giv­ing mon­ey to the work­ers as from giv­ing it to the firms — and for the same rea­son , that work­ers have to spend , so that the mon­ey inject­ed into the econ­o­my cir­cu­lates more rapid­ly .
This mod­el can explain some aspects of the cur­rent US data that are inex­plic­a­ble from the con­ven­tion­al , neo­clas­si­cal point of view — the key para­dox being that while base mon­ey ( “ M0 ” ) has been increased dra­mat­i­cal­ly , there has been almost no move­ment in broad­er mea­sures of mon­ey ( “ M1 ” and “ M2 ” ) .
If the mon­ey mul­ti­pli­er argu­ment were cor­rect , the increas­es in M1 and M2 would have been mul­ti­ples of the increase in M0 , as Oba­ma was led to expect .
In fact , the expan­sion in M0 has been met by a fall in the cred­it - gen­er­at­ed com­po­nent of the mon­ey sup­ply : since M2 includes all of M1 and M1 includes all of M0 , this is clear­er when we sub­stract the dou­ble - count­ing out .
M1 has actu­al­ly con­tract­ed almost as much as M0 has expand­ed , while the expan­sion in M2 has been less than a third the size of the growth in M0 .
The “ mon­ey mul­ti­pli­er ” has also collapsed — a mys­tery from a neo­clas­si­cal point of view , but entire­ly pre­dictable from the “ endoge­nous mon­ey ” per­spec­tive .
Oba­ma has been sold a pup by neo­clas­si­cal eco­nom­ics : not only did neo­clas­si­cal the­o­ry help cause the cri­sis , by cham­pi­oning the growth of pri­vate debt and the asset bub­bles it financed ; it also is under­min­ing efforts to reduce the sever­i­ty of the cri­sis .
This is unfor­tu­nate­ly the good news : the bad news is that this mod­el only con­sid­ers an econ­o­my under­go­ing a “ cred­it crunch ” , and not also one suf­fer­ing from a seri­ous debt over­hang that only a direct reduc­tion in debt can tack­le .
That is our actu­al prob­lem , and while a stim­u­lus will work for a while , the drag from debt - delever­ag­ing is still present .
The econ­o­my will there­fore lapse back into reces­sion soon after the stim­u­lus is removed .
Iowa , America ’s breadbasket , home to liberal scion Tom Harkin and conservative contrarian Charles Grassley , is vetting the issue of medical marijuana politically like no other previous state has by conducting a series of public testimonies , convened by the Iowa Pharmacy Board ( who was ordered by a Polk County judge to do so in April in response to lawsuits brought by medical marijuana patients in Iowa against the IPB ) .
Two of the first four public hearings have already happened ( August 19 in Des Moines and Sept. 2 in Mason City ) ; the next hearings are :
October 7 in Iowa City and November 4 , Council Bluffs
At the Mason City hearing on September 2 , eight speakers , all but one in favor of medical marijuana law reforms , spoke out against the prohibition of medical marijuana in Iowa .
Des Moines resident and multiple sclerosis patient Ray Lakers , 42 , who was jailed for possessing less than a gram of medical marijuana in 2005 , spoke of medical marijuana ’s utility and benefit to his life .
Conversely , Maedene Sappenfield of Mason City spoke out against it in the Globe Gazette , “ I have a son - in - law in North Carolina who has MS and he functions without marijuana very well , so it is possible . ”
Watch news video of the Mason City hearing here .
The IPB does not have the authority to legalize marijuana for medical use , but it could suggest to lawmakers to move marijuana to a schedule lower than I .
In turn , Iowa lawmakers would have to pass amending legislation .
An AP article indicates an interesting legislative challenge ( some would say ‘ poison pill ’ ) : “ the [ IPB ] said that the drug [ marijuana ] would have to be used as treatment in all states for Iowa to reclassify it . ”

Comments
Porn is great .
It teaches , it reassures , it cares for you .
A good porno can make you feel good about life again .
Your girlfriend leaves you , you burn the roast , your local sports team loses the big game - put on your favorite porno and all that disappears in a sweaty , sticky haze of guys and girls doing it for real .
But of all life ’s many pleasures , few are better enjoyed in solitary than pornography .
Like a special ritual you do before a big job interview , or the strange daydreams you have on a lazy Sunday afternoon , porn is something best kept to oneself .
But sometimes that which is best not discussed needs to come out into the open , like when you finally get up the nerve to show your doctor that weird growth on you ass .
In the world of hardcore pornography , now is one of those times .
For porno has lost its way .
What was once a magical world that ushered young men and women into the adult world of guilt and shame and comforted them when they got there has somehow become sullied .
There ’s something warm and inviting about the old pornos that today ’s wank vids just do n’t have .
Maybe it was the fuzzy film stock , the fat , open bass lines , or the wild , untrimmed hedges .
Whatever it was , Seventies porn just made you feel good .
Today ’s porn is all about getting in and out , but not in a good way .
All across this great nation , people are reaching for the tissue box with a sense that something has gone wrong .
Their cheeks may still be flushed and their wrists may still be sore , but now their brows are furrowed , too .
Furrowed with a troubling question :
Whatever happened to porn like Grandma used to make ?
In a spirit of mastubatory solidarity , we present a few of the ways that old porn is better than new porn .
Atmosphere
The Great Chefs all know that presentation matters .
As the old saying goes , “ the first bite is with the eye . ”
It does n’t matter if you ’re serving up the most delicious food in the world ; if it looks like crap , people are n’t going to enjoy it .
There ’s a reason we wrap Christmas presents .
Good things are better when they come in nice packages .
Porn is no different .
In the good , old - timey porno , when the camera opened on a seedy , wood - paneled bedroom in some San Fernando Valley basement , you instantly knew where you were .
Old - fashioned pornos grounded you in a cozy world of shag carpets and brown furniture .
From the cheesy home bars to the undulating water beds , the porno makers of the past knew how to create an environment conducive to getting it on .
They understood that atmosphere mattered just as much as lube and lipstick .
Old pornos understood the dance .
Like the best gentlemen , Old porn took the time to romance its intended .
Any joker can grab a girl and pull her back to his cave by her hair , but it takes a special kind of seducer to get her to go willingly .
In today ’s porno , you ’re lucky if the A.D. thought enough to throw an old blanket on the studio floor .
In the hustle and bustle of the modern skinflick , nobody cares about the little things .
As long as there ’s two or more people inserting two or more of their body parts into each other in front of a camera , that ’s enough .
These days it does n’t matter if they ’re in the back of a minivan , a stairwell , or a empty white room .
All that matters is that copulation is being recorded by a camera .
Watching a porno these days is like eating a plain boiled potato .
Sure , it ’s good for you and it will fill you up , but what about flavor ?
Call us old - fashioned , but we like a little mustard on our hot dogs .
Porn today is cold and sterile ( oh , that such a word might refer to porno ! ) ;
There ’s no attention to detail .
It ’s all wam , bam , not even a thank you ma’am !
New porno may know how to f**k , but old porno knew how to make love .
The Crews
Where did this commitment to quality hardcore films come from ?
The people .
From the mightiest director to the lowliest fluffer ,
The people who made the porn of old were craftsmen ; craftsmen with years of experience setting up lights , blocking shots , and hosing out hot tubs .
The old pros knew when to lock the camera down and shoot wide for an all out gang - bang and when to go hand - held and close - up for an intimate poolside blowjob .
These were people who lived and breathed hot girl - on - girl action , Men and women who poured their hearts , souls , and bodily fluids into getting the perfect money shot .
These were artists .
But no more .
With these new clowns you ’re lucky if they can get both boobs in the shot .
The bunglers today think that as long as you know where the ‘ on ’ button is on a $ 2500 digital camera , you ’re good to go .
The technique and heart are gone .
Porno movies today are all about quantity , not quality .
The craftsmen have been replaced by a skeleton crews of a couple or even just one cranking out scene after scene of boring banging .
Pornography is no longer a collective enterprise of willing professionals .
No where is that fact more tragically on display than in the dead eyes of today ’s porno “ stars . ”
The Stars
In porn , the only thing more important then the people behind the scenes working the cameras are the ones in front working the schlongs .
Yes , we ’re talking about Porn Stars .
But what does that phrase even mean anymore ?
In the porno of yesteryear , care was taken only to use the best ex-strippers and failed models .
Porn films often used the same small group of professionals who all knew each other and worked together on film after film .
The result was organic performances from people who knew and trusted each other to hump their brains out with style and class .
Yes , this really is Ron Jeremy .
Old porn stars were like a theater collective .
A group of artists dedicated to the work and craft of boner films .
A group of young performers coming together to make the dirty movies of their dreams .
Out of these small troupes , stars emerged as bright as any old Hollywood ever produced .
Marilyn Chambers , Seka , John Holmes , Ron Jeremy ; larger than life figures who made putting on a filthy raincoat and going to a dingy theater feel like a real night out .
Who could n’t help but be swept up in the glamor and glitz behind the red door ?
But alas , modern porn makers do n’t seem to care much for glamor .
Where once we had magnificent porn stars grinding like angels , today ’s porn seems satisfied to recruit whoever looks like they have the lowest self - esteem at the Encino bus terminal on a given Saturday night .
Besides their tattoos and geometrical pubic hair , there ’s nothing special about the talent anymore .
Porn stars today turn over faster than the staff at your local Taco Bell .
Sure , there are still a few stars around , but they ’re anachronisms , left - overs from a simpler , purer era of smut , yet missing that something special that made us fall in love with the stars of old .
Nowadays , it ’s all about amateurs and “ real ” girls .
There ’s no place anymore for glamor .
The only thing larger than life in today ’s porn is the cocks .
The Sex
But what of the warm , sticky center of porn ?
The action ?
The “ that goes in there ” ?
Once again , Porno just ai n’t what it used to be .
The sex in old skin flicks was hot , but pure .
A little dirty ?
Sure .
Promiscuous ?
Oh yeah .
But old porn was about good , old - fashioned sex .
The kind of balling that meant something more than just who could shoot the farthest .
Old porn was a political statement ; an expression of new - found sexual freedom .
The freedom to love , be free , and put your cock wherever it was invited .
Old porno reflected the growing feeling in America that sex was n’t something to hide behind Mom and Dad ’s door .
No , it belonged out in the open in the suburban dens , apartments , and truck stop toilets of the nation .
Porn sex used to mean something .
It was swinging as a statement of principals .
A declaration of dick .
Old porno did n’t just get you off , it pointed the way to a better , sexier future .
But all that thick , creamy idealism dried up and flaked away as video allowed the mercenary and cynical into porno .
In short order , sex movies became just about the sex .
Instead of the lovingly prepared , three course stroke flicks of the past , we got a Big Macification of porn .
Utilitarian boning .
1984 with tits and ass .
Doublethink to go along with the double penetration .
Porno today reduces sex to its basest , filthiest elements .
But in a bad way .
Sure , there may be more positions , bigger boobs , and an endless number of sub - genres to cater to every conceivable desire , but where ’s the hope ?
Like the ex-hippy who gives up his job as a juggler at a Renaissance fair to go work on Wall Street , porn gave up the dream of a hornier tomorrow for cold , cold cash .
You thought we were going to say ‘ hard ’ right ?
Somewhere an overweight guy is pulling down his sweatpants , pressing play , and crying .
For he knows that more than his self - respect and 10 cc ’s of his bodily fluid have been spilled on the rec room floor .
The skill , idealism , and yes , the nobility is gone from porn .
It may be too late for the porn of today , but let ’s take a lesson from the porn of yesterday to improve the porn of tomorrow .
We owe it to the masturbators of the future .
On Tuesday , March 11th , 2008 , somebody made one of the craziest bets Wall Street has ever seen .
The mystery figure spent $ 1.7 million on a series of options , gambling that shares in the venerable investment bank Bear Stearns would lose more than half their value in nine days or less .
via Wall Street ’s Naked Swindle
And it worked .
In less than a week , the trader turned his money into over a quarter of a billion dollars .
Funny thing is , no one knows who did it .
Some unimaginative types consider this to be a case of insider trading , but I prefer to think it proves the existence of time travel .
Eventually this post made it to the front page of Google for “ proof of time travel ” and some people reading the page were quite angry for one reason or another .
So in order to help fill the Internet with useful information and keep from getting flamed by people looking for better proof , I ’ve included the incidents below that are often considered proof of time travel .
Swiss Watch In Tomb
In 2008 during the excavation of a 400 year old sealed tomb in Shangsi Town , China a chunk of dirt was knocked off and landed with a metallic sound .
Upon investigation it was discovered that there was a Swiss ring watch in the dirt .
The watch was supposedly of a make that would n’t be developed until hundreds of years after the tomb had been sealed .
Cell Phone in Charlie Chaplin
In one of Charlie Chaplin ’s movies called The Circus , a lady walks past and she appears to be talking on a cell phone .
It seems plausible that there may be a different explanation for her behavior –especially when you consider that if you go back in time with a cell phone , it probably would n’t be particularly useful before the infrastructure is built to support making calls , but if she is a traveler from the future , who knows what type of amazing device she might be holding .
I ’m just glad to see that in the future people are n’t walking around like idiots talking to themselves with invisible earpieces embedded in their ear .
Below is the video of the woman from the movie .
Bridge Opening Photograph
There is an old photo from the re-opening of a bridge in 194 where one of the people looks like they are dressed in a style that post dates when the photograph was taken .
The caption reads : Reopening of the South Fork Bridge after flood in Nov. 1940 .
1941
Here is a close up of the man that seems dressed a bit out of his time period .
Time Portal Under Sink
This guy claims he crawled under his sink and just kept going .
He stood up and met himself as an older man .
He shot some video with his phone with “ himself ” and they both show that they have the same tattoo .
Update : I ’m told that this is actually an advertisement for mutual funds or retirement planning , so I guess we ca n’t count this as proof .
If you ’ve made it this far , you are probably very interested in time travel .
According to this article , it is impossible .
However , if we ’ve learned anything from history , we should know that you have to be very careful what you say is impossible .

Indians do not have a national identity number A planned Unique Identification ( UID ) number for Indian citizens will be backed by biometric authentication , the head of the project has told BBC .
Fingerprints and photographs of more than a billion people will be taken when they are registered for the identity number , Nandan Nilekani said .
The biometric evidence will be stored online in what will be the biggest such national database in the world .
The first UID numbers will be issued in about 12 - 18 months , he said .
Mr Nilekani said that the " technology challenge " in putting together a biometric record of one billion citizens was " immense " .
" Biometrics on this scale has not been carried out before .
They will be stored online and help in instant online authentication of the identity of every Indian , " he said .
But Mr Nilekani said the government does not have an " exact fix " on the how many Indians had some sort of identity proof .
' Pro-poor ' Biometrics on this scale has never been done before
Nandan Nilekani , chairman , Unique Identification Authority of India
His office is looking at 80 million income tax payers who possess a Permanent Account Number ( PAN ) , some 200 million account holders in public and private banks , some 500 million mobile phone consumers and over 600 million Indians who have election cards .
There is , obviously , a considerable overlap as many of them have all or many of these forms of identification .
His office will also look at the database of Indian passport holders , public distribution system cards for food for the poor , and the list of cooking gas consumers in the country .
However , these checks will have to be done carefully because , as Mr Nilekani admits , there is the " phenomenon of duplicates " or fraudulent numbers .
It is clear that a large number of poor people have no identification at all , making it doubly difficult for them to gain access to social welfare schemes , Mr Nilekani added .
" This project is pro-poor and inclusive targeted mainly towards the poor .
The middle class and the rich have some form of identity .
People on the margins are getting lost because of lack of identity , " Mr Nilekani said .
It is also hoped that the number should help tackle identity theft and fraud .
Mr Nilekani 's office will be working with state governments and 20 - 25 agencies - the income tax department , the country 's Election Commission and the state - run life insurance company , for example - to roll out the identity numbers .
No identity
The unique number will not be an identity card - instead , the number will be included in documents like election identity cards , PAN cards and bank account numbers .
India 's efforts at giving every citizen an identity number is possibly one of the greatest challenges facing the government .
Every Indian is expected to have a national identity number by 2014 " There is the technological challenge , there is a challenge of the scale of work , and there is a complex governance challenge , working with so many departments and states , " Mr Nilekani said .
The state of Karnataka in the south , India 's capital , Delhi , and Meghalaya state in the north - east are among the states which may take part in early pilots .
The project 's main technology centre will be based in Bangalore , with eight regional centres working with the various states .
Unlike in the US and UK , Indians do not have a common federal identity number .
The government expects to give a unique identification number to every Indian citizen within five years .

Printer Friendly ... Structure Recovery as Counter - Example Guided Abstraction Refinement Author : RolfRolles # Views : 8945
Counter - Example Guided Abstraction Refinement ( C.E.G.A.R. for short ) is one of those brilliant techniques , like abstract interpretation , that is simple to state , and that in principle applies beyond its original application domain ( in this case , model checking ) .
As this blog entry is meant to be an informal exposition of an idea I had , I feel that it is not warranted to set up the necessary formalism to discuss C.E.G.A.R. in precise mathematical terms , but it would be wrong to convey the notion that it is anything other than a mathematical endeavor .
When you 're trying to figure something out in a black - box fashion , you probably do something like the following .
You begin by inspecting the data at hand and constructing some sort of model ( an " abstraction " ) that fits it .
Then you acquire more data , and test your model against it .
If new data causes the model to be falsified ( that particular data is called a " counterexample " ) , you must " refine " your model so as to account for it .
This process is iterated until no more counterexamples are found .
Basically , this is C.E.G.A.R. -- you can see that the idea enjoys widespread genericity and more or less applies to any scientific endeavor .
Notice I did n't talk about software or anything in particular in this paragraph ; I 'm just talking about thinking .
To be more specific , C.E.G.A.R. is an idea in model checking that is very similar to the preceeding paragraph .
Basically , a model ( abstraction ) is constructed automatically , and standard model - checking techniques are used to verify that the model satifies the specification which has been provided .
If it does not , a counterexample is generated .
You then analyze the original hardware or software system to see if the counterexample falsifies the specification .
If it does , the counterexample is a genuine witness to the fact that the system does not adhere to the specification .
If it does not , then we have a " spurious " counterexample ( an indication that our abstraction is deficient ) , which we use to refine our model accordingly , and then we repeat the process .
Once I learned about C.E.G.A.R. , I realized that I already adopted a very similar technique while manually reverse engineering object - oriented applications .
I begin by assuming that there are not any structures in the program at all .
When I encounter an instruction of the form mov reg , [ reg+offset ] , I define a new structure consisting solely of that member , with any bytes below or above that member being considered as undefined .
I then track the structure pointer and repeatedly add members every time I encounter a reference of that form .
In terms of C.E.G.A.R. :
1 : Begin with an empty structure as the model .
2 : Assert that the structure is a valid model of the program 's memory accesses with respect to the structure pointer .
Model - check the program under this assumption .
3 : If a reference to an as - yet undefined structure member is found , this is a counter - example which is a witness to the falsity of the notion that the model accurately depicts the structure under consideration .
Therefore , refine the model to incorporate the new structure member , and go to 2 .
4 : Output the structure .
I do n't mean to imply that this is the way that an automated structure recovery tool should be constructed ; I think that an interprocedural version of what Hex - Rays does with global dataflow analysis ought to be sufficient for most purposes .
I 'm merely suggesting a mathematically precise way to look at the problem of structure recovery .
Perhaps I 'll post an entry about viewing the same problem in terms of the Knaster - Tarski theorem in order theory .

Thanks for sharing Rolf .
This technique is really intuitive , and as you said I also found myself doing the same while reconstructing structures .

I generally just take a glance at the disassembly and write the structure out in full but this will work too ...

This reminds me of Popper " Conjectures and refutations " , a seminal work in the philosophy of science .
Popper elaborated this 90 years ago ;-)
See e.g .
http://www.leonardbeeghley.com/docs/SYG%206125/Popper,%20Science-conjectures%20&%20refutations.pdf
As he said " the criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability , or refutability , or testability " .
Sounds familiar ?

Rund um die Uhr wach Andrea Naica - Loebell
Mit Hilfe von Pillen kann durchgearbeitet werden
Es ist der Traum jedes gestressten Menschen , für den der Tag stets zu kurz und der Schlaf im Grunde schlicht verschwendete Zeit ist : Länger wach bleiben und mehr erledigt kriegen .
Neue Medikamente machen es möglich .
Zugelassen sind sie eigentlich , um Patienten , die an Narkolepsie leiden , zu behandeln .
Aber zunehmend helfen sie auch Workaholics mit nur vier Stunden Schlaf auszukommen .
Der Wirkstoff Modafinil macht es möglich .
Der heutige Mensch leidet häufig unter Stress .
Er hat viel zu viel zu tun und viel zu wenig Zeit .
Hektik bestimmt den Alltag .
Erfolgreiche Managertypen brüsten sich gerne damit , mit nur einigen Stunden Schlaf auszukommen – wer mehr braucht , ist in ihren Augen ein Verlierer .
Statistisch betrachtet , schläft ein Erwachsener hierzulande jede Nacht etwas mehr als sechs Stunden .
Experten gehen dagegen davon aus , dass man sieben bis acht Stunden pro Nacht schlafen sollte , der echte Wohlfühlschlaf dauert ihrer Meinung nach neun , bei manchen sogar zehn Stunden .
Oft wird beklagt , dass wir eine unausgeschlafene Gesellschaft seien ( Wir schlafen zu wenig ) .
Schlafmangel bringt den Stoffwechsel aus dem Gleichgewicht ( Zuwenig Schlaf macht alt und krank ) , aber auch zu viele verschlafene Stunden sind ein gesundheitliches Risiko und verkürzen das Leben ( Schlafen gefährdet die Gesundheit ) .
Eine ausgewogene Schlafdauer ist wichtig für das Wohlbefinden und die Leistungsfähigkeit .

Schlafen ist gesund und lebenswichtig .
Ausreichend in Morpheus Armen zu schlummern spielt eine wichtige Rolle für das Lernen und Erinnern ( Wie war das noch mal im Mittelteil ? ) , aber auch für Denkfähigkeit und Kreativität ( Ratzen wie Einstein ) .
Dennoch gelten in unserer Gesellschaft Langschläfer oft als Faulpelze .
Zudem leiden viele Menschen unter Schlafstörungen .
Allein in Deutschland können Millionen allnächtlich nicht einschlafen , sie wälzen sich während ihrer Träume unruhig im Bett herum , schnarchen heftig oder leiden unter Atemaussetzern ( Wenn die Nächte nicht enden wollen… ) .
Carpe noctem
Das Magazin New Scientist widmete die Titelstory der letzten Ausgabe den neuen Muntermacher - und Schlafmitteln .
Carpe noctem – nutze die Nacht – könnte das Motto der heutigen Großstädter lauten .
Werbeslogans versprechen , dass die City nie schläft und wer will schon etwas verpassen ?
Wozu ein Drittel oder auch nur ein Viertel des Lebens verschlafen , wo man in dieser Zeit doch prima liegen Gebliebenes abarbeiten , neue Filme anschauen oder schlicht die ganze Nacht durchtanzen könnte ?
Sich mit Kaffee , Tee oder Energy - Drinks einen kleinen , munterhaltenden Kick zu verschaffen , ist gesellschaftlich akzeptiert .
Gefährlicher ist der Griff zu den in den 90er Jahren immer beliebter gewordenen Amphetaminen , die in den meisten Formen schlicht verboten sind – einige Ausnahmen wie Ritalin unterliegen dem Betäubungsmittelgesetz , jede Verschreibung ist meldepflichtig .
Seit einigen Jahren gibt es aber die neuen Lifestyle - Drogen , über die viel diskutiert wird ( 11 steps to a better brain und Neue Pillen für den neuen Menschen ) .
Sie versprechen durch das Schlucken von Tabletten wie auf Knopfdruck mehr Leistungsfähigkeit , bessere Reaktionen , mehr Erfolg durch bessere Stimmung und den Abbau von Ängsten ( Die Pille für das Vergessen ) .
Selbstverständlich gibt es für die meisten dieser Wirkstoffe auch medizinische Indikationen – zum Missbrauch wird es , wenn Leute bei Ärzten diverse Symptome simulieren , um an diese Medikamente zu kommen .
Das gilt auch für Modafinil , die Wachmacher - Pillen , die in den USA seit 1998 unter dem Markennamen Provigil und in Deutschland als Vigil auf dem Markt sind .
Hergestellt wird die Arznei gegen exzessive Tageschläfrigkeit von der Firma Cephalon , die über ihr Produkt berichtet :
Modafinil wirkt gezielt auf die Schlaf -/ Wachzentren des Gehirns und fördert so spezifisch die Wachheit , ohne jedoch den gewollten Schlaf zu beeinflussen .
Es unterscheidet sich in seinem pharmakologischen Profil grundlegend von herkömmlichen Stimulanzien wie den Amphetaminen und weist kein Suchtpotenzial auf .
Krankheiten und Doping
Wie genau die neuen Hallowach - Pillen wirken , ist noch unbekannt , bislang hält die Pharmafirma ihre Erkenntnisse unter Verschluss .
In Deutschland fällt die Substanz unter das Betäubungsmittelgesetz , verschrieben wird sie nur auf den entsprechenden Spezialrezepten .
Modafinil wird eingesetzt , um Patienten zu helfen , die tagsüber die Augen nicht offen halten können , weil sie an Schlaf - Wach - Störungen wie der Narkolepsie , oder jenen , die an nächtlichen Atemstörungen wie dem obstruktiven Schlafapnoe - Syndrom leiden .
Seit vergangenem
Jahr ist es auch für die Therapie des chronischen Schichtarbeiter - Syndroms zugelassen ( Arznei reduziert Müdigkeit bei Schichtarbeit ) .
Erforscht wird gerade , ob auch Patienten mit Multipler Sklerose von dem Aufputschmittel profitieren können ( Modafinil in Multiple Sclerosis ) .
Unerwünschte Nebenwirkungen der Psychostimulanz sind in seltenen Fällen u.a.
Kopfschmerzen , Übelkeit , Nervosität , Angstzustände und Verdauungsstörungen .
Aber nicht nur Kranke nehmen Modafinil , um ihre Leistungen zu steigern .
Seit 2003 wurde es nachweislich von Sportlern als Dopingmittel eingenommen ( Doping - Skandal erschüttert die WM ) .
Was für Leichtathleten gut ist , kann für Otto Normalverbraucher nicht schlecht sein , sagte sich das US - Militär und führte einmal mehr Medikamententests mit Soldaten durch .
Ein tagelang durchkämpfender Leatherneck ist der Traum jeder Armeeführung ( Maintaining alertness and performance during sleep deprivation : modafinil versus caffeine und Air Force testing new fatigue - combating drug )
Selbstversuch und Abhängigkeitspotenzial
Noch bevor die Doping - Polizei der Sport - Verbände auf Modafinil stieß , war es unter Workaholics bereits eine bekannte Stimulanz , um aufkommende Müdigkeit abzublocken .
Schon vor drei Jahren startete der Journalist David Plotz einen Selbstversuch mit den Wachmachern ( Wake Up , Little Susie Can we sleep less ? ) .
Er war erstaunt , wie konzentriert , munter und wunderbar er sich fühlte – obwohl er normalerweise aufgrund von Schlafmangel als Vater eines Kleinkinds spätestens am Spätnachmittag ständig kurz davor war , mit dem Kopf auf der Tastatur des Computers einzunicken .
Ganz anders nach der Einnahme von Modafinil : Hellwach und voller enthusiastischer Arbeitswut stürzte er sich auf Recherchen und Texte .
Er arbeitet zwar lang wie ein Besessener , brach den Versuch dann aber ab , als er sich dabei ertappte , dass er darüber nachdachte , wo er nach der angesetzten Erprobungswoche den Nachschub bekommen würde , um sich weiter so topfit zu fühlen wie in diesen Tagen .
Bisher haben Studien noch keine Anhaltspunkte dafür erbracht , dass Modafinil abhängig macht oder auf Dauer andere schwerwiegende Folgen hat .
Langzeiterfahrungen fehlen noch , weil das Präparat erst seit einigen Jahren erhältlich ist .
Nach Auskunft des Herstellers Cephalon kann man mit Modafinil bis zu 48 Stunden wach bleiben , ohne dass man hinterher – wie sonst immer – den Schlaf aufholen muss .
Für die Firma hat sich die Pille zur Minderung des Schlafbedürfnisses als Goldesel erwiesen .
Im vergangenen Jahr gingen weltweit Packungen für 575 Millionen Dollar über die Apothekertresen .
Von einem Missbrauch will Cephalon nichts wissen , die Firmensprecher stellen sich auf den Standpunkt , es handle sich um ein Medikament zur Behandlung von Narkolepsie und es sei verschreibungspflichtig – damit könne es gar keine Personen geben , die ohne einen Arztbesuch Zugang zu dem Wirkstoff bekämen .
In Zeiten von Internetapotheken eine Illusion – schließlich gibt es immer eine Quelle irgendwo im Ausland .
Aber das Risiko , dass ein solches Päckchen vom Zoll abgefangen wird , muss man gar nicht eingehen .
Im New Scientist berichtet ein 31 jähriger Programmierer aus Seattle , dass er nicht mehr viel Schlaf braucht , denn zuerst erhielt er Modafinil regelmäßig von einem Freund und inzwischen ist er selbst Inhaber von Rezepten : Diagnose Narkolepsie .
„ Ich würde nicht sagen , dass ich mich aufmerksamer oder weniger schläfrig fühle .
Es ist nur so , dass kein Gedanke an Müdigkeit aufkommt “ , berichtete er , „ Ich kann mit Modafinil in der Arbeit enorm produktiv sein .
Ich bin organisierter und motivierter .
Und es bedeutet , dass ich Freitagnacht ausgehen und Party machen kann und trotzdem am Samstagmorgen früh zum Skifahren . “
Schlafforscher sind kritisch , wenn sie solche Berichte hören .
Sie sind überzeugt , dass längerer , erholsamer Schlaf nötig ist , um gesund zu bleiben ( vgl. Nicht erholsamer Schlaf ) .
Nicht auszuschlafen kann eine Fülle von Krankheiten nach sich ziehen .
Die meisten Experten sind überzeugt , dass eine pharmazeutische Unterdrückung des Schlafbedürfnisses auf Dauer den Körper schädigt .
Langfristige Folgen könnten Schäden des Hormonhaushaltes oder des Immunsystems sein .
