Shanghai's boom led to a new financial centre - but who benefited ?
China 's rapid economic growth has created huge companies , but most of them are owned by the state .
Now the Communist Party is embracing businessmen in its drive to modernise the country - but it faces growing accusations of corruption .
In the provincial town of Liuzhou , 1,200 miles south - west of Shanghai near the Vietnamese border , town officials held a banquet for GM executives and journalists to celebrate GM 's investment in a new engine plant at formerly state - owned Wuling , China 's leading maker of small minivans .
Leading the toasts was Liuzhou 's most important official , who hailed GM 's investment and hoped that more multinationals would invest in Guangxi Province to help boost people 's standard of living .
GM's Rick Wagoner celebrates with company and party bosses at Wuling That toastmaster , however , was the head of the province 's Communist Party , who is in a battle to gain a growing share of China 's booming car industry .
In September , he won a significant victory , when the government named Liuzhou as one of four " designated secondary centres " for the production of auto spare parts - a fast - growing segment of the Chinese auto industry .
State - directed capitalism
The auto industry encapsulates all the strengths and weaknesses of China 's state - directed capitalism .
Car production in China is growing so rapidly that it is set to overtake the US within a decade as the world 's largest market , and multinationals are flooding in to invest .
There will soon be more cars in India and China than the US But all foreign multinationals must find a Chinese joint - venture company , which takes a majority stake in the business , and nearly all these Chinese companies are state - owned .
In Shanghai , GM was lucky to find Shanghai Automotive ( SAIC ) , China 's largest car company , as its partner .
As SAIC was owned by the Shanghai municipal government , it found no difficulty in finding new sites to expand its business in the new Pudong district .
Shanghai Automotive also produces a version of the Rover 75
And it had no problems getting suppliers - as the government even owned its own parts company .
The Shanghai government was also instrumental in helping the other early investor in Shanghai Automotive , Volkswagen , with its markets .
All 20,000 municipal taxis in Shanghai are Volkswagens and made locally .
In return for its help , the government requires foreign car companies to share their modern technology with the state companies , thus helping them modernise both the production line and introduce new equipment in the cars .
GM has no regrets about its relationship with a state - run , party - controlled business .
GM boss Rick Wagoner says the Chinese managers have a " very professional " approach and that GM has benefited from party backing in smoothing the way for it to produce in China .
Uncontrolled expansion
The symbiotic relationship between foreign multinationals and local party officials also applies even more to overseas Chinese businessmen , who are being enticed to invest back in the mainland .
The new Shanghai often overshadows the old Much of Shanghai 's property boom has been fuelled by Hong Kong Chinese investors , who have built many of the huge shopping malls and skyscrapers that have transformed the city .
And as the Chinese government owns all the land in the city , property developers are sold mere leases , which are auctioned off to the highest bidder .
The profits from the sales go to the municipal government , which has used the money to build the vast new infrastructure of roads , ports , airports and 12 underground lines which has transformed the city .
Until recently , it was relatively easy for the government to clear the land it wanted for development , relocating thousands of Shanghai residents to new housing on the outskirts of the municipal region .
And its control of the planning system meant that there was no conflict , and no delay , over planning permission .
It was in the interest of the government - bent on the expansion of Shanghai - to get the maximum value out of each site 's land value , by building high - rise apartments for the rich or commercial office blocks .
Crackdown
But the system also encouraged corruption .
Mr Chen got too close to business , the party claimed Businessmen were encouraged to join the party , while insider deals were common .
Last September , the secretary of the Shanghai municipal committee of the Communist Party , Chen Liangyu , was sacked from his post for corruption .
He has been accused of diverting money from Shanghai's $ 1.2 bn pension fund to help finance building projects through dummy companies controlled by him and his business allies .
Mr Chen was also implicated in a real estate scandal in 2003 that led to the imprisonment of leading property developer Zhou Zhengyi , once named China 's 11th wealthiest individual .
The dismissal and trial of Mr Chen is part of a broader campaign by the Chinese government to stamp out the perception of widespread corruption among party officials .
Revelations have included the denunciation of corrupt officials who kept mistresses while indulging in expensive foreign goods and trips abroad .
CORRUPT COMRADES
1998 : Beijing mayor Chen Xitong jailed for corruption 2000 : Scores of officials implicated in smuggling scandal in Xiamen 2001 : Mayor of Shenyang and his deputy sentenced to death for land deals 2003 : Shanghai property tycoon Zhou Zhengyi jailed for corruption 2006 : Shanghai party boss Chen Liangyu sacked for diverting pension fund money into property deals
What 's behind Chen 's sacking ?
The party fears that corruption will undermine the legitimacy of the party , at a time when - despite economic growth - many people are suffering from rapid economic change .
The gap between rich and poor is growing , while state provision of health care and pensions is declining .
But the prosecution is closely linked to a power struggle within the party .
As a politburo member , Mr Chen is allied to former leader Jiang Zemin , who strongly backed Shanghai 's headlong dash for economic growth .
Unbalanced growth Beyond the corruption scandals , there is a bigger problem for China 's state - directed capitalism .
Chine is rapidly expanding its steel capacity through state firms
That is the competition between regions for economic growth and - ironically - the inability of the central government to prevent overexpansion .
Shanghai 's premier state - owned company had traditionally been Baosteel , now the world 's fifth - largest steelmaker , which also supplies the Shanghai car industry with its basic raw material .
Baosteel has been on an aggressive expansion programme - as have other Chinese steel companies , buying up other companies and listing some of its shares on the Hong Kong market .
It has plans to double steel production again , buying iron ore companies in Brazil and building a huge new plant in Shenzhen , the booming province near Hong Kong .
Migrant workers toil in Shanghai as the gap with the rich widens
And those plans were strongly backed by the Shanghai party , which had close ties to Baosteel 's boss , also a party member .
But the virtual doubling of steel production by China has led to a glut of steel on the world market , as well as questions as to whether the breakneck expansion can continue .
For now , China 's booming economy is absorbing all the steel it can produce , despite the attempts by central government to slow growth by raising interest rates .
But if growth were to slow , the damage to Baosteel 's balance sheet and its workforce could be severe .
And then , the competence of the party to run the economy - even with the advice of businessmen - could come under fire .

· Figures show Asian people bear brunt of use of power · Fears that tactic causes loss of confidence in police
Only one in every 400 stop and searches carried out under sweeping anti-terrorism laws leads to an arrest , official figures released yesterday reveal , triggering fresh pressure on the government and police over the controversial tactic .
Official government figures covering 2005 / 6 , the first since the July 7 2005 bombings on London , show a big increase in the use of the power , with Asian people bearing the brunt .
One force , City of London , carried out 6,846 stops of pedestrians and vehicles without finding enough evidence to justify a single arrest .
Stops under the Terrorism Act 2000 rely more on an officer 's discretion than other powers to search , which require reasonable suspicion .
The number of stops under terrorism laws in 2005 / 6 showed a 34 % rise on the previous year to 44,543 .
Asians faced an increase of 84 % , black people an increase of 51 % , searches of " other " ethnic groups rose 36 % and white people faced a 24 % increase .
The biggest increases were in London , with the Metropolitan police carrying out more than half of all terrorism stop and searches and the City of London force 15 % .
Experts believe anti-terrorism stop and searches have not led to a single person being caught who was later convicted of a terrorist offence .
Police say that even if this is the case the power is useful because it can be used to disrupt terrorist activity .
Some senior officers have considered scaling back the use of the power or scrapping it , fearing it does more harm than good .
In the 44,543 stops in England and Wales , there were 105 arrests .
Out of every 400 people stopped 399 were let go straight away .
Ben Bowling , professor of criminal justice at King 's College London , said : " If these people arrested were in possession of bombs you might say that 's fine , but I can't recall a case where that 's happened .
" These powers are being used indiscriminately with a minimal result .
The consequence of that is a loss in public confidence and a drop of support among those stopped without reason for the police . "
The figures showed that the racial divide in stop and search aimed at stopping non-terrorist crime also became starker .
Black people were seven times more likely to be stopped and searched by police .
The number of stop and searches carried out under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act , which legally require reasonable suspicion , hit their highest level in seven years .
In 2005 / 6 police carried out 878,153 , a 3.4 % increase on the previous year , with drugs being the main reason given by officers for searches .
The figures also show police missing their targets for ethnic minority recruitment .
Police managed a slight increase on the previous year to take the proportion to 3.7 % , which is short of the 4 % target .
While the proportion of full - time police officers is lower than the overall ethnic minority population , the percentage of special constables and police community support officers is considerably higher .
The number of racist incidents recorded by police rose 4 % , to 60,407 , though the government says this is only a fraction of those that occurred .
Racially or religiously aggravated offences rose by 12 % to 41,382 .
A serving Met police superintendent , Ali Dizaei , who is also president - elect of the National Black Police Association , said : " The report debunks the myth that there is less stop and search by the police .
In fact , there has been an increase over the year .
" It also shows the massive disproportionality which exists for black and Asian people being searched .
The disproportionality will continue to shake the trust and confidence of black and Asian communities at a time where the police needs them on board . "
A Home Office spokesperson said in a statement : " The government wholly supports the powers of stop and search and believes it to be a vital tool for police officers in preventing , detecting and reducing crime , whether it be street robbery , gun crime , drug - dealing or terrorism .
" The key to effective and fair use of stop and search is that it should be used in a targeted , intelligence - led way , with good grounds and based on accurate , up - to - date intelligence .
" Our aim is to ensure that officers have the confidence to use the powers effectively to tackle crime , whilst promoting confidence in their use amongst all members of the community . "
IRC にて、まうきち先生から「 お勧めのSF小説教えてください」とのお達しがあったので、よーし頑張って布教しちゃうぞ！という勢いでSF初心者にお勧めの本をまとめてみました(本日記を読んでいらっしゃる方のうち、どれくらいが非SF者なのかは考えないことにしましょう。うん ) 。
はっきりいってSFはマイナージャンルな上に、最近は書籍の生鮮食料品化が進んでいるので、ちょっと古い本などはすぐに入手不可能になったりします。なので、以下は「できるだけ新刊・近刊・もしくは古本などで入手可能性の高そうな本」をもとに「SFというジャンル内の大まかな傾向を把握できそうなもの」、というポリシーに基づき、独断と偏見でジャンル内傾向の説明と該当カテゴリ内でのおすすめ作品をまとめてみました。
サイバーパンクの残り火──出色の三編 柾悟郎 「 ヴィーナス・シティ 」( ハヤカワ文 庫JA・絶版 )
谷甲州 「 ヴァレリア・ファイル 」( C☆NOVELS )
エイミー・トムスン 「 ヴァーチャル・ガール 」( ハヤカワ文 庫SF )
1980 年代にウィリアム・ギブスン(代表作は『ニューロマンサー』ハヤカワ文庫SF )、ブルース・スターリング(代表作は『スキズマトリックス』、『蝉の女王』いずれもハヤカワ文庫SF)らが先導したサイバーパンク運動ですが、その特徴をあえて独断にもとづき、乱暴にまとめてみると次のようになります。
コンピュータとネットワークの発達・普及を背景にした人間とテクノロジー(情報通信、バイオ、ナノテク、メカトロニクスなど)の一体化。人間と機械が協調し、あるいは物理的に融合して一個のシステムとして機能するという新しい人間存在のあり方を描く。
テクノロジーの高度な発達とは裏腹に、社会観は退廃的。資本主義の進展による大企業コングロマリットの勢力伸長(主権国家なみの規模と影響力をもつ大企業群の登場など)、あるいは南北格差や貧富の差の拡大によって社会がそれぞれ独自の利害と思惑を持つ集団に細分化されていき、それらの間での抗争を描くという展開が多い。
こういった人間観・世界観の魅力から、サイバーパンク運動は燎原の火のように広がっていきました。80年代〜90年代にかけて、サイバーパンク的な要素がマンガ・アニメ(『攻殻機動隊』など)・ゲーム( TRPGでいえば『シャドウラン』など)、映画(『マトリックス』が代表的)など他ジャンルにも吸収されていき、また現実社会における情報化・ネットワークの普及が進む中で「サイバーパンク」という各個とした実体は消えてなくなり、むしろ「( 人々が考える)なにかSF的なもの」の中に広く包摂されるようになっていったといえるでしょう。
それでもサイバーパンクの独特の魅力を凝縮した作品群は存在します。今回取り上げた作品はいずれも正統派サイバーパンクとは言いがたいもので、ある意味変化球的なセレクションですが、様々な視点からサイバーパンクの魅力と熱気の片鱗を感じ取っていただけるのではないかと思います。
「ヴィーナス・シティ」は、富士通ハビタット(今風に言えばセカンドライフ(笑)でしょうか)
やROなどのMMORPGに近い仮想空間「ヴィーナス・シティ」の中で、男性キャラとして振る舞う女性が異形のキャラクターとして虐待に遭っている人物と遭遇し、恋に落ちるうちに「ヴィーナス・シティ」自体を揺るがす事件に巻き込まれ……という仮想空間と現実世界が交錯したミステリー仕立ての作品です。
S-Fマガジンで連載され、1995年に出版された本書ですが、仮想空間の描写や仮想空間の内外での登場人物の言動と心情描写は現代のMMORPGのプレイヤーのそれと比べても違和感なく、「95年という時点でよくこれだけのものを書けたな」と唸らされます。通信インフラがTCP/IPベースのインターネットではなくHB(HyperBroad)-ISDNであるというあたりなどは書かれた時代を感じさせたりもしますが、それはご愛敬。
経済大国でありオタク文化大国でもある日本に憧れてやってきたはいいものの、自らの不安定な位置に悩む白人中間管理職のおじさんなどという絶妙なキャラクターも出ており、なかなか魅力的な世界描写・心理描写を楽しめます。ネットワークに興味のある人やMMORPG好きの人はついニヤニヤしながら読み進めていけるのではないでしょうか。ミステリー好きの人にもお勧めできるかもしれません。
「ヴァレリア・ファイル」は当初、この著者にしては珍しく角川スニーカー文庫(！)
で1987年から90年にかけて5分冊のシリーズとして出され、その後99年に中央公論新社からC☆NOVELSのレーベルで上下二分冊に分けて復刊されました。しかもC☆NOVELS版の表紙・挿絵はあの士郎正宗です。中公の担当者GJと言わざるを得ない。
さて、肝心の内容ですが、これも地味な作品を得意とする著者には珍しく(笑)、かなり派手めにエンターテインメント性を意識した作りになっています。寂れた情報都市アストリアで学生兼情報屋をやっている主人公が、ひょんなことから軍関係の情報鉱脈にある「ヴァレリア」という女性に関する秘密研究の情報というヤバいネタを掴んでしまい、追われる身となった彼の前に当のヴァレリアを名乗る女性が現れ、自らの救出を依頼する……という内容ですが、個々のキャラクターが「立っている」上にテンポの良いストーリー展開でぐいぐい読ませていきます。特に魅力的なキャラが主人公の仲間であるフィリピン系ハッカーのレティシア・ロドリゲスという女性で、とにかく猪突猛進して周囲を混乱の渦に巻き込む自走地雷みたいなお嬢さんです。暴走娘大好き！という方にはたまらないキャラクターといえます。
もちろん世界描写もしっかりしており、現代の視点から見ても通信インフラやネットワーク周りの描写に古さが感じられない上(このあたりはエンジニア出身の著者の真骨頂でしょう)、軍が差し向けた「ハンティング・ファルコン」という自律戦闘機械に主人公たちが追い回されるシーンは昨今の米軍の無人航空機運用などを考えると妙にリアリティがあります。ネットワークに興味のある人やドタバタコメディとサスペンスが入り交じって展開するノリが好きな人にはお勧め。士郎正宗ファンの方ならまずジャケ買いして、しかる後に作家と漫画家の間の電脳世界の描写のし方を比較してみる、という楽しみ方もあるでしょう。総合的にエンターテインメント作品としての完成度が高い本作ですが、中公版も入手困難なのが難しいところ。
サイバーパンクの特徴として、人間が機械の側に歩み寄るという傾向がありますが、「ヴァーチャル・ガール」は機械の側から人間に歩み寄るという方向性で、カテゴリとしてはむしろ人工知能ものといえます。なのでサイバーパンクのカテゴリに押し込めるのはやや乱暴なのですが、あえてここで紹介することにします。
いわゆる「ナード( アメリカ版オタク) 」ではありますが実家が大金持ち、自身もコンピュータとメカトロニクスの天才という青年が生み出した少女型アンドロイドの「マギー」。作られてからしばらくの時期は周囲の世界を徐々に理解しながら製作者の青年と幸せに暮らしますが、人工知能の開発が禁じられている本書の世界のアメリカでは彼女の存在自体が御法度。かくして二人は放浪の身となり、ホームレスに身をやつしてアメリカを巡る旅に出る……。というのが本書のおおまかなあらすじ。
一見すると男性側の一方的なファンタジーを仮託した「萌え美少女」の話かよ、と思われそうですが、マギーが「造られてゆき」、そして世界を「認識しだす」過程はメカトロニクス、人工知能、認知科学の観点から見てもしっかりと描写されており、この分野に興味のある人には楽しめるでしょう。
また、ホームレスの世界というアメリカ社会の底辺を描いていながら、そこに生きる人々の喜怒哀楽と優しさ、そして彼らに囲まれて成長していくマギーの姿は成長物語(ビルドゥングス・ロマン)として一級の価値があります。アメリカ社会に興味のある人や、人工知能と人間の関係というテーマに惹かれる方、ロボット/アンドロイドものが好きな方には文句なくお勧めできる秀作。
「 SFだからこそ」書ける物語──異色作品集 ロバート・J・ソウヤー「イリーガル・エイリアン」(創元SF文庫)
マイク・レズニック 「 キリンヤガ 」( ハヤカワ文 庫SF )
テッド・チャン 「 あなたの人生の物語 」( ハヤカワ文 庫SF ) このカテゴリでは
、SFというジャンルならではの発想と視点、そして読後感を味わえる長編と連作短編集、および短編集を取り上げます。他ジャンルとはひと味違う、SFならではの楽しさや一種荒唐無稽ともいえるバカバカしさ、あるいはほろ苦い読後感や視点の転換を味わっていただけるものを選びました。 まずは「イリーガル・エイリアン」から。ついに人類はファースト・コンタクトに成功、人類より進んだ文明と魁偉な容貌をもつ種族、トソク族の使節が現代アメリカのとある町を訪れます。しかしなんとそこで殺人事件が起こり、トソク族が殺人事件の被告として連邦法に基づいて裁判を受ける羽目になり……というのがおおまかな内容。ご存じのようにアメリカは陪審制をとっており、裁判の行方を描く法廷劇としての側面もさることながら、殺人事件の顛末にかかわるミステリとしての側面、そして一見ナンセンスなコメディの裏に現代社会への揶揄的な視線も潜み、なかなか多彩な要素を含んでいます。トソク族の生態や文化の描写もしっかりとしており、人類とトソク族の間のカルチャーギャップも楽しめるという美味しさもあります。
キワモノっぽく見えますが、法廷もの好き、ミステリ好き、コメディ好き、ファースト・コンタクトに興味のある方、宇宙人に興味のある方、あるいはちょっとひねくれたユーモアが好きな方へと色々な方にお勧めできる、意外と間口の広い(かもしれない)作品です。小ネタが随所に盛り込まれており、肩肘はらずにニヤニヤ笑いながら読み進めていけるでしょう。最後のオチもコミカルな中に思わず「誰もが思い当たるフシのある」笑うに笑いきれない要素をはらんでおり、なかなか秀逸です。
「 キリンヤガ」のサブタイトル は“ A FABLE OF UTOPIA ( ユートピアについての寓話 ) ” 。舞台は22世紀、熱帯気候へのテラフォーミングが施された小惑星コロニー。そこでケニアの農耕民族、キクユ族の末裔であるコリバが同志たちや弟子の少年ンデミとともに、失われたキクユ族本来の伝承と生活、文化を取り戻そうと苦闘する過程を描く一連の連作短編集です。コリバは本来は欧米で教育を受けた「近代的な」ケニア人なのですが、ヨーロッパ人の作り出した文明と都市に背を向け、小さいコロニーであくまでもキクユ族のムンドゥムグ(祈祷師・呪術師・長老・語り部)として人々を教え導こうとします。しかしことはそう簡単に運ぶものではなく、ムンドゥムグと彼を取り巻く人々との軋轢や苦悩、あるいは悲劇がコリバの伝えるケニアの神話伝承や寓話を織り交ぜて語られます。
この作品自体も寓話的なのですが、特に印象に残るのは読み書きが男性のムンドゥムグや酋長たちにのみ許されているキクユ族の社会の中で、独学で読み書きを覚え、自分独自の言語までを編み出した少女カマリの悲劇を描いた「空にふれた少女」、なまじ勇敢で聡明なためにキクユ族しかいない社会の矛盾に気づき、人生の意味に悩んであるいは自殺し、あるいは追放の憂き目にあう若者たちを描いた「ロートスと槍」あたりでしょう。そして最後にはコリバ自身がンデミとも決別し、自らの挫折に直面することになります。
「近代化」すなわち世界の「ヨーロッパ化」という波に呑まれた非ヨーロッパ人のアイデンティティのあり方を考える上で、本作は非常に興味深い視点を提供してくれます。寓話や神話伝承が好きな方、歴史が好きな方、「近代化」というキーワードにピンとくる方には文句なしにお勧めできる作品です。SFには馴染みのない文学好きの方にも「こういう話もありますよ」とお勧めしたい一品。
「 あなたの人生の物語」は新鋭作家テッド・チャンの短編集。人を食ったような雰囲気の古代バビロンの塔建設の話(『バビロンの塔』)から、錬金術と神秘主義と熱力学、胚の前生説が現実に有効な理論として機能し、名前によって各種の機能を付加されたオートマトンが動く19世紀イングランドを舞台とした話(『七十二文字』)、人間の脳がもつ顔の美醜の認識能力を人為的に停止させる処置が開発された世界で様々な立場の人にインタビューを行うという筋立ての話(『顔の美醜について──ドキュメンタリー』)など、SFならではの奇想とロジックを併せ持った印象的かつ幅広い短編が収録されています。
ただし、本書を読んで「ああ、元ネタはこれか」という風にニヤニヤしながら楽しむには歴史や科学、科学史など幅広いバックグラウンドの素養が必要とされる、いわゆる「ハードSF」に近い作品集です。歴史や科学、科学史が好きな人には文句なく楽しめるでしょうが、そういった背景知識がない場合「なんで面白いのかいまいち分からない」状態になってしまい、「SFファンって難解でもったいぶったネタが好きな連中なんだな」という印象を与えてしまいかねない諸刃の剣でもあります。科学書(ポピュラー・サイエンス)が好きな人、とくにスティーヴン・ジェイ・グールドやリチャード・ドーキンスの科学エッセイ、山本義隆の科学史が好きな人には文句なくお勧めできるのですが、そうではない人にはお勧めいたしかねます。そういう意味で、本書は良くも悪くもSFらしいSFといえます。

Jhannet Sejas , a 19 year old girl was immediately arrested by the police after she recorded a 20 second clip from the movie " Transformers " that she wanted to show to her little brother .
She now faces up to a year in jail and a $ 2,500 fine .
Sejas was celebrating her 19th Birthday with her boyfriend in a local theater in Arlington .
A few minutes after she taped the short clip the police came rushing in and took her into custody on the charges of “ being a pirate ” .
Sejas and her boyfriend were promptly escorted out of the movie theater , still confused about what just happened .
“ I was crying , I ’ve never been in trouble before . ” , she later said in a response to the trip to the police station .
Of course Sejas had no intention to sell the 600 millisecond clip , she was n’t even planning to put it on YouTube .
The only thing she wanted to do was show it to her 13 year old brother , who was dying to see the movie himself .
Unluckily theater owners just introduced their new zero - tolerance policy since everyone can be a pirate .
Kendrick Macdowell , a representative National Association of Theater Owners said in a response : “ We can not educate theater managers to be judges and juries in what is acceptable .
Theater managers cannot distinguish between good and bad stealing . ”
Good and bad stealing ?
Nuts ! , the guy obviously has no clue what he ’s talking about .
If all theater owners treat their customers like this they will start to lose even more money than they already do now .
And guess who they will be blaming ?
Right , Pirates .
Sejas will go to trial later this month for recording a motion picture without permission , and is facing up to a year in jail and a $ 2,500 fine .
Seriously unbelievable .

You ca n’t live in New York — arguably , you ca n’t spend an hour in New York — and remain oblivious to the machinery of profit pumping away under every surface .
This city makes money , loses money , houses money ; lately , with luxe condos stacking up like casino chips along the waterfront , the city looks like money .
What ’s amazing , then , is how little we truly know about the inner workings of this beast we feed , and milk , daily : How does New York make its money ?
Every company setting up in the city finds itself plugged into its myriad historical , cultural , and regulatory quirks .
The biggest one , of course , concerns our island ’s most precious commodity and its most enduring obsession : real estate .
New York businesses live and die by the rent ; if you ’re a retailer leasing here , “ making the rent ” becomes the yardstick of solvency .
The unofficial golden rule of restaurants dictates that the rent be made in a week and take up no more than a quarter of revenue .
The bar version of the rule is even simpler :
The rent should equal your Friday - night take .
With each year , another company succumbs to the strange realization that where it sits may be more valuable than what it does .
Even Macy ’s , that icon of consumerism , may be worth more as a building than as a store .
We ’ve picked a disparate cross section of New York institutions and examined their inner workings .
Some are nonprofits ( a soup kitchen , a private school ) , some are not profitable ( a fledgling yoga studio , the Yankees — at least on an annual basis ) , and at least one , Goldman Sachs , is stratospherically lucrative ( though a lazy meth dealer ekes out a higher margin ) .
A note :
Where companies would n’t provide figures , our estimates are based on analyst reports , tax filings , and interviews with former and current employees .
We also asked Edward Glaeser , a pioneering urban economist at Harvard , to analyze the New Yorkonomics of the businesses we profile .
His insights are in italic .
Glaeser is an expert in how New York ’s great density makes our lives — and livelihoods — hugely dependent on one another .
We ’re all plugged , at different entry points , into the same awesome web .
A failing restaurant keeps a printer in the black with its incessant flyering .
The sex - toy market rises and falls with the consumer - confidence index .
An eight o’clock Nobu reservation provides a cabdriver with his golden hour .
And everyone — everyone — is cursing the rent .
Except the landlords .
They treat their Nobel prize winners rather differently in the US .
Over here , you 're lucky to get an invitation for a glass of sherry with the vice - chancellor before you scuttle back to your cramped office to fill in a few more speculative grant applications .
But 45 years after winning the Nobel prize - along with British scientists Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins - for discovering the structure of DNA , James " Jim " Watson is still regarded in America as quasi-royalty .
At 79 , Watson no longer gets involved in hard - graft science .
He quit his last high - profile job as head of the Human Genome Project in 1992 after falling out with Bernadine Healy , the newly appointed director of the National Institutes of Health , over the patenting of gene sequences .
His main functions as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ( CSHL ) - the Long Island non-profit , private research institute - are to press the flesh with the great and the good to extract research cash , and to keep a beady eye on the Watson school of biological sciences .
But even as a figurehead , Watson is a celebrity .
He 's a regular on the global conference circuit , and his opinion is often sought by politicians - though recent , and possibly future , presidents wo n't necessarily like what he has to say about them .
" Bush is just a disaster , and the Clintons worry me .
They get their truths from social scientists , not scientists .
I 'm a little afraid of their friends . "
Around Cold Spring Harbor , Watson is spoken of in hushed tones by everyone from the security guard at the front entrance to leading academics ; but then no one raises their voice much above a whisper at Cold Spring Harbor .
When Watson first came to Long Island in the late 1940s , as research assistant to Salvador Luria , a future Nobel winner himself , CSHL was just a couple of ramshackle buildings with a few wooden outhouses .
" We did n't really come to do any serious science , " he says .
" We came to talk , and to escape the intense heat of the Indiana summer .
We did a few experiments , but no one cared much whether they worked or not . "
These days , CSHL looks more like a five - star hotel complex , nestling on the manicured hills of Long Island 's north coast and overlooking a secluded cove stuffed with yachts .
Buy property
The tastefully wood - panelled office in the main building has the feel of a Silicon Valley millionaire 's HQ , and the only truly distinguishing feature of the room is the framed Nobel citation on the wall behind the desk .
Everything else is expensive but a wee bit bland ; everything apart from Watson himself , that is .
Throughout his life , Watson has made few concessions to anyone or anything and , even though he is a committed liberal , political correctness has never featured anywhere on his list of priorities .
Least of all today .
" You should always use your Nobel prize money to buy property , " he laughs .
" My share [ $ 6,000 ] went as a down - payment on a house in Cambridge , Massachusetts . "
" I thought you spent it on paintings , " I reply .
Watson is well - known for an art collection that includes works by Paul Klee and André Derain .
" Oh no , " he says , " the money for them came from royalties from my textbook , The Molecular Biology of the Cell .
It earned me about $ 20,000 , the equivalent of an entire year 's academic salary . "
Like many Americans , Watson is upfront about money .
He 's pleased to have done well for himself , not just for the trappings , but for the freedom of not being hard up .
His parents struggled financially during the Depression , and Watson has always kept one eye on the cash flow while the other was on the science .
" I appreciated being rich , " he says , " because it allowed me to study in Paris and Geneva .
Francis [ Crick ] twice had to pawn his typewriter to fund his research . "
Watson is equally candid about his limitations .
At school in Chicago and at college in Indiana , his grades were more often Bs than As .
So how come he went from being a rather average student to one of the two men credited with making a key scientific discovery of the 20th century ?
" I never had an exceptional mind - I certainly was n't in the same league as Francis , " he says .
" I think I 've succeeded more by learning what needed to be done next , and getting help in getting it done .
I was just very focused and impatient . "
This is n't the academic 's traditional first resort of false modesty .
Self - deprecation is n't part of his make up : he prides himself on telling things straight .
And it 's probably this , as much as anything else , that has got so many colleagues ' backs up over the years .
He strips away the mystery of the scientific process and reduces it to an everyday story of hard work , ambition , opportunism and complex human relationships .
And relationships did n't come much more tricky than those involved in the decoding of the structure of DNA .
For Watson , it is just another modern morality tale , albeit one that should be told with some exaggeration and good humour to make it more interesting for everyone else .
Watson had been working on phages - bacterial viruses - when a meeting with Wilkins in Italy , at which the English scientist talked about his X - ray diffraction data for DNA , persuaded him to change tack .
Watson hooked up with Crick at the Cavendish lab in Cambridge and the rest is history : the two men determined the double - helix solution for DNA .
Watson and Crick never enjoyed the easiest of relationships .
" I wanted to start my book [ The Double Helix ] with the sentence , ' I 've never seen Francis in a modest mood ' but the lawyer wanted me to change it to ' seldom ' , " Watson laughs .
" Francis sometimes lacked a sense of humour .
I also wanted to call the book ' Honest Jim ' , but Francis did n't get the joke ; he thought it implied a dishonesty .
At times , he was a little more square than I thought ; he had this enormous laugh , but not always when the humour involved himself . "
No big deal
Crick might not have been best pleased with Watson 's assessment of his career .
" Francis knew he was n't in the same league as the great physicists and , as the great age of nuclear physics had passed , he moved to biology , which offered more interesting objectives and was less crowded . "
But Watson sees no reason to get precious about these things .
He sees nothing wrong with ambition and , in any case , he reckons solving the structure of DNA was n't quite the big deal it has often seemed since .
Rather it was just the final , incremental nail in a series of experiments and , if they had n't done it , then someone else inevitably would .
They were just lucky to be in the right place at the right time .
Whatever the tensions between Crick and Watson , they were nothing compared with those between the other key players .
" Neither Francis nor I had the courage to call Maurice to say that we 'd solved his problem , " Watson says .
" John Kendrew [ another member of the Cavendish laboratory ] thought it best if we called him to say we had something that might interest him .
Maurice looked at the model , and knew it probably had to be right .
We invited him to put his name to the paper we were writing for Nature , but he phoned from London to say he would be publishing a separate paper in the same issue . "
Watson muses : " He said in his autobiography that it was his biggest mistake not to have put his name on the paper .
But he realised he had n't done it .
Just as we realised that if he had n't shown us the X - ray photo and talked honestly about the data , we would never have been in the game .
But that was fair play .
Everyone was glad when he was later cited as part of the Nobel prize .
No one thought about Rosalind [ Franklin ] , because she was dead . "
Conveniently so , many have argued , as each Nobel prize has a maximum of three citations .
Franklin was a British scientist who died in 1958 and who many believe was never given due credit for her part in the discovery of the structure of DNA , either in her lifetime or since .
How does this square with Watson 's commitment to fair play ?
He smiles .
" Rosalind is my cross , " he says slowly .
" I 'll bear it .
I think she was partially autistic . "
He pauses for a while , before repeating the suggestion , as if to make it clear that this is no off - the - cuff insult , but a considered diagnosis .
" I 'd never really thought of scientists as autistic until this whole business of high - intelligence autism came up .
There is probably no other explanation for Rosalind 's behaviour .
" She showed great insensitivity to Wilkins .
It [ DNA ] was his problem and she just thought she could take it from him .
She was clueless .
John Randall [ the British physicist who led the King 's College team that included Wilkins and Franklin ] told her DNA was going to be her thing and [ she ] took it from Maurice .
But fair play should never have allowed Rosalind to do it .
So she was either not a nice person , or just clueless .
I think clueless .
When you knew her , she was n't nasty ; just awkward .
He adds : " Francis did n't think Rosalind was a great scientist .
That was Francis at his most honest .
The truth was she could n't think in three dimensions very well . "
The assessment is not meant to be as damning as it sounds .
Rather , it is Watson just doing what he always does : telling it as he sees it , not least because he does n't attach the same stigma to mental illness as others do .
For Watson , it 's just a genetic condition , similar to heart disease .
" I 've no time for the Steven Rose types , who argue that schizophrenia is caused by the stresses of capitalistic society , " he says .
" I 've hated them for years .
I 've seen the failure of the environmental approach in a very personal way .
My wife and I have a schizophrenic son .
We did n't want to accept this for 30 years , so we put him under great pressure when we should n't have .
He just wanted to be looked after , and we did n't respect that .
We tried to make him independent . "
Stupid gene
Watson 's insistence on the primacy of nature over nurture in genetics has got him into trouble in the past ; he has been quoted as saying there is a gene for stupidity and genetic screening would allow us to cure the problem .
He feels no reason to back down , merely to qualify .
" I was n't talking about people with a slightly below - average IQ , " he points out .
" I was talking about the bottom 10 % who have severe learning difficulties .
If someone 's liver does n't work , we blame it on the genes ; if someone 's brain does n't work properly , we blame the school .
It 's actually more humane to think of the condition as genetic .
" For instance , you do n't want to say that someone is born unpleasant , but sometimes that might be true .
If you accept that people are the products of evolution , then you have to have an open mind to the truth .
Unfair discrimination exists whether we like it or not ; I would n't have married a gum- chewing vegetarian .
Ultimately , we 'll help the people we discriminate against if we try to understand more about them ; genetics will lead to a world where there is a sympathy for the underdog . "
It 's not always easy to follow the internal logic of Watson 's scattergun stream of consciousness , or to work out which bits he really means and what he 's just saying because he's on a roll and enjoying being provocative .
But he does have a strong sense of self and , when the chips are down , he 's usually to be found on the side of the angels .
As head of the Human Genome Project , he took on Craig Venter 's rival efforts to privatise gene sequences and , if the matter has yet to be resolved , it has n't been lost .
" Eventually , the Supreme Court will have to adjudicate that it's not good for human health , " he shrugs .
Curiously , though , there is no mention of Venter , or his company , Celera , in his idiosyncratic new memoir , Avoid Boring People .
" The book was long enough as it was , " he smiles , " and I did n't think it would be enhanced by what I said about him . "
Though that does n't stop him here .
" Craig wanted to patent his sequences , but it made no sense .
So I said , ' You should n't patent something a monkey could do . '
I think that got to him , because at our next meeting he turned up in a monkey suit . "
Watson has never claimed to have been the best scientist of his generation .
But he 's done some good science , he 's worked with brilliant minds , he 's made friends and enemies in equal measure .
And he 's enjoyed doing it .
" Regrets ? " he muses .
" Nah .
Imagine if I 'd married some of the women I asked .
It would have been a disaster .
You know what ?
I 'd quite like them to make a funny movie out of my book . "
And who would play you ?
" Sacha Baron Cohen . "
Choosing to be diplomatic for the first time in two hours , he declines to say who would play Crick .

John Stottlemire is accused of helping consumers get around coupon printing caps in Coupon Inc. 's proprietary software , allegedly in violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act . *
Photo : Courtesy of John Stottlemire * John Stottlemire is the DVD Jon of coupon - clipping , and it 's getting him in trouble .
The California man is on the working end of a federal copyright lawsuit after posting code and instructions that allow shoppers to circumvent copy protection on downloadable , printable coupons – the type used by General Foods , Colgate , Disney and others to sell everything from soap to breakfast cereal .
The coupons are distributed by Mountain View , California - based Coupons Inc. through ad banners , e-mail and its website , coupons.com .
To use them , consumers must install Coupons Inc. 's proprietary software .
The software assigns each user 's computer a unique identifier , which the company uses to track and control the consumer 's coupon - printing practices , usually limiting each user to two coupons per product .
Each printed coupon has its own unique serial code .
In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose , California , last month , Coupons Inc. accuses Stottlemire of creating and giving away a program that erases the unique identifier , allowing consumers to repeatedly download and print as many copies of a particular coupon as they want .
The lawsuit also charges Stottlemire with posting tutorials on bargain - swapping sites DealIdeal.com and thecouponqueen .
net on how to manually defeat the print limit , which the complaint alleges " would allow users of that software to print an unlimited number of coupons from the coupons.com website . "
Stottlemire , 42 , of Fremont , California , insists there was no encryption or hacking involved , and therefore he did not violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
" I honestly think there are big problems when you are not allowed to delete files off of your computer , " says Stottlemire .
To be sure , Stottlemire 's work differs from the generic online copyright battles involving movies , music or even literature :
He 's accused of liberating something that is already free .
But Coupons Inc. argues the coupon hack is no different from cracks like " DVD Jon " Johansen 's program DeCSS .
Scores of companies contract with Coupons Inc. to release a limited number of coupons for each product .
If somebody cracks the code and downloads hundreds or thousands of them , it 's consumers who lose , according to CEO Jeff Weitzman .
" We 're protecting copyrighted information that is free to consumers already , " says Weitzman .
" We 're trying to make sure everybody can get their fair share . "
Ironically , Stottlemire says his motive was to get a job at Coupons Inc .
" My goal was to show Jeff my capabilities and to ask him for employment , " he says .
But motives aside , Stottlemire says the case now raises bigger issues :
How can a computer owner be prohibited from deleting files from his own computer ?
" All I did was erase files or registry keys , " he says .
" Nothing was hacked .
Nothing was decoded that was any way , shape or form in the way the DMCA was written . "
Legal experts are n't so sure .
" I think it 's a pretty broad statute , " says Carl Tobias , a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law .
" It may cover this .
I think it does give companies a lot of leverage and a lot of power . "
Jim Gibson , a University of Virginia School of Law visiting scholar who teaches copyright law , suggests Stottlemire might be swimming in legally murky waters at best .
" He might be in trouble for providing technology that is designed for essentially hacking around copyright protection , " Gibson says .
" Whether as a matter of public policy there should be a claim against him is a completely different story . "
Stottlemire says he 's being sued because Coupons Inc. " does not have the technology in place that would limit the number of times that a person could print a coupon . "
The 500 brands Coupons Inc. represents also suffer from fraud the old - fashioned way .
They fall victim to photocopying of their coupons .
Weitzman says the company shuts off coupon - printing access to violators if photocopied coupons with the same serial numbers show up at markets .
That hurts the companies ' bottom line , Weitzman says .
" We monitor those things very carefully , " he says .
" If we do see duplicates coming through , we have ways from keeping people from printing coupons in the future . "
The company wants Stottlemire to turn over the names of people he knows downloaded his software , and is seeking damages from the coder that could amount to hundreds of thousands – or even millions – of dollars .
And it 's not offering him 10 percent off .

One warm Sunday evening a few weeks ago , Ethan Hawke ’s every - other - weekend visit with his kids — Maya , 5 , and Levon , 2 — came to a close at Uma Thurman ’s Gramercy Park apartment , and he did n’t know quite what to do .
He thought he would check out the revival of Ingmar Bergman ’s Fanny and Alexander , the story of familial bliss marred by a father ’s death and a mother ’s remarriage , so he trudged down to Film Forum .
He stood in front of the marquee .
Then he thought that if he went in , he was going to get suicidal .
A person ca n’t drop off his kids at his ex-wife ’s and go see Fanny and Alexander , he mused .
So he headed back to his apartment , where his friend Josh Charles , a buddy from all the way back to Dead Poets Society , was crashing in Hawke ’s office –slash–guest room for the duration of his run in Neil LaBute ’s The Distance From Here .
They listened to the new Wilco album and played some poker .
Hawke kept waiting for a friend who was on a date to call — he ’d said that Hawke could meet up with them later — but he never did .
So Hawke watched the second half of the Lakers - Minnesota game , praying for Minnesota to win because he hates the Lakers , and being happy when Minnesota did , indeed , win .
Then he took an obscure frontier - battle book someone had lent him into bed , a bed with caramel - colored sheets that would stay unmade the following day .
So that was a wash of a day , mostly because he did n’t do anything creative , and if Hawke does n’t do at least one creative thing each day , he considers the day “ pissed away , useless , wasted , ” and even gets to feeling that way about himself .
This summer , Hawke ’s schedule includes finishing up a starring role in a remake of John Carpenter ’s exploitation movie Assault on Precinct 13 , filming in Toronto ; constructing a three - bedroom hermitage in Nova Scotia , on an island he bought with Thurman but which most likely will soon be his ; raising money to direct an adaptation of his first novel , The Hottest State ; traveling to South Africa to film a part in Andrew Niccol ’s Lord of War ; and crisscrossing the country on a press junket for Richard Linklater ’s Before Sunset , a reprise of the much - loved 1995 film Before Sunrise that ’s written by Hawke , Linklater , and co-star Julie Delpy ( the film opens on July 2 ) .
He also wants to read for three hours a day , and spend three hours a day working on his next novel , a kind of paean to Somerset Maugham ’s The Razor ’s Edge he ’s making notes for these days , in a small black journal he carries with him most places he goes .
“ I always hear my old football coach talking in my head , ” says Hawke . “ ‘ Two hundred percent , Hawke !
Ordinary effort , ordinary result !’ ” This was the coach who advised Hawke not to quit the team when he was cast in his first movie , the E.T. manqué Explorers , at 12 .
He was discovered at an open call at the then Gulf & Western Building on Columbus Circle , which he attended by train from Princeton Junction , New Jersey , one of the places he moved with his mom after his parents got divorced in Texas when he was 3 .
“ The coach gave me a big speech , ” says Hawke .
“ I was like , ‘ I ’m going to be in a major motion picture , bro ; I ’m going to quit this freshman football team . ’ ” He smiles .
“ He might be right , in hindsight . ”
Hawke ’s drive does n’t manifest itself in casual conversation — and all conversation with him is a fairly leisurely process , as there ’s nothing Hawke likes more than a good long talk that meanders to a point far away , even on a banal topic like the process of interviewing .
“ When I first started acting , it was so uncool to even do an interview , ” says Hawke , sipping a ginger ale from a wide blue straw at Gramercy Park ’s Player ’s Club , an old - timer - thespian hangout .
“ Last time I was here , a guy came up to me and said , ‘ Loved your Hotspur , better than Sean Connery in ’ 60 , ’ ” he says , referring to his widely acclaimed performance last winter in Henry IV at Lincoln Center .
“ I thought falling in love and having a baby were my deﬁning moments , my dark night of the soul .
Then I had another . ”
“ You know , Redford did n’t do interviews , you did n’t see Paul Newman on the cover of some magazine hawking his shit , you did n’t see Nicholson on the Jay Leno show , ” says Hawke .
“ I remember when Reds came out , Warren Beatty did n’t do one press thing — he said , ‘ The movie will speak for itself . ’ ” Hawke sips from the straw .
“ Ginsberg ’s Spontaneous Mind , a collection of all his interviews , is great .
A ton of people know who he is but have n’t read one poem by him , and at the height of his celebrity , he made seventeen grand a year .
Anyway , he decided that more people read interviews than read poetry — so he felt that doing interviews was more a part of his life ’s work , that it was as great a way to communicate with the world as poetry was .
So he ’d try to speak as honestly and put as much thought into those interviews as he did his poetry . ”
Sip , sip , then later : “ You know , though , I always want people to do interviews for me .
However I present myself , there ’s still something fake about it .
’ Cause we ’re all presenting ourselves all the time .
So how does one go about it ? ”
“ Aww , ” he says , setting the ginger ale down and spreading his arms across the back of his chair .
“ I ’m just babbling . ”
Such musings are part of the Hawkean cliché , the sensitive pretty boy hanging around a patchouli - scented dorm hall discussing the meaning of life — “ the Gen - X fruitcake , ” as he describes his persona circa Reality Bites and Before Sunrise ( before then , he was cast mainly as a soulful preppy in male ensemble films ; see Dead Poets Society , Alive , and Midnight Clear ) .
He ’s been called pretentious .
“ I remember one of my really close friends saying , ‘ Hawke .
You gonna play Hamlet ? ’ ” he says .
“ I ’m like , ‘ Why not , man ? ’
He said , ‘ People aregoing to kill you for it .
You write a book , and now you ’re going to play Hamlet ? ’
‘ Look , it ’s got nothing to do with you , bro .
It wo n’t mean shit to you when I ’m dead whether I did Hamlet or did n’t do Hamlet .
Your mama does n’t care if I do Hamlet .
Your mama just wants you to be nice to her . ’ ”
Choosing Thurman as his mate seemed to announce Hawke ’s appreciation of the finer things in life .
She was the highly evolved Tarantino muse with impeccable parental credentials , her father a professor of Indo - Tibetan Buddhist studies at Columbia and the first Westerner to become a Tibetan Buddhist monk , her mother a model turned psychotherapist and a former wife of Timothy Leary .
Ethereal princess and goofball naïf pushed strollers to the Magnolia Bakery and passed time at their farmhouse in Woodstock until the tabloids got wind of Hawke ’s affair with a 22 - year - old on a Montreal film set , reveling in the hypocrisy of the Über - sensitive star who nevertheless cuckolded his wife .
One of Thurman ’s brothers told reporters , “ I want to kill him ” ;
Hawke later pointed to Thurman ’s career as a factor , declaring that he did n’t know if it was simply too difficult to be married to a woman who is a movie star .
Hawke calls last year the worst of his life .
“ Falling in love and having a baby made me feel the whole world changed , ” says Hawke .
“ It brought up issues of faith and love , why would I want to be a parent , what am I living for , what ’s worth dying for — all that interesting stuff .
At the time I thought it was my defining moment , my dark night of the soul .
I realize that ’s not true .
It was one dark night of the soul .
Then you hit another one . ”
On the Monday of the Sunday when he did nothing , Hawke is loping around Chelsea pointing out his favorite diners and record stores .
He ’s wearing ripped - up blue jeans and semi-laced Wallabees , a worn baseball cap with the rooster decal perched high on his head .
The famous goatee , which Hawke shamefacedly reveals as inspiration for his nickname among his close friends —
Goat , short for the Goateed Love Boy — remains intact , as does the ever - present American Spirit drooping from his lip , which he puffs at with thumb and forefinger as though it were a joint ; he says that his doctor told him that he could smoke for a year after his divorce is final .
He says , “ Until I was 16 , I wanted to be Holden Caulfield ; from 16 to 23 , I wanted to be Neal Cassady .
I was n’t cool enough .
I guess after 23 , I tried to be me . ”
The world , however , saw him as representative of a generation , and not always in a good way .
“ When I was younger , I was always so sad that I could n’t ride with the Merry Pranksters , or that I did n’t get to hang out with Allen Ginsberg , ” says Hawke .
“ I found the label Gen X kind of irritating , sure , but I actually like the other people associated with that time , Douglas Coupland or Kurt Cobain , so no shame in that .
When Before Sunrise premiered in Berlin , Linklater and I took off to Barcelona to see R.E.M. , and for some reason at the hotel we ran into Michael Stipe and went to his room and smoked cigarettes .
Rick and Michael were both vegetarians , and they were talking very passionately about that .
It felt very exciting for some reason .
Then we went to the concert , and Michael dedicated his first song to Rick , and we looked at each other like , ‘ That is so cool .
You just got a song dedicated to you in a 35,000 - seat stadium ’— Gen X! Yeah ! ”
Though Thurman and Hawke ’s lives remain intertwined —
“ We ’re both so busy , we need each other to take care of the kids , ” he says — the existences that they are leading today significantly diverge .
Thurman , who has been dating hotelier Andre Balazs , bought a $ 5 million , three - story , six - bedroom house on 19th Street , with intentions of moving in , then flipped it .
Hawke , who has indulged in dalliances but says he ’s found no one special , landed in a hotel in Chelsea that ’s been the site of numerous haute - bohemian triumphs and tragedies , and inspiration for Hawke ’s first feature movie as a director , Chelsea Walls , a dreamy pastiche of Kris Kristofferson monologues and Beat poetry .
The two - bedroom he ’s renting is the kind of place he always wanted to live in , the apartment he had in mind when in younger days he ’d dream of living where Henry Miller might ’ve lived .
“ I ’ve struggled with the belief that anyone who is a really , really serious artist should be poor , ” says Hawke .
“ When the revolution comes , who ’s going to be hung ?
I do n’t want some fancy apartment , ’ cause I do n’t want them to hang me from a chandelier when the revolution comes . ”
In a lot of ways , Hawke takes after his mom , who left the city five years ago to work for the Peace Corps in Romania , sick of feeling like a middle - aged person in New York looking for a date .
“ She likes to read books about Eleanor Roosevelt and great people , and I think she started feeling like her life was incredibly empty , ” he says .
“ I think it also did a weird whammy on her when I got married and had a kid :
My son ’s an adult now . ”
Hawke steps into the elevator .
“ Are you an actor ? ” asks a woman with pinkies linked with a toddler daughter .
“ I am , ” says Hawke .
“ Do you know Ethan Hawke ? ” she asks .
“ I do , ” he says .
“ I was born the exact same moment as him . ”
She looks confused .
“ I am him , ” says Hawke .
“ Oh , I ’m sorry , ” she says .
“ I thought you were Ethan Hawke , and then I noticed your hair was a different color . ”
“ Hmm , ” says Hawke .
“ I ’ve never been a hair - dye guy .
That ’s not my trip . ”
The sun beats into Hawke ’s apartment , and the A/C is on the fritz .
It ’s cluttered and messy , with toys strewn all over , dozens of furry things in a pile near white bunk beds in his kids ’ room , the only air coming in through a small window looking out on an air shaft .
Once inhabited by Andy Warhol star Viva , Hawke ’s bedroom is painted gold and deep blue , with a fresco of the Holy Trinity on the ceiling .
An impish Gabriel lurks over the doorway .
He has a bar - code label stuck to his ankle .
“ I ca n’t take it down , ” says Hawke .
“ It ’s too funny . ”
Mostly the apartment functions as a show - and - tell of Hawke ’s many hobbies .
Wistful black - and - white portraits that he took of his kids rest on the lip of a piano , next to a few guitars —
Hawke likes noodling around on them , especially during downtime on film sets , and is currently teaching himself to play Gordon Lightfoot ’s “ Early Morning Rain . ”
( “ Modern music lacks the spit and piss of good soul music , ” he notes . )
A portrait of the Newton Boys that Hawke painted on that set hangs on one wall .
There ’s a manual typewriter on his desk ; he wrote both his books on it .
“ The computer has destroyed fiction , ” he declares .
“ Paragraphs get so perfectly sculpted they lose all their juice . ”
In the living room , there ’s an art project of a sort going on , though Hawke does n’t have much to do with this one .
Two women are kneeling by a massive slab of plywood that almost covers his threadbare Oriental carpet .
“ What happened to my coffee table ? ” asks Hawke , scanning the room .
“ We threw it out the window , ” one of them deadpans .
The coffee table is actually shoved up against a wall with a dartboard , to make room for the construction of this collage , a housewarming gift from Linklater .
It ’s made up of index - card - size frame grabs — numbers from a projectionist ’s reel , stills of women ’s faces .
The workers are clearly nervous around Hawke , though , and keep asking if he has any advice .
“ Just do it as you think is cool , ” he says , flipping through the rubber - banded stacks of cards .
“ God , this is going to be awesome ! ” he says , and shakes his head .
“ This thing is totally odd !
It ca n’t be pretentious , because it ’s too odd . ”
If Hawke sees Before Sunrise as the high point in his early adult life , then the filming of Before Sunset seems to be functioning as a kind of marker for this phase of life as well .
“ Dead Poets Society was all about how brilliant Peter Weir was — anyone could ’ve played my part , ” says Hawke .
“ But being in Before Sunrise was the closest thing I ever came to being in a band .
Both of these movies are really personal .
There ’s not a goddamn thing Rick , Julie , and I do n’t know about each other . ”
Before Sunrise is the perfect summer movie , recording only the beginning of a romance , with no bitter contrail .
It ’s one night between the Eurailing Hawke and a French graduate student : Adulthood has just arrived for both , and though they fall in love , they do n’t feel compelled to seal their future together .
Before Sunset chronicles one day nine years later , after Delpy appears at a Paris bookstore to see Hawke ’s character read from his new novel , which is largely based on their encounter .
She is now in a dead - end relationship ; he is in an unhappy marriage and makes comments such as these : “ What is love ?
Respect , trust , admiration .
I felt all those things .
So cut to the present tense and I feel like I ’m running a small nursery with someone I used to date .
I ’m like a monk .
I ’ve had sex less than ten times in the last four years .
I feel if someone were to touch me I ’d dissolve into molecules . ”
“ I do n’t know who wrote that , ” says Hawke .
He adds , “ You do n’t make a movie like this without putting some blood , spit , and piss into it . ”
The next day , Hawke had to fly back to Toronto for Assault on Precinct 13 , so he could n’t go to a concert at Irving Plaza he ’d planned to see with some friends , which was a bummer .
So his last night in New York for a while was spent with two of his best buddies , playwright Jonathan Marc Sherman and actor Frank Whaley , and their wives .
They took him to a nice restaurant near Madison Square Park , somewhere he ’d never been before , and he ordered some “ fancy catfish . ”
It was very weird to be sitting in that restaurant with them talking about kids , at the kind of place that they would n’t have been caught dead at ten years ago .
“ I do n’t know what it ’s like to be anybody else , ” says Hawke , “ but what was nice for me about being young is that friendships have a real power and a weight because nobody ’s hooked .
And then slowly everybody starts getting hooked and you have a priority above your friendships , you have a relationship and wife and kids , things that are more important to you than making sure your homey ’s doing all right .
Now here I am , 33 and single again , and all of them are married .
It ’s like , who wants to hang with me , man ?
Nobody . ”

9V LED Lamp
Here ’s a simple project that turns a 9V battery into a fully functional LED lamp .
You ’ll need one new 9V battery , one gutted 9 volt battery , three high intensity LED ’s ( white , 25.000 mcd – 3,8 volt and 20 mA – 35 degrees ) , and one magnet .
Full instructions here .
One drawback :
The benefit of this is that you do n’t have any losses in a resistor and the battery will end up lasting longer – but the LED ’s will not operate on 100 % .

THE CHAOS HAWKS ….
In the beginning were the War Hawks , and much did they counsel the powerful to do battle against the evildoer Saddam .
Then came the war , and the looting , and the Heritage Foundation hordes , and the hawks lamented exceeding loud and many soon repented of their ways .
Yea , verily , they presently transformed themselves into Pottery Barn Hawks , eager to fix the disaster they had helped create and thus redeem themselves in the eyes of the faithful .
In the fullness of time , though , the disaster ripened and flowered and became impossible of resolution , and the hawks despaired .
Success had become unachievable , yea unto their own generation and the generation to come after them .
In short , life sucked .
So what ’s a Pottery Barn hawk to do ?
The answer , lately , is : become a Chaos Hawk .
First , admit that Iraq is hopeless , thus demonstrating that you ’re not completely out to lunch .
After all , the surge has produced only tiny gains in a few highly localized areas and has no chance of replicating those successes on a wide scale .
The Iraqi government is dysfunctional , the police forces are dysfunctional , the army is years away from competence , militias are engaged in a ruthless campaign of sectarian cleansing , infrastructure is declining , and refugees are fleeing the country at a rate of thousands per day .
Having admitted , however , that the odds of a military success in Iraq are almost impossibly long , Chaos Hawks nonetheless insist that the U.S. military needs to stay in Iraq for the foreseeable future .
Why ?
Because if we leave the entire Middle East will become a bloodbath .
Sunni and Shiite will engage in mutual genocide , oil fields will go up in flames , fundamentalist parties will take over , and al - Qaeda will have a safe haven bigger than the entire continent of Europe .
Needless to say , this is nonsense .
Israel has fought war after war in the Middle East .
Result : no regional conflagration .
Iran and Iraq fought one of the bloodiest wars of the second half the 20th century .
Result : no regional conflagration .
The Soviets fought in Afghanistan and then withdrew .
No regional conflagration .
The U.S. fought the Gulf War and then left .
No regional conflagration .
Algeria fought an internal civil war for a decade .
No regional conflagration .
So where does this bogeyman come from ?
Hard to say .
Probably a deep - seated unwillingness to confront the fact that the United States can’t really influence a course of events we originally set in motion .
But Iraq is already fighting a civil war , and that civil war will continue whether we stay or go .
If we go it will likely become more intense , but also shorter lived .
The eventual result , however , will almost certainly be the same : a de facto independent Kurdistan in the north and a Shiite theocracy in the south .
The rest of the Middle East will , as usual , watch events unfold without doing much of anything about them , and will accept the inevitable results .
The U.S. , for its part , will remain in the north to protect Kurdistan , in the east in Afghanistan , in the west in the Mediterranean , and in the south in its bases in the Gulf .
We ’ll hardly be absent from the region .
I think it ’s worthwhile for proponents of withdrawal to be honest about the likely aftermath of pulling out : an intensified civil war that will take the lives of tens of thousands and end in the installation , at least in the short - term , of an Iran - friendly theocracy .
This is obviously not a happy outcome , but neither is it the catastrophe the Chaos Hawks peddle .
The alternative is to babysit the civil war with American troops , spilling blood and treasure along the way , without truly affecting the course of events in any substantial measure .
Politically , this is the key battleground now .
As long as the Chaos Hawks are able to panic the public into believing that withdrawal will result in a Middle East in flames and ten dollar gasoline at home , no Congress will have the backbone to defund the war and force a pullout .
This means that it ’s time for more sensible regional professionals to screw up their courage and tell the truth : pulling out wo n’t be pretty , but if it ’s done prudently neither will it be Armageddon .
The sooner we figure this out , the sooner we can leave Iraq .
Until then , though , our foreign policy will continue to be held hostage to a senseless war that does us no good .
Al - Qaeda will continue to recruit and grow , Afghanistan will slowly slip away , a shooting war with Iran will become more likely , our military will continue being stretched and drained , and our country will become less and less safe .
And all for nothing .
It ’s way past time for us to start formulating a sane national security policy for an age of terror .
Leaving Iraq is the first step .

Pietermaritzburg , South Africa
Having her virginity regularly tested makes South African Nsomawethu Tshobeni feel good .
" At 31 I 'm very proud to be a virgin , and when I attend the test regularly it gives me self - esteem as a woman , " said the nurse who works in the coastal city of Durban .
A revival in the traditional practice among young Zulu women in South Africa is portrayed by supporters as the best way to stop unwanted pregnancies and the spread of HIV / Aids .
But opponents say the practice is sexist and outdated and can even increase the chances of Aids - given the widely held misconception that unprotected sex with a virgin is safe or can cure Aids .
Workshop
Some 200 young Zulu women attended a session in Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu - Natal province ranging in age from seven to 31 .
Human rights activists say virginity testing is demeaning
They met five female elders in a workshop and discussed general sexuality as well as more specific problems .
The physical examination to determine if they have ever had sex seemed very much a secondary part of the proceedings .
How to deal with rape , which is at epidemic levels in South Africa , was one of the topics that came up during the session .
The discussions , however , rarely mentioned condoms , regarded in South Africa as the first defence against Aids .
' Colonialist mentality '
Instead , abstinence was highlighted as the main way to prevent infection .
Nomagugu Gobese , an elderly woman who founded the Nomkhubulwane Culture and Youth Development Organisation and who is dubbed " auntie " by many of the girls who come for testing , is among those who strongly support the tradition .
Female elders discussed general sexuality matters with the girls
Gobese said virginity testing had been practised for hundreds of years and those opposing the tradition , which she likened to a religion , were adopting " a colonialist mentality " .
" The lesson should be to teach the school kids on how to abstain and not to make them think that it 's OK to fall pregnant , " she said .
Makhosaza June has been sending her 24 - year - old daughter for virginity tests every month .
" I have seen the effect on my daughter since she started attending the tests , " she says .
" She now has self - respect and she is the one who wants to attend those tests , I do n't force her . "
Risk
But Loveness Jambaya , of the non-governmental advocacy group Gender Links in Johannesburg , said the practice puts women 's lives into jeopardy .
This event gives me a chance to meet other girls who are virgins .
I now know myself and I 'm responsible for my body
Sthabile Buthelezi , 25
" You are at greater risk of rape because of ( the incorrect ) belief of sex with virgins helping to fight Aids .
And if you 're found to have had sex you are open to being ostracised by the community and all forms of abuse , " she said .
" HIV / Aids is the greatest risk they face . "
For generations Zulu homes have run tests to ensure their daughters fetch a higher " lobola " , the traditional payment made by the groom 's family to the bride 's family .
" It 's unacceptable .
It 's imposed on a girl but not a boy which is unfair , " says Cecilia Ncube of the UN 's women 's rights agency , Unifem in Johannesburg .
" And it stigmatises .
" A man is expected to marry a virgin - if she is exposed then she will be an outcast in the community . "
South Africa 's parliament in 2005 considered a proposal to ban the tests , but the measure was defeated .
Tests
Doctors and Zulu elders concede the tests do not in themselves reveal whether a person is HIV - positive .
But the tests can reveal who may be having unsafe sex and which among them need counselling and possibly treatment .
Supporters add that girls who successfully pass the tests receive reaffirmation for their choice to remain chaste .
Sthabile Buthelezi , 25 , said she had been attending virginity testing sessions since 1994 .
" This event gives me a chance to meet other girls who are virgins , and we can show the whole world that we are virgins .
I now know myself and I 'm responsible for my body , " she said .
For those who say the virginity tests place too much of an onus on women , Nomagugu Gobese has a surprise .
She said she will begin testing boys later .
Medical experts might question her methods , but she said she is sure she will be able to tell who has been having sex .
" Boys should be taught to be good mannered as well , not just girls .
" Otherwise we are fighting a losing battle by concentrating on the girls only , " she said .
Can nanotechnology save LCD TVs ?
( Nanowerk Spotlight )
Many of us do n't like to admit it , but televisions are an important part of our lives .
Technology has improved the quality and convenience of TVs and has given us a whole new set of choices – high definition , plasma , and liquid crystal displays .
With an estimated 66 million sets to be sold this year , flat - screen LCD televisions are the most popular choice .
Much of the reason behind the popularity of these high - tech wonders is the decrease in price that happens with most cool technology – a few years after they have been on the market .
But , for the popular LCD TV , a shortage of a key compound used to produce LCDs may force manufacturers to raise prices .
Electronics suppliers are facing a shortage of the rare metal indium , a co-product of zinc mining .
Indium is a rare , malleable and easily fused metal , similar to aluminum , which is used to make indium tin oxide ( ITO ) , the standard transparent electrode used in nearly all flat panel displays and microdisplays .
Indium is expensive and scarce and demand is increasing .
According to Displaybank , the demand for indium was 861 tons in 2006 and may reach nearly 2000 tons by 2011 .
Five years ago , indium was about $ 100 / kg ; now it costs $ 800 / kg .
Displaybank expects the total sales of indium in 2007 to be $ 533 million .
But , geologists say the cost of indium may not matter soon , because the earth 's supply of it could be gone in four years .
This could put a serious damper on that 52 " LCD screen you 've been dreaming about .
Fortunately , with the help of nanotechnology , a team of scientists in Japan have developed a new material that may replace the need for indium in LCD production .
Transparent substances such as jewels and glass are generally not conductive .
Transparency means that there are no free electrons to scatter light , and therefore , transparency and electronic conductivity are not very compatible ; and the oxides of the light elements , such as Ca and Al , are insulators .
By altering the crystal structure of ordinary alumina cement at the nano - level , Professor Hideo Hosono and his team of researchers at the Tokyo Institute of Technology , have developed a compound that conducts electricity as well as manganese and other metals .
Their research results were published in a recent issue of Nano Letters ( " Metallic State in a Lime - Alumina Compound with Nanoporous Structure " ) .
Regular alumina cement , which is made from a lime - alumina compound ( C12A7 ) , has a crystal structure consisting of asymmetric cages .
These asymmetric cages are poor conductors of electricity .
However , by sealing the nano - compound with titanium in a glass tube and heating it to more than 2,000° F. ( 1,100° Celsius ) , Hosono and his research team were able to change the structure , creating a homogenized , symmetrical cage which conducts electricity .
Tests indicate that the nano - cements electrical conductivity is comparable to that of manganese at room temperature and as its temperature decreases , its conductivity increases .
The team developed several processes that enable the free oxygen ions in C12A7 to be completely replaced with electrons , resulting in a metallic conduction with a sharp enhancement of the drift mobility .
Initially , reducing processes such as Ca vapor treatment results in a replacement of the free oxygen ions with electrons .
Since the Ca treatment is very slow ( 10 days for a 0.4 mm thick sample ) to extract the free oxygen ions , the researchers have devised a titanium treatment of the C12A7 single crystals to dope electrons .
Hosono's team observed that the insulating C12A7 is converted to a metal by replacing more than half of the free oxygen ions by electrons .
They note , though , that the doping and conduction mechanisms in C12A7 are much different from those in conventional semiconductors due to the unique crystal and electronic structures of C12A7 .
Crystal structure of C12A7 .
( a ) Structure of the cage framework .
Free oxygen ions are neglected for simplicity .
The black box shows a cubic unit cell with twelve cages .
Two of the 12 cages encage a free oxygen ion in each cage in the stoichiometric state .
When each free oxygen ion is replaced by two electrons , electron occupancy in the cage is 4/12 .
The cage has a large free space with 0.4 nm inner diameter .
If a cage does not contain an ion , the cage forms a free - electron - like s orbital , as illustrated by the large spheres .
( b) Expanded image showing three cages extracted from ( a ) .
A cage has a free oxygen ion ( illustrated as a light blue sphere ) .
Six Ca ions ( green spheres ) form a part of the cage wall and two Ca ions coordinate to a free oxygen ion or to an empty cage center .
Upon incorporating a free oxygen ion , lattice relaxation is induced as indicated by the arrows : i.e. , the ion-encaging cage shrinks , while the empty cages slightly expand .

The cement could be made nearly transparent by slicing it into thin membranes , creating an ideal substitute for rare metals like indium .
This discovery is the first time an insulator - to - metal ( IM ) transition has been observed in a light metal oxide .
So far , nanotechnologys expectation for electroactive functions has been limited to specific porous materials such as carbon nanotubes , because other porous materials lack conductivity .
The researchers in Japan say that the keys to realizing metallic C12A7 are to utilize the free space of the cages embedded in the unique nanostructure of the C12A7 crystal and to suppress the local lattice relaxation upon the electron doping .
The researchers believe the process can be used to achieve the same metallic state in numerous other compounds , making various abundant light oxide metals formerly believed to be useful only as insulators capable of conducting electricity .
The fascinating perspective opened up by this kind of research could mean that in future materials engineers could take commonly available and abundant materials and ' tease ' novel functions out of them , turning them into more valuable materials and allowing to replace rare and precious materials .
This means the future of LCD displays may be safe after all .
It also means that readily available ( and inexpensive ) light metal oxides may replace other rare materials in electrical applications .

TUNCELI , Turkey ( Reuters ) - Kurdish separatist rebels said on Friday they were crossing back into Turkey to target politicians and police after Ankara said it was preparing to attack them in the mountains of northern Iraq .
As regional tensions rose , Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan cautioned that relations between Ankara and Washington were in danger over a U.S. congressional resolution branding as genocide massacres of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915 .
Washington harbors growing concerns about the possibility of a major Turkish military incursion to crush Kurdish rebels seeking a homeland in eastern Turkey .
U.S. officials fear such an action could destabilize a relatively peaceful area of Iraq .
Ankara recalled its ambassador from the United States for consultations after the U.S. vote , which was strongly condemned in predominantly Muslim but secular Turkey .
“ We do n’t need anyone ’s advice on northern Iraq and the operation to be carried out there , ” Erdogan told a cheering crowd in Istanbul , after saying that the United States “ came tens of thousands of kilometers and attacked Iraq without asking anyone ’s permission ” .
Referring to relations with the United States and the Armenian resolution , Erdogan , using a Turkish idiom usually employed to describe relations , said : “ Where the rope is worn thin , may it break off . ”
He did not elaborate .
“ All prospects look bad ... and relations with the U.S. have already gone down the drain , ” Semih Idiz , a veteran Turkish commentator , told Reuters .
“ If Turkey sets its mind on something , whether wrong or right it will do it .
The invasion of Cyprus in 1974 is a good example , ” he said , referring to a Turkish invasion of northern Cyprus which drew U.S. condemnation and sanctions .
A statement by the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) could increase domestic pressure on Ankara to launch a big offensive that Washington fears could have ramifications in the region .
The United States relies heavily on Turkish bases to supply its war effort in Iraq .
Erdogan said his government was ready for any world criticism if Turkey launched an attack against some 3,000 PKK rebels who use north Iraq as a base to attack Turkish targets .
Ankara blames the PKK for the deaths of more than 30,000 people since the group launched its armed struggle for an ethnic homeland in southeast Turkey in 1984 .
Some analysts say an offensive became more likely after the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee approved the bill on Wednesday .
Relations with Washington have hitherto been a strong restraining force on Turkey .

Turkey denies that genocide was committed but said many died in inter-ethnic fighting .
It remains a sensitive issue , but many Turks are starting to more openly discuss such past taboos .
The PKK statement moved world oil prices back above $ 83 a barrel , traders said .
The Kirkuk oil fields of northern Iraq feed export pipelines running north into Turkey .

ERDOGAN FACES MOUNTING PRESSURE
After a sharp escalation of attacks by Kurdish militants on Turkish troops , Erdogan ’s government , which faces pressure from the public and the army to act , has decided to seek approval from parliament next week for a major operation .
Erdogan said he wanted to secure approval now to avoid spending time later if and when an operation was warranted .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called Erdogan on Thursday to express her disappointment at the U.S. Armenian bill , which the White House has tried to stop .
The non-binding Armenian resolution now goes to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives , where Democrat leaders say there will be a vote next month .
The resolution was proposed by a politician with many Armenian - Americans in his district .
Turkey has cautioned that the bill would have negative consequences for bilateral ties .
Potential moves could include blocking U.S. access to the Incirlik air base , cancelling army contracts , downscaling bilateral visits , denying air space to U.S. aircraft , and halting joint exercises .
Iraqi Defence Minister Abdul - Qadir Mohammed Jasim held talks with Turkey ’s ambassador to Baghdad on Friday to seek ways to improve bilateral ties in fighting terrorism .
Erdogan said Turkey respected Iraq ’s unity but if it did
nothing to stop the PKK , considered a terrorist organization group by Washington , Ankara and the EU , then Ankara had to act .
Analysts and diplomats cast doubt on whether PKK rebels would leave their Iraqi hideouts for the southeast of Turkey where tens of thousands of heavily armed troops are positioned .
“ The guerrillas are not moving to the south ( northern Iraq ) ; on the contrary they are moving to ... places in the north , ” the PKK said in a statement published on Firat news agency .
The PKK said its fighters planned to carry out attacks against the ruling AK Party , the main opposition CHP and the police unless certain conditions were met .
It did not elaborate .
Rumsfeld : France , Germany are ' problems ' in Iraqi conflict
McCain predicts easy victory if war comes
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld Wednesday dismissed French and German insistence that " everything must be done to avoid war " with Iraq , saying most European countries stand with the United States in its campaign to force Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to disarm .
" Germany has been a problem , and France has been a problem , " said Rumsfeld , a former NATO ambassador .
" But you look at vast numbers of other countries in Europe .
They 're not with France and Germany on this , they 're with the United States . "
Germany and France represent " old Europe , " and NATO 's expansion in recent years means " the center of gravity is shifting to the east , " Rumsfeld said .
French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Wednesday in Paris they were not convinced a war with Iraq was necessary while U.N. arms inspectors were still searching Iraq for weapons of mass destruction .
" Any decision belongs to the Security Council and the Security Council alone , which will address the issue after having examined the latest inspectors ' report , " Chirac said .
" Secondly , as far as we 're concerned , war always means failure . "
( Full story )
France holds a veto on the Security Council as one of its five permanent members , while Germany is a key NATO ally and will hold the council 's rotating presidency in February .
" If the inspectors ask for more time , we need to give them more time , " said Schroeder , who has already said he would not send German troops to a war against Iraq .
Bush warns Iraq of war crime trials
President Bush said Saddam had shown he was more interested in " playing hide and seek " than disarming .
" It 's time for us to hold the world to account and for Saddam to be held to account , " Bush said Wednesday in a speech in St. Louis , adding that Saddam presents a " real risk " to the world .
Just days before a report on the status of inspections will be delievered to the U.N. Security Council on Monday , Chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix said Iraq must take further steps to support its claim that it has disarmed , and its cooperation with inspectors is " not sufficient " so far .
U.N. officials have stressed the report would be an update , not a conclusive determination about any Iraqi weapons programs .
Nevertheless , Secretary of State Colin Powell has told Security Council members that " difficult choices " would follow the report .
Sen . John McCain , R - Arizona , said he expects " some kind of resolution of the Iraq crisis , one way or another , " within weeks .
If war comes , " We will win this conflict .
We will win it easily , " he said .
" That does not mean we wo n't experience the tragedy of the loss of some American lives .
We will have an opportunity to instill a democracy in Iraq which will be an example and perhaps force other nations in that region to move in the same direction . "
Bush warned Iraqi military leaders Wednesday not to use weapons of mass destruction against U.S. troops or " innocent lives within Iraq . "
If they do , he said , " When Iraq is liberated , you will be treated , tried , and persecuted as a war criminal . "

Despite saber - rattling , and the Washington buzz that a strike is coming , the president does n’t intend to bomb Iran .
Cheney may have other ideas .
By Steven Clemons
WASHINGTON — During a recent high - powered Washington dinner party attended by 18 people , Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft squared off across the table over whether President Bush will bomb Iran .
Brzezinski , former national security advisor to President Carter , said he believed Bush ’s team had laid a track leading to a single course of action : a military strike against Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
Scowcroft , who was NSA to Presidents Ford and the first Bush , held out hope that the current President Bush would hold fire and not make an already disastrous situation for the U.S. in the Middle East even worse .
The 18 people at the party , including former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , then voted with a show of hands for either Brzezinski’s or Scowcroft ’s position .
Scowcroft got only two votes , including his own .
Everyone else at the table shared Brzezinski ’s fear that a U.S. strike against Iran is around the corner .
In the national debate about America ’s next moves in the Middle East , an irrepressible and perhaps irresponsible certainty that America will attack Iran now dominates commentary across the political spectrum .
Nerves are further frayed by stories like this one , about the Pentagon making a list of 2,000 military targets inside Iran .
The left — and much of the old - school , realist right — fears that Bush means to bomb Iran sometime between now and next spring .
Both would like to rally public opinion against the strike before it happens .
The neoconservative right , meanwhile , is asserting that we will bomb Iran but that we need to get to it posthaste .

As we post this , Jim Gray has been missing for three months .
It now seems very unlikely that he is still alive , although his family has not given up hope .
We decided to publish the following tribute to him , because his life deserves to be celebrated .
James ' Jim ' Nicholas Gray ( born 1944 )
History excels at recording technical achievements , so there is no doubt that in 100 years Jim Gray 's name will still be there in the history books .
After all , he won a Turing Award , the computing equivalent of a Nobel Prize .
That alone assures him a place .
In the database world he will be remembered as the man who worked out how transactions can be performed effectively .
No doubt history will also record the facts of his untimely disappearance - he disappeared on Sunday January 28 , 2007 on a short sailing trip in good weather , and no trace of man or vessel has yet been found .
It is also likely to record the extraordinary fact that , after five days , when the Coast Guard finally gave up searching , the technical world did n't .
Instead , people from many companies including bitter rivals like Oracle , Microsoft , and Google , worked side by side , day and night to continue the search in any possible way they could dream up .
They hired planes and boats and sent them out .
DigitalGlobe volunteered one of its satellites to capture images of the search area .
NASA diverted an ER - 2 ( the civilian version of the U2 spy plane ) to photograph the area .
When the physical images needed rapid transport , an F - 18 magically appeared .
People wrote custom software which chopped up the images and applied image processing .
Amazon hosted the images on the Mechanical Turk website so other volunteers could spend hours poring over them , applying the non-artificial intelligence that might just spot something the algorithms had missed .
The Coast Guard had never seen such a concerted and technically competent response from civilians .
Captain David Swatland , deputy commander of Coast Guard sector San Francisco , said : " This is the largest strictly civilian privately sponsored search effort I have ever seen . "
Given that the search was so unusual , history will probably record it , but I guarantee it will completely fail to record why we all did this .
How come so many people in so many organisations came together to try to find Gray ?
Why did companies fall over themselves to divert resources from top priority projects ?
Why were people from such diverse companies allowed to collaborate so freely ?
The reason is simple : Jim knew a very large number of people and those of us who knew him also loved him .
When it came down to it , we did n't care that he was very bright .
We did n't care that he had a Turing award .
We did n't care who he worked for .
It just so happened that in our many and varied interactions with Jim , the one common factor was that he always gave far , far , more than he took .
We were all enriched by the fact that he was here on the planet and none of us was prepared to accept that he might be gone .
So the co-operation was n't about companies signing declarations of an intention to form an alliance that might , at some point in the future , form the basis of an agreement to work toward a common understanding .
This was about individuals emailing each other and saying : " This is terrible .
What can we do ?
I have this resource , what have you got ? "
This was about people like Joseph M Hellerstein emailing out and Sergey Brin emailing back within the hour offering Google Earth 's satellite imaging expertise .
This was about over 12,000 people who do n't have those kinds of resources , giving of their time to scan endless images of the sea looking for anything that resembled a boat .
So why did we all care so much about him ?
Jim was very , very bright .
He excelled in database technology ( obviously ) but he was also a polymath – he actively worked in areas as diverse as astronomy , medicine , oceanography , and environmental science .
In one sense this does n't make Jim unique – there are a great many human beings around , some of them are bound to be highly intelligent .
Sadly for most , a brain the size of a planet comes with an ego to match .
Not Jim .
He must have been aware that his intellect was unusual , but he was great at ignoring the fact .
Mr Putin has pledged to boost Russia 's defences
The crisis saw the US and Soviet Union go to the brink of nuclear war .
Mr Putin , at a summit with EU leaders in Portugal , said the situation was " technologically similar " .
But he argued there would be no repeat because Russia and the US were " not enemies anymore ... we are partners " and President Bush was a " personal friend " .
The 1962 stand - off was triggered when US spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases in Cuba , within striking distance of the American mainland .
Moscow 's decision to deploy these weapons in Cuba was at the time seen as a response to the build - up of powerful US missiles in Europe .
Tensions were only defused when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the bases in return for guarantees that Washington would not attack communist Cuba .
' Similar situation '
US President George W Bush has said there is a " real and urgent " need for a missile shield in Europe as a defence against possible attack by Iran and countries in the Middle East .
His defence secretary suggested this week that the development of the bases in countries such as the Czech Republic and Poland could be slowed while Russian concerns were addressed .
The US and Russia are eager to develop new missile systems
President Putin said : " Let me recall how relations shaped up in a similar situation in the mid-1960s .
" Similar actions by the Soviet Union , when it deployed missiles in Cuba , provoked the Caribbean crisis .
For us , technologically , the situation is very similar . "
But he said the current tensions would not reach the pitch attained during the Cuban crisis .
" I agree completely with President Bush when he says that Russia and the US are not enemies anymore ... we are partners .
I am fully justified in saying that just as he calls me a friend , I can call him a personal friend too . "
Mr Putin said Russia had put forward proposals in the area of security but " we have unfortunately not yet received any answers " .
US state department spokesman Sean McCormack said there were " clear historical differences " with the Cuban crisis .
" I do n't think that they are historically analogous in any way , shape or form . "
Simmering tensions
EU leaders at the Portugal summit were hoping to speed progress towards a long - term agreement with Russia , that would extend to sensitive areas such as energy supplies .
The EU has been hoping to smooth strained relations with Russia
The EU depends on Russia for a third of its energy needs and has seen gas supplies disrupted for two successive winters .
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso confirmed a deal had been reached on sharing information on energy supplies to pre-empt sudden shortages .
" We have agreed today on a specific early warning mechanism to deal with problems in supply before they become a possible crisis , " he said .
An agreement was also reached in Portugal on working together to curb the trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs and on raising the quota for Russian steel exports to the EU .
The US is adamant that the shield - a sophisticated link - up of radar and missile systems - is intended to catch missiles in mid-air if launched from places like Iran

In separate appeals , both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have urged EU leaders to speak firmly and with one voice about what the groups call the Kremlin 's worsening human rights record .
The Kremlin also opposes the stance pursued by several EU members on Kosovo and Iran .
Russia opposes independence for the Serbian province of Kosovo and has also criticised recent moves to impose sanctions on Iran .
TYLER COWEN tugs popular economics in the direction of self - help : how you can use simple insights and intuitions from economic theory to get more of what you want .
The dust jacket of his book promises tips on love , work and dentistry , and that 's only the start .
There are suggestions for improving your reading habits , surviving torture , getting the dishes done at home , collecting fine art , going to the cinema , giving to charity and ordering food when eating out ( at an expensive restaurant , “ If it sounds bad , it probably tastes especially good ” ) .
If you did n't know that Mr Cowen was an economist , you might take him for a psychologist .
The version of economics advanced here has nothing to do with algebra or interest rates .
It is economics in Ludwig von Mises 's formulation of a “ logic of choice ” .
How do we decide what we want ?
How do we know what other people want ?
If we can make a bit of progress on those two fronts , says Mr Cowen , we can probably improve the quality of our everyday life .
One of his recurrent warnings is to allow for the complexities of human emotions .
What people want cannot always be expressed in money .
You cannot , for example , pay your children to respect you , any more than you might pay your spouse to love you .
And even in situations where cash incentives might seem appropriate , you are liable to come up against the general truth that people hate to feel manipulated .
A teenage child might balk at washing dishes at home to qualify for pocket money — but would willingly do the same thing in the café down the road , where a job and a wage signalled independence .
Mr Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University in Fairfax , Virgina , and a co-owner of marginalrevolution.com , one of the best economics blogs on the internet .
At George Mason he has helped to build a creative and widely admired economics faculty .
The seriousness of his academic credentials should still any doubts about the conversational tone of his writing .
This could easily have been a much longer and more densely argued book had the author so wished .
Even so , and allowing for the intended general readership , it is still prone to skip from idea to idea with little pause for thought — a virtue in blogging , where ideas are floated for debate , but less so in a book , where the reader expects rounded argument .
“ Discover Your Inner Economist ” joins a recent school of books demystifying and popularising economics that began with Steven Landsburg 's “ Armchair Economist ” in 1993 , and conquered the bestseller lists in 2005 with “ Freakonomics ” by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner .
It stands apart from its predecessors by making its revelations not so much about the way the world works as about the way we ourselves work ( and play ) and how we can take practical steps to do both better .
Mr Cowen 's model for running better meetings is hard to beat : put in place a system ( he suggests body sensors ) that enables participants to signal their boredom anonymously .
When everyone is known to be bored , the meeting halts .
It 's a pity , however , that Mr Cowen does n't really arrive at any useful advice for keeping the dentist in line .
The problem here , to extend his line of argument , may be that you want a dentist whose supreme value is to avoid inflicting pain ; yet who , with that supreme value , would ever become a dentist ?
I found this note with one page of Haskell code , without comments , when I was cleaning up my files .
It took me quite a while to figure out what it might probably be about : given a list , zip its first half with the reverse of its second half , in only “ one and a half ” traversals of the list .
It gives us a fast algorithm to , for example , check whether a list is a palindrome .
I thought it was probably something we discussed in AoP , but it turns out that I must have taken the note when people in IPL were studying There and Back Again of Danvy and Goldberg .
Recorded in the note was my attempt to understand it .
Let convolute ( xs , ys ) = zip xs ( reverse ys ) and half be a function cutting a list in half , the problem is simply specified by revzip = convolute .
half .
The first trick is that convolute can be expressed in terms of its generalisation :
> convolute :: ( [ a ] , [ b ] ) -> [ ( a , b ) ] > convolute = fstn .
uncurry walk > where fstn ( xs , [ ] ) = xs
where walk is defined by :
walk xs ys = ( zip xs ( reverse ( take n ys ) ) , drop n ys ) where n = length xs
The reason introducing walk is that it can be defined as a fold :
> walk = foldr ( (. ) . shift ) ( split ( nil , id ) ) > shift x ( zs , y:ys ) = ( ( x , y ) : zs , ys ) > nil _ = [ ]
But the definition below is probably a lot more comprehensible :
walk [ ] ys = ( [ ] , ys ) walk ( x : xs ) ys = shift x ( walk xs ys )
Some of these auxiliary functions should be part of the Haskell Prelude :
> prod ( f , g ) ( a , b ) = ( f a , g b ) > split ( f , g ) a = ( f a , g a )
The following implementation of half splits a list into two halfs using two pointers :
> half :: [ a ] -> ( [ a ] , [a ] ) > half = race .
dup > race ( xs , [ ] ) = ( [ ] , xs ) > race ( _:xs , [ _ ] ) = ( [ ] , xs ) > race ( x:xs , _: _:ys ) = cross ( ( x : ) , id ) ( race ( xs , ys ) ) > dup a = ( a , a )
Furthermore , uncurry f = apply .
prod ( f , id ) where
> apply ( f , a ) = f a
Therefore the specification has become :
revzip = fstn .
apply .
prod ( walk , id ) . race .
dup
Now we try to fuse prod ( walk , id ) . race and get
> wrace ( xs , [ ] ) = ( split ( nil , id ) , xs ) > wrace ( _:xs , [ _ ] ) = ( split ( nil , id ) , xs ) > wrace ( x:xs , _: _:ys ) = prod ( ( shift x . ) , id ) ( wrace ( xs , ys ) )
Hence the result :
Escalating his debate with civil liberties advocates , Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he had '' no problem ' ' with the DNA testing and fingerprinting of all newborns , although he did not propose actually gathering such records .
The Police Commissioner , Howard Safir , is already drawing both criticism and support for his new proposal that the police take DNA samples from the hundreds of thousands of people arrested every year in the city .
Mr. Giuliani , who backs the police plan , broadened the debate in a speech and news conference yesterday by endorsing the use of DNA tests in intensified city efforts to identify '' deadbeat ' ' fathers and force them to support their offspring financially .
Children in single - parent homes are eight times more likely to commit crimes than those in intact families , he said .
Asked whether the DNA samples from children in support cases should also be given to law enforcement agencies , the Mayor said : '' The same way fingerprints are available , DNA should be available . ''
He called DNA tests ''a wonderful protection for the innocent and another method of catching the guilty , '' as well as a tool for determining paternity .
Seymour Hersh reveals shocking new details of Abu Ghraib ; ' Father and son forced to do acts together ' John Byrne and David Edwards
Published : Sunday June 17 , 2007 Print This Email This
In a Saturday interview with CNN's Late Edition , veteran New Yorker reporter Seymour Hersh revealed new details about the coverup of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal .
His new piece in the magazine can be read here .
" The notion ... that our leader , Donald Rumsfeld , the Secretary of Defense and his aides , they all went and testified in May after the stories about Abu Ghraib became public that 'oh my God , we just did n't know about , we did n't realize how serious it was , ' is simply not true . "
Blitzer asks Hersh about a quote given by Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba said in a May 6 , 2004 meeting with Rumsfeld , then - Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and top brass at the Pentagon .
" I described the naked detainee lying on the wet floor , handcuffed , with an interrogator shoving things up his rectum and said , ' That 's not abuse , that 's torture , ' " Taguba said .
" There was quiet . "
The following day , May 7 , Rumsfeld testified before the House Armed Services Committee .
" It breaks our hearts that in fact someone did n't say wait , look , this is terrible , " Rumsfeld said .
" We need to do something to manage -- the legal part of these proceeding along fine .
What was n't proceeding along fine was that the president did n't know , and you did n't know and I did n't know and as a result , somebody leaked a secret report to the press and there they are . "
Hersh scoffs at Rumsfeld 's response .
" It 's sort of ridiculous .
Everybody at the top , by the middle of January , knew , " Hersh said .
" The only question I raise at the end of the article , is what the president know , when ? "
Blitzer reads the White House response .
" The President addressed this fully , " a White House statement says .
" He first saw the pictures on TV and was upset by them .
He called for the investigation to go forward .
He found the actions abhorrent and urged the Defense Department to get to the bottom of the matter . "
" It 's not when they saw the photographs , " Hersh stresses .
" It 's when they learned how serious it was .
They were told in memos what the photographs showed ...
They showed other , more sexual abuse than we knew , sodomy of women prisons by American soldiers , a father and his son forced to do acts together .
There was more stuff [ than ] was made public .
You did n't need a photograph if you had a verbal description of it .
" It 's quite implicit , " he added .
" They knew very quickly this was bad . "
Studies have found that 24 % of small businesses spend more than 120 hours a year dealing with employee federal tax issues .
No business , small or large , wants to deal with such a level of risk or wasted hours .
The good news is , the development of payroll system software allows business owners to handle their payroll within minutes without leaving themselves open to tax issues .
It ’s important to remember that there is a wide variety of payroll software to choose from .
Which option is best for you depends on your unique work style .
We take a look at some of this software below so you can decide what ’s best for your business .

TO A man with a hammer , Mark Twain once said , everything looks like a nail .
One hammer that has seen lots of use in recent years is the type of mathematical relationship known as a power - law distribution .
Such distributions have been observed in phenomena as diverse as earthquake magnitudes , the sizes of personal fortunes , and the number of visits made to websites .
They have not , however , shown up in diagnostic medicine — at least , not until now .
In this week 's Physical Review Letters , Yoshiharu Yamamoto of the University of Tokyo and his colleagues explain how the movements of people suffering from clinical depression can be described by a power law — and how this law is so different from that of healthy people that it looks truly diagnostic .
Like many mathematical functions , a power law plots two variables against each other to form a characteristic curve on a graph .
Dr Yamamoto collected the data for his own particular power - law curves by fitting his experimental subjects — about half of whom were healthy , and half of whom had been diagnosed as having clinical ( or “ major ” ) depression — with accelerometers .
These devices measure how often someone changes his rate of movement by recording each time his acceleration exceeds a certain threshold .
The basic results confirmed a known feature of depressed people .
The normal daily rhythm that would lead to a high , steady number of counts during daylight hours and low counts during the night was replaced by occasional bursts of activity .
The surprise came when the team started plotting their results out on graphs .
The curves produced by plotting the lengths of low - activity periods against their frequency were strikingly different in healthy and depressed people .
This reflects not inactivity by the depressed ( though they were , indeed , less active ) but a difference in the way that the healthy and the depressed spread their resting periods over the day .
Depressed people experience longer resting periods more frequently and shorter ones less frequently than healthy people do .
That discovery may provide another way of diagnosing major depression — although if it were indeed to become a diagnostic tool , someone would first have to show that the pattern for those experiencing minor , non-clinical depression was not the same as that shown by the clinically depressed .
Another diagnostic tool would be welcome , though , because current diagnoses often depend on self - reporting , which can be unreliable .
But Dr Yamamoto 's result is not merely of practical significance .
It also raises an interesting question about the nature of depression itself .
That is because , when he looked for similar power - law curves in other areas , the one which he thought most resembled that exhibited by the depressed turned out to be the pattern of electrical activity shown by nerve cells isolated in a Petri dish and unable to contact their neighbours .
It is both unnerving and intriguing that a mental disorder which isolates people from human society , and which must surely have its origins in some malfunction of the nerve cells , is reflected in the behaviour of cells that have themselves been isolated .
Maybe this is just a coincidence — another example of Mark Twain 's hammer .
But maybe it is not .
Suit against blogger a legal test in Paris , Texas Suit against blogger weaves legal web in Paris , Texas
Hospital 's pursuit of critic 's identity tests the limits of speech and privacy
An unlikely Internet frontier is Paris , Texas , population 26,490 , where a defamation lawsuit filed by the local hospital against a critical anonymous blogger is testing the bounds of Internet privacy , First Amendment freedom of speech and whistle - blower rights .
A state district judge has told lawyers for the hospital and the blogger that he plans within a week to order a Dallas Internet service provider to release the blogger 's name .
The blogger 's lawyer , James Rodgers of Paris , said Tuesday he will appeal to preserve the man 's anonymity and right to speak without fear of retaliation .
Rodgers said the core question in the legal battle is whether a plaintiff in a lawsuit can " strip " a blogger of anonymity merely by filing a lawsuit .
Without some higher standard to prove a lawsuit has merit , he said , defamation lawsuits could have a chilling effect on Internet free speech .
" Anybody could file a lawsuit and say , ' I feel like I 've been defamed .
Give me the name , ' " Rodgers said .
But there is little case law in Texas or nationally to give judges a standard for when to expose anonymous postings on the Internet .
" Right now it 's a very murky area of the law , " Rodgers said this week .
Since March 2005 , The - Paris - site blog has been relentlessly critical of the business management and health care provided by the Paris Regional Medical Center , owned by Essent Healthcare Inc. of Nashville , Tenn .
" Quality issues are in play , patients are avoiding the facilities unless they have no choice , and employees are only staying because their families anchor them , not because of any loyalty to Essent , " is a mild example from an April blog posting .
Commenters targeted , too
The blogger identifies himself under pseudonyms of fac_p and Frank Pasquale .
Most blog commenters — some of whom appear to be hospital employees — are anonymous .
In June , Essent filed a defamation lawsuit in state district court against " John Does 1 - 10 " for postings and comments made on the Paris blog , which the suit says has had 169,272 page views " from sites throughout the United States and the rest of the world " since it began .
The lawsuit also claims patient privacy was violated under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act , HIPPA .
" We understand and respect the blogger and general public 's right to voice their opinions about PRMC and welcome constructive criticism , " the company said in a statement issued this week .
" However , the method used by the defendants is wholly unacceptable .
It is a cowardly infringement on the confidentiality rights of PRMC patients and an unwarranted attack on the reputation of the hospital . "
The company claims in one instance , the blog posted enough information on a patient death to identify the patient before the family was notified .
Essent asked District Judge Scott McDowell to order a Dallas Internet Service Provider to release the blogger 's name .
Federal law bars an ISP from releasing the name of a customer without a court order .
McDowell on Monday notified lawyers for Essent and for the blogger that he will be issuing such an order within the next week .
" The only thing this might do is silence an open criticism of Essent 's method of doing business , " fac_p said on the blog in reaction to the judge 's notice .
Fac_p said on his blog that what Essent really wants is the names of hospital employees who have posted comments on his site or given him information .
Rodgers said these employees could be considered whistle - blowers .
Spokeswoman Kim Fox said Essent is pleased that McDowell will order the release of the blogger 's name , because now the lawsuit can proceed .
Fox said Essent 's biggest concern is that the blogger has said some hospital employees have given him patient records .
Even though they have not been posted on the blog , Fox said this represents a violation of federal law and the company needs to find the employees who are doing it .
But Rodgers said the next step will be some sort of appeal .
He said the problem is that Texas has no appeal procedure for an anonymous defendant who actually has n't been served the lawsuit .
Lawsuit part of trend
The blogger 's lawyer said he is studying how to appeal to the 6th Court of Appeals in Texarkana or to file a lawsuit in federal court .
He said he also hopes groups that deal with free speech and Internet privacy issues will get involved .
Rodgers said the question is not whether a plaintiff in a defamation lawsuit should be able to get the name of an anonymous blogger , but " what hoops they have to jump through " before violating the blogger 's free speech rights .
The number of corporate and political lawsuits around the country against " John Doe " bloggers has been growing dramatically since 2000 , said University of Florida law professor Lyrissa Barnett Lidsky , an expert on these types of lawsuits .
Lidsky , a Texas native and graduate of the University of Texas law school , said most Internet libel lawsuits are brought to " chill the speech of bloggers , " though some involve genuine defamation .
" It is evolving .
You 're seeing courts struggling to accommodate different interests , " Lidsky said .
" On the one hand , you do have a right to speak anonymously .
On the other hand , you do not have the right to defame people . "

Chews your poison ...
These Ten Strange and Unusual Japanese Chewing Gums are really not bad as chewing gum goes - some are actually quite good !
Japanese chewing gum differs from American chewing gum in many ways , and that probably is a result of the practical way Japan looks at chewing gum .
Since it 's merely chewed for a while and then disposed of , it just makes sense for chewing gum to serve some function , ANY function before being spat out .
This way of thinking can produce some VERY strange and unusual types of chewing gum , and from them we 've assembled this Top Ten list !
Now then , let 's get down to the good , the bad and the sticky !
10 ) No Time Gum : Eat Your Toothbrush !
No time to brush your teeth ?
No problem - if you 've got !
This multifunctional minty mélange contains tiny granules that scrub your teeth clean as a whistle while you chew .
Is this cool , or what ?
Gum that works as hard as you do while saving you time and , presumably , dentist visits .
I can just hear Mom now ...
9 ) " Man Smell " Gum - Not Just for Athletic Supporters
8 ) Chewing Gum with After - Wrappers - A Neat Idea
Yes , the title threw me too , but that 's whattranslates to .
Luckily there 's much more to it than that - like the previously mentioned Fuwarinka Scented Gum , Man Smell gum contains those special Rose oils that escape through your skin after chewing .
This one exudes a manly Menthol Rose aroma , not just your average sweaty - guy funkiness .
Let 's be thankful for that , at least .
7 ) Digi-Gum : 4 out of 5 Nutty Professors Agree !
Perhaps frightened by word of the infamous Singapore Chewing Gum Ban and Caning Bylaw , the manufacturers of ( pronounced " Zee- Lish " ) gum decided to add a packet of after - wrappers to their plastic jug o' gum .
When you 're ready to ditch your chaw , just wrap & toss into the nearest trashcan .
This is actually a wonderful idea that other gum manufacturers should follow , it would save the look of our streets by giving people a viable gum disposal option instead of just spitting it out .
More Xylish gum , this time in " Funky Orange " flavor .
The gum itself is n't odd , but the character on the pack is ... it sure looks a lot like Jerry Lewis in full - out Nutty Professor mode .
Why " Digi - Gum " ?
Who knows , but does n't that sound hip & trendy ?
The gum 's active ingredient , Xylitol , is very popular in Japanese gums - it 's sweet but does n't cause tooth decay .

6 ) Sparkle Ninja Chewing Gum , for Flamboyant Ninjas
5 ) Black Black Gum - Bigger and Blacker than Before
Strawberry flavoredisn't Japanese , it 's just acting that way .
I mean , who ever heard of a ninja in a pink outfit ?
Not that there 's anything wrong with that ... but is n't being un-noticeable the whole point of being a ninja ?
Then again , walking down most any major Japanese city street clad in sparkling pink tights is n't going to draw much attention these days anyway .
4 ) Xylish Platinum Mint Chardonnay Flavor - Smell Drunk , Stay Sober
Did n't they used to sell black gum on the back pages of comic books ?
Or was it black soap ?
In any case , is not for the faint of heart .
Just ask Jean - Claude van Damme ... the " Muscles from Brussels " promoted the macho chew in a series of Japanese TV ads .
According to the print on the package , Black Black Gum has a .
It also has caffeine , niacin and a really powerful licorice - mint taste , making it ideal for those late night cram sessions before a high technical college exam .
3 ) Fuwarinka Scented Gum : Come Out Smelling Like a Rose
So you 're driving along on a dark evening , not a care in the world , until those telltale flashing lights appear - you 've been pulled over by The Law .
What NOT to do ?
Pop a stick ofin your mouth while waiting for Officer Smith to sidle up alongside .
Imagine the fun you 'll have , watching him puzzle over the Breathalyzer readings while you exhale wine - breath into the tester yet one more time !
Wine - flavored gum ... puts those English " Wine Gums " to shame !
And , it 's the perfect way to disguise a visit to a bar .
2 ) Sex Gum for Men : Like Chewable Viagra ?
Now here 's a radical idea that , curiously , has n't caught on outside Japan : gum that makes your breath AND your body smell good !
Futuristiccontains the aromatic compounds geraniol and linalool which , when swallowed , waft either Fresh Citrus or Fruity Rose aromas through your skin !
Just imagine how much money you 'll save on cologne , aftershave and deodorant ?
1 ) Bust Up Gum : It Blows Up Your Bubbles !
contains a variety of natural herbs and extracts proven ( they say ) to improve blood flow and muscular function - and they do n't mean in your arms , regardless of what the ad photo displays .
The gum also contains something called " plant testosterone " ... hey , have you ever seen a limp tree ?
Sorry ladies , if you thought that a Japanese " sex gum for women " was going to be the complement of the just mentioned Suplitol Tongkat Ali Gum for Men , you 're going to be sadly disappointed - and probably more than a little annoyed .
Bust Up Gum , the female sex gum from B2UP , just makes the fairer sex more sexy - in the eyes of the opposite sex !
None of that blood flow stuff , noooo ... according to B2UP , the special ingredients , " extracts from the Pueraria mirifica ( Kwao Krua ) plant , makes a woman 's breasts grow as well as improving their shape and tone . "
I did n't know breasts HAD a tone - unless it 's High C ( or B Flat ) .
Still , it 's amazing ... boob - enhancing gum .
They could call it Double Bubble if the name was n't already taken .
Bust Up gum is just the latest Japanese food product containing Pueraria extracts - others include F - Cup Tea and F - Cup Cookies .
Ca n't say they 're not confident in their products !
Y'know , Bust Up gum has the potential to replace Ex - Lax chocolate as the snack schoolyard pranksters offer their unsuspecting targets .
Can you imagine the expression on some poor proto - geek 's face after being told he just chewed Bust Up gum ?
Let 's hope that scenario remains in the field of imagination !

In 1911 the discovery that the world was billions of years old changed our view of the world for ever .
Imagine trying to understand history without any dates .
You know , for example , that the First World War came before the Second World War , but how long before ?
Was it tens , hundreds or even thousands of years before ?
In certain situations , before radiometric dating , there was no way of knowing .
By the end of the 19th century , many geologists still believed the age of the Earth to be a few thousand years old , as indicated by the Bible , while others considered it to be around 100 million years old , in line with calculations made by Lord Kelvin , the most prestigious physicist of his day .
Dr Cherry Lewis , University of Bristol , UK , said : " The age of the Earth was hugely important for people like Darwin who needed enormous amounts of time in which evolution could occur .
As Thomas Huxley , Darwin 's chief advocate said : ' Biology takes its time from Geology ' . "
In 1898 Marie Curie discovered the phenomenon of radioactivity and by 1904 Ernest Rutherford , a physicist working in Britain , realised that the process of radioactive decay could be harnessed to date rocks .
It was against this background of dramatic and exciting scientific discoveries that a young Arthur Holmes ( 1890 - 1964 ) completed his schooling and won a scholarship to study physics at the Royal College of Science in London .
There he developed the technique of dating rocks using the uranium - lead method and from the age of his oldest rock discovered that the Earth was at least 1.6 billion years old ( 1,600 million ) .
But geologists were not as happy with the new results as , perhaps , they should have been .
As Holmes , writing in Nature in 1913 , put it : " the geologist who ten years ago was embarrassed by the shortness of time allowed to him for the evolution of the Earth 's crust , is still more embarrassed with the superabundance with which he is now confronted . "
It continued to be hotly debated for decades .
Cherry Lewis commented , " In the 1920s , as the age of the Earth crept up towards 3 billion years , this took it beyond the age of the Universe , then calculated to be only 1.8 billion years old .
It was not until the 1950s that the age of the Universe was finally revised and put safely beyond the age of the Earth , which had at last reached its true age of 4.56 billion years .
Physicists suddenly gained a new respect for geologists ! "
In the 1920s the new theory of continental drift became the great scientific conundrum , and most geologists were unable to accept the concept due to the lack of a mechanism for driving the continents around the globe .
In 1928 Arthur Holmes showed how convection currents in the substratum ( now called the mantle ) underlying the continents could be this mechanism .
This proved to be correct but it was another 40 years before his theories were accepted and the theory of plate tectonics became a reality .
The theory of plate tectonics has proved to be as important as the theory of evolution and the discovery of the structure of the atom , but without the discovery of how to quantify geologic time , confirmation of plate tectonics would not have been possible .
Today , few discussions in geology can occur without reference to geologic time and plate tectonics .
They are both integral to our way of thinking about the world .
Holmes died in 1964 having lived just long enough to see sea floor spreading confirm his ideas of continental drift .
Chiquita said it made " protection " payments after threats to staff
In March , Chiquita pleaded guilty to paying $ 1.7 m ( £ 850,000 ) to the United Self Defence Forces of Colombia ( AUC ) .
The firm said its only motive was the safety of its Colombian workers .
It agreed to pay the $ 25 m to resolve an inquiry by the US justice department , a settlement that Judge Royce Lamberth has now authorised .
Prosecutors had said Chiquita Brands International paid the money between 1997 and 2004 to the AUC in return for " protection " .
The AUC , which is listed by the US and EU as a terrorist organisation , has carried out massacres and assassinations , although it is now engaged in a peace process in Colombia
Prosecutors said Chiquita also made payments to Colombia 's main left - wing rebel group , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Farc ) .
The company 's former Colombian subsidiary operated in areas where there was a strong presence of both armed groups .
Chiquita , which has its headquarters in Cincinnati , Ohio , said in March that it would pay the $ 25 m fine as part of a settlement with the department of justice .
A three - year inquiry by US investigators began after Chiquita approached the department in 2003 to say its branch in Colombia had been making the payments after workers were threatened .
Chiquita has since sold the Colombian arm of its business .
Thousands of Colombians have died in four decades of conflict involving the Farc , the AUC and other armed groups .

Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature , but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary .
Scheme demonstrates that a very small number of rules for forming expressions , with no restrictions on how they are composed , suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language that is flexible enough to support most of the major programming paradigms in use today .

I am by no means a major contributor , but I do have an ongoing interest in the language and the systems that have been built to run it efficiently .
Once upon a time I was a SRFI editor , and I participated in the voting on R6RS .
Today ( 2007 - 08 - 16 ) , it looks as if R6RS is going to be standardized .
Given the R6RS charter , the ratification process and the votes , I do n't see that there can be any other outcome that does not violate the rules for approving the new standard document .
This is unfortunate because there are several serious problems with the standard .
They are largely outlined in the no votes ; however , there are several yes votes that also indicate problems .
I wo n't repeat the verbage of those who are either smarter or more involved in the process than I am here , except to say that I am very surprised that people cited my opinions as being relevant .
Now today ( 2007-08 - 25 )
I have been pointed to the notes from the discussion which started this whole process .
And they are very interesting .
It is nowhere near as democratic as people seem to think ( [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] ) , but on the other hand , there appears to have been a definite intention to push the community into places it may not have wanted to go ( [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] ) and what looks to me like an endorsement of " Worse is Better " as a language design philosophy .
As Brian Harvey pointed out way back in 1991 , this may actually have been a predictable outcome .
All of the politics are not particulary relevant to the overriding issue of havong a high - quality technical document .
At least I am not particularly opposed to the growth in the size of ' Standard ' Scheme , as long as it has been done in a way that is consistent with the principles outlined by Will Clinger ( above ) and is technically sound .
That is not the case and is clearly shown in the votes ( and other parts of the ongoing discussion ) .
Given the political foundations of the process , it is possible and maybe even desirable for the Steering Committee to intervene .
This is probably even more true if you consider the use of Scheme in Computer Science education .
There is a significant tension between practical features and theoretical elegance which has been a hallmark of Scheme for quite a long time .
However , it seems that in recent years , the trend in CS education has been towards more practical work and less theoretical .
In my opinion , This is a bad thing .
For one it promotes really bad engineering , but the real problem , as Brian Harvey implied , is that knowing the tool - du - jour is very different from knowing the structure of a large class of tools .
The beauty of Scheme is that it has reified the structure of a truly huge range of tools into a fairly simple programming language .
Now because of Turing completeness , we know that , beyond certain minimal limits , it is foolish to speak about the ' expressive power ' of computer languages - nevertheless we do find very real , and very practical , esthetic differences between languages .
I , and others , would argue that Scheme not merely balances the expressive power and pedagogical simplicity , but that the necessities of teaching CS theory through Scheme have made it an excellent language for delivering solutions .
Apparently many students ( and the faculties which live off their tuition fees ) do not feel that way anymore .
Too bad .
As R. W. Hamming argued in his book Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers , students are n't really qualified to know how they should be taught .
And the corporate world is structurally unable to understand ( much less adopt ) a good tool when it becomes available .
I think that the larger point is simply that following the crowd is a losing strategy .
It certainly is not the way that Scheme became the language it is today .
So to summarize , I fully believe that the R5.97RS draft should not be ratified , no matter what the votes say .
Maybe this is bad sportsmanship on my part , but I prefer to think it is because we should be working towards something better than a mere community consensus ( which process was not even put in place by the community ! ) .
There are even technical and procedural reasons for not approving the current draft above and beyond what I have outlined here .
It is not up to the technical standard of either R4RS or R5RS , and that is what will ultimately determine the uptake by the community .
Or alternatively , a language specification split which will be no less legitimate than R5.97RS .
10 Reasons You Need an IT Architect
Every IT organization needs skilled architects who are experienced in designing systems , databases , networks and user interfaces .
In this article I ’ll give you 10 reasons .
1. Architecture is critically important to IT .
Let ’s start with a definition .
In my book , Boiling the IT Frog , I explain the IT use of the word “ architecture ” this way :
For a building like a house or a skyscraper , the word “ architecture ” refers to the way that building materials are assembled to form a structure .
Similarly , the architecture of an information system refers to the way that software and hardware components are assembled to form the overall system .
Just as building architecture has styles , IT architecture has different styles for system construction .
Just as building architecture has building codes and best practices to ensure the safety and longevity of a building , IT architecture has system standards and best practices to ensure the security and longevity of a system .
And just as building architecture has approaches which make the maintenance and alteration of a building easier and less expensive , IT architecture has approaches which make the maintenance and alteration of software easier and less expensive .
The book then talks about architecture ’s critical importance :
The architecture part of the IT strategy is often omitted , but this omission is a huge mistake .
Would you want someone to build a new city without a plan for where the streets should go or how the buildings should look ?
An IT strategy without an architecture definition is similar — systems would be developed without regard for how they will fit together or even how they should be built to minimize ongoing cost .
In an IT organization without an architecture , it ’s not uncommon to do the equivalent of adding two additional floors to a building which has a foundation that was n’t designed to support the extra floors .
2 . The IT architect focuses on how to do things , while the CIO focuses on working with the business to determine what to do .
As I said in my book , the most common IT mistakes are doing the wrong things – not doing things wrong .
The CIO has to concentrate on figuring out what to do , but someone else has to figure out how to do those things .
That ’s the architect ’s responsibility .
3 . In companies with centralized IT , the IT architect must manage the architecture approach being used by each IT project .
One of the biggest advantages of centralized IT is the efficiency gained by using common approaches and standards .
The architect makes that efficiency possible .
4 . In companies with decentralized IT , the IT architect must coordinate the architecture approaches being used by the individual decentralized IT organizations .
Even in decentralized IT , there is a need to share data and information across the various parts of the company , to present a unified view of the company to customers and employees , and to maximize the sharing of effort being expended by each decentralized IT organization .
Decentralization does n’t imply anarchy , and even in companies which have decentralized total control of IT , someone should facilitate sharing of architectural information across those decentralized IT organizations .
5 . In a company which uses off - the - shelf packaged software like ERP or CRM , or software - as - a - service applications like those from Salesforce.com , the IT architect has to figure out a way to sew together all of the different disparate systems so that they can talk to each other .
In an ideal world ( I wish I saw this more ) , the architect would also be involved in the decision to buy a particular off - the - shelf packaged software solution , so that the solution could be evaluated based on the difficulty of integrating it with the company ’s existing systems .
6 . In a company environment where business people make systems decisions based on articles in airline magazines , the IT architect has to clean up the mess made by the poor system choices .
This is sort of like the Winston “ the Wolf ” Wolfe character played by Harvey Keitel in the movie Pulp Fiction – someone who comes in after major mistakes have been made and tries to sanitize the situation to prevent future issues .
Only in this case the mess has to do with software that does n’t play well with others , packages which require non-standard hardware and operating systems , and the need to customize software to present a consistent user interface to customers and employees .
7 . In an international company , the IT architect has to deal with the software implications of internationalization .
The architect must figure out how the company ’s systems are going to deal with multiple currencies , multiple languages , multiple laws and legal systems , and multiple cultures .
The architect must also determine how data will be converted between various combinations of systems .
Internationalization is one of the most difficult challenges facing an architect , kind of like building a skyscraper that has to change appearance and behavior based on who ’s looking at it .
8 . The IT architect has to separate truth from fiction in the latest round of buzzword architectures ( e.g. , Agile , RAD , RUP , SOA ) .
In this role the architect has to be the gatekeeper and voice of reality : Does a particular architecture or software development approach get tested or used in your company ?
Which buzzwords should be ignored ?
Which improvement claims are real ?
9 . The IT architect has to figure out how to phase in and integrate the latest technology that your company chooses to adopt .
These are technologies like RFID , VPN ’s , security tokens , encrypted disk drives , smartphones and PDA ’s .
Are they viable ?
What pilot tests have to be done before they ’re used in production ?
How will they fit with current technology ?
10 . The IT architect has to anticipate change .
The only constant in IT is change .
Business needs will change , customers will change , technologies will change , legal requirements will change .
The biggest challenge for an architect is not to pick the best architecture for current needs – the biggest challenge is to pick the best architecture for constantly changing future needs , and to revise that definition of “ best ” on an ongoing basis .
Conclusion
In the Q&A session after a recent webinar , I was asked to describe the working relationship between the CIO and the architect .
I cited reason # 2 above , and said that if the CIO is focused on what the business needs , then the Chief Architect is in a sense serving the role of the “ Chief How Officer . ”
That in a nutshell is what the architect does , and that ’s the difference between a CIO and an architect : the CIO determines what to do , and the architect determines how to do it .
If you have a CIO but not an architect , then the CIO will be less effective in setting business direction for IT because the CIO will be distracted by how issues .
It is also quite likely that a CIO in such a situation will either be a good CIO or a good architect but not both .
That ’s because the personalities and skill sets of the two roles are so different .
The bottom line is that both a CIO and an architect are needed , and they both make a major contribution to IT strategy – each in their own way .
Good IT architecture is critical to successful IT , and you ca n’t have good architecture without good architects .
Note : I ’ve used the singular form of the word “ architect ” in this article , but obviously in larger companies there can and should be many architects .
In such an organization there is a need for a Chief Architect who provides overall architectural direction .
This person is also sometimes called the Chief Technology Officer ( CTO ) to distinguish the job from the CIO who is more business focused .
Now that the Army has completed its seventh inquiry into the death of Cpl.
Pat Tillman and top military leaders have testified in Congress , we still do n’t know who concocted a phony story about how Corporal Tillman died and whether the White House knew it was happening .
Congress needs to clarify whether this messy affair reflects astonishing incompetence or a conspiracy to exploit a famous soldier ’s death .
Corporal Tillman , who gave up a pro football contract to volunteer as an Army Ranger , was shot dead in Afghanistan in April 2004 while trying to assist another Ranger unit .
Almost immediately , soldiers in the field recognized that he had been hit by fire from fellow Rangers .
Yet witness reports were rewritten to make it seem like he had been felled by the enemy .
That became the basis for expediting a posthumous Silver Star before a memorial service in early May .
Even after the truth was recognized , the Army stuck by its award on the theory that Corporal Tillman acted heroically before he was killed .
Even the Tillman family deemed it a cynical effort to exploit the tragedy .
Army and Pentagon investigators have been unable to establish who rewrote the witness reports , and why .
This week Army Secretary Pete Geren called it “ a perfect storm of mistakes , misjudgments and a failure of leadership . ”
The Army punished its designated villain , a conveniently retired general who is apt to lose a star and some pay .
Meanwhile , former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and three senior generals testified that they knew of no cover - up at the Pentagon or the White House .
The bungling and misrepresentations might well have been the Army ’s sole doing .
Yet the White House could ease doubts by granting the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee full access to key personnel and documents .
I 'm sorry , but anyone who hates the Transformers movie needs to look at more pictures of Megan Fox , and pay less attention to the movie 's plot ... that IS why she was in the movie to begin with .
It 's a common trick that most men ( including myself ) fall for .
Put in a wicked hotty , and BOOM the movie is all better .
One of the most exciting and diverse fields of science today involves quantum information processing .
There are many designs for quantum computers suggested , and a few that have been demonstrated .
Among the demonstrated suggestions for a quantum computer is a one - way quantum computation process that makes use of a two - photon four - qubit cluster state .
Kai Chen , a scientist at the Physikalisches Institut in Heidelberg , Germany and the University of Science and Technology of China ( USTC ) in Hefei , China , tells PhysOrg.com , “ One - way quantum computing model was proposed years ago , but our experiment is a brand new demonstration of the computing model . ”
Chen and his team , lead by Prof.
Jian - Wei Pan , which consists of colleagues from the Physikalisches Institut as well as from USTC and the National Chiao Tung University in Hsinchu , Taiwan , present their results in a Physical Review Letters piece titled , “ Experimental Realization of One - Way Quantum Computing with Two - Photon Four - Qubit Cluster States . ”
“ Our new model of quantum computing is different from the quantum circuit model , which has an input and an output . ”
Chen says .
“ We use two - photon cluster states , and information is written onto the cluster , processed , and read out from the cluster by one - particle measurements only . ”
He does point out that work is needed to produce this method of obtaining output : “ We have designed a specific order and choices of measurements to get desired output . ”
Cluster states in quantum computing are highly entangled states deemed necessary in one - way quantum computing .
In the quantum world , entanglement among quantum objects , such as qubits , is described with reference to the others , even though they may be spatially separated .
Indeed , Chen and his colleagues performed their experiment showing a two - photon four - qubit cluster state entangling photons in both spatial and polarization modes .
Chen says that this demonstration of quantum computing is more efficient than other photonic schemes .
“ Developing and using two - photon cluster states allows us to be four magnitudes more efficient than the previous sources .
We are increasing the efficiency of quantum computing . ”
He also points out that the new design for photonic quantum computing developed by Pan ’s team allows for high fidelity .
“ With the previous source , there is a lot of intrinsic noise due to multi-photon generation , ” Chen says .
“ Using two - photon , our system offers much lower noise with a very high fidelity quantum gate . ”
This means that more of the information is passed on , and less of it is lost in background noise .
Chen explains that this type of quantum computing is an optical quantum computer , using light .
“ We have designed a new scheme for producing the four - qubit cluster states , which are based on techniques that we have developed before for generating hyper - entangled states .
With our new designs , the scheme is expected to motivate further progress in quantum computing . ”
He continues : “ We think this quantum computing technique with optics has a very bright future . ”
What kind of a future ?
Chen and his colleagues are already working on ideas for the future of quantum information processing .
“ We are working on extending qubit numbers to perform more complicated tasks , ” he says .
In their experiment Chen and his peers implemented a Grover ’s search algorithm .
They hope that being able to increase their cluster states to eight qubits or more will “ exponentially increase the ability to do quantum computing . ”
Chen continues : “ If we combine our technique of optics with quantum memory using atoms , we can extend our abilities of performing quantum computation and quantum communication .
One can think that in the future , we can get a true quantum computer , and have a global quantum network . ”

More than 100 people were arrested in a series of early morning raids in three states aimed at bringing down a major drug trafficking network whose operation was centered mainly in Morris County , authorities said .
Dubbed " Operation Redirect " the arrests began shortly before 5:30 a.m. when SWAT officers in Kissimmee , Fla. , outside Orlando , stormed a single - story house and arrested Ovie N. " Tony " Lattimore , 50 , a former Morris County resident who police said was one of the leaders of the ring , which mostly distributed cocaine and oxycondone .
At the same time , authorities in New Jersey and New York armed with search warrants began knocking on -- and in some cases knocking down -- doors of suspects .
One of those , George R. Washington , 43 , of Morristown , was identified as another leader of the ring .
Officers seized large amount of drugs and money during the raids along with several weapons and vehicles , authorities said .
By mid-morning about 100 people were in custody and arrests continued into last evening .
Most of the New Jersey arrests were made in Morris County .
Others were made in Essex , Sussex and Warren counties , authorities said .
Many of those arrested were charged with possession and / or distribution of cocaine or oxycodone , a narcotic pain killer .
Others were charged with possession and / or distribution of marijuana or heroin , authorities said .
Lattimore and Washington were charged with being leaders of the network .
Both were being held on $ 350,000 bail and Lattimore was awaiting extradition back to New Jersey , authorities said .
About 400 officers from three dozen local , state and federal law enforcement agencies in three states participated in the raids .

We think we perceive objective reality , but perception is always altered by invisible biases .
Illusions demonstrate this fact .
So go ahead , get your own perception from 10 of the coolest illusions ever made .
1 Elevator Floor Illusion
Going into this elevator would certainly makes one nervous .
A sign at the entrance cautions the people that goes in about work in progress .
A more detailed look shows that the floor has been painted with an illusion that there is no floor .
2 Earthquake Illusion
he Red Cross creatively used the power of optical illusion to shock viewers in its earthquake - awareness campaign in San Francisco .
3 Leaning Tower Illusion
Here is a novel illusion that is as striking as it is simple .
The two digital photography images of the Leaning Tower of Pisa areidentical , yet one has the impression that the tower on the right leans more , as if photographed from adifferent angle .
The reason for this is because the visual system treats the two images as if part of a singlescene .
Normally , if two adjacent towers rise at the same angle , their image outlines converge as they recedefrom view due to perspective , and this is taken into account by the visual system .
So when confronted withtwo towers whose corresponding outlines are parallel , the visual system assumes they must be diverging asthey rise from view , and this is what we see .
4 Triple Sunrise Illusion
This is a natural illusion .
On this day , the Sun rised due east at the Equinox , a geocentric astronomical event that occurs twice a year .
What we see here is a set of ice halos , recorded on a cold winter morning near Green Bay , Wisconsin , USA .
Produced by sunlight shining through common atmospheric ice crystals with hexagonal cross-sections , such halos can actually be seen more often than rainbows .
The remarkable sunrise picture captures a beautiful assortment of the types most frequently seen , including a sun pillar ( center ) just above the rising Sun surrounded by a 22 degree halo arc .
Completing a triple sunrise illusion , sundogs appear at the far left and far right edges of the 22 degree arc .
An upper tangent arc is also just visible at the very top of the view .
5 Land Shark Optical Illusion
This was featured in the Economist Magazine article titled “ Top Ten Signs ” and was a finalist for an Epica Award in 2003 .
All this time we thought the “ Land Shark ” skits on Saturday Night Live were just comic fun .
Little did we know at the time that this might happen .
It starts out innocently , a caring relative gets an exotic pet for their niece or nephew .
The beast gets big enough to take off a fingertip and flush it ’s gone .
But being the cleverest species of them all , they adapt and the next thing you know you have a land shark as big as a bus .
6 Tansparent Street Signs Illusion
Chicago artist Cayetano Ferrer paints street signs with images of its immediate background , thus giving them the illusion of transparency .
7 Cardiff Bay Illusion
Cardiff
Bay barrage visitors would definitely love the art that Swiss artist felice Varini and his team created .
Seen at a certain angle , the large optical illusion would render into a public art which would fascinate unknowing visitors .
8 Shadow Illusion
Partners in both life and art , Tim Noble ( 1966 ) and Sue Webster ( 1967 ) explore the toxic influences of consumer culture through new modes of portraiture .
Turning garbage into complex and visually arresting sculptural installations , Noble and Webster exploit , manipulate and transform base materials , often using self - portraiture to undermine the “ celebrated ” authorship of the artist .
This artwork is called “ Dirty White Trash ” , Six months ’ worth of the artists ’ rubbish .
9 Death Ad Illusion
A “ Be careful ” Ad illusion .
It lets people know they should be more careful on how they use those stairs …
10 Money Illusion
Yes , it ’s simple , but still cool , since it ’s so simple , you can do it yourself !

I recently read this article about how the Linux device driver project needs more work to do .
I pondered this for awhile , and came to a realization .
While Linux still does indeed lack drivers for some hardware , I believe that the lack of drivers is no longer the largest technological obstacle to Linux adoption .
The thing Linux needs to focus mostly on now is completeness , not quantity , of hardware support .
Read on , and allow me to explain .
If you take the newest version of Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon , you can install it on just about any standard desktop PC , and it will work .
The video card will most likely work just fine .
It will work even better if you take the two clicks to install a binary driver , if necessary .
The mouse , keyboard , and other peripherals will work .
All of your drives will work .
It is only incredibly rare hardware , such as some proprietary enterprise RAID controllers , that will be completely unsupported .
Also , if you have an extremely new high - end motherboard , it may not work perfectly .
However , problems with new motherboards seem to get fixed in the next kernel release .
You ca n’t expect much more than that , especially considering the incredibly rapid kernel development cycle .
I can not honestly say the situation is perfect .
There are still a lot of drivers that need writing .
However , it has been a very long time since I have encountered any completely unsupported desktop hardware , and more drivers being written every day .
If my experience is not uncommon , why is there still a common perception that Linux lacks hardware support ?
Perhaps people tried Linux back when hardware support was terrible , and they do n’t realize how far it has come since then ?
Perhaps people who have this impression have never really tried Linux , and they just go by what they read in the tech news ?
These are possibilities , but whatever the cause , I can tell you that there is actually another , bigger , problem looming in the Linux world .
The problem I see is that many existing Linux drivers are incomplete .
Do n’t get me wrong .
I do n’t mean to say the drivers are low quality .
In fact , Linux drivers are among the best in terms of stability , security , and performance .
What I mean by incomplete is that the drivers do not support every feature of the hardware .
Sure , they support the core functionality , but many pieces of supported hardware have non-essential features which are unsupported .
If the Linux drivers were complete , as well as quality , we could honestly say that Linux actually supports hardware better than Windows does .
Instead we continue to play catch - up .
To fully demonstrate my meaning , let me give you some personal examples of incomplete Linux hardware support .
Just as a note , I am aware that not all of these examples should be solved in the domain of kernel drivers , but how the solutions should be implemented is irrelevant to my fundamental thesis .
On my desktop at home I have a Logitech MX1000 .
It is a wireless USB laser mouse with thirteen different buttons .
The core functionality works perfectly in Linux .
I can point , I can click , I can scroll , and I can hotplug the USB .
This is a big improvement from the Linux of just a few years ago .
However , all is not well .
Many of these 13 buttons do not work properly , or easily , under Linux .
Also , this mouse is designed to run at 800 c pi .
In Linux I must install and use a command line application to set it to 800 cpi instead of the default of 400 c pi .
I also have to use the same application to change the cruise control setting .
This is a very powerful mouse , but under Linux it is no better than a normal wireless USB wheel mouse .
The user can do a lot of tweaks to improve the situation , but at the present time you can not achieve anything close to the features offered by Logitech SetPoint under Windows .
Linux may be free as in beer , but it effectively costs me $ 50 if it reduces my $ 80 mouse to the feature set of a $ 30 mouse .
Now let ’s look at some high - end motherboards .
As I said , brand new motherboards tend to have flaky Linux support until a new kernel version is released .
That is to be expected .
However , many enthusiast motherboards produced by companies like Abit and ASUS have extra features not found on the motherboard in your average Dell .
Many of these motherboards allow flashing of the BIOS while the OS is running .
Others allow live overclocking .
I personally would never suggest using such features , but that is besides the point .
The point is that the hardware has features which are not available to the Linux user .
The advantages of software freedom appear quite diminished when you realize that to get them you will not get everything out of your hardware that you paid for .
I have a Fujitsu P7230 notebook running Ubuntu Gutsy .
I am using it to write this very article .
It works extremely well , but , as you would expect , not every feature of the laptop is functional under Linux .
This laptop has a g - force sensor .
In Windows it uses that sensor to determine when to park the drive heads .
In Linux this feature is completely unsupported .
The fingerprint reader , two custom buttons , and the internal microphones are all unsupported .
The internal memory card reader works , but has IO errors with some SD cards .
The basic functionality of my laptop computer is all there with Ubuntu , but none of the weird special features are .
Those weird and special features might seem relatively unimportant , but people want to use them .
When they pop in a Linux LiveCD and a feature they use is not available , to them it is no better than if it had n’t worked at all .
Let me now bring back my longest lasting Linux gripe , sound .
Audio has improved a lot in Linux since I last blogged about it , but it is still the one department where I feel Linux needs the most work .
Let us look at the sound card in my desktop as an example .
It ’s an on - board Nvidia / Realtek sound card .
It can produce and capture analog stereo sound , and it can output PCM audio through the optical output .
The basic functionality of the sound card works perfectly , and with some tricky configuration of alsa it can do a bit more .
However , if you want more than that , just give up .
I ’ve been waiting for years , and there has been no improvement whatsoever .
Pretty much zero of the advanced features of the sound card are supported under Linux .
Under Windows the sound card will mix , in hardware , all outgoing audio into a single Dolby Digital signal and send that out of the optical output .
It can also do lots of other things involving the routing of sound to different speakers , or routing the PC speaker to the optical output .
It ’s actually quite incredible that the on - board sound card has more features than most home theater receivers .
Regardless , only the most basic features of playing and recording audio function under Linux .
Support for surround sound in Linux in general is complete shit .
People these days have these incredible DSPs in their computers capable of advanced hardware audio processing , but under Linux they might as well all be Sound Blaster 16s .
This is a case where we have a driver for a piece of hardware , and it works , but it does not implement every available feature of that hardware properly .
For one more example , let ’s look at my scanner .
It ’s a CanoScan LiDE - 50 .
It used to be completely unsupported under Linux , but it works now .
However , it works like shit .
Under Windows it scans very quickly , under Linux it scans slowly .
Also , there are four buttons on the face of the scanner .
Under Windows these buttons allow launching of the scanner application , or even taking the current scan and directly attaching it to an e-mail .
Under Linux these buttons are unavailable .
Sure , it ’s nice that the scanner works , but the fact that it works worse than it does in Windows is not going to give someone a reason to switch .
What we need to strive for is making the scanner work better in Linux than it does anywhere else .
Not only should it scan at the proper speed , but perhaps the functionality of the buttons could be customizable by the user .
Perhaps some open source scanning application could find some new and intuitive uses for those buttons and make Linux superior to Windows in even more ways .
When people try out Linux , they do n’t care just that their hardware works .
Even if Linux hardware support were exactly the same as Windows hardware support , many people would not switch .
They have no reason to switch , because there is no advantage .
However , if Linux actually supported the hardware better than Windows did , that would be something .
Imagine someone putting in a LiveCD to find that their scanner scans faster .
Imagine someone finding out that with Linux they can use the g - force sensor in their laptop as a theft alarm .
What attracts most average people to Linux in the first place is its superior performance , stability , and security .
However , those advantages will be overshadowed if someone finds out that they ca n’t do everything they used to do with the exact same hardware .
I want to conclude by clarifying that I am well aware that not all of these unsupported hardware problems are a result of incomplete kernel drivers .
Many of these problems should be solved in userspace in one way or another .
That is all irrelevant .
What is important is that when you have a piece of hardware primarily designed to do function X , but capable of Y and Z , you ca n’t support just feature X and consider that to be satisfactory .
Unless every single feature of a given piece of hardware is pushed to the absolute limit by the software , then the user is not getting everything they have paid for in that hardware .
The failure to implement features Y and Z is keeping Linux back these days much more so than the failure to implement X .
If there are Linux developers out there looking for things to work on , go back and take another look at hardware which is currently considered to be supported , and make sure that every single feature is supported 100 % .
If not , you ’ve got some work to do .
It is rather obvious that inflation is part of our current economy yet underreported .
Multiple articles have discussed this including one we did looking at the overall budget expenses for most American households .
I ’m not sure why the mainstream media is n’t stating the obvious ; that American families need credit to keep the economy running .
We are n’t talking about modest ratios of debt to income , but a growing amount of credit is being used as a bridge between the wage stagnation we have been facing and covering monthly expenses .
I was skimming over article after article and no one seems to talk about the wage and price gap .
Yes , we hear about families having a hard time making their mortgage payments .
But do you really need a 10 page analysis on why a person making $ 14,000 a year ca n’t afford a $ 720,000 loan ?
The true story is in the massive wage stagnation of the nation .
At a time when the unemployment rate is at record lows , GDP is growing , and home prices skyrocketing why is it that Americans are having to tap into unprecedented amounts of credit ?
We saw how dependent the overall global economy is addicted to credit when in August the markets literally went into a screeching halt over liquidity .
No credit , no money .
In fact , we are witnessing an interesting shift to a credit equals money economy .
Think Americans are saving ?
Americans actually spend more than they earn .
How can this be ?
For one , we rarely see cash anymore .
At least on a large scale .
Most people get their paycheck electronically deposited .
Then they pay their mortgage with e-Bills .
Then they use debit and credit cards for every purchase including items from fast food chains .
As if you need to charge a 50 cent donut on your American Express .
When was the last time that you cashed your check and had the entire amount in your hands ?
It is interesting to note that this faith in electronic money hit a few walls when people could n’t withdraw money from the UK ’s Northern Rock online and folks did a mini - bank run .
We also had a taste of it here with NetBank having online difficulties .
Banks are big and look stately because they are to inspire security .
When you see a vault , you know something of value is kept behind there .
But what if the vault opened and all you saw was a laptop showing a brief chart of credits and debits on some accounting software ?
I understand that electronic banking systems are here to stay and they do make life more convenient .
You also need credit for daily necessities like buying a home , insurance rates , and sometimes employement .
But studies also show that people spend up to 18 percent more if they use their credit cards instead of cold green cash .
This leads us into the current predicament , if money is now interchangeable with credit , what happens when the credit markets stop ?
You Want Money ?
Uncle Fed has a Loan for Ya !
Openly the Fed is beating its chest like a Neanderthal stating that it will do everything to stifle inflation .
However , when we look at BLS data , inflation is n’t to be found .
O where o where are you inflation in government stats ?
The government wants you to believe that prices are stable but debt to income ratios have never been higher for the country .
Why is this ?
With such a massive boom in housing , you would think people would have equity and diversified wealth management strategies .
This is n’t the case with most American ’s since most of their wealth is stored in housing .
Do n’t think so ?
Take a look at the booming mortgage debt in the US :
Not only is the booming debt a symptom of something larger , but the mentality of the continuous upgrade and moving up places owners in this perpeptual hamster wheel of renewing debt .
Case and point .
A friend was nearing the end of his car payments .
The car is still in excellent condition and he seemed excited .
I asked him what he planned to do with the freed up monthly cash flow .
“ Not sure what I ’ll do with the extra money .
I think I ’m going to trade it in and buy a convertible . ”
To each their own .
But you see how this cycle perpetuates .
With housing , if you trade one over inflated asset for another , you are only feeding into the game .
And you become dependent on credit as a facilitator .
So there are multiple things happening here including the bamboozling of the American pubic that they need larger and larger homes .
Oh really ?
How odd in the face of our declining family size ; and keep in mind this is occurring in light of baby boomers downsizing and many people deciding to live solo .
Working professionals are holding off on having children since they realize that they probably can’t afford to have children and provide an adequate lifestyle in many expensive metro areas .
Many young families are wrestling with the issue of having children .
Even with two good incomes , many families run the numbers and realize that it will be a stretch if one partner decides to stay at home for a few years .
And then you have future college costs .
As you can see , the argument for larger homes is more psychological than economical .
The need for larger homes and cars is driven by behavioral marketing and not economic utility .
You notice those Hummer commercials ?
They have the vehicle with gas mileage ratings looking like GPA scores going over mountains and chasing hyenas in the Sahara .
When was the last time you had rapid wildlife chasing you in Santa Monica ?
This credit psychology is played out well in the casino environment .
Why do you think they give you chips in exchange for cash ?
Why do they give you a credit card instead of cash ?
It is easier to spend when you do n’t think of money as money .
If someone is able to see what $ 500,000 looks like , do you think this would change the impact on buying a home in Southern California ?
Of course , the Fed is pumping up the money supply while saying they are concerned about inflation .
This is absurd since inflation is an issue of too much money floating in the economy .
And since credit = money flooding the market with easy credit is going to cause what ?
So if they are worried about inflation and the root cause of inflation is pumping more money they sure are n’t acting concerned by their policies .
I ’m not sure the vast majority of American ’s really care about inflation so maybe they figure it will just blow over .
Folks accept prices going up as a fact of life and as long as they can make the monthly minimum payments to service their revolving debt , they are okay .
Why go to a pay day lender when you have the Fed ?
Financial institutions do n’t need to go to loan sharks when they have the biggest one sitting at the right hand of our government .
When things got tough , they speed dialed the Fed and all is okay .
But like any payday lender , the interest is what will bring you down .
For a short - term fix you harm the stability over the long run .
The world markets are reacting and that is why the dollar is at all time lows .
Commodities are hitting records and the stock market is also up for the year .
Everything is up !
Including the debt load on our country .
Debt load is increasing :
We ’ve read the bills that currently passed .
They offer short - term relief to the symptoms of the current housing market but do n’t address the root cause .
The root cause is we are running the risk of devaluing our currency and possibly creating a hyper - inflationary environment that is n’t reflected in our government numbers except in real world numbers .
We are living in a parallel universe apparently .
Yet I think the Fed is afraid of deflation and their actions point toward this .
When prices start correcting downward , the tools they have will be largely impotent .
Some sellers would n’t be able to sell even if prices went down 5 or 10 percent .
If they have no access to credit or funds , then they are stuck .
That is the reason many went with these exotic loans in the first place .
They did n’t have the funds to begin with !
And buyers are being more cautious by force and their own merit .
The force part comes from the fact that there is very little exotic mortgages fueling the current market .
The velocity of selling slows down when you have to check documents and verify that prospective buyers ’ stated income reflects reality .
Things move much quicker when you can mold numbers via stuntman loans .
For all other things , you have the Fed .
ls
The entertaining part comes into play when you realize that an open file has its ref count moved up .
This prevents you from removing a file out from beneath some poor , hapless program .
So , you 've got a machine with no space in /var and you find to your horror that your cron logs are vast .
So you remove that log file .
The disk space stays the same .
The file is still there on the disk , and will remain there until its reference count goes to zero .
Only the name is missing .
You 'll have to restart cron at this point , to get it to close the log .
The correct way to deal with huge files when shutting off the service to clean the log file is not an option is to cat / dev / null into them , which obliterates the contents : cat / dev/null > huge_file .
This may also render it unparsable to log parsing tools if an incomplete log line ends up at the head of the file , so make sure it 's genuinely not possible to shut down the service for the 30 seconds or so it would take to clean the log file normally
( Some admins object to using this trick since the resulting log file can get corrupted .
YMMV - your mileage may vary ) .
One side benefit of this behavior comes into play for certain security situations .
You can open a temporary file and unlink it before shoving data into it .
So long as you never close it you can continue to use that file with no one knowing it exists .
Well , except lsof .
Originally submitted by Ben Woodard on 21dec99 .
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has vetoed a legislative proposal that aimed to increase California 's data protection standards .
The proposed law , AB 779 , imposed stronger data protection requirements than the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard , an industry - created standard for protecting consumer data .
Gov. Schwarzenegger objects to the broad scope of the law and argues that compliance would be excessively costly and burdensome for small businesses .
The Governor also argues that the industry is better equipped than lawmakers to evaluate the need for higher standards .
" Protecting the personal information of every Californian is very important to me and I am committed to strong laws that safeguard every individual 's privacy and prevent identity theft , " the Governor wrote in a veto statement .
" However , this bill attempts to legislate in an area where the marketplace has already assigned responsibilities and liabilities that provide for the protection of consumers . "
Additionally , Schwarzenegger criticized what he perceives as ambiguities in the text of the law itself .
" While I support many of the provisions of this bill , it fails to provide clear definition of which business or agency ' owns ' or ' licenses ' data , and when that business or agency relinquishes legal responsibility as the owner or licensee , " Schwarzenegger wrote .
The Governor also encourages lawmakers to collaborate with businesses to create " a more balanced legislative approach . "
Despite the concerns expressed by Schwarzenegger , AB 779 was immensely popular in the state Senate and Assembly .
The state Senate passed it in a vote of 58 to 2 and the Assembly passed it with a vote of 30 to 6 .
The margins indicate that there 's enough support for the legislation for both houses to override the veto .
The AB 779 would impose limits on what kind of information companies can retain , prohibit companies without data retention policies from collecting sensitive data , and force businesses to stop storing authentication data after the completion of transactions .
Supporters of 779 question the adequacy of industry standards .
Recent Payment Card Industry compliance statistics issued by Visa show that only 40 percent of major retailers are in full compliance .
Serious data theft incidents caused by poor security — like the one that took place earlier this year when hackers obtained millions of credit card numbers by infiltrating the wireless network of several TJ Maxx stores — indicate that the industry is n't doing enough .
Schwarzenegger 's decision to veto AB 779 will be seen as a disappointment by privacy advocates , some of whom believe that the veto was influenced by industry lobbyists .
The need for higher data protection standards is abundantly clear , but the proper solution is less obvious .
The legislative approach to ensuring better data security may prove to be expensive for many businesses operating in California , but the cost of neglecting this important issue could be much higher for the citizens of California , especially given that the businesses appear incapable of adequate self - policing .
If state lawmakers decide to pursue a legislative compromise in response to the veto , they must strive to ensure that data security is n't compromised as well in the process .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) is once again running for president .
But you would n't know it from the mainstream media , which have been spending all their time focusing on Clinton , Obama , and sometimes Edwards .
It seems like the only time we hear about Dennis Kucinich is when the talking heads make fun of him .
They ridicule Kucinich 's short physical stature and his elfin appearance , and they make creepy comments about Kucinich 's gorgeous young wife .
First of all , this is supposed to be an election , not a beauty contest .
Kucinich may not have Obama 's height or Edwards ' good looks .
But what he does have are ideas that are often much more in line with what the American people really want .
But , for some reason , we can't get past the jokes and get down to the issues .
Unfortunately , the ridicule took on a new dimension when Kucinich admitted , during a recent debate , that he had seen a UFO -- an unidentified flying object .
From the reactions I 've seen , you 'd think he had admitted to seeing little green men inside that UFO .
Yes , that 's a little weird , but did that question even really belong in the debate ?
Is it any weirder than the fact that former presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan had also seen UFOs ?
Is it any weirder than the fact that Ronald and Nancy Reagan consulted an astrologer before making major decisions ?
Is it any weirder than the fact that George W. Bush believes that God speaks through him ?
No , what 's weird is that the issues are being ignored in favor of schoolyard - style ridicule .
If the pundits and the Congress could get past the nonsense and focus on the issues , Dennis Kucinich might have a chance to bring about some of the change that the American people have been more and more impatiently waiting for .
Like bringing our troops home from Iraq .
Like holding the Vice President accountable for his manipulation of the intelligence process to deceive Americans in the run-up to the war in Iraq , and for threatening aggression against Iran absent any threat to the U.S .
Like keeping jobs here in the U.S .
Like protecting consumers .
Like promoting the development of clean , safe , renewable energy sources .
Like taking care of our sick .
And like enforcing our country 's ideal that all persons are created equal .
But those things are hard work .
It 's much easier to just sit back , collect money from the special interests , and ridicule Dennis Kucinich .
Because he 's short .
Because he 's not so telegenic .
Because he 's married to a beautiful redhead .
And because he speaks for those of us who have a heart .

This is a list of the most evil currently reigning dictators in the world .
It is amazing that these people continue to rule while we busy ourselves fighting in places that are ruled by far less dangerous men .
As the original list was written in 2007 , it has been necessarily updated in 2019 with continuing stories for those who no longer rule .
10 Kim Jong - il , North Korea , ( in power 1994 – 2011 )
[ Update : Kim Jong - il died in 2011 and was succeeded by his son Kim Jong - un .
Jong - un has been much in the news of late due to a warming relationship with the United States under the leadership of President Donald Trump who , for the first time in history , stood on North Korean soil without security in order to meet Mr Kim .
Unexpectedly Kim Jong-un and the president of South Korea have agreed to imminently take the necessary steps to officially end the Korean War . ]
The amount of debate over the recent nuclear weapons development in North Korea has managed to deflect people from the fact that Kim ’s government represses its people more completely than any other living dictator .
North Korea has , for the last 31 years , been at the bottom of the Freedom House ranking for political rights and civil liberties .
It is also ranks last in the Reporters without Borders ranking of press freedom .
The US committee for Human Rights estimates that there are approximately 150,000 Koreans performing forced labour in prison camps for political dissenters and their families .
Contrary to popular belief , Kim Jong
Il is actually a very clever and efficient manipulator of his people .
He is also the author of the books On the Art of the Cinema , and On the Art of Opera .

9 Than Shwe , Burma ( in power 1992 – 2011 )
Advertisement
[ Update : In 2011 , Than Shwe stepped down in favor of his hand - selected successor Thein Sein , the first democratically elected president of Burma and a moderate and reformist who developed a friendly relationship with former President Barrack Obama .
Sein himself stepped down in 2016 and was “ ordained ” a Buddhist monk the very next day .
Burma ( Myanmar ) is now ruled by Win Myint who was elected in 2018 by the ruling assembly . ]
General Than Shwe has survived a power struggle to emerge as the sole leader of Burma ’s military dictatorship .
Because of his hard - line views , he has taken an already bad human rights situation to an even worse level .
Burma has more child soldiers than any country in the world and the Burmese regime continues to kidnap citizens to force them to serve as porters for the military in conflicts against non-Burmese ethnic groups .
In 1990 the party of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi won 80 % of the vote in an open election .
The military cancelled the results .
Suu Kyi has spent most of the years since then under house arrest .
On May 31 , 2003 hired thugs attacked Suu Kyi ’s motorcade , killing several of her supporters and arresting dozens of others including Suu Kyi herself .
Shwe is a very private figure , preferring to work behind the scenes .
Consequently , even the Burmese people know very little about him .
8 Hu Jintao , China ( in power 2002 – 2012 )
[ Update : Hu Jintao retired voluntarily in 2012 and was replaced by paramount leader Xi Jingping who currently reigns as dictator of China .
Jingping is the first dictator of China born after the Communist revolution .
At an early stage in his life , Jinping lived in a cave after his own father was executed during the cultural purge of the 1960s and 1970s .
Xi Jinping is more dictatorial than his predecessor and his reign has seen the rise of deeper surveillance of the people , the introduction of anti-Muslim concentration camps , and further internet censorship with the help of companies like Google which kowtows ( for increased profits ) to his demands . ]
Trained as a hydrolic engineer , Hu Jintao joined the Communist Party in 1964 and spent the next 38 years working his way up the hierarchy .
While serving as Party Secretary of Tibet , he did not hesitate to administer martial law and to oversee the killing of unarmed demonstrators .
Now that he is General Secretary of the Communist Party of China , Hu , although not all - powerful , is the leader of an unusually repressive regime .
The communist party still controls all media , and uses 40,000 internet security agents to monitor online use .
More than 200,000 Chinese are serving re-education sentences in labour camps and China performs more than 4,000 executions every year , more than all of the other nations of the world combined , and many of them are for non-violent crimes .
7 Robert Mugabe , Zimbabwe ( in power 1980 – 2017 )
[ Update : Mugabe was replaced by his assistant Emmerson Mnangagwa in a coup in 2017 .
Mnangagwa has , thus far , reigned in as crazy a manner as his predecessor and assassination attempts have occurred .
Mnangagwa is considered one of the richest men in Zimbabwe ( unsurprisingly ) .
Mugabe died on 6 September , 2019 in Singapore where he ironically undertook treatment due to the lack of decent healthcare in Zimbabwe thanks to his own failings as a leader and his racist anti-white policies . ]
Mugabe began his reign with widespread international and national support .
After leading a successful anti-colonial war of liberation , he was elected independent Zimbabwe ’s first president .
But over the years he has displayed increasingly dictatorial tendencies .
According to Amnesty International , in 2002 alone , Mugabe ’s government killed or tortured 70,000 people .
Unemployment is above 70 % and inflation 500 % .
Mugabe has been accused of blocking the delivery of food aid to groups and areas that support the main opposition party .
He has continued to hold elections , but has restricted the opposition ’s ability to campaign and has shut down media that do not support him .
When opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai won 42 % of the vote , Mugabe had him arrested and charged with treason .
Mugabe has also confiscated farms owned by white people and turned them over to his supporters .
6 Crown Prince Abdullah , Saudi Arabia ( in power 1995 – 2015 )
[ Update : Crown Prince Abdullah died in 2015 and was succeeded by his brother King Salman .
Both are sons of Ibn Saud the founder of modern Saudi Arabia who created the nation through conquest in 1932 .
Under King Salman some modernization has taken place with women now being allowed to drive cars . ]
Crown Prince Abdullah has been the acting leader of Saudi Arabia since his half - brother , King Fahd , suffered a stroke in 1995 .
Saudi Arabia is one of the only nations that holds no elections whatsoever .
The royal family has promised municipal elections soon but has not announced whether women will be allowed to vote .
In fact , it is forbidden for unrelated Saudis of the opposite sex to appear in public together , even inside a taxi .
Women are not allowed to testify on their own behalf in divorce proceedings and , in all court cases , the testimony of a man is equal to that of two women .
According to the US State Department , Saudi Arabia continues to engage in arbitrary arrest and torture .
During a human rights conference in 1995 , Saudi authorities arrested non-violent protesters who were calling for freedom of expression .
Some were later flogged , the usual punishment for alleged political and religious offenses .
In a very unusual show of power , the religious forbade children from playing with Barbie dolls , which they dubbed ‘ Jewish dolls ’ that are ‘ symbols of decadence of the perverted West ’ .
5 Teodoro Obiang Nguema , Equatorial Guinea ( in power since 1979 )
This small West African nation ( population 500,000 ) was a forgotten dictatorship until major reserves of oil were found in 1995 .
Since then , US oil companies have poured billions of dollars into the country .
Although the per capital annual income is $ 4,472 , 60 % of Equatoguineans live on less than $ 1 a day .
The bulk of the oil income goes directly to President Obiang , who has declared that there is no poverty in Guinea , rather that the people are used to living in a different way .
In July , state radio announced that Obiang is “ in permanent contact with the Almighty , ” and that “ He can decide to kill without anyone calling him to account and without going to Hell . ”
There is no public transport , no newspapers , and only 1 % of government spending goes to health care .
When asked why so much of his nation ’s oil money is deposited into his personal account at the Riggs Bank in Washington , DC , Obiang explained that he keeps total control of the money in order to ‘ avoid corruption ’ .
4 Omar Al - Bashir , Sudan ( in power from 1989 – 2019 )
[ Update : A coup in Sudan in 2019 ended the reign of Omar Al - Bashir and terminated the position of President .
Sudan is now governed by a group known as the “ Sovereignty Council ” which was formed in August 2019 .
Over its life as a republic , Sudan has switched between Sovereignty council rule and presidential rule a number of times . ]
Sudan , the largest country in Africa , is in the midst of a complex 20 year civil war that has claimed the lives of 2 million and uprooted another 4 million .
Al - Bashir seized power in a military coup and immediately suspended the constitution , abolished the legislature , and banned political parties and unions .
He has tried to negotiate a peace agreement with the main rebel group , but he insists that the nation be ruled according to Islamic Shari ’a law , even in southern Sudan , where the people are Christian and animist .
His army has routinely bombed civilians and tortured and massacred non-Arabs , particularly in the oil - producing areas in the south .
He has a long history of providing sanctuary for a wide range of terrorists , only to turn against them .
He turned over the notorious Carlos the Jackal to France in exchange for financial and military aid and , in 1996 , he tried unsuccessfully to sell Osama bin Laden to the US government .
3 Saparmurat Niyazov , Turkmenistan ( in power 1990 – 2006 )
[ Update : Niyazov died in 2006 and was succeeded by Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow who won an “ election ” with just under 90 % of the vote .
He , like his predecessor , has a cult of personality developing around him . ]
Since taking charge of this former Soviet republic in central Asia , Niyazov has developed the world ’s most extreme personality cult , challenged only by that of Kim Jong Il .
Niyazov ’s picture appears on all Turkmen money , there are statues of him everywhere , and he renamed the month of January after himself .
His book , Book of the Soul , is required reading in all schools at all levels , and all government employees must memorize sections of it in order to keep their jobs .
Niyazov rules without opposition .
As he put it , ‘ There are no opposition parties , so how can we grant them freedom ?’.
In recent years Niyazov has cracked down on religious and ethnic minorities , including Russians , and has refused to grant exit visas for families for women under the age of 35 .
He has imprisoned political dissidents and subjected them to Stalinist - style show trials and public confessions .
The Turkmen constitution requires retirement at the age of 70 , but Niyazov has ensured his own rule by creating a 2,507 - member People ’s Council which unanimously elected him Lifetime Chairman .
2 Fidel Castro , Cuba ( in power 1959 – 2016 )
[ Update : Fidel Castro died in 2016 .
He was succeeded by his brother Raúl Castro who , aside from legalizing television , is ruling in a similar manner to his insane brother before him .
Is n’t it funny how often the “ people ’s ” governmental form of communism becomes a monarchy ? ]
The longest reigning dictator , Castro took advantage of the world ’s preoccupation with the Iraq war in March and April of 2003 to carry out his biggest round - up of non-violent dissidents in more than a decade .
He arrested 75 human rights activists , journalists , and academics , and sent them to jail for an average of 19 years .
Cuba remains a one party state with all of the power in the hands of Castro .
The courts are controlled by the executive branch ( in other words , Castro ) .
He traditionally blames all of his country ’s problems on the USA .
1 King Mswati III , Swaziland ( in power since 1986 )
Swaziland ( population 1.2 million ) is the last remaining absolute monarchy in Africa .
Mswati III ascended to the throne when he turned 18 , four years after the death of his father .
Because he had been educated in England it was thought that he would modernize his kingdom .
However , he has shown a liking for certain Swazi traditions .
On September 15 , 2002 , he watched thousands of girls and young women dance bare - breasted in the annual Reed Dance and then chose one of be his tenth wife ( his father had 100 wives ) .
The girl ’s mother filed a lawsuit against the king , charging him with abducting her daughter .
Mswati , who rules by decree , then announced that the Swazi courts were forbidden from issuing rulings that limited the king ’s power .
In an attempt to appease international opinion , Mswati approved the drafting of a new constitution to replace the one that his father had suspended 30 years earlier .
However the new constitution bans political parties , allows the death penalty for any criminal offense , and provides for the reintroduction of debtors ’ prisons .

SPIEGEL Interview with China 's Deputy Minister of the Environment " The Chinese Miracle Will End Soon "
The world has been dazzled in recent years by the economic strides being made by China .
But it has come at a huge cost to the country 's environment .
Pollution is a serious and costly problem .
Pan
Yue of the ministry of the environment says these problems will soon overwhelm the country and will create millions of " environmental refugees . "
( CNN ) --
In tiny Bishop , California , Rep. Buck McKeon , R- California , wants to build a museum honoring the mule .
Bishop , California , celebrates " Mule Days " every Memorial Day weekend .
McKeon has requested a $ 50,000 earmark to explore the possibility of building a museum in the town that every Memorial Day weekend holds the biggest mule celebration in the United States .
It might sound preposterous , but McKeon is doing what many of his House colleagues are doing -- appropriating federal funds for pet projects back home .
McKeon has requested funds for studying the feasibility of building the museum and providing support for operations .
McKeon defended the earmark in a statement sent to CNN as supporting economic development in his district .
" Bishop is a classic western frontier city which survives on tourism .
Adding a museum to its community will increase tourism by bringing sightseers and visitors to Bishop year - round , benefiting the area economy , " McKeon 's statement said .
" If CNN chooses to make a mockery of small - town , western heritage , that 's its prerogative , but I 'm going to remain focused on the economic development of my district . "
According to congressional spending watchdog group Americans for Prosperity , House members this year alone seek to spend $ 13.7 million in tax dollars on 63 museum - related expenses .
And the requests are n't limited to one party .
Rep. John Murtha , D - Pennsylvania , whom critics often call the " King of Pork , " has asked for $ 150,000 to restore the W.A. Young and Sons Foundry to a " key historic property , " according to a description posted on Murtha 's Web site .
Watch why taxpayers might be paying for a mule museum »
The Rices Landing foundry in Murtha 's economically distressed district is right next to Gary Smith 's home .
Smith parks his car in front of the building because as he says " they got a tour in there [ only ] once a year . "
Murtha declined to talk to CNN about his earmark requests .
That is not uncommon .
Earlier this year , CNN asked House members to disclose their earmarks .
Of the more than 430 members , 47 provided earmark requests , 68 said they would not release their requests and six said they had not made any requests .
The others did not return CNN 's request for a list of their earmarks .
Earmarks have been a political hot button for years .
Commonly derided as " pork , " pet projects are tucked into spending bills .
In 2006 , Congress approved a record $ 29 billion in earmarks .
Watchdog groups , citizens and the media have tried to figure out which members of Congress were asking for money to fund pet projects .
When Democrats swept into power in January , they vowed a more ethical , open and transparent government .
Earmark reform was at the top of the list .
But the party leaders have struggled to make the earmark process more transparent .
Democrats have agreed to attach names to earmarks -- letting the public know which representative is asking for what -- before votes on bills .
That will be a first , and Democrats have touted the move as a sign of their openness .
But there is no law or rule that requires senators or members of Congress to release their requests .
In his statement , McKeon called himself a " staunch supporter of earmark transparency and accountability . "
" A light needs to be shined on the hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars spent on ' bridges to nowhere ' and projects that serve no real purpose , unlike our community museum request , " McKeon said .
" I do not shy away from , nor do I take any issue with , the public knowing that federal dollars went to support the economic development of a small town on the western edge of the country . "
McKeon 's and Murtha 's requests come at a time when Rep. John Boehner of Ohio , the Republican minority leader , is trying to force reforms in how congressional members ask for and receive funding for pet projects .
Boehner is gathering signatures in hopes of forcing a vote to make public every earmark in every bill .
Boehner said it would be unreasonable to force a vote on each of the 16,000 expected earmarks Congress will approve in this year 's spending bills .
But he said some amount of exposure will cut down on the more outrageous requests .
Boehner recently wrote an editorial urging his fellow Republicans to return to their fiscally conservative roots and stop asking for so many pork - barrel projects .
But he admits he has limited power , even among fellow Republicans .
" I 'm elected to be their leader , " Boehner said .
" I 'm not elected to be their dictator or lay out all the rules .
All I can do is lead by example .
I 've never asked for one [ earmark ] .
I think there 's an incredible amount of waste .
I 'm doing my best to control it . "
Democratic House leaders , including Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin , the Appropriations Committee chairman , declined to answer questions concerning earmark funding .

A feminazi is a woman to whom the most important thing in life is seeing to it that as many abortions as possible are performed .
Their unspoken reasoning is quite simple .
Abortion is the single greatest avenue for militant women to exercise their quest for power and advance their belief that men are n't necessary .
They do n't need men in order to be happy .
They certainly do n't want males to be able to exercise any control over them .
Abortion is the ultimate symbol of women 's emancipation from the power and influence of men .
With men being precluded from the ultimate decision - making process regarding the future of life in the womb , they are reduced to their proper , inferior role .
Nothing matters but me , says the feminazi .
My concerns prevail over all else .
The fetus does n't matter , it 's an unviable tissue mass .

In June , a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction against a housing ordinance in Farmers Branch , Tex. , that would have imposed fines against landlords who rented to illegal immigrants .
In July , the city of Valley Park , Mo. , repealed a similar ordinance , after an earlier version was struck down by a state judge and a revision brought new challenges .
A week later , a federal judge struck down ordinances in Hazleton , Pa. , the first town to enact laws barring illegal immigrants from working or renting homes there .

Muzaffar A. Chishti , director of the New York office of the Migration Policy Institute , a nonprofit group , said Riverside ’s decision to repeal its law — which was never enforced — was clearly influenced by the Hazleton ruling , and he predicted that other towns would follow suit .
“ People in many towns are now weighing the social , economic and legal costs of pursuing these ordinances , ” he said .
Indeed , Riverside , a town of 8,000 nestled across the Delaware River from Philadelphia , has already spent $ 82,000 defending its ordinance , and it risked having to pay the plaintiffs ’ legal fees if it lost in court .
The legal battle forced the town to delay road paving projects , the purchase of a dump truck and repairs to town hall , officials said .
But while Riverside ’s about - face may repair its budget , it may take years to mend the emotional scars that formed when the ordinance “ put us on the national map in a bad way , ” Mr. Conard said .
Rival advocacy groups in the immigration debate turned this otherwise sleepy town into a litmus test for their causes .
As the television cameras rolled , Riverside was branded , in turns , a racist enclave and a town fighting for American values .
Some residents who backed the ban last year were reluctant to discuss their stance now , though they uniformly blamed outsiders for misrepresenting their motives .
By and large , they said the ordinance was a success because it drove out illegal immigrants , even if it hurt the town ’s economy .
“ It changed the face of Riverside a little bit , ” said Charles Hilton , the former mayor who pushed for the ordinance .
( He was voted out of office last fall but said it was not because he had supported the law . )
In " Sicko , " his new film assailing the U.S. health care system , filmmaker Michael Moore does n't try to be fair to health insurers and pharmaceutical companies .
That 's because Moore -- the man behind anti-Bush " Fahrenheit 9/11 " and pro-gun control " Bowling for Columbine " -- makes no pretense of balance .
He has a point of view : Greedy pharmaceutical companies need to be much more tightly regulated .
And health insurers ?
They should n't exist at all , replaced instead by government - subsidized health care .
It 's safe to say the health care industry looked forward to the film 's opening Friday about as much as they would to open - heart surgery .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
All the same , industry representatives tried to downplay the potential impact and insisted the film was causing them nothing more than a mild case of angina .
" Unfortunately , this is a Hollywood editorial .
It is not a documentary and it should be seen as such , " said Mohit Ghose , spokesman for America 's Health Insurance Plans , the industry trade group .
" He ( Moore ) made no attempt to contact us ... about the issues he raises in the movie . "
Ghose said he has no plans to see the film .
But many insurance insiders admit to having already seen the film in previews , clips or in a bootlegged copy that appeared briefly on the Internet almost two weeks ago .
Moore builds his case against managed care through a series of anecdotes : a woman whose health insurer denied treatment on the basis she was " too young " to have cervical cancer ; another who was billed for an ambulance ride after a car accident because she failed to get the trip " pre-approved . "
Some cases are heart - wrenching , such as a Kansas City man who died from kidney cancer after his insurer deemed his treatment options " experimental . "
Focus on talking points
As part of its damage - control strategy , insurance industry executives talked among themselves and agreed to focus on a few " talking points . "
They say they encourage debate about health care reform and support initiatives to reduce the number of uninsured Americans .
Insurers decided it was not in their interest to enter a public battle of wits with Moore , whose " Fahrenheit 9/11 " was the top - grossing documentary of all time .
" We all agreed that taking the high road as opposed to taking on Michael Moore is what we wanted to do , " said Matthew Schiffgens , spokesman for Kaiser Permanente .
Shannon Troughton , spokeswoman for WellPoint Inc. , the parent company of Blue Cross of California , said there was no " strategy on our part to handle this in any specific way . "
" There 's a difference between the movie , which is more of a one - sided piece of entertainment , versus what really needs to happen , which is a dialog and conversation at all levels about health reform , " she said .
Kaiser 's rebuttal
Still , many companies have taken it on themselves to clarify the ways they believe they 've been misrepresented in the film .
Kaiser , headquartered in Oakland , posted a rebuttal on its
Web site to the way it was portrayed in specific portions of the film .
The HMO features prominently in a 1993 case involving 18 - month - old Mychelle Williams .
The little girl died from a blood infection shortly after being transferred to a Kaiser hospital from Martin Luther King Jr. / Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles .
While the film contends she died because Kaiser refused to authorize tests that would have determined her condition , Kaiser said it was a case of medical malpractice , not denial of treatment .
The jury found both doctors involved to be liable , with King / Drew responsible for 75 percent of the more than $ 1.35 million in damages and Kaiser for 25 percent .
Kaiser also took issue with the film 's portrayal of a conversation between Richard Nixon and John Ehrlichman , in which the former president 's top domestic adviser urged him to set rules authorizing the health maintenance organization structure .
He cited Kaiser as an example , arguing that its model of medicine provided less care and therefore made more money .
" Ehrlichman 's distorted paraphrase badly misrepresents Kaiser Permanente , its goals , its strategy and its not - for - profit model , " Kaiser 's Web site states .
As for a segment in which Kaiser is accused of dumping an indigent patient near a Los Angeles shelter , Kaiser admitted to handling the transfer " very badly " but called it an isolated incident .
Kaiser said it has changed its practices to prevent the inappropriate discharge of homeless patients .
Blue Shield of California , based in San Francisco , said Moore did not tell the full story in the case of Maria Watanabe , a woman who explained in the film she was denied an MRI and finally received one in Japan , where she discovered she had a brain tumor .
The filmmaker ends her story by saying she hired a lawyer .
" Blue Shield was completely unaware of the women 's medical condition until we were sued , and we prevailed in a jury trial .
The filmmaker was aware of the trial and undoubtedly knew the outcome , " Blue Shield spokesman Tom Epstein said .
Blue Cross of California declined to discuss the case of a woman whose policy was retroactively canceled for failing to disclose she had a yeast infection .
The company said the case was " favorably settled by both parties . "
A pharmaceutical - makers ' trade group fired off an early counterattack with a press statement in May accusing Moore of producing a " biased , one - sided attack . "
The industry , which plays a smaller role in the film than it apparently expected , has laid low in recent weeks .
Enough said
For his part , Moore has said he did n't try to hunt down industry executives as he famously did with General Motors in " Roger & Me . "
Industry -- pharmaceuticals in particular -- already has had more than enough say , he argued .
" The nightly news seems like every other ad is a pharmaceutical ad .
Their story is told over and over again every single day .
This is an attempt for two hours during the whole year -- two hours , the length of this film , to say here 's the other side , " he told the Seattle Times .
The Vermont State Senate has passed a resolution calling on the United States Congress to initiate impeachment proceedings against President George W. Bush and Vice President Richard Cheney .
Until recently , Senate President Pro Tem Peter Shumlin ( D ) had been blocking the effort to bring the resolution to the floor , despite heavy pressure from citizen activists .
Shumlin 's reasoning shifted over several weeks from the need to maintain professional comity with Vermont House Speaker Gaye Symington ( D ) , who opposes the resolution , to an insistence that such a measure had to start in the House , to the lack of time remaining in the legislative session .
In the end , thanks to the incredible efforts of Vermont activists , Symington signaled that she did n't care what the Senate did , the legislative counsel 's office cleared up Shumlin's ( somewhat suspect ) procedural mistake , and the Senate ended up passing the resolution in just five minutes , by a vote of 16-9 :
" I was deeply moved by the meeting on Tuesday and I ’ve been a supporter of this consistently from the beginning , " said Shumlin .
" There has n’t been a president of the United States of America who has worked harder for impeachment hearings than Pres.
Bush , and Vice Pres. Cheney . "
After Tuesday ’s meeting , Shumlin said he read , and listened to , news reports and did n’t like what he heard .
" I did n’t like myself and I wanted to find a way to fix it , " said Shumlin .
" The neat thing about the Vermont Legislature is that we listen to citizens . "
Congratulations and thanks for a brave stand go out to Vermont activists .
And at long last , thanks are able to go to Peter Shumlin , too .
Next hurdle :
The opposition of House Speaker Gaye Symington ( D ) .
UPDATE : Vermonters , contact your state representatives !
They need to hear from you , and they need to know that they , like the Senate , can pass this bill in five minutes .
Dave in Kazbegi , Georgia
Dave Kidd is an adventurer .
A Kiwi Indiana Jones minus the hat and archaeological degree .
Earlier this year , he set out to get from Dublin to Sydney , with a single goal : not to fly .
As he wrote : “ Quite simple really enjoy a quiet Guinness at St James gate then travel South East by boat , bus , train , foot , donkey , camel , rikhaw until I can see the white curves of the Sydney opera house . ”
Quite simple indeed .
From a hot and muggy Varanasi , Dave wrote to tell me about how he has fared so far .
31 countries in 8 months , without flying ...
Why did you decide not to fly ?
It was a man selling me a back pack for my move to London that planted the seed almost four years ago .
His sales pitch was that his friends had used that type of back pack to do the old " Hippie Trail " and that it had held up great .
Flying home last year for a wedding , I was tossing and turning as only a 6ft Kiwi can , wedged in a Thai airways seat .
I was watching the flight path on the screen : we were flying over these amazing places that I really wanted to visit .
Delhi was one of them and as I looked out of the window and could see the lights of Delhi spreading out for miles far below I just knew that I was missing out .
Besides , travelling overland is a lot more challenging than trying to scam one more drink out of an air hostess .
What do you think drives you to travel ?
Adventure , meeting new people , gaining new experiences , a loathing of being bored and the 9 till 5 syndrome drives me to travel .
I think the challenge of not flying has been a very important aspect of my travel as it gives me something to work towards all the time instead of just wandering the globe .
Sunset over the Grand Canal
What have been some of the main highlights so far ?
Leaving the UK
Being fed by an old Nomadic woman on the bus in Morocco and then being told that I was far too skinny and should eat more of her bread .
Seeing the Statue of David in Florence
The random guy that put me in a taxi in Albania , refused payment for it , asked five people for directions to my hostel and walked me to the door , shook my hand and wished me a good trip ...... I love everyday heroes .
Drinking Vodka with Gaylor and Nena in Tabilisi , then the random little adventures into the city so that they could share with me some hidden wonder that I would have never seen without them .
Iran was definitely a highlight of this trip .
After it just blew my preconceptions of the country out of the water , I really did n't want to leave .
Eating dinner with my hands at a road side restaurant in Baluchistan and looking around at all these Pakistani men dressed in their Baluchis , who just included me as if I was any other man on that bus .
Were there any disappointments ?
One disappointment was the doughnut that tried to rob me in Casablanca .
It took such a long time to trust anyone again after that episode .
Also , the bureaucracy that I have faced with regards to visas , some days it really is just the mood of the Embassy staff that you meet .
When you started your blog you introduced the idea for your trip , and opened with this rather reflective statement : " Adventures are funny things : you spend all your spare time planning them , dreaming and longing to be on one .
Then when you are actually on one you wish you were anywhere else . "
How have you found that ?
Have you been enjoying the adventure while you 're on it , or has it been a case of wishing you were elsewhere ?
Ah , yes , this comes from a few climbing adventures that I had been planning for ages .
After an avalanche , I was trapped by a storm for days , finding that I had bitten off more than I could chew and just being plain scared , longing to be , well anywhere but hanging off the side of a mountain .
I would be a liar if I said that that I have loved every second of the trip .
I have missed one of my best friend 's weddings .
There are days that I have lost the plot after getting robbed , walked around for two hours in the rain looking for a place to sleep , felt like death although really being far from it , or , being physically threatened .
Luckily one of the only good things the army issued me was a very dark sense of humour and the ability to laugh at myself .
So although some days I do wish for the comfort and normality of home I have never really seriously considered getting on a flight .
Besides I could n't face the ribbing my mates would give me if I did n't make it and would be forced to move permanently to India .
In your last entry you were really positive about your experience in Iran ... and quite angry about Western media that paints such a harsh picture of that area of the world .
Were you surprised by the friendliness you encountered in Iran ?
The response I get from 99 % of people when I explain my trip and tell them that I plan to head through Iran is negative .
" You will want to be careful there " they say or " You do n't want to be mistaken as an American there " followed by a spate of comments about kidnappings , suicide bombing and general hate for the non Islamic West .
I am also exposed to the usual media that show an anti US demonstration in Tehran and portray it as the entire Persian population .
However I was lucky and had met another traveller that had been there and he gave me a heads up on what to expect .
This was a god send as I was able to relax and go with the flow and get the most out of their amazing hospitality .
However even with this information I was totally amazed by how welcoming and generous the people were .
What 's the plan once you 've made it to Sydney ?
Are you going to fly the final distance to New Zealand , or is the idea to hang around Australia for a while ?
Firstly I plan to crack open a bottle of champagne at the opera house with all my Aussie family and friends and have a bit of a knees up .
This will be after spending a month in the Outback travelling from Darwin through the interior to Sydney with my sister .
Then as much as I would love to stay I plan to fly home and catch up with family and friends and have my first Christmas at home in four years .
Of course during the six weeks I plan to be home I will not just be sitting around putting photos in albums , I will be planning the next great exploit while my mother cooks me food .
This will involve a climbing expedition to Mt Aconcagua .
At 6962 m this is the highest mountain in the world outside the Himalayas so should prove to give the body a wake up call after sitting on public transport for 8 months .
Then it 's back to the reality of the real world in the UK to save for the next trip ...... I mean … a house and a responsible life .

The Bush administration has blown chances to capture or kill Osama bin Laden , to win wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , and now to have any chance of maintaining a stable nuclear - armed Pakistan .
Like U.S. policy toward the shah ’s Iran in the 1960s and 1970s , the Bush administration , despite a rhetorical commitment to spread democracy around the world , has put all of its eggs in the basket of an autocrat unlikely to survive  in this case , Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf .
Although Musharraf uses the U.S. war on terror and desire to get bin Laden to play the United States like a fiddle , the Bush administration ’s reasoning is that alternatives to Musharraf are worse .
If the United States keeps solidly backing Musharraf , however , things could get much worse than even bin Laden using Pakistan as a haven : a nuclear - armed Pakistan controlled by radical Islamists .
Unfortunately , Pakistan probably has already been “ lost , ” and U.S. policy has played an important role in its demise .
U.S. policymakers have repeatedly underestimated the consequences of the deep unpopularity engendered by profligate U.S. government meddling in the affairs of other countries .
In Iran , although the shah ’s government was brutal , the regime also became so identified with its unpopular U.S. benefactor that this became a major contributing factor in its collapse and replacement with a militant and enduring Islamist substitute .
The Bush administration , with its macho bravado , especially has had a tin ear for the ramifications of anti-U.S hatred .
After 9/11 , instead of scheming to use the attacks as a justification to go after Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq , the Bush administration should have eliminated the Taliban regime in Afghanistan , used enough U.S. forces to get bin Laden instead of relying on unreliable Afghan fighters , taken full advantage of Musharraf ’s limited - time offer to give the U.S. military free reign in Pakistan to hunt down bin Laden and al - Qaeda , and then withdrawn from the region .
Instead , the Bush administration allowed mission creep to take its eyes off the prize of taking down al - Qaeda .
The U.S. mission in Afghanistan turned to nation - building , counterinsurgency , and the stanching of the drug trade .
The occupation of Afghanistan by non-Muslim forces and close U.S. support for the dictator Musharraf in neighboring Pakistan predictably revved up Islamic militants there and gradually turned them against his regime .
In an attempt to discreetly court these militants to support his government and to maintain the flow of U.S. military aid to ostensibly fight them , Musharraf allowed these groups to operate in the wild tribal regions of western Pakistan on the Afghan border and even reached a truce with them that withdrew the Pakistani government ’s military forces from these areas .
This wink and nod has allowed both al - Qaeda and the militant Taliban to recover and reenergize themselves what are now essentially safe havens .
The stepped up Taliban attacks on U.S. forces in Afghanistan can be explained by the continued U.S. occupation there and the havens given to them by Musharraf .
Given Musharraf ’s unenthusiastic pursuit of al - Qaeda in Pakistan , why does the United States continue to support him ?
The answer is mainly out of fear of “ instability ”  read any change in a nuclear - armed country .
The United States , with its sprawling informal empire , tends to be status - quo- oriented , as evidenced by the Bush administration ’s failure to take advantage of the only way out of Iraq  the radical decentralization or partition of that country .
The United States fears that the only alternative to Musharraf in a nuclear - armed country is the Islamic militants ; but this outcome is the most likely if the unpopular United States continues to back Musharraf so closely .
Musharraf has faced mass protests across Pakistan for his increased despotism and his suspension of the country ’s chief justice .
Musharraf feared that the judge , Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , could issue rulings that would interfere with his attempt to have the parliament elect him to another five - year term .
Also , several former generals have talked openly about overthrowing him in a coup .
Yet they might not be able to control any coup and reestablish military rule .
The Islamists have been strengthened by Musharraf ’s suppression of alternative non-Islamic opposition parties ; Musharraf has said that their leaders  exiled former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawa Sharif  will not be allowed to return for upcoming parliamentary elections .
Instead of the disastrous policy the Bush administration has pursued , it should end the occupation of Afghanistan , which would cool the Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan and Islamic militancy in Pakistan .
In addition , the United States should threaten to cut off aid to Pakistan unless Musharraf and his intelligence services make a genuine attempt to capture or kill bin Laden .
With a cooling of militant Islam in the region , brought about by a U.S. withdrawal , Musharraf should have more leeway to pursue bin Laden without an Islamist backlash .
Finally , the United States should press Musharraf to open the elections to non-Islamist oriented parties and allow their leaders to return from exile .
These actions would further bleed support from the Islamist radicals .
Unfortunately , keeping the Islamists around , but contained , has been good for the autocratic Musharraf regime .
The problem is that the instability caused by this policy can no longer be contained .
Like the shah of Iran , Musharraf must use increased violence to put down popular protests , thus further fueling the spreading uprisings .
The shah ’s Iran and Pakistan have one important difference , however : Pakistan has nuclear weapons .
Tragically , the Bush administration may eventually give the world an Islamist bomb .
Have you ever had visions of living like The Addams Family ?
Or maybe you just want to make your family and friends wonder about you .
No matter how normal your home decor is , it 's fun to have something around to make people gasp , and then ( maybe ) laugh .
But if you put all the products I found together , you 'd have a truly scary home .
Let 's start with the front door .

Tim Welch was never the kind of guy who worried about his weight .
Tim Welch topped 260 pounds at his heaviest weight , before his cousin convinced him to join Weight Watchers .

In fact , the 37 - year - old accounts manager from Seattle , Washington , ate a fairly balanced diet and loved participating in sports while growing up .
" I was thin and fit my whole life , " Welch remembers .
" I was always active in sports such as running cross-country in high school and swimming on the swim team in college . "
Things started to change in 1995 after he graduated from college .
Welch got a job , moved out of his parents ' house and began indulging in late - night meals with his friends .
" I remember specifically in 1995 , my waist size went from a 34 [ inches ] to a 38 in a matter of months , " Welch said .
" I got a size 36 pants to accommodate my waist size and I had to ask for a bigger size for Christmas because they were too tight . "
Welch was in total disbelief when he stepped on the scale and realized he was carrying 200 pounds on his 5 - foot - 10 - inch frame .
Despite the initial shock , he continued to gain weight .
Even though he fit the medical definition of obese , Welch stayed physically active .
He joined a master 's swim team , hiked and walked regularly .
Because he was physically active , Welch thought he could keep eating whatever he wanted .
As his weight crept up , his desire to exercise waned .
By the winter of 2005 , the extra calories and his now - sedentary lifestyle caught up with him .
During a doctor 's visit , Welch discovered that his weight had skyrocketed .
" That was pretty depressing to see that 262 [ pounds ] on the physical .
Just knowing that I had become that heavy , " said Welch .
About the same time , Welch started walking with a cousin who had lost 70 to 80 pounds on Weight Watchers .
During their walks , she would gently encourage him to give the program a try , he says .
She also tried to calm his fears that he'd have to stop eating all of the foods he loved in order to lose weight .
" I kept expressing a really persistent fear I had of restricting my comfort foods .
I felt to truly lose weight , I could n't ever eat the things I loved -- hamburgers , ice cream , chocolate , bacon , cheese [ and ] cookies , " said Welch .
" I felt like in order to lose weight I would have to give up those things . "
Welch started to become depressed and ashamed of his increasing waist size .
Embarrassing moments such as asking for a bigger pants size and having a homeless man yell , " Hey , big guy ! " on the street -- began to take a toll on him .
As a new year approached , Welch reached his breaking point .
In January 2006 , as part of his New Year 's resolution , Welch reluctantly attended his first Weight Watchers meeting , but not before making one last stop for what Welch called his " last meal . "
" I had a double - cheeseburger , onion rings and milkshake at Johnny Rockets right before the meeting , " said Welch .
" I weighed 252.6 at my first meeting . "
During the first week on Weight Watchers , he dropped 7 pounds .
Welch also learned how to enjoy his favorite foods through portion control , eating in moderation and choosing healthier foods first .
Welch , who was already walking 3.5 miles a day roundtrip to work , started taking water aerobics three times a week and swimming again competitively .
The weight continued to come off , about 2 - 3 pounds a week .
CNN iReporters before - and - after weight loss photos »
" When I got to 200 pounds , I decided , well , ' Why do n't I go for a weight that 's a healthy weight range for my height , ' " said Welch .
" So I did , and by that point the weight had slowed down .
It does n't come off as quickly as you get closer to your goal weight .
But it was still coming off . "
Eight months later , Welch had lost 87 pounds and reached his goal weight of 174 pounds , which is the maximum weight for someone who is 5 feet 10 inches tall , according to the national guidelines .
People were stunned by his dramatic weight loss .
" I literally had people that knew me that did n't recognize me , " said Welch .
So , what 's the best advice Welch has for others who want to lose weight ?
" Be the best friend you can to yourself while you 're going through this weight loss journey .
I 've always been someone who was very hard on themselves and suffered from low self - esteem . "
Welch said he tried to be very forgiving of himself during the whole process and he still is .
He said you should congratulate yourself and focus on any accomplishment you make each day or each week , rather than focus on areas were you have failed .
For example , Welch says if you have an extra helping of mashed potatoes , do n't beat yourself up .
Stop yourself and focus on the fact that you chose salmon and peas for dinner and ate two helpings of mashed potatoes -- compared with the cheeseburger and French fries you would have eaten two years ago .
Welch also says people should n't deny themselves completely .
Allow yourself to indulge in some chocolate when you want it .
But instead of eating the entire candy bar , break off a few squares , count the calories , and enjoy it .
Also , learn to recognize the fats that are better for you .
Do n't cut out all of the fat .
Instead , choose a healthier fat .
For example , Welch often allows himself to eat peanut butter or guacamole , which are higher in fat but are a healthier fat than eating something fried .
How has the weight loss changed Welch 's life ?
Welch can bend over and tie his shoes without discomfort .
He feels much lighter going up a flight of stairs and he can hike much faster .
More importantly , he 's become more optimistic .
" It made me realize I can , in fact , do anything I set my mind to , " said Welch .
" It gave me a confidence I desperately needed that I try to apply to other areas of my life . "

EXCLUSIVE : FBI Whistleblower Sibel Edmonds Will Now Tell All - and Faces Charges if Necessary - to Any Major Television Network That Will Let Her
She 's Prepared to Name Names , Including Those of Two ' Well - Known ' Congress Members Involved in Criminal Corruption
The ' Most Gagged Person in U.S. History ' Tells The BRAD BLOG She 's Now Exhausted All Other Channels ...
-- By Brad Friedman
Attention CBS 60 Minutes : we 've got a huge scoop for you .
If you want it .
Remember the exclusive story you aired on Sibel Edmonds , originally on October 27th , 2002 , when she was not allowed to tell you everything that she heard while serving as an FBI translator after 9/11 because she was gagged by the rarely - invoked " States Secret Privilege " ?
Well , she 's still gagged .
In fact , as the ACLU first described her , she 's " the most gagged person in the history of the United States of America " .
But if you 'll sit down and talk with her for an unedited interview , she has told The BRAD BLOG , she will now tell you everything she knows .
Everything she has n't been allowed to tell since 2002 , about the criminal penetration of the FBI where she worked , and at the Departments of State and Defense ; everything she heard concerning the corruption and illegal activities of several well - known members of Congress ; everything she 's aware of concerning information omitted and / or covered up in relation to 9/11 .
All of the information gleaned from her time listening to and translating wire - taps made prior to 9/11 at the FBI .
Here 's a handy bullet - point list , as we ran it in March of 2006 , for reference , of what she 's now willing to tell you about .
" People say , ' why does n't she just come forward and spill the beans ? '
I have gone all the way to the Supreme Court and was shut down , I went to Congress and now consider that shut down , " she told The BRAD BLOG last week when spoke with her for comments in relation to our story on former House Speaker Dennis Hastert 's original attempt to move a resolution through the U.S. House in 2000 declaring the 1915 massacre of 1.5 million ethnic Albanians in Turkey as " genocide " .
" Here 's my promise to the American Public :
If anyone of the major networks -- ABC , NBC , CBS , CNN , MSNBC , FOX -- promise to air the entire segment , without editing , I promise to tell them everything that I know , " about everything mentioned above , she told us .
" I can tell the American public exactly what it is , and what it is that they are covering up , " she continued .
" I 'm not compromising ongoing investigations , " Edmonds explained , because " they 've all been shut down since . "
" She 's Very Credible "
She has , in fact , spent years taking every reasonable step to see that the information she has goes through the proper channels .
The Supreme Court refused to hear her whistleblower lawsuit , even in light of the Department of Justice forcing the removal of both her and her own attorneys from the courtroom when they made their arguments concerning why it was that still had to remain gagged under the " States Secrets Privilege . "
On the morning that the SCOTUS refused to hear her case , the facade cracked on the front of the building .
In a ridiculously ironic metaphor which would have been rejected by any credible screen - writer , a chunk of marble -- just above an allegorical statue representing " Order " and just below the words " Equal Justice " -- came crashing to the ground .
She has met with , and told her story to , U.S. Senators including Republican Charles Grassley and Democrat Patrick Leahy , both of the Senate Intelligence Committee , both who found her extremely credible .
60 Minutes producers may remember when Grassley told them , " Absolutely , she 's credible ... And the reason I feel she 's very credible is because people within the FBI have corroborated a lot of her story . "
In fact , the FBI itself has done so .
Their Inspector General found her allegations , as described in the unclassified version of his report , to be " credible " , " serious " and " warrant[ing ] a thorough and careful review by the FBI . "
As far back as 2002 , Grassley and Leahy co-wrote letters on Edmonds behalf to Attorney General John Ashcroft , FBI Director Robert Mueller , and DoJ Inspector General Glenn A. Fine , calling on all of them to take action in respect to the allegations she 's made .
" Certain officials in this country are engaged in treason against the United States and its interests and its national security , " she said during an interview an August 2005 interview on Democracy Now .
That comment followed 60 Minutes ' revelation years before alleging that Edmonds had information revealing that a " Turkish intelligence officer " she worked with at the FBI " had spies working for him inside the US State Department and at the Pentagon . "
She 's briefed many legislative offices -- as well as the 9/11 Commission -- in regard to her claims , and now , she says , she 's even prepared to tell the media " the names of every single Congressional office who has received the names of the witnesses " to the crimes she 's detailed .
When we spoke last week , Edmonds seemed to reserve most of her frustration for Congressman Henry Waxman 's office .
Waxman is the Democratic Chairman of the U.S. House Government Reform and Oversight Committee .
After briefing members of his security - cleared staff " inside the SCIF " -- a high - security room in the U.S. Capitol , specially created for discussion of highly sensitive information -- Edmonds says she was told on several occassions , prior to the 2006 Election , that her case would be one of the first heard in his committee , once he became Chairman .
" I even gave names of former and current FBI agents who were willing to go to Waxman 's office and give more information on all of this , " she said .
" Before the elections , I had a promise from Congressman Waxman 's office . "
She claims they told her , before the election , " the only reason they could n't hold hearings , was because the Republicans were blocking it . "
" They said ' your case will be one of the first ones we will hold investigations on , ' " she told us .
Now , however , since the Democrats have become the majority in the House , Waxman 's office is " going mum " .
They wo n't even respond to her calls .
The Congressman 's office did not respond to several requests for comment on this story .
Two Other " Well - Known " Congressmen
Aside from the allegations she 's already made concerning Hastert , as we reported in some detail in early 2006 , following up on a Vanity Fair exposé in 2005 , Edmonds says there are at least " two other well - known " members of Congress that she 's prepared to name as well .
" There are other Congressional people , whose names have not come out , " she explained .
" As [ Waxman 's office knows ]
I 'll be able to give them file numbers and investigations , including investigations by the IRS .
I will be giving details one by one , not just allegations . "
" But , " she added , " unfortunately nobody wants to have an investigation like that . "
For the record , she told The BRAD BLOG , the other two " well - known members " are from the House , both Republican , and " one of them is recently no longer there . "
So far , she says , " those names have not been public . "
" Kafka - esque "
Since leaving the FBI , and in the wake of her years - long ordeal , which she frequently describes as " Kafka - esque " , Edmonds has founded the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition .
In addition to the support she has received , at various times , from members of Congress , she 's received a great deal of support from members of the national security whistleblower community and government watchdog organizations .
As we reported last Spring , Veteran FBI counterintelligence agent , John Cole has said he 's " talked to people who had read her file , who had read the investigative report , and they were telling me a totally different story " than that given publicly by FBI officials .
" They were telling me that Sibel Edmonds was 100 percent accurate , " he said , " management knew that she was correct . "
Famed " Pentagon Papers " whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg has described Edmonds as " extremely credible . "
In a 2005 interview on KPFA , Ellsberg said , " FBI agents we 've talked to have , in every respect that was raised , have confirmed her story - that she 's a very credible witness . "
More than 30 groups , from across the political spectrum -- including the Project on Government Oversight ( POGO ) , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , the September 11th Advocates , the Liberty Coalition , the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) , OMB Watch , Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC ) and People for the American Way ( PFAW ) -- all signed a letter in March of this year calling on the House Oversight Committee to " hold public hearings into the case of FBI Whistleblower Sibel Edmonds , and the erroneous use of the State Secrets Privilege to shut down all court proceedings in her case . "
That petition was sent almost precisely one year after The BRAD BLOG originally reported on a public petition to Congress , demanding they hold public hearings .
More than 30,000 people , Edmonds says , have now signed that petition since it was first announced .
" Exhausted Every Channel "
In a speech given over the Summer in D.C. at the American Library Association ( ALA , video here ) , Edmonds detailed the " Kafka - esque " nature of her unprecedented gag - order .
Among the information still - regarded as " classified " under the States Secret Privelege : the fact that she was a translator for the FBI , where she was born , what languages she speaks , the date of her birth , the universities she attended and the degrees she earned .
In fact , the interview that CBS ' 60 Minutes aired with her in 2004 , was later retroactively classified by the Department of Justice under the same " privilege " !
But enough is enough .
She 's now ready to tell all .
To the public .
But not ( yet ) to us .
She will speak , however , to any broadcast network who would like to have her .
" I have exhausted every channel .
If they want to , they can bring criminal charges against someone who divulges criminal activity , and see how far they 're going to get . "
But will any of the corporate mainstream networks take her up on the offer ?
It 'd certainly be an explosive exclusive .
" I do n't think any of the mainstream media are going to have the guts to do it , " she dared them .
So whaddaya say 60 Minutes ?
We 've given you scoops before that you ended up turning down -- and likely later regretted .
Will you be smart enough to take this one ?
" You put me on air live , or unedited .
If I 'm given the time , I will give the American people the exact reason of what I 've been gagged from saying because of the States Secrets Privilege , and why it is that I 'm the most gagged person in the history of the United States . "
" My feeling is that none of them have the guts to do that , " she dared them , before charging , " they are all manipulated . "
" I keep using the word Kafkaesque ... " she paused , during her speech at ALA , clearly showing her exasperation , " because ... , " she continued slowly , " ... I really can't come up with a better word . "
We all want to seem smart around workmates and acquaintances , but we often do n’t have the time to put in to further study to achieve this .
Luckily , there are a few ways you can make yourself seem smarter with a minimum of effort .
This is a list of the ten best tips for appearing smarter .
10 Learn a topic to debunk
The majority of “ hot topics ” are debated by people with very little knowledge of the subject .
A good example of this is global warming – the majority of people you speak to on this subject will tell you how we must change our habits to prevent global warming , but few will know what “ anthropogenic global warming ” is .
Spend a little time learning what the real experts on these faddish topics say and you simply ca n’t go wrong .
Try to remember some of the names of authors so you can quote them .
9 Improve your Vocabulary
Advertisement
The simplest way to do this is to subscribe to a “ word a day ” emailing list .
Remember to ensure that you memorize the correct pronunciation and spelling of the new word or phrase .
Perhaps you can start with mesonoxian , or any of the words on the Top 10 Weird English Words .
8 Obscure Knowledge
By developing knowledge in a very obscure area , you are very unlikely to meet someone else with the same knowledge .
This means you can wax lyrical for hours and it does n’t matter how many mistakes you make – no one will know , and you will seem ultra-smart .
You might , for example , spend some time studying the early Egyptian dynasties ( or an interesting character like Smenkhkare , ) or the writings of early Christian writers .
You can be sure that even the most staunch Southern Baptist fundamentalist has never heard of most of the “ fathers of the Church ” , let alone read anything they wrote .
Saint Igantius of Antioch is a good start ; you can follow up with Athenagoras , Irenaeus , Origen , Novatian , and Polycarp .
Great subject matter for the Atheist who wishes to debate against fundamentalists .
7 General Knowledge
This can be done very easily .
Buy a Trivial Pursuit ( Genus Edition ) and memorize one card before going to bed each night .
In no time you will have a fount of general knowledge so immense that no one will dare debate you at Friday night drinks .
The other thing you can do to improve general knowledge is to read “ This day in History ” articles .
Luckily , the List Universe prints a “ Today in History ” list on the right hand side of every page ( underneath the latest 10 comments ) with links to Wikipedia to get you started .
Good Lord !
I feel smarter just thinking about it !
6 Ask Questions
The best way to use this trick is to ask questions when you already know the answer .
This is a form of Irony when used in the right way ; when the person you are questioning answers , you can ask a related question which will make it appear that you have taken in what they said , absorbed it , and wish to clarify an aspect of the topic .
Additionally , when you are discussing a subject with someone who clearly knows less about it than you , you can ask questions that you know will make them stumble .
This is particularly good if you have a large audience as everyone will be in awe of you .
Make sure you are humble when the person ’s weakness shows .

5 Learn About Good Books
Sparknotes .
I repeat , sparknotes .
Use the short notes found on this site to get a broad overview of famous classic novels .
You only need to learn enough to make it seem that you have read the book .
For a decent classic you should be able to do this in 30 minutes or less .
And who knows , you may find that you want to read the book and gain some real intelligence .
4 Watch Movies
Watch some classic movies that are both good and bad .
These movies do n’t have to be silent movies , black and white , etc .
Just good movies , fulfilling movies .
Also , watch some bad movies .
Someone who can spout off one or two good movies will sound either smart or fake .
But someone who can state both good and bad movies , and justify why each is classified that way , will sound intelligent .
3 Learn Quotes
A great writer once said : “ Most people are other people .
Their thoughts are someone elses opinions , their lives a mimicry , their passions a quotation . ” – while this is amusing , it is not entirely correct when trying to appear smarter .
People will be utterly in awe of you if you can quote a famous line from poetry , a great play , or a witticism by a literarary master .
There are a million sites on the internet that will help you to find quotations .
Learn one a day .
If you wish to learn a few lines of poetry , I recommend starting with Plath , Ginsberg , or Whitman ; everyone knows who they are , but few will be able to quote them .
Oh – the quotation I used here is by Oscar Wilde .
2 Use Words you Know
Nothing makes you looks more like an idiot than fumbling language .
Stick to what you know !
People will argue that tapes and books can teach you new words , but you still risk a terrible mistake .
Learning new words can broaden your thinking and amplify your ability to communicate .
However , doing so will open you up to appearing stupid , so you should stick with words you are 100 % positive of pronunciation and meaning .
Even if it takes you an entire extra sentence to explain a concept that one word would have clarified instantly , it ’s totally worth it .
1 Be Quiet
Quite simply , the less you say , the less you can say wrong .
Oh , and smile and nod knowingly .
The Mir - I was used to help plant a Russian flag on the Arctic seabed
The Natural Resources Ministry said tests on soil samples showed Russia was linked to the Lomonosov Ridge .
Moscow has mounted several expeditions recently - and risked tensions with rivals in August by planting a flag in the seabed below the North Pole .
The Arctic is thought to be rich in oil , gas and mineral reserves .
Correspondents say Russia 's main rivals for the supposed spoils - the US , Canada and Denmark - have been angered by Moscow 's recent aggressive strategy in the region .
Under a United Nations convention , the country claiming ownership of the region 's ocean floor must show evidence that the seabed is an extension of their continental shelf .
Evidence claim
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the Lomonosov Ridge is part of its land mass - and now the Natural Resources Ministry believes it has the proof .
Nasa photo shows ice cover in 2005 and as it was in 1979
The statement added : " The ridge is therefore part of Russia 's land mass . "
Marine research official Viktor Posyolov told Russia 's
Tass news agency the claim could extend Russia 's seabed by 1.2 m sq km ( 463,323 sq miles ) .
He said the territory could potentially yield 10,000 billion tonnes of conventional fuel .
In a further sign of its intent , the Kremlin announced that four strategic bombers were to make training flights over the Arctic and the Atlantic Ocean .
Rival expeditions
Russia 's claim to a vast swathe of territory in the Arctic has sparked an increasingly tense rivalry with other countries who believe they have a claim .
After Russia planted its flag in the seabed , Canada vowed to increase its icebreaker fleet and build two new military facilities in the Arctic .
Denmark recently sent a team of scientists to the Arctic ice pack to seek evidence that the Lomonosov Ridge was attached to the Danish territory of Greenland .
And a US Coast Guard icebreaker also set off late last month for a research expedition - although scientists said the trip had been planned well before the Russian move .
Competition for territorial and economic rights has heated up as melting polar ice caps have introduced the possibility of exploiting the previously inaccessible seabed .
A Navy SEAL killed in Afghanistan will be awarded the Medal of Honor , the first such award for troops serving in Afghanistan and the first for a SEAL since the war in Vietnam , the White House announced Thursday .
Lt. Michael P. Murphy , 29 , who had SEAL training here and was assigned to a SEAL team in Hawaii , was killed in June 2005 during a mission in the Hindu Kush mountains to find a key Taliban leader .
Ambushed by insurgents , Murphy ’s four - man SEAL team engaged in a fierce firefight and was in danger of being overrun .
Although he was wounded , Murphy risked his life to save fellow SEALs and then maneuvered into an open position to send out an emergency call and to continue firing at the enemy .
While making the call , he was hit again .

Only one of the SEALs on the team survived .
Eight other SEALs and eight soldiers aboard a MH - 47 Chinook helicopter sent to rescue Murphy ’s team also were killed when the craft was brought down by a rocket - propelled grenade .
The incident was the worst single - day loss of life for Navy Special Warfare personnel since World War II .
“ Mike Murphy was a true warrior , a true leader .
No one cared more about his men than he did , ” said a SEAL officer who asked to be identified only as Sean .
Because their missions are secret , SEALs prefer to remain anonymous to the public .
President Bush will present the Medal of Honor to Murphy ’s parents on Oct. 22 at the White House .

Only two other military personnel -- Marine Cpl. Jason Dunham and Army Sgt. 1st Class Paul Ray Smith -- have been awarded the nation ’s highest honor for bravery for actions undertaken since Bush sent troops into Afghanistan in 2001 .
Both of those awards were for bravery in Iraq and were posthumous .
The three other members of Murphy ’s team -- Matthew Axelson , 25 , and Danny Dietz , 31 , who were both killed , and Marcus Luttrell , 32 -- have each been awarded the Navy Cross , second only to the Medal of Honor .
Luttrell is the author of “ Lone Survivor : The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10 . ”
Murphy grew up on Long Island and graduated from Pennsylvania State University in 1998 with degrees in political science and psychology .
He was commissioned a Navy ensign in 1999 and graduated from SEAL training in Coronado in 2001 .

His father , Daniel , an attorney and a combat veteran of the Vietnam War , said the assignment to Afghanistan was particularly important to his son .
Murphy had friends in the New York police and fire departments and wore an NYFD patch on his uniform .
“ He told me , ‘ We ’re going where the people who planned , plotted and recruited for 9/11 are , ’ ” Daniel Murphy said .
Murphy ’s mother , Maureen , said the Medal of Honor meant that “ now the world will know what his family has always known : how special he was . ”
At the SEAL base in Coronado , Murphy and his teammates were the subject of numerous conversations as word of the White House announcement circulated .

Though SEALs ’ grief lingers , they preferred to praise Murphy ’s steely determination and leadership .
“ I ’ll remember him and those other guys every day of my life , ” said Cory , a SEAL petty officer first class .

Prepare to be amazed at what passes for investigative journalism on television these days .
Atlanta 's WSB - TV Action News team ran a sensational iPod " nana " piece last night under the title " Man 's Pants Catch Fire At Airport . "
To set the stage , WSB - TV says that the nano " uses the same technology as those troubled laptop batteries under recall due to the risk of fire . "
In steps Danny Williams -- mild mannered consumer , airport employee -- who claims that his iPod nano " burst into " chest - high flames while he was at work .
So why is n't he covered in burns after exposure to such a serious chemical fire ?
We 've all watched the horrifying video of a lithium ion battery explosion , right ?
Well , Danny claims that he was protected by a " glossy piece of paper " in his pocket at the time .
Taking it up a notch , WSB - TV worries that Danny could have been mistaken for a terrorist due to his smoking airport trousers .
Look , we 're not saying that nothing happened , after all , we 've written about an exploding iPod nano before .
We 're only saying that it did n't happen in the way described .

Today ’s Washington Post shows President Bush shaking hands with GIs , breathing in the atmosphere of Iraq .
He may even have run his hand fondly over a piece of battlefield equipment -- all of which will have been contaminated with depleted uranium ( DU ) . ( 1 )
Consider DU for a moment .
The last four U.S. wars ( the Balkans , Afghanistan and Iraq 1 and 2 ) dumped thousands of tons of aerosol DU from anti-tank shells , bullets , and bombs into the atmosphere - the equivalent I am told of 40,000 Hiroshima bombs – but with far greater impact . ( 2 )
Radiation expert Dr. Leuren Moret says : “ Depleted uranium exposure risks … may be far more toxic than nuclear weapons or nuclear power plant exposures .
In July of 2005 , the National Academy of Sciences reported … that there is ‘ no safe level of exposure . ’ ” ( 3 )
She estimates that “ the amount necessary to cause death to a person inhaling the material is extremely small . ”
“ It is estimated that one millionth of a gram [ of DU ] accumulating in a person 's body would be fatal . ”
( 4 ) Has President Bush contaminated himself ?
DU has a half - life of 4.5 billion years , is infinitesimally tiny in aerosol form , and travels around the world in the prevailing winds .
It is not simply in the Middle East ; it has been carried everywhere on the planet .
The “ smog of war ” has even been found in glaciers . ( 5 )
If you live in Great Britain , the authorities responsible for informing you of dangerous levels of DU may not have informed you because the privatized facilities are owned by Halliburton , ( 6 ) the same firm that mines DU in Australia , ( 7 ) and is the major U.S. war contractor in Iraq as well as a major partner in a mideast oil pipeline consortium . ( 8 )
Halliburton was given the contract to clean up Kuwait , ( 9 ) even though DU can not be cleaned up .
Halliburton is the mother of DU from cradle to grave ( irony intended ) .
Theirs must also be the mother of all conflicts of interest .
DU can be transferred in semen .
It can be brought home on a returning soldier 's gear .
It leads to the most horrible of birth defects , permanent disabilities , and death . ( 10 )
No known protective gear prevents contamination .
( 11 ) There is no cure or treatment .
( 12 )
It kills soldiers and civilians alike , friend , foe , and neutral .
Israel is showing elevated numbers of breast cancer , leukemia , and childhood diabetes cases from downwind DU contamination . ( 13 )
Iraq , Afhganistan , and the Balkans all may well have become permanent wastelands because of DU contamination .
( 14 ) Radiation experts like ( google ) Drs. Leuren Moret , Rosalie Bertell , Doug Rokke , and Dai Williams predict eventual " omnicide " ( 15 ) for the planet if the United States ( or Israel ) drops another load of DU - as they would in a war with Iran .

Official Explanation a “ Fraud ”
World renowned scientist , Lynn Margulis , Ph.D. , has severely criticized the official account of 9/11 and called for a new investigation , “ I suggest that those of us aware and concerned demand that the glaringly erroneous official account of 9/11 be dismissed as a fraud and a new , thorough , and impartial investigation be undertaken . ”

Around 20 years ago McDonalds got a permission from the Communist Party of Soviet Union to open its first rest in Soviet Russia .
It was not only the first McDonalds but generally the first fast food place in Russia ever .
People from all over the Russia when visiting Moscow wanted to visit this “ pearl of the capitalism ” so there were literary a few mile long lines of the visitors to this place .
Also around the same time Pepsi started its sales exclusively in Russia , there were no any other cola or even some soft - drink of any other foreign origin .
The number of points of sale was also limited and also because of that there were long lines to each .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - OPEC has no power over many of the factors buffeting oil markets and the group is worried by record high prices that are threatening the world economy and future demand growth , OPEC ministers said on Tuesday .
“ Please do n’t blame us for $ 93 oil , ” Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah al - Attiyah told reporters on the fringes of an international energy conference .
“ The market is out of control . ”
OPEC President Mohammed bin Dhaen al - Hamli reiterated OPEC would always step in to meet supply shortfalls , but a 34 percent surge in the oil price since mid-August was driven by a flood of speculative investment and international political tensions .
“ The market is increasingly driven by forces beyond OPEC ’s control , by geopolitical events and the growing influence of financial investors , ” said Hamli , who is also UAE oil minister .
“ We are of course concerned about high oil prices . ”
“ We will do what we can , mainly responding to changing demand fundamentals . ”
OPEC oil ministers will meet for informal talks as OPEC heads of state gather in Riyadh in mid-November .
Ministers have ruled out any policy decision at those talks -- OPEC has already agreed to add 500,000 barrels per day of oil from November 1 .
Hamli repeated the line that an output increase was not on the agenda in Riyadh .
OPEC ’s next formal meeting is on December 5 in Abu Dhabi .
“ We are monitoring the situation closely .
We will review the situation there and then , ” Hamli said of the December talks .
“ We have to stay alert .
If the market needs more oil , we will supply it , ” he added .
The 10 OPEC members subject to output restraint -- all except Iraq and Angola -- will aim to ship 27.253 million bpd of oil onto the 86 million bpd global market from November 1 .
If Iraq and Angola ’s production are added in , OPEC will be pumping nearer 31 million bpd .
But consumer nations , including top energy user the United States , are calling for more .
“ If oil is going up and keeping at this level it may hurt the economy , especially non-oil producing developing countries , ” said Nobuo Tanaka , executive director of the International Energy Agency that advises industrialized consumer nations .

" The more foreign parliaments insist that our forebears committed crimes against humanity , the less likely anybody in Turkey is to face up to the hardest moments in history . "
That , roughly speaking , is the message being delivered by Turkey 's hard - pressed intelligentsia as the legislators in one country after another vote for resolutions which insist that the killing of hundreds of thousands of Ottoman Armenians in 1915 amounted to genocide .
" Will the adoption [ of a resolution ] help to inform the Turkish public ... on the great tragedy which befell the Ottoman Armenians ?
" No , it can hardly be expected to ... broaden the debate on the history of the Ottoman Empire 's final period . "
So writes Sahin Alpay , a liberal - minded Turkish academic , in a recent column in Zaman newspaper .
What such appeals reflect , of course , is an elementary fact of human psychology : the phenomenon of individual and collective defensiveness .
When people feel completely secure , and among friends , they can be very frank about misdeeds which they , or people close to them , have committed .
But hackles will go up again as soon as they become insecure , because they feel their accusers are acting in bad faith , or that accepting their accusations will have bad consequences .
On the defensive
In recent years , liberal Turkish scholars have expressed the hope that membership , or even prospective membership of the European Union , will give the country enough confidence to discuss the Armenian tragedy without threatening those who use the " g- word " with prosecution .
Sceptics may retort that in recent years , things have been moving in the opposite direction : the revised Turkish penal code and its preamble , adopted in 2005 , make even more explicit the principle that people may be prosecuted if they " insult Turkishness " - a crime which , as the preamble makes clear , includes the assertion that the Ottoman Armenians suffered genocide .
It is certainly true that Turkish defensiveness - the sort of defensiveness which can treat open discussion as verging on treachery - has been running high since the 1960s when the Armenians round the world began lobbying for an explicit acceptance , by governments and parliaments , that their people suffered genocide in 1915 .
A campaign of violence launched by Armenian militants in the 1970s , who mainly attacked Turkish diplomatic targets and claimed over 50 lives , raised hackles even higher .
All that raises a question : has there ever been a moment , since the events of 1915 , when the Turkish authorities might , conceivably , have acknowledged or even freely discussed the view that almost every Armenian regards as self - evident : the view that in addition to relocating the entire ethnic Armenian population of eastern Anatolia , the " Committee of Union and Progress " ( CUP ) which wielded effective power in the Ottoman empire also gave secret orders to make sure that as few as possible of the deportees survived the experience ?
In fact , there was such a moment : the immediate aftermath of World War I .
Tried and executed
At that time the Ottoman government was intact but dependent for its survival on the good graces of the victorious British Empire .
The sultan 's regime was desperately trying to distance itself from the actions of the CUP , the " state within a state " which in 1915 had masterminded the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Armenians - and is alleged to have given secret " extermination " orders at the same time .
During the early months of 1919 , few people in Anatolia publicly doubted that Armenians had suffered atrocities that were egregious even by the standards of a terrible war .
The sultan and his foreign minister were at pains to reassure the British of their determination to punish the perpetrators of these atrocities , and they held four big and revealing trials whose proceedings were published in the government gazette .
In April 1919 a local governor , Mehmed Kemal , was found guilty and hanged for the mass killing of Armenians in the Ankara district .
But the climate shifted rapidly after May 1919 , when Greek troops were authorised by the victorious Entente powers to occupy the Aegean port of Izmir and , in another part of Anatolia , Mustafa Kemal - later known as Ataturk - began his campaign to make the Turks masters in their own land .
Nationalist feeling
Turkish rage over the Greek landing lent fuel to the Kemalist cause , and discredited the Ottoman government .
With every passing month , the British government 's leverage over the Ottoman authorities waned , and so did British enthusiasm for the conduct of war crimes trials .
In 1921 , the British government made a pragmatic deal to release a group of Turkish prisoners it had been holding in Malta on suspicion ( among other things ) of crimes against the Armenians .
They were freed in exchange for Britons being held by the Turks .
In Turkish lore , this release is held up as proof that no serious evidence against the captives existed .
What it certainly proves is that British zeal for investigating the past was waning , even as the Kemalist cause gained strength and the British - influenced Ottoman regime faded into oblivion .
In any case , the officially cherished version of the Turkish state 's beginnings now insists since the empire 's British adversaries and occupiers were the main promoters of war crimes trials , those trials themselves must have been worthless or malicious .
A new state
But in the midst of all this nationalist discourse , something rather important is often obscured , and there are just a few Turkish historians who dare to point this out .
The atrocities against the Armenians were committed by an Ottoman government , albeit a shadowy sub-section of that government .
There is no logical reason why a new republican administration , established in October 1923 in an act of revolutionary defiance of Ottoman power , should consider itself responsible for things done under the previous regime .
In fact , when the nationalist movement was founded in 1919 , the climate of revulsion over the sufferings of the Armenians was so general that even the neo-nationalists were keen to distinguish themselves from the CUP .
Some see significance in the fact that the nationalist movement chose to rally round an army officer , Mustafa Kemal , who had never been anywhere near the places where the Armenians met their fate .
The very fact that the Turkish republic bears no formal responsibility for eliminating the Armenian presence in eastern Anatolia ( for the simple reason that the republic did not exist when the atrocities occurred ) has given some Turkish historians a flicker of hope : one day , the leaders of the republic will be able to face up to history 's toughest questions about the Armenians , without feeling that to do so would undermine the very existence of their state .
Fatma Muge Gocek , a Turkish - born sociologist who now works as professor in America , has said there are - or will be - three phases in her country 's attitude to the fate of the Armenians : a spirit of " investigation " in the final Ottoman years , a spirit of defensiveness under the Turkish republic , and a new , post - nationalist attitude to history that will prevail if and when Turkey secures a places in Europe .
That makes perfect psychological sense , even if the immediate prospects for a move from phase two to phase three do not look very bright .

Wireless networks are springing up everywhere
The latest attack lets criminals defeat firewalls and spy on where someone goes and what they do online .
It comes after a series of other attacks that , experts say , have left the basic protection in wi-fi comprehensively " broken " .
But compatibility issues mean that many will have no alternative but to use the much weakened protection system .
Lock picking
The basic security measure in the technical specification for wireless networks , 802.11 , is known as Wired Equivalent Privacy .
WEP encrypts data flying back and forth between a computer and an access point to stop people spotting and stealing confidential information .
It does this using an encryption key but numerous attacks have shown how easy it is to get hold of this key and unlock access to the wi- fi network or your data .
" WEP as a security measure is so broken that your ( and everyone else 's ) kid sister can easily circumvent it , " said computer security researcher Ralf - Philipp Weinmann , co-author of the aircrack - ptw tool that can crack WEP in minutes .
Anyone caring about their privacy , said Mr Weinmann , should not use WEP to stop others using their wi-fi hotspot .
Mr Weinmann and his colleagues unveiled aircrack in early 2007 but prior to that three other research teams , in 2001 , 2004 and 2005 showed how to circumvent WEP .
The latest attack , created by Vivek Ramachandran of AirTight Networks , tricks a computer into thinking it is logged on to a wi- fi network it trusts .
It exploits the basic hand - shaking system in wi-fi to get hold of lots of data it can analyse to crack a key .
While the chance that someone will piggyback on your wi- fi network is low , there have been cases in the UK where this has happened .
Malicious attackers can crack WEP to get at key data
Alongside this is the risk of people using your broadband connection for potentially criminal activity .
However , said Mark West of the home tech help company Geek Squad , many people are forced into using WEP despite its shortcomings .
" WEP might be all they can run , " he said .
The well - publicised problems with WEP have resulted in improved security systems for wireless networks known as Wi-fi Protected Access ( WPA ) .
An improved version of this , called WPA - 2 , appeared in 2004 but is not yet widely used .
Mr West said backwards compatibility problems might mean that people cannot opt for the better protection found in WPA or WPA - 2 .
Using either of these requires Windows XP fitted with Service Pack 2 , Vista or OS X on the Mac. Linux also supports WPA .
Drivers for wi-fi access cards might also need to be updated and the firmware on a hub might also need refreshing .
Any other device that tries to link via wi-fi will also need updating .
For many , said Mr West , updating all these separate components could be too much to ask .
A spokesman for BT said that it used WEP on its home hub products because of the compatibility issues .
" We use WEP for a very sensible reason , " said the spokesman , " there are a number of devices out there in the marketplace that do not use WPA . "
When helping people install wi-fi networks Geek Squad started trying to use WPA - 2 but often had to fall back on the weaker protection .
WPA - 2 was only made mandatory on wi-fi access points manufactured after September 2006 , which means much wireless hardware still relies on WEP .
" It 's often the lowest common denominator , " said Mr West , adding that it was better than nothing .
He said : " It 's more of a deterrent that will prevent most people being able to access that router . "

Introduction
1980 arrived and so did a twelve day transit strike - the second major transit strike in 14 years .
When it was settled , a large operating deficit was forecast and the threat of a fare increase was raised to pay for it .
1989 ended with the threat of a large operating deficit ... and the threat of a fare increase was raised to pay for it .
Sound familiar ?
The 1980s could be summarized as the " Jekyll and Hyde " period of the New York Subway System .
As the decade began , it had the filthiest trains , the craziest graffiti , the noisiest wheels , and the weirdest passengers .
By the end of the decade , it had cleaner trains , no graffiti , quieter wheels -- and the weirdest passengers .
( Okay , three out of four ai n't bad ! )
In the 1980s , things got worse before they got better .
Decades of deferred maintenance , going back to Subway Unification in 1940 , finally caught up with the system .
From Unification , through the Board of Transportation era , from the day the New York City Transit Authority was born in 1953 , through the MTA 's birth in 1968 -- political pressure kept both fares and government funding so far below what it cost to maintain the system that maintenance was just not done .
The term " deferred maintenance " became accounting jargon to pass the maintenance burden further out into the future .
In the first half of the 1980s , service , infrastructure and crime were abysmal .
There was no preventative maintenance - components were fixed as they failed - which was often .
Breakdowns occurred an average of every 6,200 miles ; down from 15,000 in the mid-seventies , also not a figure to be proud of .
Signage was very poor , or unreadable due to the graffiti .
By early 1981 , one quarter of the trains were out of service , and thirty minute commutes ballooned to one and a half hours .
1
Richard Ravitch took over the MTA late in 1979 .
Just three weeks after he took over , the LIRR went on strike .
Just a few months after that , both the subway and the LIRR again went out on strike .
Ravitch would inherit a $ 200 million deficit .
Ravitch worked very hard to get the capital improvement programs started .
In 1981 through 1982 , he was able to secure $ 8.1 billion in funding for the first capital improvement program .
In 1982 , the first year of the program , the MTA signed contracts for nearly $ 3 billion in improvements -- more than what it spent in the entire period between 1970 and 1980.2 Reconstruction work at the major yards at 207th Street and Coney Island began .
Contracts valued at $ 150 million for track , switch and signal work were awarded .
Subway station renovation would start late due to disagreements on making stations accessible to the handicapped , but the renovations did get going .
Ravitch laid the groundwork for the system 's turnaround , but would retire in 1984 , just as the fruits of his work were appearing on the vine .
David Gunn took over as TA president and Richard Kiley took over as MTA Chairman after Ravitch retired from the MTA in 1984 .
While they may have received the most accolades for improving the subway so much in the late 1980s , it was Ravitch who started the capital improvement programs and got the funding to turn the poor state of affairs around .
In the second half of the 1980s , the subways shone brighter , literally .
New stainless steel subway cars , the R - 62 ( A ) s for the IRT and the R - 68 ( A ) s for the BMT / IND Divisions , began running .
After a so - so start , they have proven themselves very reliable .
The IRT Redbirds , from class R - 26 up , went through a general overhaul program ( GOH ) and were retrofitted with new components , a new paint job , and air conditioning .
The existing BMT / IND equipment at the time , from car class R - 32 and up , was also taken through a GOH program , and those cars that were originally manufactured without air conditioning were retrofitted with it .
The R - 30s were given a light overhaul , but did not receive air conditioning , because they would have become too heavy .
The MTA embarked on the first of what became many capital plans in November of 1982 , bringing the subway to a state of good repair .
Mean distance between failures ( MDBF ) measurements began to improve markedly , and continue to improve to this day .
Graffiti was finally eradicated from all subway cars by the end of the decade ( though it has been replaced by " scratchitti " in the 1990s ) .
This is the story of the NYC Transit , then known as the Transit Authority , during the 1980s .
This document will examine the state of the Transit Authority and its subway system in the 1980s .
It will wrap up with a list of incidents and accidents that were newsworthy during the 1980s , and list some " odds and ends " that did n't fit " nicely " in the text below .
Fiscal Posturing
During any election year , the transit fare always becomes a major political issue , and 1980 was no exception .
Governor Hugh Carey made an " iron clad " promise to keep the subway fare at 50 cents through 1981 , and considered charging New York metropolitan area owners of automobiles and other vehicles " user fees " that would be used to offset the rising costs of mass transit .
3
These fees would cover a proposed deficit of $ 200 million for 1980 .
The fee would be collected when motorists registered their vehicles , though no specific fee was suggested .
Richard Ravitch , the chairman of the MTA at that time , opposed this user fee , preferring an " inflation sensitive " gasoline tax , which Governor Carey opposed .
It should be noted that $ 39.2 million of this deficit was tied directly to the problem - prone Rockwell International trucks ordered for the R - 46s .
This was the sum total of the overtime needed to inspect cracks on the trucks as well as the cost of repairing equipment that was breaking down at increasing rates .
4
In another effort to save money , the MTA also proposed to eliminate the special half fare program for the elderly during peak hours , and the Sunday half - fare program for all riders .
Hundreds protested this proposal .5
The MTA planned to save $ 44 million with the elimination of these fare programs .
The Sunday Half Fare Program ended on May 1st , 1980 .
MTA board members privately forecast a subway fare increase of 10 to 25 cents for May 1980 due to the need to bring the infrastructure to a state of good repair , increases in operating costs , and fuel and labor costs which the Federal government was no longer subsidizing .
And in a transit message to the New York State Assembly , Governor Carey proposed that the commuter rail lines should bear more of a share of any transit increases than the subways .
6
In March , Carey softened his position somewhat , proposing new taxes on gasoline and petroleum products , but not guaranteeing that the 50 - cent fare would be maintained .
7
The transit contract with the Transport Workers Union Local 100 was due for renewal in April 1980 .
Contract negotiations started on February 4th , with the TWU 's opening demands including a 30 % wage hike and a new holiday to celebrate the union 's founding president , Michael J. Quill .8
The contract would run 21 months .
TWU president John Lawe justified the 30 % increase , explaining that the cost of living had gone up over 53 % since March 1974 , and transit workers required pay raises of 25 -- 31 % just to maintain the same purchasing power that they had back then .9
Ravitch indicated that these demands could not be met , and if they were , subway and bus fares would need to double .
This set the tone for labor negotiations over the next two months , which were primarily confrontational in nature .
Since the MTA is a state agency , the responsibility for finding the money to pay for a transit settlement fell on Governor Carey , who pledged to hold the 50 - cent fare .
New York City Mayor Edward I . Koch , showing his usual feisty style , said the only thing he would contribute to help settle the negotiations was " his two cents " .
10
It was n't until March 31st that the MTA came out with its first offer for the TWU -- a 3½ % wage increase in each year of a proposed 34 - month contract that would expire January 31st , 1983.11
The MTA offer was tied to a long list of productivity improvements .
When this MTA counteroffer was made , the first transit strike since 1966 would be only hours away .
The 1980 Transit Strike
Negotiations failed to come up with an agreement , and The Strike was called .
34,000 members of Transport Workers Union Local 100 walked off their jobs during the early morning hours of April 1st , 1980 .
It was no April Fool 's Joke .
For every day of the strike , the Taylor Law would collect two days pay from each striking worker , and severe fines and penalties could still be levied .
The Union could lose the right to automatically deduct its dues from workers ' paychecks .
12
The initial offering by the MTA was 6 % the first year and 6 % the second year with no cost of living adjustment ; around midnight it was rejected .
Talk then focused on 7 % for the first year , 7 % for the second year and a cost of living adjustment .
That , too , was rejected .
The mediators recommended 8 % for the first year , 8 % in the second year , and other items , but that , too , was not agreed upon .
13
The union was looking to make up lost ground from the 1976 settlement , reached during New York City 's fiscal crisis , where increases were negligible .
The City , on the other hand , just beginning to recover from the fiscal crisis , was thinking very conservatively and was not looking to give away the store as was done in the 1966 transit strike .
Mayor Koch did not want to get involved initially .
His position was that Chairman Ravitch was the chief negotiator for the MTA , not him , and Koch would therefore keep himself a low profile in transit matters .
Unlike the threatened strikes in 1998 and 2002 , where City Hall was very noisy and threatened legal action and astronomical fines , it was relatively quiet in the early days of the 1980 strike .
How did the New York City subway and bus systems shut down in an orderly fashion once the strike was called ?
The last subway and bus runs were those that started before 12:01 am .
Once the subway or bus reached the end of its line , it would run light back to its home terminal .
All manually operated signals would be forced to red by leaving towermen .
An occasional rail polisher train would run each day of the strike to keep the rails shiny and deter vandalism .
Newspapers were filled with stories and pictures of the sea of humanity crossing the Brooklyn Bridge , with cheerleader Koch at the Manhattan end shouting " how'm I doin ? " .
Primary roadways and river crossings were limited to two or three passengers per vehicle in the morning rush .
Police Officers acted as car pool coordinators at tunnel crossings ; pedestrians who showed up were usually able to find room in someone else 's car or truck for the trip into Manhattan .
Your author recalls bicycling to high school in Brooklyn , marveling that the leisurely bike trip took about ½ hour , or half the time it normally took transferring between the B - 5 ( Kings Highway ) , B - 68 ( Coney Island Avenue ) and B - 35 ( Church Avenue ) buses to get to school .
The calendar also helped ease some of the crunch during the first few days of the strike .
Schools were off ; it was the Passover / Easter break .
LIRR employees also went out on strike , but then did an about face at the request of a Federal mediator and went back to work on Thursday April 3rd.14 The Port Authority -- Trans Hudson ( PATH ) lines and Conrail ( now today 's Metro - North ) offered additional services to accommodate additional passengers during the strike .
The Long Island Railroad was unable to handle the additional capacity required to accommodate displaced Queens subway riders , and ended up closing its Queens stations , as well as several in Brooklyn , for the duration of the strike .
The Staten Island Rapid Transit continued running during the strike , and Brooklyn riders drove to SIRT stations , and took the SIRT to the Staten Island Ferry to get to work .
The strike cost the city about $ 2 million a day in lost taxes and another $ 1 million a day in overtime expenses for city employees .
The private sector was losing $ 100 million daily , and job absenteeism hovered between 15 % and 20%.15
The strike was finally settled on April 11th .
The TWU won a contract calling for a 9 % raise in the first year and 8 % in the second year along with a cost of living adjustment ( expected to be at about 20 % ) .
The TA obtained some minor givebacks .
The City was not pleased with the settlement , calling it too expensive .
To offset the new labor agreement , and to make up for a huge operating deficit , the subway fare was raised to 60 cents on July 1st , 1980 .
However , in the first weeks of the increase , if you were able to get your hands on the Russian three - kopek coin ( worth about a nickel in 1980 ) , you could use it to go through turnstiles and save 55 cents !
16
It did n't affect as many people as the subway strike , but Strike Fever spread to the PATH system , too .
On June 12th , 1980 , 177 members of the Brotherhood of Railway Car Men went on strike , which lasted for months .
The union was looking for a 36.3 % salary increase over the next 38 months , but the Port Authority was offering 30 % over the next 42 months .
There were also pension differences that needed to be ironed out .
The strike lasted nearly the entire summer , ending finally on August 27th , and service resumed on September 1st .
The new contract would run for 42 months , grant a pay increase of nearly 30 % and contain additions to the pension plan .
The EL is Still Falling !
In the late 1970s , the West End El was raining chunks of metal .
In 1980 , the Brighton Line joined in .
During the week of March 7th , 1980 , an 11 - year - old schoolboy narrowly missed being pummeled on the head with a 10 - pound lag bolt .
17 A woman walking under the West End El in March 1980 at 52nd Street and New Utrecht Avenue was hit by falling junk .
18 The problem of " falling junk " was widespread along the 182 miles of elevated tracks in the early 1980s .
Many residents living near the West End El complained that noise from the trains was increasing .
19
While a multimillion - dollar noise abatement program was underway in 1980 , most of the funds were spent on underground stations , leaving the West End El unaffected .
Sound studies performed by a Federal team measuring elevated railway noise throughout the country measured the 18th Avenue station between 98 and 106 decibels .
( A jackhammer is rated at 95 decibels ) .
Any sound above 85 dB can cause hearing loss ; you know that you are listening to an 85 - dB sound if you have to raise your voice to be heard by somebody else .

By the end of 1980 , complaints about subway and bus services replaced inadequate sanitation as the number one issue complained about to City Hall .20
On January 8th , 1981 , over 1,000 angry passengers refused to leave a Manhattan - bound CC train at Hoyt / Schermerhorn Streets that was ordered out of service due to door trouble .
21
Many complained that they had already been ordered off other trains that had also been taken out of service due to mechanical problems .
Police were called , yet passengers refused to leave ( and may have been unable to leave , because the platform was extremely crowded ) .
Finally , token clerks handed out free transfers good for other subway or bus lines .
The following day , about 2,000 passengers refused to leave a downtown IRT Broadway local that also had door problems and was ordered out of service .
However , the crew was able to resolve the door problems and the train continued on its route running 18 minutes late .
These were just two of many similar incidents that occurred in the early 1980s , where during rush hours , 25 % of the scheduled trains , on average , did n't run .
Just how bad was the system by early 1981 ?
22
In January , there was one Tuesday where 1/3 of the subway fleet was not in service .
In the first two weeks of January , 500 trains were cancelled each day .
A trip taken in 1910 that took 10 minutes could take four times as long in 1981 .
There were 30 derailments in 1980 .
Infrastructure was not routinely inspected and few repairs were made until a failure occurred .
In January of 1981 , none of the 2,637 IRT cars had ever had an overhaul .
Subway rolling stock , in general , had n't received preventative maintenance since 1975 .
The average MDBF in 1981 was 6,639 miles , down from 13,900 ( ! ) in 1977 , and 24,000 in 1970 .
23
The R - 44s and R - 46s , the newest cars in the system , consisted of 25 % of the IND - BMT 's 4,178 subway cars .
Yet they were the most prone to breakdowns : the R - 44s because of sophisticated technology installed in anticipation of operating on a fully automated Second Avenue Line and the R - 46s due to their cracked trucks .
The Transit Authority always claimed that lack of funding is what led to the deplorable condition of the subway in 1981 .
There were also accusations of mismanagement cited by the press .
One example cited was $ 300 million spent on subway cars only to find out that they did n't fit properly in the repair shops .
Millions more were spent on spare parts that were stored in leaky warehouses and forgotten , while maintainers lacked the necessary spare parts to keep subway cars running .
24
The subway car shortage became so acute at one point that vacations were cancelled and overtime for car maintainers shot through the roof .
In May of 1981 , the TA , for the second time since 1977 , wanted to close the Franklin Avenue Shuttle in Brooklyn .
The TA cited its deplorable condition and lack of ridership as its reasons for closing the line .
Dean Street was still open in 1981 , but its condition at that time was beyond words -- a sagging canopy , light poles broken at the base , and platform railings intended to prevent passengers from falling over the side of the platform were ready to collapse under their own weight .
A section of over 100 feet of concrete retaining wall shifted over a foot near Bergen Street in February of 1980 , and was buttressed by a makeshift brace of heavy timbers that probably lasted until the Shuttle was closed for repairs in the 1990s .
If this wall had slipped more , the tracks would have surely collapsed .
This collapse started as a crack that had been known about for months , but nothing was done about it until this near - disaster occurred .
The TA felt that bus service could adequately serve the needs of these riders for a fraction of the cost of maintaining the shuttle .
It would cost between $ 45 and $ 60 million to renovate , while replacement bus service would cost $ 500,000 a year .

The Shuttle line would be allowed to deteriorate throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s ( where it would appear much more decrepit ) , til finally being overhauled 1998 - 1999 .

On July 17th , 1981 , the MTA board voted to close the Franklin Avenue Shuttle effective November 1st .
The shuttle had been closed for a two - week period ending May 7th due to demolition of a building adjacent to the tracks .
The fight over the Franklin Avenue Shuttle became political , when Brooklyn state lawmakers vowed not to vote for future MTA money requests until they were assured that the shuttle would stay open .
Some people compared the shuttle with The Train to the Plane , which ran with a deficit similar to the shuttle -- why close the shuttle if the Train to the Plane would remain running ?
Bowing to this political pressure , the TA backed off this proposal .
Red Alert !
Structural defects that required immediate attention were labeled as Code Red defects or " Red Tag " areas .
" Immediate attention " was defined as " within 24 hours " .
However , there were so many structural problems throughout the entire subway system that many went unrepaired for months !
38 Code Red defects were recorded on the IRT New Lots Avenue line between the Nostrand Avenue and New Lots Avenue stations between January 1980 and July 1981 ; as of October 1981 , fifteen of these defects had not yet been corrected .
26 Some columns that supported elevated structures were so shaky that trains would not run if the wind exceeded 65 mph .
This was particularly widespread the Flushing and Jamaica elevated lines .
In 1981 , the subway fleet was in such poor shape that many cars were leaving the repair yards with known defects , severe enough to cause even more breakdowns .
Dead motors were a huge problem , even during the warmer months .
The subway system was in such bad shape that the State Legislature declared a " transportation emergency " and passed an $ 8 billion program to rehabilitate the system .
27
The MTA received most of this financing , and this funding became the first 5 - year capital improvement program , originally announced in 1980 .
About half of the program covered the purchase of new subway cars and buses .
The federal government was not helping the TA overcome its bad image , and this is not a reference to inadequate funding .
In 1981 , the National Transportation Safety Board released a report based on a yearlong study that revealed that safety regulations for mass transit systems , including New York 's , were inadequate and left the potential for disaster .
28 Transit staff was generally inadequately trained to evacuate subway tunnels in an emergency .
Transit equipment , using a new generation of plastics , increased the fatality risk in the event of a fire .
The study blamed the US Department of Transportation for not regulating safety standards .
Well , at least the study did n't completely shift the blame to individual transit systems .
By early 1982 , though , not much headway was made in stopping the deterioration of subway and bus service .
The Economic Development Council , a business group headed by David Rockefeller that originated in 1965 , ran an executive - lending program for businesses to address issues .
The EDC offered a plan to start resolving the issues , offering to recruit 20 business executives to do so .
The EDC 's report cited duplication of duties across different organizations in the TA and severe procurement problems .
In addition , responsibility for fighting graffiti and vandalism was divided between two departments , and it was n't clear which department was responsible for subway stations .
In August of 1983 , TA President John Simpson resigned his position .
During his tenure , Mr. Simpson concentrated on car maintenance , and was able to improve service and get on - time performance back to 90 % .
He also negotiated the use of Washington ( DC ) Metropolitan Area Transit Authority ( WMATA ) buses when the Grumman Flxibles were grounded .
A few days later , Chairman Richard Ravitch resigned his position as MTA chairman .
Mr. Ravitch engineered the first capital improvement program , which helped begin the long process of getting the subway into a state of good repair .
On October 5th , 1983 , Robert Kiley was appointed the new MTA chairman .
Kiley 's previous job was the head of Boston 's Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ( MBTA ) .
Kiley hired David Gunn as TA president on February 1st , 1984 .
Gunn 's previous job was head of Philadelphia 's Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority ( SEPTA ) .
The EDC 's support was not effective in reversing the spiral of defective equipment and poor service .
In an interview with the Daily News published on October 21st , 1984 , TA president David Gunn stated that 4,000 of the TA 's 6,400 cars needed " a lot of work " , and that it was n't the age of the subway cars that necessitated the work -- it was " poor everyday maintenance and a lack of a major overhaul program " that caused the problems .
29 Gunn instituted an overhaul program in 1984 where 200 cars per year would be completely overhauled , and the first cars to go through this program were the R - 36s that ran on the IRT Flushing Line .
When the work was completed , the cars would take on the paint scheme now known as the " Redbird " , and the interior would also be painted .
Interior graffiti found on subway cars would be removed at the end of a run .
Once a car was overhauled , the TA would make sure it stayed that way .
This overhaul program would eventually be expanded to increase the number of rebuilt cars per year .
Some cars , such as the R - 10s , would not be overhauled because of their age ; they would be " spruced up " .
The long - standing policy of placing the least reliable cars -- and some of the newest - on the longest runs on the system was finally questioned .
The overhaul program began to improve the MDBF of all the lines as the overhauled cars went back into service .
Photographer Jim Maurer captured this view of spruced - up R - 10 cars on the Jamaica Bay crossing in 1986 .
The state of the subway actually put off a fare hike in late 1984 .
TA President David Gunn wanted to improve service before instituting a fare hike , because service was not at " acceptable " levels .
The TA asked patience in allowing it to get things together .
The TA also reconsidered the renovation of some subway stations so that more subway cars would be overhauled .
The proposed 1985 budget contained a number of promised improvements :30
The number of trains that break down in service or never leave the yard due to a malfunction would be reduced to a handful in any given rush hour .
The goal was no more than 24 trains per rush hour .
78 stations and 3½ miles of elevated trestle would get fresh paint .
Motormen would get new uniforms .
Complaints about rude subway employees would drop 35 % .
500 subway cars would be painted at the newly overhauled Coney Island shops , more than double the number painted in 1984 .
Graffiti would be permanently removed from 1,721 subway cars .
Stainless steel subway cars would be washed every two weeks .
Lights , heat , air conditioning , and public address systems would work in 90 % of all subway cars .
Maps and destination signs would be correct in the same percentage of cars .
Stations would be washed every two weeks instead of every three .
Escalator / elevator failures would drop to 2 % .
A new double crossover would be installed on the Brighton Line south of the Brighton Beach station between the two express tracks .
This was moved to the 1987-1991 capital program , and was eventually dropped .
Yard expansions to store out of service trains would reduce the possibility of graffiti vandals tagging trains stored outside of yards .
The yards to be expanded were 239th St. , Unionport and Coney Island yards .
While the focus may have been on the subway cars and the stations , items that passengers could see , there were rumblings underfoot that every mile of subway track would have to replaced in the next ten years .
The deferred maintenance era hit track , too , with only 1/5 of the required track work being done during the 1970s .
31
There were 450 red tag areas of track where trains needed to slow to 5 -- 10 mph , and the number of yellow tag areas -- portions of track that were not in immediate danger but would need replacement soon -- stood at 334 in February of 1984 .
Future capital programs would need to allocate funds for track replacement .
By the summer of 1985 , though , the overhaul program was n't getting top billing by the press -- it was a report by the Straphangers Campaign32 that revealed :
¼ of all subway cars had at least one broken door panel ,
1/5 of all subway cars were dark or poorly lit ,
1/6 of all subway cars had illegible maps or incorrect destination signs ,
Rush hour riders traveling between 20 and 45 minutes could expect to be six minutes late 40 % of the time ,
The East Side IRT was rated best for working doors , adequate lighting and properly labeled trains , largely because of the new R - 62s running on the line .
The GG line had the most poorly lit and mislabeled trains , while the LL had the most missing maps and the J and M lines had the most defective doors .
In 1986 , a second $ 8 billion capital improvement program was passed , but this program did not include any funding for the Franklin Avenue Shuttle .
For the third time , it was again on the chopping block , this time requiring restoration at an estimated cost of $ 40 - $ 70 million .
Deterioration of the line was very extensive .
While the line still remained open , it seemed that it would either close because of an MTA decision to do so , or because it would fall apart as a result of no repairs being made to it .
The MTA was hoping for a federal contribution of $ 1.5 billion ; due to federal budget problems , that number shrank to $ 648 million .
Mayor Koch was unwilling to increase New York City 's contribution to the MTA as well .
Governor Mario Cuomo was hoping to get the funding issues resolved by the spring of 1986 , but Republicans preferred to wait until after the November 1986 election .
Funding was so tight that there was real consideration of closing either the IND Concourse Line or the IRT Jerome Avenue Line , dropping IND service to the Rockaways and running buses instead , truncating the BMT Jamaica Line in Brooklyn and cutting back service on the Staten Island Rapid Transit.33
In February 1986 , the Straphangers Campaign 's " report card " of subway service revealed that the number of subway cars with better lighting , legible maps and correct signage was increasing -- a good trend -- but announcements , rush hour service and the number of cars with broken doors did not improve at all from the previous year .
In general , 24.1 % of the fleet had broken doors , 20.4 % had inadequate lighting , 6.9 % had unreadable maps and 11.7 % of trains had incorrect signage .
34
The line rated best was the Lexington Avenue IRT mainly because of the new R - 62s ; the line rated worst was the GG Crosstown , with 43.3 % of trains having broken doors and 42.9 % of trains having poor lighting .
All Cracked Up
The R - 46 Rockwell truck fiasco continued unabated into 1980 .
The rate of cracks found on the trucks nearly doubled , from 889 cracks logged in February 1979 to 1,700 in March 1980.35
The R - 46s had to be inspected several times a week at the TA 's expense , and the TA and New York City filed suit against Rockwell , Pullman Standard and four other subcontractors for $ 192 million .
As of March 1980 , 62 R - 46s were out of service due to cracks and 112 were out of service for other reasons .
While the inspections caught many cracks before they became unfixable problems , on September 27th , two cracks of a type not before seen were found on the trucks .
36
As a result , the TA cut the R - 46 usage rate in half , and they would run only during weekday rush hours .
Until this time , they were run between 6 am and 10 pm every day .
Shuffling the R - 46s in and out of the yards was causing delays throughout all the IND - BMT lines .
In an effort to reduce the mileage that the R - 46s ran , 144 of them were moved to the Brighton Line , but complaints from Brighton Beach residents about excessive vibration forced the TA to move them to the A and CC lines .
37 Ironically , R - 46s were run at all times during an acute equipment shortage during December 1980 and January 1981 , due to very cold weather .
Even the JFK Express was affected -- there were times in early 1981 where R - 10s were making up the service !
All of the R - 16s , the cars the R - 46s were intended to replace , were put back into service while the R - 46 problems were sorted out .
The problems were , besides the cracked trucks , heaters and wiring that posed fire hazards , faulty lighting and door controls .
Yet there was even a TA proposal to remove the cross seats from the R - 46s and replace them with side facing seats , as found in the R - 27s through R - 42s .
In late December of 1981 , the TA won $ 72 million in damages from Rockwell International , but the City Department of Investigation indicted seven high - ranking transit officials in connection with the planning , purchase , inspection and acceptance of the R - 46 subway cars .
Improprieties such as favoritism to certain contactors and mismanagement were cited .
On March 8th , 1982 , Rockwell paid New York City $ 80 million for damages that resulted from the faulty trucks .

Even without the R - 46 truck problems , the TA 's strategy of purchasing subway cars with new technologies seemed fine on paper , but it was a disaster in practice .
The R - 44s and R - 46s had enough technology in them to make Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott of the USS Enterprise smile with glee , but they were barely able to make it through their runs .
They were so complex that repairs that should have been " simple " took weeks to make , and the Department of Car Equipment was not provided the required education to be able to handle these issues in a timely manner .
It was this scenario that caused the TA to do an about - face with the R - 62 and R - 68 contracts , which were all " back to basics " , and it was n't until the 1990s that the TA decided to " risk " getting involved with new technologies with the R - 110A and R - 110B experimental " new technology " trains .
By 1986 , the R - 46s still had n't seen an MDBF greater than 10,000 miles.38
It was n't just the R - 46s that were cracking up .
In 1979 and 1980 , the TA took possession of 637 new Grumman Flxible Model 870 buses .
On November 19th , 1980 , they were ordered off the streets because cracks had been discovered in 39 bus frames during routine inspections .
At the time , these buses represented about 14 % of the City 's bus fleet .39 Many of these buses had n't seen 3 months of service .
Many of the buses returned to service , but were again removed from service around December 13th .
The TA also decided to dissolve an agreement for 570 additional Model 870s .
Initially , Grumman rejected the ideas that the cracks were a design defect , but as the number of cracked frames increased , Grumman agreed to pay for repairs .
The TA was n't certain that the buses could be repaired .
On December 8th , 1980 , the TA told Grumman to stop producing the last 200 buses in the initial 837 - bus contract .
The following day , the TA stopped paying Grumman for the current contract , and took steps to dissolve a $ 65 million follow - up order .
Up to this time , the TA still owed Grumman $ 46 million on an $ 89 million contract .
Grumman countered that the TA breached its contract with them by withholding payment .
In March of 1981 , after several corrections to the Model 870s were made , they returned to service .
Even so , the Model 870s would be grounded and partially replaced by mothballed buses that were due for scrapping , but these mothballed buses were far from meeting service requirements .
Waits for buses in all five boroughs skyrocketed .
The TA was forced by federal law to accept the lowest bid for the bus contract , but because of the defects , they wanted to give the contract to General Motors ( for the RTS - I ) .
However , that same law prohibited the TA from just walking away from the contract .
If Grumman were unwilling to give the contract to GM , the TA would have to prove that the buses were poorly built and unsafe .
If the TA succeeded in doing that , Grumman Flxible would be barred from bidding for any future bus contracts in the US .
Meanwhile , where would all the extra buses needed for daily service come from ?
A Christmas present from Washington , DC -- that 's where !
A caravan of 105 creaking old buses leased from WMATA would meander its way to New York City , with a National Guard escort , leaving Washington at 10:40 am on December 27th , 1980.40
The convoy was accompanied by extra mechanics , tow trucks , tools and truckloads of spare parts .
It was hoped that the cost of the WMATA buses would be recovered from Grumman Flxible .
Much of this convoy was recently returned from a stint in Philadelphia , where officials indicated that numerous breakdowns occurred .
Nearly 150 MTA employees were flown to Washington , then bused to WMATA 's New Carrollton and Landover , MD shops to pick up the buses .
The first WMATA bus to debut on a revenue run in New York City ran on the M106 crosstown run down 42nd Street heading east from 12th Avenue .
Staten Island express bus service was supplemented by approximately 100 MC8s leased from Greyhound .
The MTA was considering paying Grumman the money outstanding on its contract in return for Grumman to make all necessary repairs to the 637 buses and not produce the remaining 200 buses in the contract .
The TA would give the remaining bus contract to GM .
Efforts to complete this agreement were fought by the City 's Comptroller , Harrison J. Goldin .
230 Grumman Model 870s were also removed from the streets of Los Angeles due to the same defect .
In December of 1980 , the Chicago Transit Authority grounded 205 Grumman Flxibles .
Houston grounded over 300 of their Grummans , too .
While Grumman and Rockwell were incapable of manufacturing sturdy subway and bus equipment , they were able to manufacture satisfactory components for the space program !
41
And why were there only two bus manufacturers in 1980 , Flxible and GM ?
In 1971 , the Federal government mandated an " ideal " bus design called " Transbus " which was very lightweight , contained sealed windows , air conditioning , a small engine and low ground clearance .
The parts would be interchangeable and easily repairable .
Three manufacturers built prototypes of the bus , then indicated they would never build another .
The federal government , realizing that their good intentions for an ideal bus would never see the light of day , accepted the Model 870 and the RTS - I as compromises .
The Feds left it up to the manufacturers to choose the materials they would use to meet the Transbus requirements .
The materials Flxible chose could not stand up to the punishing streets of New York City .
In order for cities to obtain 80 % in federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration ( UMTA ) grants , they were forced to purchase either the Model 870 or the RTS -- any other bus would not be federally funded .
When GM and Flxible bid for the MTA 's bus contract , Flxible was the lower bidder , and the MTA was mandated by law to accept the lowest bid .
The MTA never liked the Model 870 , but Flxible was no longer manufacturing the old style buses that the MTA was used to .
42
In 1982 , the MTA was exploring the purchase of new buses from the Hino Company of Japan and Renault of France .
The contract would be for 325 buses per year for 5 years .
On February 7th , 1984 , David Gunn , on his 5th day as the TA president , ordered all of the Model 870s grounded after one of them , an express bus from Brooklyn , burst into flames while it was being driven back to a garage in Manhattan .
43
They never returned to service again .
The MTA tried to sell the buses while they were in storage at the Brooklyn Army Terminal .
As of 1985 , there were no buyers .
The TA sued Grumman for $ 324 million in damages citing fraud ; Grumman countersued for $ 1 billion citing poor maintenance as the reason for the Flxible 's failures .
The MTA had to repay the federal government the funding it provided - $ 56 million -- by July 1st , 1984 because the federal UMTA wanted the MTA to put the buses back in service .
Grumman later agreed to buy the buses back , refurbished them a bit and then resold the buses at bargain prices .
New Jersey Transit bought 120 of them and recognizing a great deal , bought 500 more of them .
Queen City Metro ( Cincinnati ) also bought some and some also went to Puerto Rico .
The 620 buses that went to NJ Transit performed very well and the last of them were retired in 2000 .
Despite the problems , New York City Transit has retained one Grumman Model 870 bus for the historical collection .
Shown here is number 236 at the 2000 Transit Museum Bus Fest .

The A - frame problem was traced to poor engineering by Rohr , Flxible 's previous parent before Grumman .
The bus was not subjected to the proper testing to see if the design would hold up , and when Grumman purchased Flxible , they thought the 870 design was good to go and began building the bus immediately .
By all indications , Grumman Flxible solved the A - frame problem and these buses went on to run for years in a number of cities , but the 870 had become a political liability in New York City after 1980 .
The 1984 fire that engulfed the 870 on 57th Street and resulted in Gunn removing the entire fleet from service was not due to any Flxible design defect , but was caused by poor TA maintenance practices .
The bus was missing a rear shock absorber that caused another part to rub against a wiring harness ; this shorted out the wiring harness and ignited the blaze .
44
This was n't the end though .
In the late 1970s , the MTA purchased a number of new double - decker buses to run down 5th Avenue .
Someone forgot to measure the clearance from overhead traffic lights .
The buses did n't stay there for long .
They ended their runs on the M4 and M5 bus routes .
The 63rd Street and Archer Avenue Extensions
A citizen 's survey revealed that , in 1980 , the subway was in the worst condition of its 75 - year history .
45 The New York Public Interest Research Group and the Institute for Public Transportation concluded that the system 's performance was very poor and its maintenance was even worse .
They probably could have saved a great deal of money by just reporting the obvious .
It did n't take a rocket scientist to reach that conclusion in 1980 .
According to a five - year study by the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee in 1981 , the frequency of subway breakdowns was causing passengers to find alternate means of getting to and from work .
121 By November of 1984 , things did n't change drastically .
Much of the subway 's track would need replacement within a few years , and some needed immediate replacement .
42 % of subway cars needed heavy work , but there was no plan in place to perform this work .
46
There were more than 5,000 fires on the subway by the end of 1984 , so many in fact , that the National Transportation Safety Board was sent in to investigate causes and recommend solutions 47 .
Other major cities ' subway systems had very few fires in the same period , though some TA sources felt that these cities were not as diligent in reporting fires as the TA was .
Your author could have made a great deal of money in 1984 by recommending to the TA that they clean up tons of garbage left by uncaring riders , and by launching a no-litter advertising campaign !

During this entire time , work on the 63rd St and Archer Avenue subway lines continued , although the MTA considered stopping work on these projects in October of 1980 , and spending the money instead on maintaining the existing system .
The Archer Avenue line was due to be completed in 1984 , and the 63rd Street line in 1985 .
Progress of the Archer Avenue subway tunnel stopped in March 1982 , when on March 5th , part of the tunnel caved in around the vicinity of Archer Avenue and 138th Street .
One construction worker was killed , and three others narrowly escaped injury .
This four - man crew was reinforcing the tunnel walls when this reinforcement gave way , causing the cave - in.48
By July of 1985 , political pressure on the MTA regarding the project was growing .
Senator Alfonse D'Amato asked the Senate to investigate the tunnel project and the use of federal funds to ensure they were being spent appropriately .
He also asked the US Attorney 's Office to launch a grand jury investigation of the tunnel .49
Many probes did take place -- by the FBI ( for criminal wrongdoing ) , the TA 's inspector general and the Department of Transportation ( because 80 % of the money spent on the tunnel was federal funds ) .
One of the subcontractors for the tunnel was defending itself against a fraud indictment .
Early in the investigations , documentation regarding the project 's major expenses was found to be inadequate .
Water seepage became a very serious problem , with 6 feet of water in some tunnel sections .
In fact , as early as 1974 , the TA was made aware of these leaks but did little about them .
Meanwhile , tracks rusted , concrete disintegrated and formed stalactites in the tunnel .
Cracks appeared in the new tunnel walls .
The 21st Street station , without seeing a single paid passenger , was tagged with graffiti .
An incorrectly designed 5 - foot thick support beam did not allow clearance for trains to pass beneath it ; when it was altered to provide the necessary clearance , it may not have been reinforced adequately .
50 The FBI was looking into allegations of bribery , where a TA engineer okayed the repairs instead of replacing the beam , which might have further delayed the project .
Despite everyone in the field of transportation examining the tunnel project for monetary and project management defects , the MTA also hired a firm to re-examine the tunnel for structural and engineering defects .
Based on the results of this study , a decision would be made whether to finish completing the line .
Construction Technology Laboratories of Skokie , IL , was hired to assess the structural integrity of the tunnel , and report back to the MTA within 90 days with a recommendation to keep the project going or stop work and abandon the project .
51 The Federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration announced on July 22nd , 1985 , that it would suspend federal funding pending the outcomes of the investigations .
And why did it come to this ?
The water leakage problem , internal infighting , faulty record keeping , time - consuming attempts to obtain funding for repair work and the fiscal crisis of 1975 led to the situation .
While all tunnels leak to some extent , excessive leakage has to be taken care of ; the TA knew about this in 1974 but did n't do anything about the problem .
This type of leakage accelerated corrosion .
In September of 1985 , there was political pressure ( again ) placed on the TA to abandon the line , because the expected ridership would cover a very small amount of the line 's operating costs .
MTA figures on fare recovery indicated that between 1 % and 6 % of operating costs would be covered by fares , even if the line were to be extended to the IND Queens Blvd line .
52
In October of 1985 , Construction Technology Laboratories found the 63rd Street tunnel structurally sound .
One girder in particular , " G - 4 " , was scrutinized because of the lack of train clearance underneath it ; 13 inches of the girder were shaved off and its structural integrity was questioned .
The engineering firm found the girder to be sound .
The project would ultimately continue .
By the end of 1985 , it was well known that the original intent of the 63rd Street subway , to run to eastern Queens , was never going to happen .
It was also known that the current terminus of the line , at 21st Street in Queensbridge , was useless ; 220 passengers an hour were the usage projections in 1984 .
The MTA was studying four options for making this line more useful :53
The Queens Express Bypass : extending the line along the LIRR to 71st / Continental Avenues in Forest Hills .
It would be completed in 1998 and cost $ 931 million .
This was the original plan for this line proposed in the 1968 MTA Program for Action .
It was felt that only this option would relieve the overcrowding on the E and F lines .
Connecting the line to the local tracks of the IND Queens Blvd line .
It was the cheapest and fastest alternative to complete -- it would be done in 1993 at a cost of $ 222 million .
But critics complained that it would do the least to relieve overcrowding on the E and F lines in Queens , the most crowded lines in the system .
The line would leave two - thirds of the available capacity of this line unused and probably make any future expansion of this line unlikely .
Extending the 63rd Street line through the Sunnyside Yard and the LIRR to the Archer Avenue subway .
It would cost $ 594 million and be completed by 1997 , but residents along the proposed route objected to this option .
Extending the line to Sunnyside Yard in Queens and allow passengers to connect to a new LIRR service stopping in Rosedale and Queens Village .
The route of the new LIRR service would be the Montauk branch , used mostly for freight service .
It would cost $ 488 million and be completed by 1995 , but like the proposal above , Queens residents along the proposed route objected to it .
Manhattan Bridge is Falling Down !
Williamsburgh Bridge is Falling Down !
It was n't just the R - 46s , the Grumman Flxibles and the 63rd Street Tunnel that were cracking up -- the Manhattan Bridge was showing signs of excessive wear and tear .
The bridge , designed and built by Gustav Lindenthal in 1903 , had a major design flaw : the subway tracks were placed on the outside of the bridge deck instead of inside near the center , as on the Williamsburgh Bridge .
As a result , every time trains crossed the bridge , the structure would flex , sometimes as much as eight feet .
This flexing , called torsion , caused already weak steel to crack , and these cracks caused more serious failures .
If you were to stand on the span as a train rumbled by , you could see the span dip and rise with the train 's passing .
For the majority of the Manhattan Bridge 's life , subway trains used the north side of the bridge far more often than the south side , and the bridge developed a permanent " tilt " with the north side being somewhat lower than the south side .
As early as 1953 , the Board of Transportation had a permanent solution -- a new river runnel at the cost of $ 90 million -- but it never received the funding .
An alternate to using the bridge was floated as early as October 1983 , when Brooklyn Assemblyman Daniel Feldman proposed a $ 100 million tunnel of 3,800 feet under Prospect Park that would connect the BMT Brighton Line to the IND South Brooklyn Line .
54
The tunnel was deemed necessary because of the Brighton Line 's bottleneck at Prospect Park , where it is reduced from four tracks to two , while the IND South Brooklyn Line was built with four tracks , and was very underutilized .
Rush hour throughput on the Brighton Line could be increased as much as 50 % , and Manhattan Bridge subway traffic could be reduced , slowing down its deterioration .
Supporters of the Franklin Avenue shuttle , however , felt that this proposal would be the final nail on the shuttle 's coffin and would ultimately be the reason for its demise .
In 1983 , closing the shuttle was high on the TA 's agenda .
In addition , conservationists feared ecological damage to Prospect Park during the construction , but Assemblyman Feldman noted that construction would all be done underground , with no cut - and - cover construction used .
The proposal never saw the light of day , but the Manhattan Bridge continued to deteriorate .
In May of 1982 , a routine inspection revealed a cracked beam above the north side subway tracks near the Manhattan tower , forcing emergency rerouting of B and D trains .
In both 1982 and 1983 , midday routings of D trains would send them via tunnel and Nassau Street Loop to just past Essex Street onto the Williamsburgh Bridge , where trains would reverse direction , go through the Chrystie Street cut , and rejoin 6th Avenue service at Broadway / Lafayette .
This added 20 minutes to the mid-day commute for Brighton Line riders .
The condition of the Manhattan Bridge got worse .
In 1985 , the north side of the Manhattan Bridge was closed for the summer for emergency repairs .
By the fall , the north side reopened , and later that year , the south side of the Bridge would be shut down , with the expectation for service to return in 1988 .
The south side of the bridge stayed closed until July of 2001 !!
Extensive corrosion was found in new areas as repairs to other identified areas occurred , severely hampering the progress to complete the repairs .
Full BMT service across the bridge was a distant memory to a generation of Brooklyn subway riders .
The bridge was not built to handle the loads of heavier subway cars .
A tunnel to replace the bridge was voted down as being too expensive .
It would take 20 years and cost more than $ 1 billion , and the areas on both sides of the bridge are developed , leaving little room , if any , for tunnel approaches for trains .
Canal Street , with its high water table ( a canal used to run there at one time ) and poor soil conditions , would not be a good place to have a tunnel .55
The Williamsburgh Bridge supposedly was immune to the disease that plagued the Manhattan Bridge .
It was n't though -- it caught the same disease , only the cause was different .
In March of 1984 , BMT Eastern Division trains across the bridge were significantly curtained during non-rush hours for a two - year period so repairs could be made .
By 1988 , the bridge was in very poor shape .
Blame this one on the pigeons , rain , rust , greed and neglect .
Pigeon droppings slowly eroded portions of the bridge 's main cables , because the cables were strung using ungalvanized steel .
The Williamsburgh Bridge was the only major bridge ever built of ungalvanized steel , a cost saving measure at the time it was built .
Corrosion formed on the bridge shortly after it opened in 1903 and never stopped forming .
The acid from the pigeon droppings , rust forming when it rained , salt being dropped during the winter , and poor drainage allowed corrosion to eat away at the unprotected cables and the bridge deck .
Various attempts to slow down the corrosive process were attempted , but none succeeded .
Broken cable strands weakened the bridge significantly .
Gaping holes in concrete caused chunks of it to fall on maintenance walkways beneath the road deck .
More than 200 wires in the northernmost cable anchorage were broken .
Wires were starting to break in the southernmost anchorage , too , and in April of 1988 , no cause for these breaks was discovered .
Computers monitored the bridge 's wires around the clock for stress being placed on the cables ; levels too high would cause state DOT commissioners to halt traffic on the bridge .
By this time , the state Department of Transportation rated the bridge 1.6 on a scale of 1 to 7 -- just enough of a rating to keep it from being immediately closed .
56
The bridge was closed to train traffic on April 11th , 1988 , when a painter on the bridge noticed a hole in a girder .
Vehicular traffic was suspended two days later because other beams were found to be corroded .
While the bridge was closed , subway cars running on the BMT Eastern Division were isolated from the rest of the subway system , so arrangements were made to transfer cars to Coney Island using diesel locomotives running over the LIRR Bay Ridge freight line and the South Brooklyn Railway .
J and M trains ran no further than Marcy Avenue , and passengers were advised to transfer at Broadway Junction for A , C and L trains , or to use a temporary ferry setup at the foot of the bridge .
Additional service on these lines was required due to overcrowding .
Even the JFK Express was affected by the bridge closing ; the extra fare was not collected weekdays , the trains were lengthened to eight cars , and the train made express stops on the IND Fulton Street line between Howard Beach and Hoyt - Schermerhorn Streets .
From that point , it made local stops to 57th Street / 6th Avenue .
Train traffic resumed over the Williamsburg Bridge on June 12th , 1988 , and the temporary ferry ceased operating .
Weekday JFK
Express trains resumed their normal stops and schedules .
When the Williamsburg Bridge was built , it replaced the Broadway ferry that stopped near the foot of the bridge .
When the bridge was closed in April of 1988 , ferry service returned !
A makeshift dock was erected and ferry service using two of the smaller Staten Island ferryboats began service on April 18th , 1988 .
Transportation to / from Manhattan from this point went full circle in the 20th century .
The Federal government was reluctant to provide money to rehabilitate the J and M lines in the late 1980s because of doubts about the structural integrity of the Williamsburgh Bridge .
It was seriously thought that the bridge would have to be replaced , or an extremely difficult cable - replacement project , without engineering precedent , would need to be performed on the bridge to keep it structurally viable .
Crime is Still High
February 13th , 1980 marked the 1st anniversary of the " Guardian Angels " , a group of ( at that time ) 220 " tough kids " who patrolled the subways and buses in an attempt to deter crime .
57 During a City Council meeting where members of safety and transportation committees met jointly to discuss transit crime , the founder of the Guardian Angels , Curtis Sliwa , night manager of a McDonalds on East Fordham Road in the Bronx , appeared to be more in tune with the level of crime than Transit Police Chief James Meehan .
While Meehan testified that he could provide sufficient protection to straphangers with the 2,300 members of his police force , Sliwa was advocating additional policemen to patrol the subways .
While the City Council received Mr. Sliwa 's remarks very favorably , statistics would seem to backup Mr. Meehan 's comments .
In a one - year period between March 1979 and March 1980 , felonies per day dropped from 261 to 154.58
While these figures were still at very unacceptable levels , at least the trend was in the right direction .
Yet the New York Times reported that between the summer of 1979 and 1980 , crime on the subway rose 70%!59
Philadelphia police officers suggested that a good way to combat crime on the New York subway was to use police dogs .
A TA spokesman said that the use of police dogs was studied several times over the past 30 years ( to 1950 ) , and was never tried , though the idea was never ruled out , either .
Reasons against the use of police dogs ranged from expense to crowding making the dogs nervous .
60 However , canine patrols did begin on the subway on December 15th , 1980 .
Canine patrols also started at the Corona Yard in August of 1981 in an effort to prevent vandalism .
Two German Shepherds named Suzy and Red made the first patrols .
While Mayor Koch was endeared to this idea , and hoped it would spread to other yards , the TA cited high costs for this program .
The dogs could not patrol the mainline tracks where many of the cars were stored when they were not in use .
The yard canine patrols ended a few months later .
An epidemic of subway car window bashing broke out on the Pelham Line in 1980 , causing $ 2 million in damages .
It spread to other lines during the course of the year .
When the broken windows were discovered in trains that were still in service , they were taken out of service , causing additional delays .
775 vandalism - related delays of more than four minutes were reported in August 1980.61 Crime was such a problem that senior City Hall and transit officials considered raising the subway fare from 60 to 65 cents to fund additional transit police officers .
On January 20th , 1982 , MTA Chairman Richard Ravitch spoke during a breakfast meeting of the Association for a Better New York , a business group .
He told the group that he would not let his teenage sons ride the subway at night , and that even he was nervous riding the trains ... and this is the top guy of the MTA saying this !
62
This anxiety translated into lost revenue , and this startling revelation by the head of the MTA prompted the organization to study how this drop in ridership could be turned around .
Generally speaking though , crime did not improve in 1982 at all .
October 1982 saw the lowest ridership on the New York Subway since 1917 , mostly due to fears about transit crime , poor subway performance and some economic factors .
63 Consider that in 1917 , the IND did n't even exist !
Crime continued to be an issue ; for example , on November 9th , 1982 , a robbery gang robbed , beat and pistol - whipped five people in three subway stations within a half hour .
Fortunately , the suspects were apprehended a short time later .
To counteract a 60 % jump in crime in 1982 , a plan to have uniformed police officers ride the subway between 8 pm and 4 am was instituted .
By 1985 , the epidemic had not subsided at all .
TA shop employees on the late shift were often used to replace broken glass in subway car windows .
Between January 27th and February 2nd , 1985 , 1,129 pieces of glass were replaced on subway cars that used the IRT Broadway Local , the IRT Lexington Avenue Local , and the IND 8th Avenue Local .64
In May of 1984 , even the Nostalgia Train IND cars were hit by vandals .
Meanwhile , enterprising criminals would steal bus transfers from bus drivers , and sell the transfers on the street for 50 cents .
The criminals would concentrate on areas where free bus to subway or subway to bus transfers were available , such as 149th Street and Third Avenue in the Bronx .65
Mayor Koch even proposed to put a subway court in the Times Square subway station to speed up arraignments and reduce time transit police were tied up with a defendant .
In June of 1985 , Operation High Visibility began , where at least one transit policeman rode every train between 8 pm and 6 am .
The program was an attempt to restore public confidence in the transit system .
Overtime costs for this program would run $ 2 million a month .
66
The 1980s made a very indelible impression on potential passengers of the subway : use the subway and you 're guaranteed to be a crime victim .
Perception became the reality ; there are people to this day who still think that the subway is the crime - ridden hellhole it was described as in the 1980s -- and this perception is totally incorrect .
But it lives on .
A Shooting on the Subway
There were many shootings on the subway , though not as many as there were above on the streets of New York City .
But one shooting in particular stood out and struck a responsive chord in many New Yorkers , and this shooting took place on the subway .
On December 22nd , 1984 , Bernhard Goetz , until that point in time just another typical passenger on the subway , boarded a southbound IRT 7th Avenue express at his home station of 14th Street .
He happened to sit near four teenage boys in the car -- Barry Allen , Troy Canty , James Ramseur and Darrell Cabey -- and there were about twenty other passengers in the same subway car .
The boys were generally not behaving well , and two of them approached Goetz , supposedly using screwdrivers as weapons , and asked him for five dollars .
Goetz had been mugged before , and unknown to the four boys , he was carrying a gun .
Interpreting the " request " for five dollars as an attempt to mug him again , Goetz grabbed his gun and shot each of the boys once .
It is not certain if Goetz fired all five shots in rapid succession , or if he paused after shooting Cabey once and said " you seem to be all right ; here 's another " and shot him again .
After this incident , Goetz got off the train and drove to New Hampshire , and as word spread , he became known as the " subway vigilante " , defending himself from crime .
On December 31st , 1984 , Goetz surrendered to police in Concord , New Hampshire and was brought back to New York City .
The coverage of the case by the news media took on the same aura as that of the OJ Simpson case in the 1990s .
The perception that crime was out of control was locked in hard and fast by this case .
The spread of graffiti all over the subways became permanently linked to the poor condition of the equipment , the delayed arrivals , the poor service and all the breakdowns that occurred on the subway on a daily basis .
Between the Goetz case and the uncontrollable graffiti , the subway became a symbol of New York City 's inability to control crime .
Some viewed Goetz as a hero for standing up to his attackers and defending himself in an environment where the police were increasingly viewed as unable to effectively combat crime .
Others viewed Goetz 's action as a violent and criminal over - reaction to the events .
Since Goetz was white and the four youths were black , others focused on the racial aspects of the incident and the public reaction that followed .
During the next year and a half , Goetz faced two grand juries and a criminal trial .
The first grand jury indicted Goetz only for illegal weapons possession , but a second grand jury was called after prosecutors claimed they had new evidence against Goetz .
At this second grand jury , he was indicted on attempted murder charges .
During this time , polls said that three of four people believed that Goetz was defending himself .
Senator Al D'Amato even offered to testify as a character witness for Goetz .
When the criminal trial finally began well over a year after the incident , Goetz was acquitted on the attempted murder charges but found guilty on the gun possession charge , and spent eight months in jail .
Darrell Cabey filed a civil suit against Goetz , which went to trial in 1996 .
The jury found that Goetz had acted recklessly and deliberately inflicted emotional distress on Cabey .
The jury awarded Cabey $ 43 million .
Goetz subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection .
In the civil trial , newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin testified that Cabey had told him about a year after the shooting that he and the other three young men on the train intended to rob Goetz because " he looked like easy bait . "
In fact , all of the youths had committed serious crimes since the original incident , except for Cabey , who remains paralyzed in a wheelchair .
Even though Goetz left New York City after the civil trial , he returned and actually ran for mayor of New York City in 2002 .
Looking Forward
In March of 1980 , the TA began an eight week survey of bus riders to determine ridership patterns ( origin and destination of one 's trip ) , but did not ask riders how long they had to wait for a bus to arrive .
67
This survey followed others that looked at on / off and transfer counts .
The $ 650,000 study funded primarily by the Federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration was completed during the summer of 1980 and it recommended specific bus route changes to better serve Brooklyn riders .
It was hoped the changes would go into effect in 1981 .
Many of the Brooklyn bus routes in effect when the survey was taken were still following routes of former trolley lines that were discontinued in the 1940s and 1950s .
In 1980 , a program to retrofit IRT cars with air conditioning was in full swing .
The TA considered buying 63 - foot subway cars to replace 260 50 - foot IRT cars , even though these longer cars were never tried anywhere on the IRT .
The cars would be purchased using $ 190 million from the Transportation Bond Act voters approved in November 1979 .
Drawbacks identified for these cars included not lining up with the movable platforms at 14th Street , and not fitting tight curves , such as at South Ferry .
Advantages of the car were the same as the R - 44/ R - 46 order -- fewer subway cars of longer length can make up a 510 - foot train , reducing operating and maintenance costs .
Consultant Louis T. Klauder and Associates was hired by the TA at $ 894,312 to evaluate the merits of the 63 - foot car .68
Part of what the consultant would do was determine how many stations might need realignment for the new cars , and if the realignment costs exceeded the cost of the cars , the plans would be dropped .
The plans were indeed dropped .
Even so , the TA fell behind its timetable for the design and purchase of 540 new subway cars that was authorized by the November 1979 bond issue .
69
The first shipment of 260 subway cars was due to be on the IRT by the summer of 1982 , and all shipments were due to be completed by 1983 .
280 IND - BMT cars were due to be reconditioned with new motors , air conditioning and new interiors .
Part of the reconditioning delay was that the TA had not decided whether to subcontract the work out or perform it in - house .
In late 1980 , the IRT Diamond Jubilee special of vintage Lo - V cars returned to the Lexington Avenue local for a week .
Service ran between 59th Street and Brooklyn Bridge , and allowed passengers to remain on the train as it rounded the City Hall Loop .
It made three round trips each day during middays .

In April of 1981 , the TA proposed route changes on some IND - BMT lines in response to a two year federally funded study of ridership patterns .
70
The proposed changes were :
The N and RR lines would swap northern terminals .
A rush hour T train would run from Bay Parkway on the West End Line to the financial district .
Additional service on 6th Avenue .
B trains would run to 168th Street at the expense of AA service .
A K train would run from Canarsie to midtown Manhattan through the Chrystie Street connection .
A proposal for non -stop express service between 59th Street and the World Trade Center was found to be unworkable due to existing lines running at capacity and the inclusion of the JFK express on the 8th Avenue line south of West 4th Street .
In 1981 , the Transit Authority began installing welded rail on some underground portions of the system .
New Subway Cars for New York
By March of 1982 , the MTA was close to a deal to purchase 325 new IRT subway cars from Kawasaki Heavy Industries of Japan .
It would be the first purchase of foreign - made subway cars that ever ran on the New York subway system .
71 Other candidates for this order included Bombardier and the Budd Company .
The federal " buy American " laws in place at the time did not apply to this purchase because no federal funds were being used .
A reason for purchasing the foreign cars was the Reagan Administration 's budget reductions for mass transit aid .
Learning from the R - 46 purchase , the R - 62 contract would contain clauses for strict guarantees .
In addition , the State passed legislation in 1981 allowing the MTA to negotiate contracts with suppliers , instead of just accepting the lowest bid .
The R - 62s , at a cost of $ 844,500 each , proved themselves very reliable immediately upon delivery .
The first R - 62 ( car 1304 ) was delivered on August 18th , 1983 , and a " welcoming " ceremony at Brooklyn 's Red Hook Marine Terminal took place .
The first train of R - 62s went into service on November 29th , 1983 as an IRT Lexington Avenue express out of Woodlawn .
Mayor Ed Koch and Chairman Robert Kiley ( only on the job for a day ) rode the new train to Brooklyn Bridge .

During the 30 - day acceptance test period for the R - 62s , they were run on the Flushing Line .
On March 19th , 1984 , the first R - 62 trainset ran through the Steinway tunnel , and an air line bracket damaged four guard lights .
The track at this location was out of alignment and caused the R - 62 to sway and hit the air bracket .
When the damage was discovered , bags of flour were attached to the exterior of another train that was also sent through the tunnel .
Technicians discovered that the bags were broken and went to inspect the tunnel .
The areas where the bags broke were discovered -- flour residue was found on the tunnel walls .
The tracks in these areas were realigned , the R - 62s were repaired and the acceptance test continued without incident on March 26th.72
The first Capital program allocated funding for the purchase of 1,150 subway cars .
Kawasaki was not interested in building another 825 IRT cars .
The Budd Company was still manufacturing transit vehicles , but the MTA did n't want to negotiate the contract with Budd alone .
St. Louis Car and the American Car and Foundry Company were out of business .
Pullman Standard was itself on the way out due to , in part , the botched R - 46 contract .
Enter Bombardier , a Canadian company best known for the manufacturing of snowmobiles , Francorail , a consortium of six French companies , and Budd , competing for the largest contract for subway cars in the United States until the R - 142 order in 2001 .
Bombardier ended up winning the contract .
Because Bombardier had a conservative approach to their railroad car business -- they would n't manufacture a car that was n't already designed and tested somewhere else - the MTA set a condition for the Kawasaki contract that Bombardier would receive a license to manufacture the Japanese - designed cars themselves .
This became the R - 62A contract , where each individual subway car cost $ 803,000 .
The first R - 62A car , car number 1653 , was delivered to Coney Island Yard on October 10th , 1984 , and the first R - 62A test train ran on December 14th , 1984 .
So why did n't the Budd Company get the R - 62A contract ?
Many people , transit enthusiasts notwithstanding , claim that the Budd - built R - 32s are some the finest subway cars ever built , and they are in better shape that those built for contracts R - 38 through R - 46 .
Budd was considered an American company at the time ( though it really was owned by Thyssen A.G. of Germany ) .
The decision to award Bombardier this contract ended up having national implications during a time when it was legislated to " buy American " , and clearly , awarding the contract to Budd would have been buying American .
MTA Chairman Richard Ravitch testified before the Senate Finance Committee and said that Budd was not willing to extend the same amount of credit to the MTA that the foreign competitors were , that Budd intended to manufacture the cars ' undercarriages in Brazil using an unproven company ( the MTA did n't want to have another R - 46 or Flxible crack ever again ) ; if the design failed , a switch to the American source of the undercarriages would have added thousands of dollars to the cost of each car , and that Bombardier was willing to use the Kawasaki design -- a proven design that was very reliable .
Similarities in design would also allow standardization of parts , which would reduce inventory expenses .
Ravitch also questioned Budd 's reliability , pointing out that the firm was a year behind in deliveries of subway cars to Baltimore and Miami.73
The committee ended up upholding the decision to use Bombardier .
Budd continued fighting the decision for many months afterward , but did n't prevail .
The $ 780 million R - 62A contract with Bombardier did n't start well .
In August of 1985 , all R - 62As were removed from service ( about 40 cars ) because Bombardier failed to remove bracket welds used while shipping the cars to New York .
74
These welds reduced the flexibility of the couplers and could have caused derailments on sharp curves , such as at South Ferry .
The cars were returned to service within a week .
Other problems included lights that would go out for approximately ten seconds , though Bombardier officials said that happened only when crossing long third rail gaps .
Acceptance tests would start and stop because additional defects in the propulsion system were found .
Finally , TA president David Gunn threatened to cancel the contract if electrical defects on these cars were n't fixed in short order .
By September 19th , all the R - 62 As delivered ( 60 by then ) were out of service due to persistent electrical problems .
Bombardier was under contract to deliver the entire 825 - car order by the end of 1987 .

In October of 1982 , a consortium of French engineering companies , called FrancoRail , was selected by the MTA to build 225 subway cars , which eventually became known as the R - 68s .
FrancoRail was chosen over bids from the Budd Company of Troy , Michigan and Sumitomo of Japan .
Half of the work on the subway cars would be done in the US , with assembly taking place in New York State .
The seating scheme would be similar to that of the R - 44 and R - 46 cars .
The cars were delayed when cracks developed in over 40 undercar frames as they were welded .
This problem was corrected by using the same type of steel used on the R - 62 car underframes .
The R - 68 contract was further delayed by the R - 62A problems because the propulsion packages in both sets of cars were similar .
When delivery of the first R - 68 was made on February 4th , 1986 , it failed to negotiate a sharp curve on South Brooklyn Railway trackage on 38th Street in Brooklyn .
The curve had to be rebuilt and the radius eased somewhat ; delivery finally occurred on February 26th , 1986 .
The 30 - day acceptance test for the R - 68s began on the Brighton Line on April 13th , 1986 .
The first regular R - 68 train went into revenue service in Brighton Beach on June 20th , 1986 , after passing a successful 30 - day test .
The option for 200 additional R - 68s was given to Kawasaki and the car class became known at the R - 68A .
The first R - 68A cars were delivered to New York on April 12th , 1988 and transferred to the TA the following day .
The first train of R - 68 As began service on May 18th , 1988 on the IND Concourse Line as part of its 30 - day acceptance test .
The delivery of the R - 62s and R - 68s signaled the end of the line for car classes R - 10 , R - 16 , R - 17 , R - 21 and R - 22 , which were retired and scrapped through the mid to late 1980s .
The R - 16s were removed from service in June of 1987 , and by July , the only R - 17s still running were those that were used on the Times Square -- Grand Central Shuttle .
The last run for the R - 21 and R - 22 car classes was December 30th , 1987 on the IRT Lexington Avenue Express ( # 5 ) during the morning rush hour .
75
The last run for the R - 17s was on February 29th , 1988 , as the last # 5 train departing Flatbush Avenue .76 Car 6609 sits in the New York Transit Museum and car 6688 is now one of the mainstays of the rapid transit fleet at the Shoreline Trolley Museum in Branford , CT .
In 1982 , the Transport Workers Union was given the opportunity to bid on the overhaul of 300 R - 36 subway cars , and in return , they abandoned repair quotas .
The TWU was interested in this contract because it was losing a growing number of repair jobs to outside contractors , and job security was being threatened .
77 The MTA had planned to farm out this work , too .
In 1982 , the first " graffiti control train " of ghostly white IRT cars debuted on the IRT Flushing Line .
The original intent of the white train was to send it out on different routes during the day and determine on which of those routes the subway train was most likely to be " tagged " .
Checks would also be done to see how much damage was done to the train while being stored in a transit yard at night .
The train did n't succeed in its original mission .
The train was very lightly tagged by vandals , if it was at all .
The extensive security system implemented at Corona Yard ( dual fences about 10 feet apart topped with razor wire and dogs patrolling this 10 - foot space ) appeared to keep graffiti " artists " at bay .
The white paint scheme was expanded on the Flushing Line to become known as " graffiti resistant white " and the security system implemented at Corona Yard was applied to the other transit storage facilities as well .
78 By January of 1983 , the entire Flushing Line fleet was painted white , with black anti-climbers , pantograph gates and body sills .
While the car sides remained graffiti free , the car ends usually got tagged .
Nevertheless encouraged by the results , the fleet that made up the Lexington Avenue local was also painted with this same paint scheme .
Some R- 17s , R - 26s , R - 28s , R-29s and R - 33s were painted , but did n't fare as well , because Westchester Yard could not store all these trains when they were n't needed for service ; taggers had a field day when these cars were stored on the middle track of the Pelham Line .
The next set of cars to be painted in the white scheme were those that served the # 4 Lexington Avenue Express .
79
By April of 1984 , the TA decided it had enough of the white paint scheme and decided to repaint them red with silver roofs , and the body sills , anti-climbers , safety gates and marker light areas were painted black .
The dawn of the Redbird era was established , and the first train to run in this scheme debuted on May 7th , 1984 .
By August of 1985 , the entire Flushing Line fleet was painted in the Redbird paint scheme .
By the end of 1985 , the first R - 29s were being painted as Redbirds .
The " graffiti control " all - white paint scheme .
The white paint was not as graffiti resistant as the MTA had hoped .

In September of 1982 , a 4 car train of restored R - 1/9s took center stage during the 50th anniversary celebration of the IND , which took place at 57th St / 6th Avenue .
The train made a round trip between 57th St / 6th Avenue and Second Avenue , but not completely under its own power .
Battery problems during the return trip at 34th St / 6th Avenue required that the train be pushed to 57th
St by a D train consisting of R - 40s and R - 42s .
One car of the trip served as a " concert car " , equipped with a piano !
The following day , the special train ran on the 8th Avenue local between Chambers Street and Columbus Circle.80
On July 10th , 1983 , the 2,3,4 and 5 lines swapped southern terminals in Brooklyn .
The 2 train , which used to terminate at New Lots Avenue , would terminate at Flatbush Avenue .
The 3 train , which used to terminate at Flatbush Avenue , would terminate at New Lots Avenue .
The 4 and 5 trains made a similar swap .
The purpose was to assign the same type of subway cars from these lines to a specific repair / maintenance facility and improve reliability .
Throughout 1983 , the West End El was rehabilitated .
Deteriorated girders supporting mezzanines were replaced .
This rehabilitation job was repeated on the Culver Line starting in October of 1987 .
On December 10th , 1984 , the last cars of the R - 14 and R - 15 car class were retired .
These cars were known to old - time IRT employees as the " Queens Cars " because they debuted in Queens on the Flushing Line .
In an effort to raise additional money for the subways and buses , the MTA sold the East Side Airlines Terminal in February of 1984 , and the New York Coliseum in 1986 .
The buyer of the Coliseum would agree to rebuild the Columbus Circle subway complex .
To prepare the BMT Jamaica Elevated for its connection to the Archer Avenue subway , service on the elevated was cut back from the Queens Blvd station to 121st Street on April 13th , 1985 .
The connection would be made at 129th Street and the elevated structure east of that point would be demolished .
The resulting " terminal " at 121st Street was inefficient because trains had to run single tracked for nearly ½ mile before entering the station .
In November of 1987 , a new double crossover north of the station was placed in service allowing J trains to relay north of the station .
This also allowed both sides of the station to be used , the Archer Avenue - bound side for exiting passengers and the Manhattan - bound side for entering passengers .

The Subway is Coming Back .
This Time , It 's For Real !
On Monday , May 13th , 1985 , Flushing Line riders " were going to be mad as hell " .
A 4½ - year long project to overhaul the IRT Flushing Line was begun , and it meant single tracking much of the line on weekends , and the complete elimination of express service for the duration of the project .
The TA advertised this change by putting leaflets in the New York Times , the Staten Island Advance , the Daily News and Newsday .
The project would lay new track , replace or repair concrete and steel structures , replace wooden station canopies with aluminum ones , improve lighting , improve signage , and install new ventilation and pumping equipment .
Expanded service would be provided when the Mets played home games or when there were sporting events in Flushing Meadow Park .
Flushing locals had better on - time performance during the construction than before it started !
The $ 60 million rehabilitation project on the IRT Flushing Line 's Queens Blvd viaduct ended on August 21st , 1989 .
When Flushing express service was restored , trains would no longer stop at 61st Street / Woodside .
Hundreds of Woodside residents signed petitions and staged rallies at the 61st Street station , hoping to get express trains to stop there again .
The TA discontinued them because people changing from the local to the express would cause excessive dwell times , which caused delays on the line when locals and expresses would merge after 33rd ( Rawson ) Street .
The change was supposed to enable local trains to stop at 61st Street every 4 minutes during rush hours , but commuters stated that the trains arrived every 8 -- 10 minutes .
The community opposition led to service changes , and expresses began stopping at Woodside a few months later .
Flushing Line riders were n't the only ones who would be " mad as hell " .
In August of 1985 , major repairs began on the north side of the Manhattan Bridge .
On August 10th , a ten - week project to improve signaling and install new track would begin , followed by additional diversions due to state Department of Transportation repairs .
The " split B/D " services began -- B and D trains from Coney Island would run up Broadway and terminate at 57th St / 7th Avenue ( like today 's Q train ) , and B and D trains from the Bronx would run only to West 4th Street .
A shuttle train would run between Grand St and Broadway / Lafayette , and the F train would be the only through - train to run on 6th Avenue .
Brighton Line riders had their share of headaches due to a long repair project on the Brighton Line that started in April of 1986 .
Stations were rehabilitated and welded rail was laid on the Brighton Line 's express tracks .
A new signal tower was built over the south end of the Kings Highway station and new wayside signaling was also installed .
To compensate for the loss of express service during this project , Brighton Line trains ( D and Q ) would run skip - stop between Brighton Beach and Prospect Park on weekdays .
Subways and buses were free on New Years Eve 1985 and 1986 to discourage drunken revelers from driving .
On March 1st , 1986 , the Astor Place IRT station received reproductions of the IRT subway kiosk .
It was trucked to the station from Alabama and reassembled in three sections on site .
Uptown Lexington Avenue locals skipped Astor Place during the construction weekend .
This kiosk was part of the Astor Place station restoration project .
Kiosks were widespread at one time , but as automobile traffic increased , they were blamed for accidents ( cutting off visibility ) .
Most were removed in the 1920s , but some lasted until the 1960s , and the last one was removed from the 145th St -- Lenox Avenue station sometime in 1968.81
On Sunday March 25th , 1986 , the Regional Plan Association ( RPA ) sponsored a conference on " The Future of Public Transit " .
The purpose of the conference was to identify problems plaguing mass transportation in the New York metropolitan area and propose solutions to those problems .
In 1986 , there were huge money shortfalls compounded by a mass - exodus from public transit to the automobile .
The conference would examine how to get people out of their automobiles and back into mass transit .
The primary reason for this exodus was the decline in the reliability and availability of mass transit : both the MDBF and the number of trains per hour on the Manhattan trunk lines had been declining since 1965.
82
Some of the items noted :
The TA hoped to get the subways and buses back to 1960 - era efficiency , but the RPA thought that goal was shortsighted .
It would take more than just a restoration of service to get people out of their automobiles ; comfort was a prime reason people cited in leaving mass transit .
If people wanted these additional services , how much would they pay for them ?
Subway service was not balanced .
Some lines were underutilized ; others were overcrowded .
There was legislation regulating the " comfort level " of transporting cattle , but crowding on some New York subway lines exceeded those tolerances , and then some !
The MTA was looking for additional funding for capital improvement programs at a time that the Reagan administration was looking to cut funding .
Some ideas floated were :
Expanding the subway fleet to reduce crowding ,
Allow city residents to ride LIRR or Metro - North trains to midtown at reduced fares ,
More premium services for which higher fees could be charged , like the JFK express .
Another suggestion was an express bus from the George Washington Bridge bus terminal to midtown Manhattan ,
One person train operation during off - peak hours
The RPA recommended the following prioritized expenditures looking forward to the year 2000:83
Extend the 63rd Street " tunnel to nowhere " to Southeast Queens via the LIRR Montauk line and Archer Avenue at a cost of $ 310 million ,
Build the Second Avenue Subway from Chatham Square , Manhattan to East 180th Street in the Bronx at a cost of $ 3.1 billion ,
Reactivate the LIRR Rockaway Beach branch to serve JFK airport at a cost of $ 160 million ,
Build a spur of the IND Queens Blvd Line along Jewel Avenue to serve northeast Queens at a cost of $ 420 million ,
Extend the IRT Flushing Line into New Jersey via a new cross-Hudson tunnel at a cost of $ 1.2 billion ,
Provide the LIRR east side access to Grand Central Terminal via the lower level of the 63rd Street tunnel at a cost of $ 1.4 billion ,
Purchase 500 new subway cars at a cost of $ 500 million .
The RPA also recommended closing some underutilized stations to speed up running times .
It should be noted that some of the new service proposals suggested by the RPA were voted down by the MTA in December of 1984 due to funding issues .
Only the 63rd Street tunnel extension to the IND Queens Blvd line was approved , contingent on federal funds becoming available .
In addition , the RPA may have been right about spending the money on new equipment to lure back passengers .
Turnstile counts at stations serviced by the new R - 62s on the Lexington Avenue lines showed a 10 % increase between 1984 and 1985.84
On Thursday December 12th , 1985 , Transit Authority officials honored the 100th anniversary of the BMT Jamaica Avenue line by rolling out the first eight of 162 R - 30 cars that went through a general overhaul .
The eight - car train cost $ 2 million to overhaul , compared to the cost of a new individual subway car of $ 1 million .
The R -30s were rebuilt at Coney Island Shop by subway employees .
The R - 30 overhaul program would produce two overhauled cars a week and the cars would be placed in the " Clean Car Program " to keep graffiti off them .85

In February 1986 , riders of the D train ( Brighton -- 6th Avenue -- Concourse Express ) were convinced that the TA had something against them .
While service on the E and F lines was stable and relatively dependable ( in 1986 terms ) , equipment on the D train , the R - 30s and R - 10s , provided very poor service .
In the summer of 1986 , though , the newest cars in the fleet , the R - 68s , would begin to replace the worn out equipment that had n't seen any maintenance in 10 years .
In May of 1986 , trains identified with double letters lost their identity .
Originally , the double letter represented IND nomenclature for local service ; for example , the C was the Concourse Express ; the CC represented the local .
In 1968 when the Chrystie Street connection combined BMT and IND services , the definition between local double letters and express single letters became muddied .
The D train ran express in Manhattan but local in Brooklyn .
The F train ran express in Queens but local in Manhattan and Brooklyn .
The Q train received variants of double letters -- QT meant via tunnel , QB meant via bridge , QJ meant -- what ?
Queens / Jamaica ?
MJ -- Myrtle / Jamaica ?
RJ -- Astoria / Jamaica ?
Double letters were dropped and every line would be known by a single letter .
An old letter was reintroduced -- the K train which until 1976 ran from Canarsie to 57th St / 6th Avenue would come back as the 8th Avenue local .
Three trains on defunct routings .

In the period 1983 through 1985 , 110 incidents of subway doors opening while trains were moving were recorded by the TA , and fifteen additional incidents occurred in the first three months of 1986 .
There were various incidents of subway doors mysteriously sliding open while trains were moving .
In March of 1986 , a $ 40 million program to stop these incidents from occurring was presented to TA board members .
The program would focus on control panel replacement , replacement of " open " relays with sealed relays , and modifying subway car circuitry where two malfunctions would need to occur before a door would fail .
86
Trends of poor maintenance began to reverse themselves by 1986 .
There were three in - service derailments in 1985 , compared to 15 in 1984 and 21 in 1983 .
The number of " red tag " areas dropped from over 500 to two in 1986.87 ( A " red tag " area was an area of track that needed immediate repairs , and trains would have to slow to 10 mph while running over these areas .
This caused frequent delays . )
As an example , the Brighton Line 's tracks between Sheepshead Bay and Prospect Park were replaced in 1986 -- the first time this was done in 20 years .
However , when the project was completed , trains were either too high or too far away from many of the platforms , and in some areas , the track needed to be pulled out , some of the ballast dug out and then the track replaced !
88 The 325 R - 62 cars , in service for a year on the IRT # 4 Lexington Avenue Express were proving themselves reliable , at an average of 50,000 miles between failures ( compared to 9,000 for the other subway car models ) .
The MDBF was improving ; it had been as low as 6,000 miles in 1980 , and was 10,000 miles by September of 1986 .
At that time , 670 new cars were accepted , 850 overhauled cars were in service and 3,000 cars were graffiti-free.89
The Subway .
We 're Coming Back , So You Come Back !
By 1988 , the change on the subways was very noticeable , despite the perceptions from people out of town that the subway was still very unsafe and full of graffiti .
Reliability had improved fivefold over 1983 levels .
94 % of the trains were graffiti free .
The American Public Transit Association gave David Gunn the 1988 " Manager of the Year " award and recognized the New York City Subway as the most improved system in North America.90
Yet movies and television continued to portray the subway in a negative light , and nearly 1 out of 4 Americans surveyed felt the subway was still unsafe .
The perception was still the reality .
In an effort to counterattack the " bad press " , the TA stopped issuing movie permits to producers that showed the subway " negatively " ; in one such incident , a group of producers who wanted to deface subway cars for filming purposes were turned down while members of the Department of Car Equipment cheered .
Yet there were still critics who felt that the TA 's focus was too much on aesthetics while maintenance was still suffering .
The reality was that on May 12th , 1989 , the war on graffiti was over .
The TA had won .
The international symbol of decay and crime was completely eradicated from the system , but not the perception of it .
That would take longer to overcome .
So in August of 1989 , the MTA was ready to put its money to its improvement claims .
On August 16th , 1989 , the most expensive subway ad campaign in New York City history ( $ 2 million ) was launched to convince people that the subway was no longer the grimy , sleazy , filthy , graffiti - marred system that it once was .91
The print portion of the campaign split the page into half -- the left half described the system in the 1970s or early 1980s , and the right half would describe the subway in 1989 , identifying some statistic where marked improvement was shown .
One ad cited that 86 % of all subway cars were air - conditioned .
Another cited that 4,288 subway cars were either new or completely overhauled .
The R - 46 subway cars would begin their general overhaul in late 1989 , two years earlier than expected , because of a favorable bid submitted by Morrison - Knudson to perform the rehabilitation work .
A third touted the elimination of graffiti -- considered an impossibility .
The by - line was " The Subway .
We 're coming back , so you come back " .
The ads would highlight improvements made under the capital plan program .
Critics argued that they were n't telling the whole story -- crime was on the way up in 1989 , and a fare increase was looming right around the corner .
Other critics argued that the money spent on the campaign would be better spent on other infrastructure needs .
The ad campaign was designed at changing the mindset about the subway -- newcomers to New York City consistently rated the subway better than residents .
In December of 1989 , funds earmarked for the rehabilitation of the Atlantic Avenue IRT - BMT complex , Borough Hall , and Flatbush Avenue stations of the IRT , and Court Street on the BMT , were diverted to other projects , including a $ 162 million fare control modernization program .
Brooklyn political leaders fought the change , but eventually lost .
At the time of this writing , the Atlantic Avenue complex is currently undergoing the renovations originally planned for in the 1987 capital program .
As the end of the 1980s approached , the TA had turned around their image .
Graffiti was off the trains .
Mismanagement occurred far less frequently .
Subway cars were receiving overhauls halfway into their useful lives instead of running them into the ground and buying new cars .
This overhaul program ( GOH ) saved the TA millions of dollars , and lessons learned from this program went into the creation of a Scheduled Maintenance System ( SMS ) where components are replaced when they are expected to fail , not after they have failed .
Tracks were being put back into a state of good repair .
The future was on the horizon , too .
Bids for the " New Technology Trains " , the R - 110A / B subway cars , were being accepted by the Transit Authority in April 1989 .
The purpose of these trains was to test out new subway car technology , and prove that this technology would stand up to heavy use , before submitting a large subway car order with it .
Amongst all the new equipment on these trains , station announcements would be automated , passenger communication systems would enable communication with the crew , the cars would have electronic signs and the entry / exit doors would be staggered , returning to the practice last seen with the R - 42 subway cars .
It would seem that the lessons learned from the R - 44 and R - 46 car purchases were lasting ones , experiences that did not want to be repeated .

On March 3rd , 1988 , a prototype automatic fare collection system was put into very limited service as an employee program .
The fare card would be swiped through a reader at the top of the turnstile and a beep would be heard indicating that the person may pass through .
If the card did n't work , the employee would seek assistance from the token clerk at the station , who would also have a pass reader .
This system was the precursor for today 's MetroCard program , w

The quiz is a small contribution to the efforts by all of us in the nano - community to spark interest in nanosciences and nanotechnology and get people involved in the things that will shape our future for better or worse .
Today ’s UnPresidented podcast is all about polls .
Can we trust them , should we trust them , what actually happened in 2016 , what do the polls tell us about the upcoming November ...
Are you surrounded by negative people , people who , no matter what the situation , can always find something wrong ?
Or people who always have so much drama in their lives , drama that is , of course , always caused by someone else ?
Being around people who constantly have drama and negativity in their lives can drain your energy , especially if you feel like they are people that you HAVE to deal with , like family members .
If you spend enough time with them , it can completely exhaust you .
This draining of energy can take away from other areas of your life , areas that you may ( or may not ) deem more important … work , relationships , and pretty much everything else .
Watching other things go down the tube ( and sometimes not even realizing that it has anything to do with the energy drain from the negative people in your life ) can suck down even more of your energy , eventually getting you to the point where you start feeling overwhelmed to the point of collapse .
So enough prelude , on to how to deal with negative people :
Step One : Pay Attention To Them ( but not their negativity ) A lot of people who are negative , and / or seem to need drama in their lives , are that way because they are insecure … they are not certain of their own worth .
One of the best ways to show someone their worth is to give them your attention … the more attention you give them , the more you are telling them they are worth .
This is complemented by showing interest in them beyond the attention you pay , as well … asking about things you know they were going to do , or things you know they are interested in .
The important thing here is to remember that you are paying attention to THEM , not their negativity .
Ignore the negativity … when they say something negative , just brush it off .
Make it really obvious that the whole being negative thing is n’t working on you , and concentrate on them .
Please do NOT do this if you do n’t sincerely care about the person , as they may be desperate to believe , and not see it as artificial … and then be devastated when they find out it was fake all along .
Step Two : Suggest Ways To Improve ( or point them here )
If the first step does n’t work after you ’ve given it time , or the person is not important enough to you to expend the substantial effort required by step one , then you can move on to giving them advice on how to solve whatever particular negative thing they are going through .
This can have one of two results , either of which will result in less negativity in your life :
They can act on the advice , and improve their life , or they ’ll stop being around you ( or talking to you ) as much , because they do n’t want someone to actually help them , they just want attention , and they think being negative is the best ( or only ) way they can get it .
Step Three : Reduce The Time You Spend With Them
This is the third , and final , step .
And it may be taken care of for you if you attempt step two first … the person may choose to spend less time around you .
If not , eventually you have to reduce the time you spend around them to reduce the drain on your own energy from their negativity and drama .
It might be hard … it might be very hard , depending on who they are to you .
Reducing the time you spend with family , for instance , is very difficult for some people , or your best friend who was n’t that way before , but at some point , when you ’ve tried the first two steps for as long as you can take for that person , the only thing left is to stop letting that person in your life so much .
Which step you start at depends on how important the person is to you … the less important they are , the higher the step you start on with them ..
How much time you spend on each one should also be determined by how important they are to you … some people are worth years of effort , others only weeks or days .
If they ’re not worth days of effort , they ’re probably not worth the first two steps … you might as well move right to reducing ( or eliminating ) your time with them .
Only you can determine how much of your effort it ’s worth to put into helping a given person get out of their negative focus .
Anyone can climb out of negativity eventually , but some cling to it hard enough that you ’re talking about a lifetime .
The more effort you put in , though , the more you are helping that person , and the more they will return the energy you invest in them when they do get past all the negatives .

Twelve Steps for Congress toward Impeachment
from Patriots Anonymous
1 . We admitted we were powerless over George W. Bush and Richard B. Cheney –that our government had become unmanageable .
2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore our nation to sanity .
3 . Made a decision to turn our will and our actions over to the care of The American People as we understood them .
4 . Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves .
5. Admitted to The American People , to ourselves , and to another member of Congress the exact nature of our wrongs in enabling this crisis .
6 . Were entirely ready to remove all members of defective character in the Executive Branch according to the will of The American People .
7. Humbly asked The American People for their support in removing the offenders from office .
8 . Made a list of all persons that had been harmed , and became willing to make amends to them all .
9 . Made direct amends to such people wherever possible , except when to do so would injure them or others .
10 . Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it .
11 . Sought to improve our conscious contact with The American People as we understood Them , praying only for knowledge of Their will for us and the power to carry that out .
12 . Having had a political awakening as the result of these steps , we tried to carry this message to others , and to practice these principles in all our affairs .
From the Big Book of P.A. , while introducing the 12 Steps in Chapter 5 : How It Works :
Remember that we deal with Cheney , Rove and their ilk — cunning , baffling , powerful .
Without impeachment they are too much for us .
Half measures such as censures , threats of ‘ sleep - overs ” and other rebukes availed us nothing .
We stood at the turning point .
We asked for the people ’s support …
Sri Lanka 's Horton Plains slender loris has been seen just four times since 1937 .
Miss Waldron 's red colobus monkey was not found in an exhaustive six - year study ending in 1999 and there have been no definite sightings since .
Vietnam 's golden - headed langur and the Hainan gibbon in China both number in the dozens .
These are the primate species on the edge of oblivion and , according to a report commissioned by three leading conservation charities , scores of others of our closest relatives are poised to suffer the same fate .
It names the top 25 species most in need of help but concludes that 114 primate species are also close to extinction .
The 25 species most at risk include two of our closest great ape cousins , the Cross River gorilla of Cameroon and Nigeria and the orang - utan from Sumatra .
Miss Waldron 's colobus also makes it on to the list , although more by hope than expectation .
Conservationists declared it officially extinct in 2000 , but a photograph taken since then of a similar - looking creature has been tentatively identified by scientists .
The document was compiled by 60 leading primatologists from the world conservation union , the International Primatological Society and Conservation International .
The list includes 11 species from Asia , seven from Africa , four from Madagascar and three from South America .
" You could fit all the surviving members of these 25 species in a single football stadium ; that 's how few of them remain on Earth today , " said Russell Mittermeier , the president of Conservation International .
" The situation is worst in Asia , where tropical forest destruction and the hunting and trading of monkeys puts many species at terrible risk .
Even newly discovered species are severely threatened from loss of habitat and could soon disappear . "
The report follows assessments in 2000 , 2002 and 2004 .
" Overall the problems are increasing , " said Eckhard Heymann at the German Primate Centre in Goettingen , one of the report 's authors .
Common problems are habitat loss due to logging for timber or oil and mineral extraction , plus bushmeat hunting .
The two issues are related because roads cut through tropical forests for logging trucks help give hunters easier routes to wildlife .
" Every additional access to remove areas increases the access to hunters , " Dr Heymann added .
Another problem is habitat destruction to make space for biofuel plantations such as oil palm .
Developed economies such as the US and Europe are pledging to use more sustainable energy sources to combat climate change , but this is having a knock - on effect on tropical wildlife .
" It is creating a huge market and now in several countries politicians are thinking of converting tropical forest areas to palm plantations , " he said .
This particularly affects orang - utan populations .
Although they still number in the low thousands , they are disappearing as a faster rate than any other primate species .
Dr Heymann said there had been some successes since the previous report .
The golden lion tamarin from eastern Brazil , for example , had benefited from a concerted conservation campaign which involved protecting fragments of forest where it lives and breeding it in captivity .
" There are still not much more than 1,000 but they are stable and no longer declining , " said Dr Heymann .
" The species is not yet safe but still it 's a success story . "

IT LOOKS as if music legend Lionel Richie 's daughter Nicole is finally going to make it down the aisle .
He was happy to break the news to 3am on a stellar night at the Prince 's Trust 's 30th anniversary concert at Tower Hill in London on Saturday .
Chatting backstage to Kiki , he confirmed that wafer - thin Nicole is to tie the knot with Adam Goldstein , alias DJ AM .
" I told her : ' Honey , you do what you want and just send me the bill , ' " the 56 - year - old former Commodores star revealed before he went on stage for the show 's finale .
" Of course I 'm going to be there for her , and I 'll be singing - there 's no way I could n't .
I 'm really happy that it 's working out for her . "
Nicole and Adam had been going out since 2003 .
She ended it in December , but three months later they were back together .
Now the wedding is on - but Lionel also hinted that he still worries about his adopted daughter .
" I really wanted to bring her with me for tonight 's gig because it 's such a special night , but she could n't get away , " he said .
" She 's in LA at the moment , but she really needs a vacation .
She 's a great girl and she 's really been through a lot . "
Simple Life star Nicole recently told Vanity Fair : " I know that I 'm too thin .
I have a problem and I want to fix it . "
A few weeks later Lionel , too , broke his silence on her ultra-skinny look .
" When I saw how thin she was , I was concerned and worried , " he said .
" I would love to see her with more meat on her . "
Before singing a string of his hits on Saturday , he said of Princes William and Harry : " They 're great boys .
You can really see that .
I do hope they get to misbehave sometimes - but they have good hearts . "
We 're sure they were Dancing on the Ceiling .

A giant robotic hand holds up the remains of a vehicle crushed by a lucky member of the Robodock 2007 audience .
View Slideshow AMSTERDAM
– A giant mechanical hand sits amid a litter of destroyed automobiles in an abandoned shipyard here .
At last month 's Robodock festival , untrained volunteers used the complex technological work of art to pick up and crush shopping carts , cars and even a small van .
Soon , the huge robotic hand might be sold for scrap metal , a perfectly normal death for a piece brought to life at the annual Amsterdam art fest .
The hand in question is 25 feet long , weighs 5,000 pounds and was built in just 12 days entirely out of scrap and recycled parts by the international team of Doyle Shuge , Justin Gray , Conrad Karlson and Jens Schendel , under the direction of veteran " machine performance " artist Christian Ristow of Robochrist Industries .
The fingers are segments of old I beams , the forearm is the modified truss of an ancient digging machine , and the entire hydraulic system was assembled from junkyard salvage .
Plumbing and cables were ripped from the walls of the old shipbuilding warehouse where the hand was constructed .
( Disclosure : I helped with some of the wiring on the project for an afternoon . )
Anybody can crush big things with the giant hand .
" When I first came to Robodock last year , " says Ristow , " I decided that what was missing was audience interactivity , and violence . "
During Robodock , Ristow waves to a young man standing in line .
The lucky festivalgoer climbs the chain ladder to the operator 's tower , inserts his hand into a custom control armature , and proceeds to pick up and crush an old Renault van .
The hand moves slowly , grindingly , making ominous groaning noises and dripping hydraulic fluid as its closing fist mangles the vehicle .
The operator lifts the remains of the van 20 feet off the ground , gives it a final crunching squeeze as huge , rusty fingernails shatter the windshield , then drops it to the concrete .
The crowd cheers wildly .
" That was awesome , " says the man as he walks away from the robot and the carcass of the van .
" Such a feeling of power ! "
He 's got a weird grin on his face , but then it 's not every day you can crush a car with your hand .
Meanwhile , Gray selects the next operator .
" OK , kids only tonight , " he announces , and a great shout of glee goes up from the under - 12 set .
See the giant hand in action about 30 seconds into this video clip from Robodock 2007 .
The scene is pure Robodock .
A group of squatters living at the abandoned ADeM docks in northern Amsterdam started the festival in 1998 .
Since then it has evolved into one of the premiere international exhibitions of underground machine , tech and performance art .
For its 10th anniversary this year , the festival featured everything from giant metal fire sculpture by the San Francisco - based Flaming Lotus Girls to Ben Blakebrough 's homemade Hiller flying machine to the collaborative human - robotic symphony of France 's La Machine .
The festival 's squatter roots favor a scrap-metal aesthetic and the use of recycled , salvaged or otherwise " found " materials .
" This is low - tech art produced by high - tech minds , " says Ristow .
Now that the festival is over , Ristow would prefer to take his robotic hand back to the United States for further shows , but it 's expensive to move and store such a large and heavy object .
Instead , if no buyer is found , the piece will be scrapped , cut apart and sold back to the junkyard .
It would be a sad fate , but Ristow says he would feel fine about it .
After all , that would be in keeping with the Robodock tradition .

A Fiery Q&A With the Prankster Accused of Burning the Man
Paradise Lost , Found Again at Laughing Squid Benefit
ALEXANDRIA , Louisiana ( CNN ) -- A Louisiana city that hosted many of the " Jena 6 " protesters Thursday became the site of a racially charged incident of its own .
A photo taken by I - Reporter Casanova Love shows a noose hanging from a pickup in Alexandria , Louisiana .

Authorities in Alexandria , less than 40 miles southwest of Jena , arrested two people who were driving a red pickup Thursday night with two nooses hanging off the back , repeatedly passing groups of demonstrators who were waiting for buses back to their home states .
The marchers had taken part in the huge protests in Jena that accused authorities there of injustice in the handling of racially charged cases -- including the hanging of nooses in a tree after a group of black students sat in an area where traditionally only white students sat .
The driver of the red truck , whom Alexandria police identified as Jeremiah Munsen , 18 , was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor -- a reference to the 16 - year - old passenger .
Munsen also was charged with driving while intoxicated and inciting to riot , according to the police report .
As officials were questioning the driver , he said he had an unloaded rifle in the back of the truck , which police found .
They also found a set of brass knuckles in a cup holder on the dashboard , the police report said .
Watch cops respond to the dangling nooses »
The passenger told police he and his family are in the Ku Klux Klan and that he had KKK tattooed on his chest , the police report said .
He also said that he tied the nooses and that the brass knuckles belonged to him , the report said .
The report , filed by Officer F.R. Drewett , said he and another officer were standing with protesters awaiting their bus back to Nashville , Tennessee , when one of the group told him about a truck driving with nooses hanging off the back .
The truck was circling around town , repeatedly driving past groups of demonstrators , the report said .
The officers pulled the pickup over and arrested two after searching the vehicle .
At least one of the nooses was made out of an extension cord , according to the police report .
The driver and passenger are white , according to the police report .
An entry in the report lists " Bias Motive : Racial Anti-Black . "
Alexandria Mayor Jacques
Roy said those involved were " from around Jena " and not from the same parish as his city .
See where the incident occurred »
Roy said he is looking into whether the incident was a hate crime .
A photograph of the truck was sent to CNN by I - Reporter Casanova Love , 26 , who said he is in the U.S. military .
He 's visiting his family in Louisiana and said he witnessed the event .
After the arrests , Roy came out to address the crowd and apologized , saying he does not condone racism , Love said .
Love added , " If the police had not stepped in , I fear what might have happened . "
Love explained why he sent the photo to CNN : " People need to see this .
It 's 2007 , and we still have fools acting like it 's 1960 . "
Roy said the matter is " not indicative " of Alexandria and that local authorities will look into it " completely , thoroughly and transparently . "
Some protesters saw another truck with a noose hanging off it , but authorities did not find the vehicle , according to the police report .

An Iranian top official warned the United States on Tuesday to beware of the possible results if it launch a military action against the Islamic Republic , the semi- official ISNA news agency reported .
If the United States attacks Iran , they may face three problems : they can not predict " the volume of our response " ; they do n't know what would happen to Israel and Washington will not know what will the oil flow look like at that time , General Rahim Yahya Safavi was quoted as saying .
Safavi stepped down last week as chief of the elite Revolutionary Guards and now serves as senior military advisor to Iran 's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei .
He made the remarks just days after the U.S. President George W. Bush said Iran 's continued nuclear program may lead to a " nuclear holocaust " in the Middle East .
The United States has never ruled out the possibility to launch a military attack against Tehran 's nuclear facilities .
A Western media recently reported the United States had made a plan to destroy Iran 's military capability in three days if Tehran does n't comply , drawing great attentions from the international community .
Iran has repeatedly vowed to fight back any outside aggression .
After years of development , Iranian forces now has the Shahab - 3 missile which could cover Israel and U.S. bases on the Arabian Peninsula with a range of 2,000 km .
Tehran also has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz , a vital channel for the transport of the region 's oil to the world .

A Florida lawyer convinced a judge yesterday to quash several RIAA subpoenas directed against anonymous University of South Florida students .
The subpoenas , which use the secretive ex parte discovery process , were shot down by the judge on narrow technical grounds that seem limited to this particular case .
Still , attorney Michael Wasylik tells
Ars that his victory still matters because it shows that RIAA attorneys " have to obey the rules " when they use the court system .
Until this point , Interscope v. Does 1 - 40 has proceeded much like other cases against college students across the country .
RIAA lawyers move on an aggressive schedule in such cases ; this case was filed in June , subpoenas were authorized in July , were sent out immediately , and were due back by mid-August .
Under ex parte discovery rules , the students are n't notified until after a subpoena has already been granted , giving them little time to contest the process .
Unless they act quickly , the RIAA gets the identifying information it needs from the university in question , then usually dismisses the case and files individual suits against the students ( whose identities it now knows ) .
It 's an aggressive strategy , and as Wasylik points out , is one built on speed and stealth .
In this case , the suit was filed after school had ended for the summer , and the subpoena information was requested before students returned .
Once the university received the subpoenas in July , it did attempt to forward them to the students ' summer addresses .
Not all addresses were correct or up to date , though , and at least one student was traveling in Europe and could not be reached by his agitated parents , who received the letter .
The upshot : Wasylik represented only two of the 40 students in court , and the judge 's decision to quash the subpoenas applies only to them .
The other 38 defendants have already had their information released .
These defendants might not even have known about the case until they arrived back at school to a nasty surprise .
Several similar motions to quash this form of subpoena have been filed in cases across the country , but this is the first to be decided .
It 's a " crack in the dam , a flaw in the armor , " Wasylik tells Ars , but he fully expects the RIAA to fix the technical service errors and try again ( the judge did not quash the subpoenas on material grounds , even though Wasylik made several such arguments ) .
To him , though , it 's encouraging to see that the RIAA can be beaten , that it does make mistakes .
It also provides a roadmap for attorneys in similar cases to follow .
The RIAA wins default judgments in most of its cases after defendants never show up ; many other defendants also settle rather than face court .
Opposing them at key points in litigation , though , can be effective , in Wasylik 's view .
Not even the RIAA can afford to fully litigate the more than 20,000 suits it has filed to date .
If enough defendants fight back , the group might need to change tactics , especially if it has to keep paying attorneys ' fees .
When you combine a goat with an electric fence you get the solution … to illegal immigration ?
That ’s Sen .
Trent Lott ’s answer to the immigration question .
When discussing the immigration bill with reporters Wednesday , Senate Minority Whip Trent Lott , R - Miss. , offered the astute analogy of building an electric fence for goats to keeping out illegal immigrants .
Though he was quick to say that he was not in fact proposing an electric goat fence , Lott voiced support for a fence that would be supported by technology such as radar and aerial surveillance .
According to South Mississippi’s Sun Herald , Lott welcomed the controversy that would inevitably ensue , arguing that he has already offended everybody : “ I ’m doing great , are n’t I ?
But it gives you a level of utopia that is just so blissful . ”
Glad that the Senate ’s Minority Whip has enviably reached utopia .
If only we could all be so lucky .

Former Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld says in the current edition of GQ magazine that the war in Afghanistan has been “ a big success , ” with people living in freedom and life “ improved on the streets . ”
To anyone working in the country , there is only one possible , informed response : What Afghanistan is the man talking about ?
In reality , Afghanistan -- former Taliban stronghold , Al Qaeda haven and warlord - cum - heroin - smuggler finishing school -- feels more and more like Sept. 10 , 2001 , than a victory in the U.S. war on terrorism .
The country is , plain and simple , a mess .
Al Qaeda and its Taliban allies have quietly regained territory , rendering wide swaths of the country off - limits to U.S. and Afghan forces , international aid workers and even journalists .
Violent attacks against Western interests are routine .
Even Kabul , which the White House has held up as a postcard for what is possible in Afghanistan , has become so dangerous that foreign embassies are in states of lockdown , diplomats do not leave their offices , and venturing beyond security perimeters requires daylight - only travel , armored vehicles , Kevlar and armed escorts .
Fear reigns among average Afghans in Kabul .
Street crime , virtually unheard of in Afghan culture , has increased dramatically over the last three years as angry , unemployed and often radicalized young men settle scores with members of other tribes and clans , steal and rob to feed their families and vent their frustration with a government that appears powerless to help them .
Taking a chance by eating in one of Kabul ’s handful of restaurants or going shopping in one of the few markets left is a new version of Russian roulette .
For U.S. officials and diplomats , Kabul is simply a prison .
Embassies are completely closed to vehicular and even foot traffic .
Indeed , at the American Embassy , the consular section issues visas only to Afghan government officials .
If an average Afghan wants a visa to the U.S. , he or she must travel to Islamabad , Pakistan , to apply .
To allow Afghans to stand in line for visas at the embassy in Kabul would invite terrorist attacks or attract suicide bombers .
Consider that an American Embassy staffer going to the U.S. Agency for International Development office across the street is required to use an underground tunnel that links the two compounds .
Even though the street is closed to all traffic other than official U.S. or U.N. vehicles and is patrolled and guarded by armored personnel carriers , tanks and Kalashnikov - carrying security personnel with a safety perimeter of several blocks , the risk from snipers , mortars or grenades is ever present .
Working in Supermax Afghanistan makes the USAID ’s performance all the more heroic .
Since 2003 , the agency has overseen the investment of more than $ 4 billion in Afghanistan , has built more than 500 schools and an equal number of clinics and has paved more than 1,000 miles of roads , all while suffering about 130 casualties at the hands of the Taliban and Al Qaeda .
By some measures , Afghanistan should be a feel - good story by now -- the Taliban is , officially at least , out of power , Al Qaeda has been chased to the wilds of the Afghan - Pakistani border and U.S. forces are on hand to consolidate and solidify a peaceful new order .
But the truth is very different .
By any measure , this remains a “ hot ” war with a well - armed , motivated and organized enemy .
Village by village , tribe by tribe and province by province , Al Qaeda is coming back , enforcing a form of Islamic life and faith rooted in the 12th century , intimidating reformers , exacting revenge and funding itself with dollars from massive poppy cultivation and heroin smuggling .
As Al Qaeda reestablishes itself , Osama bin Laden remains free to send video messages and serve as an ideological beacon to jihadis worldwide .
The country ’s president , Hamid Karzai , meanwhile , is in effect little more than the mayor of Kabul .
The war in Afghanistan is a political and military one - step - forward - two - steps - back exercise .
The work there is n’t just unfinished , it is more dangerous and less certain than policymakers in Washington and talking heads in New York studios can imagine .
Those suggesting otherwise are either naive or flacking a political agenda .
John Kiriakou , now in the private sector , served as a CIA counter - terrorism official from 1998 to 2004 and recently returned from Afghanistan .
Richard Klein , a former State Department official , is managing director for the Middle East and Arabian Gulf at Kissinger McLarty Associates in Washington .
What better way to follow up on The Little People of London than with an amazing tale of artistic giganticism ?
Julia Fullerton - Batten was born in Bremen , Germany and received her diploma in fine arts from the Berkshire College of Art and Design .
She has since traveled the world and rapidly risen to fame as a premiere fine arts photographer , in no small part thanks to her surreal urban imagery .
In her Teen Stories image series , Julia has taken typical scenes and individuals and juxtaposed them at strange and incredible scales .
This technique , in conjunction with using ordinary people ( as opposed to professional models ) has enabled her to produce an intentional awkwardness in the posture of the models that enhances visual tension within her photographs .
Such work gives a strange new meaning to the terms “ street art ” and “ urban art . ”
Off the street , Julia ’s portraiture is equally impressive .
Instead of staging her subjects in neutral settings , Julia creates almost hyper-real environments playing off of the elegance , extravagance or eccentricity of peoples ’ places of work .
This creates a sense of personality around her subjects , a distinctiveness lacking in a typical staged portrait .
Finally , Julia ’s personal work truly spans the spectrum of artistic possibility .
These photographs show a range of talent , while somehow retaining her distinctive approach to composition and the stark coloration characteristic of her work .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A British judge admitted on Wednesday he was struggling to cope with basic terms like “ Web site ” in the trial of three men accused of inciting terrorism via the Internet .
Judge Peter Openshaw broke into the questioning of a witness about a Web forum used by alleged Islamist radicals .
“ The trouble is I do n’t understand the language .
I do n’t really understand what a Web site is , ” he told a London court during the trial of three men charged under anti-terrorism laws .
Prosecutor Mark Ellison briefly set aside his questioning to explain the terms “ Web site ” and “ forum ” .
An exchange followed in which the 59 - year - old judge acknowledged : “ I have n’t quite grasped the concepts . ”
Violent Islamist material posted on the Internet , including beheadings of Western hostages , is central to the case .
Concluding Wednesday ’s session and looking ahead to testimony on Thursday by a computer expert , the judge told Ellison : “ Will you ask him to keep it simple , we ’ve got to start from basics . ”
Younes Tsouli , 23 , Waseem Mughal , 24 , and Tariq al - Daour , 21 , deny a range of charges under Britain ’s Terrorism Act , including inciting another person to commit an act of terrorism “ wholly or partly ” outside Britain .
Tsouli and Mughal also deny conspiracy to murder .
Al - Daour has pleaded not guilty to conspiring with others to defraud banks , credit card and charge card companies .
Prosecutors have told the jury at Woolwich Crown Court , east London , that the defendants kept car - bomb - making manuals and videos of how to wire suicide vests as part of a campaign to promote global jihad , or holy war .
The trial continues .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Wednesday his overall experience at Columbia University was a good one , even though he was introduced as a " petty and cruel dictator . "
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was criticized when introduced at Columbia University on Monday .
" What really mattered was that several thousand students came to meet a teacher who does n't teach there , but they sat down with me for over one hour , " he told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour .
" We debated , we talked , they heard and thought about the issues that I raised and that , to me , was most valuable . "
Ahmadinejad spoke at the the Ivy League institution Monday .
Before his talk , Columbia President Lee Bollinger -- who had been criticized by some for extending an invitation to the Iranian leader to speak -- called the Iranian leader 's denial of the Holocaust " ridiculous . "
" For the illiterate and ignorant , this is dangerous propaganda , " he said .
He called the Iranian leader " either brazenly provocative or astonishingly uneducated . "
Ahmadinejad opened his remarks by saying Bollinger 's introduction was discourteous , intellectually dishonest and inaccurate .
Watch Iranian president talk with CNN »
About his reception , Ahmadinejad said , " I wish that had n't happened , but nonetheless I think academic students and universities have the ability to make their own judgments , to keep themselves away from such pressures and expand their horizons . "
Dialogue between people of opposing views serves to increase tolerance , and universities are an appropriate forum for such dialogue to occur , he said .
" People should go there to listen to one another and , at the same time , the environment should be friendly , " said Ahmadinejad .
He said the meetings he participated in at Columbia and the United Nations , where he addressed the General Assembly on Tuesday , represented " a lot of important work in helping increase the ability of people to listen together , towards peace , towards justice , towards compassion and towards brotherhood around the world . "
But his meeting with CNN on Wednesday was an abbreviated one -- limited to one question after an earlier agreement to a 15 - minute interview .
The reasons for the restrictions were unclear .
Amanpour asked two questions .

All About Mahmoud Ahmadinejad • Columbia University
From Conservapedia
Sex is the attribute of being either male or female , categories which reflect biological reproductive functions .
The female sex is defined as the one which produces the larger gamete ( the egg ) and which typically bears the offspring .
In contrast , the male sex has a smaller gamete ( sperm ) and rarely bears offspring .
Sex can also refer to sexual intercourse , the physical act of reproduction , also known as " sexual relations " or " having sex . "
In some animals , sex may be assigned to specific structures rather than the entire organism .
Earthworms , for example , are normally hermaphrodites .
Norms of social conduct
For a more detailed treatment , see Gender roles .
" Sex " is the biological definition of whether one is born male or female by their genitalia and biological genes .
" Gender " is a word created in the 1950s to define what society expects of persons of different sexes .
The distinction is important in law , as it tends to forbid discrimination on the basis of either , e.g. effeminate men cannot be fired for not acting according to their " gender " .
In other areas the distinction is primarily important for more abstracted social and legal arguments , rather than everyday use .
In the 21st century , " gender " signifies an apparent difference between your birth sex and the gender one " identifies as , " also known as being transgender .
The left - wing , including Cultural Marxists , frequently claim the existence of a difference in biological sex and " gender identity , " despite no difference by basic biology .
The term sex is often used to denote the activity of sexual relations , and as such it is subject to laws of social conduct .
Sexual morality in the Bible
From the beginning , God created the male and female as uniquely compatible and complimentary , and only joined them in the sanctified sexual union of marriage .
[ 1]
All sexual relations with others outside that bond are revealed to be fornication , which is unconditionally ( regardless of motive or circumstance ) prohibited and condemned . [ 2 ]
In the Bible a harlot or whore ( KJV ) was a woman who had sex before marriage , including prostitutes .
[ 3 ]
If a man engaged in such with a single woman , he was required to marry her for life , while the death penalty was mandated for the man ( or both if consensual ) for engaging in sexual relations with a woman who was betrothed ( contracted to marry ) to another , or for a woman who married under the false pretense of being a virgin , and her husband objected upon discovering otherwise . [ 4 ]
Likewise , spiritual fornication was that of infidelity to God in making an idol to be one 's god , [ 5 ] with Israel being covenantally " married " to God . [ 6 ]
In the Gospel of Mark 7:20 - 23 ( cf. Mt. 15:19 ) , Jesus declares that sin begins in the heart , and the iniquities that proceed out of the heart include fornications , which being plural , includes all sexual relations outside marriage .
While broader descriptions exist ( i.e. " the bed of love " : Ezek. 23:17 ) sexual intercourse is what is usually indicated ( by euphemisms ) in laws against illicit sex , yet it is generally held that this is not limited to such , but prohibits all sexual eroticism outside marriage ( in which it is exclusively sanctioned : Prov. 5:15 - 20 : SoS ) , and which all " uncleanness " [ 7 ] covers . [ 8 ]
Though more than one wife was allowed in the Old Testament , and even concubines were wives , [ 9 ] the Lord Jesus restored that to the original standard of one man and one woman , for life ( though most understand the fornication clause as allowing divorce in the case of marital infidelity , as fornication can include adultery [ 10 ] ) .
In so doing , ( Mt. 19:4 -9 ) Jesus defined the male and the female as constituting the " what " of " what therefore God hath joined together " , and which , along with other verses , excludes same - sex marriage or other sexual unions .
For a more detailed treatment , see Homosexuality and biblical interpretation .
Gender identity
Gender identity is a term used by the Left to give cause to people believing they are a sex other than their biological sex .
It can be used to signify a man wants to become a woman ( or vice versa ) or if any person wants to become a " third gender , " meaning they choose a sex that is neither male nor female .
Children are not simply born with a sense of their own gender but that their gender identity is formed through connections and interactions with others , primarily members of the same sex . [ 11 ]
Leftists also hold the non-scientific opinion that a person 's gender can be altered anthropomorphically by surgery and hormone treatment .
Safety
In general , vaginal sex is highly safe .
The rates of sexually transmitted diseases amongst American teenagers is practically equal between those who always use condoms and those who have occasional or no condom usage . [ 12 ]

The breasts are used by community midwife teams
The woolly breasts are being used at Liverpool Women 's Hospital to show new mothers how to breastfeed and how to express milk if necessary .
Kate McFadden , the hospital 's infant feeding co-ordinator , has already knitted several and has called in the services of her mother , a keen knitter .
The breasts are produced in a variety of skin shades .
They are used by community midwife teams to demonstrate how milk should be expressed , particularly for premature babies being kept in hospital .
Ms McFadden told BBC
News : " We have a regional neo-natal unit and we encourage new mothers to express milk to help the small and sick babies .
Expensive models
" When we first put an e-mail appeal out to everyone in the trust , there were a fair few messages being sent back .
" But they are vital to us and are a low - cost , simple teaching tool . "
Ms McFadden sourced the breast pattern from the Lactation Consultants ' Association .
She said : " You can buy model breasts , but they cost around £ 35 each , which is quite prohibitive , as we need about 50 . "
Although community groups , including the official friends of the hospital association , have pitched in , more knitters are needed .
The administration ’s first reason for denying New York ’s request was that the state has failed to show that it has enrolled at least 95 percent of all the children below 200 percent of the poverty level before moving the eligibility bar to higher incomes .
New York says it has one of the country ’s highest participation levels — at 88 percent — which sounds plenty good enough to justify reaching higher .
So far as we know , no state has met the 95 percent level and many experts think it is unattainable in a group that is difficult to reach and motivate .
Another ground for denial — that New York had failed to require that children above 250 percent of poverty be uninsured for a full year before enrollment — may be the most irrational of all .
The administration claims that its goal is to make sure that families do n’t drop existing group health coverage to enroll in S - chip .
But one year is too long for any child to go without insurance with the likely result that medical needs will be ignored .
At one point the state — unwisely in our view — reluctantly offered to extend its proposed six - month waiting period to a full year provided the administration would grant exceptions for children who lose their private coverage involuntarily , as when a parent dies or loses a job .
No dice .
The administration seemed more intent on blocking the program than finding a reasonable compromise .
New York can petition for reconsideration , and probably should , though the likelihood that the administration might change its mind is vanishingly small .
State officials should also consider a legal challenge .
The best guarantee of success — and protection for America ’s children — would be for Congress to block implementation of the White House ’s arbitrary and destructive new requirements , perhaps in S - chip reauthorization bills that are now before a conference committee .
If that ca n’t be done by a veto - proof margin , voters will have to elect more legislators committed to solving the health care crisis afflicting middle - class families .
The RIAA has finally won its long running battle to have the Russian music download site AllOfMP3 shut down .
The announcement came earlier this week , curiously timed to coincide with Vladimir Putin ’s visit with George Bush .
Coincidence ?
Hardly , it ’s been widely speculated that the existence of sites like AllOfMP3 were a huge roadblock to Russia ’s entry into the World Trade Organization .
Almost immediately after the shutdown , a new site called MP3 Sparks was launched by MediaServices , AllOfMP3 ’s parent company .
MP3 Sparks offers an almost identical selection of music , pricing structure , and encoding options .
The new site even supports accounts created on AllOfMp3 .
Or at least it did while it was online .
MP3 Sparks is now offline as well , and it ’s unclear whether Russian authorities caught on quickly , or if the site might actually be the victim of its own success .
In another coincidence of timing , we ’ve been hearing quite a bit about Universal Music Group ’s efforts to play hardball with Apple .
Universal is apparently refusing to resign a long term agreement to make its catalog of music available on iTunes .
Instead , they ’ll be negotiating on a month - to - month basis and will have the ability to pull their entire catalog from iTunes on short notice .
The problem here is that digital downloads are the one business segment where major labels are seeing sales growth .
And iTunes has been responsible for the vast majority of that growth .
If Universal really were to pull its music from iTunes it would do more damage to its own bottom line than it would to Apple or Steve Jobs .
This whole download thing is n’t going away either .
The music business has changed permanently — the old days of shipping analog media will be over momentarily .
In the meantime , if the major labels want alternatives to iTunes they ’ll need to either innovate on their own , or partner with someone who is capable of innovating .
Someone like MediaServices , perhaps .
One fact that ’s been lost in the heated discussions over AllOfMp3 is that the service was a truly innovative digital music platform .
I ’ve written in the past about how AllOfMp3 should serve as a model for the digital download services of the future .
MediaServices has an innovative approach to the digital music experience , a commerce system already in place , and a high quality library of songs ready to deliver .
Instead of seeing the potential AllOfMp3 represents , the industry would rather debate the legitimacy of MediaServices payments to the Russian royalty agency ROMs , and work through the US government to shut the site down .
Now that the RIAA has succeeded — sort of — you have to wonder what Plan B might be .
At the rate they ’re going they ’ll never escape Apple ’s evil clutches , or Steve Job ’s control over pricing .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Monday challenged a university audience to look into " who was truly involved " in the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , defended his right to question established Holocaust history and denied there were gay Iranians .
When pressed about the harsh treatment of women , homosexuals and academics who challenge Iran 's government , Ahmadinejad painted a rosy picture , saying , " Women in Iran enjoy the highest levels of freedom , " he said .
He elicited laughter and boos from the audience at Columbia University when he said , " In Iran , we do n't have homosexuals , like in your country . "
His remarks , which lasted about an hour , made several general references to God , religion and science .
He portrayed himself as an academic , misunderstood and unfairly criticized in the United States .
Ahmadinejad is in New York to address the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday .
He spoke at the invitation of Columbia 's president , Lee Bollinger , who in his introduction excoriated the leader by saying he " exhibit[s ] all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator . "
Ahmadinejad on CNN CNN's Christiane Amanpour goes one - on - one with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on " AC 360 . "
Tonight , 10 ET ; 0200 GMT
Thursday see full schedule »
Blaming his schedule , Ahmadinejad left Columbia after his speech before answering many questions posed to him , Bollinger said .
Hundreds gathered to protest Ahmadinejad 's appearance , incensed that a leader who has publicly denied the Holocaust and called for the destruction of the state of Israel was given a prestigious forum to espouse his beliefs .
Christine C. Quinn , speaker of the New York City Council , said Columbia should not be giving Ahmadinejad a platform .
" All he will do on that stage ... is spew more hatred and more venom out there to the world , " she said .
Hamid Dabashi , a professor of Iranian studies at Columbia , called the whole forum " misguided . "
Refusing to back off of his stance on Israel , Ahmadinejad again questioned whether the Holocaust happened .
" If the Holocaust is a reality of our time , a history that occurred , why is there not sufficient research that can approach the topic from different perspectives ? " he asked .
The Iranian leader has made statements in the past suggesting Israel be politically " wiped off the map , " though he insists that can be accomplished without violence .
See some of Ahmadinejad 's controversial remarks »
While he would not respond with a " yes " or " no " when asked Monday if he sought the destruction of Israel , he said the status of Israel should be determined by a free election .
" Let the people of Palestine freely choose what they want for their future , " he said .
Ahmadinejad has drawn fire for defying international demands that Iran halt production of enriched uranium .
At Columbia , he said Iran is a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency , the world 's central nuclear technology governing body , and has submitted many times to IAEA inspections .
" Over and over again the agency 's reports indicate that Iran 's activities are peaceful , that they have not detected a deviation , " he said .
Washington and other nations accuse Tehran of trying to create a nuclear weapons program .
Watch reaction to Ahmadinejad speaking at Columbia University »
Ahmadinejad said Iran questions " the way the world is being run and managed today . "
But he said Iran would hold talks with the U.S. government " under fair and just circumstances . "
U.S. officials have said Iranian explosives and weapons are making their way to Shiite Muslim militias in Iraq 's sectarian conflict and have been used against U.S. troops in the four - year - old war .
U.S. commanders have said they have captured Iranian agents involved in supplying those weapons to the militias , some of which have longstanding ties to Iran .
On this point , Ahmadinejad employed a tactic he used often Monday -- answering questions with more questions .
Bollinger asked , " Why is your government providing aid to terrorists ?
Will you stop doing so and permit international monitoring to certify that you have stopped ? "
Through a translator , Ahmadinejad replied , " Well , I want to pose a question here to you .
If someone comes and explodes bombs around you , threatens your president , members of the administration , kills the members of the Senate or Congress , how would you treat them ?
Would you reward them or would you name them a terrorist group ?
Well , it 's clear .
You would call them a terrorist . "
Earlier Ahmadinejad had said he wanted to visit ground zero in New York to " pay his respects " to those who died in the attack on the twin towers at the World Trade Center .
Several groups were outraged .
Security became an issue and the visit was canceled .
Asked what he hoped to accomplish there , the Iranian president said it was unfair he could not extend his sympathies to victims of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
Addressing the press directly , he seemed to make a connection between the " root causes " of the September 11 , 2001 attacks and a solution in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" If the root causes of 9/11 are examined properly -- why it happened , what caused it , what were the conditions that led to it , who truly was involved , who was really involved -- and put it all together to understand how to prevent the crisis in Iraq , fix the problem in Afghanistan and Iraq combined . "
He stressed repeatedly that Iran wants to negotiate with the United States and other nations , several times describing Iran as a " cultured " and " civilized " nation .
" I think that if the U.S. administration , if the U.S. government puts aside some of its old behaviors , it can actually be a good friend for the Iranian people , for the Iranian nation , " he said .
" For 28 years , they 've consistently threatened us , insulted us , prevented our scientific development , every day , under one pretext or another . "
As he ended his talk at Columbia , he invited faculty and students to visit any university in Iran they choose .
" We 'll give you the platform .
We 'll respect you 100 percent .
We will have our students sit there and listen to you , speak with you , hear what you have to say , " he assured .
Earlier Monday , in a question - and - answer videoconference with the National Press Club , Ahmadinejad said the Middle East can govern itself without interference from the United States and other Western nations .
Speaking from New York to the luncheon in Washington , Ahmadinejad said Iran wanted to see " an independent powerful Iraq ... which will benefit the entire region . "
" We are two nations interconnected , " he said of Iran and Iraq .
" We are brothers and friends . "
But he said the region did n't need U.S. help .
" We oppose the way the U.S. government tries to manage the world .
...
We propose more humane methods of establishing peace , " he said .

Here 's a real - life superhero dilemma :
What do you do when you 're the world 's most powerful news and opinion magazine , carrying the English - language torch of freedom on behalf of your million - plus high - net - worth readers across the globe , and suddenly you spot injustice on the Eurasian horizon :
Sham elections in an oil - rich Eurasian country , resulting in a one - party parliament ; its autocratic leader just pushed through constitutional amendments allowing him to remain in power for life ; and it's waging a campaign to bully Western oil companies out of their lucrative oil fields , in spite of contracts and investments made .
If the country in question is Kazakhstan , and you 're The Economist , then you know exactly what to do : Put Vladimir Putin on the cover and scare the shit out of your readers by sounding the " Hitler Alarm ! " threat he poses to mankind .
It does n't matter that you run a version of this story almost every week .
Or that the story you decide to run in the wake of Kazakhstan 's sham elections happens to have been run in almost the exact same form by all of your colleagues FOUR FUCKING YEARS AGO .
For The Economist , the Putin - as - Fascist story is n't bound by traditional Newtonian concepts of time or space , let alone the basic principles of Western journalism .
It 's a story that can be played like a deck of trump cards .
No matter what else happens in the world - for example , the mega - clusterfuck in Iraq , a war that The Economist screamed for in a campaign capped by its infamous " The Case For War " editorial - when a story threatens to confuse or upset their agenda , the weekly can just drop the Putin - Hitler trump card .
It works like a dream , every time .
Thanks to the English magazine 's clever rhetorical strategy , calibrating an effective mixture of aristocratic contempt , two - notches - smarter - than - Newsweek diction , and occasional anti-elitist populism to pander to its majority - American readership , readers trust The Economist .
They - particularly American readers - trust it because they think it knows more than they do ; this is its entire appeal .
They even get a sick thrill being talked down to by a dirty old aristocratic prig .
For Americans in particular , accustomed to the lifeless , dumbed - down , least - common - denominator prose in their own media , reading The Economist is its own reward , giving them the sense not only that they 're smarter than the average Time subscriber , but that it even makes them vaguely decadent , in a literary - aristocratic sort of way .
They become smarter by osmosis simply by being in the imagined drawing room of The Economist 's wit- slinging editorial offices .
In reality , The Economist is one of the most appallingly wrong and evil - as in responsible - for - millions - of - dead - people evil - organs in the world today .
As far as " wit " goes , The Economist ranks up there with Benson , the snappy TV sitcom butler , though it 's nowhere near as delightfully entertaining as the British butler in the godawful Dudley Moore comedy Arthur .
Or as Michael Lewis , the author of Liar 's Poker , observed after moving to England , " The magazine is written by young people pretending to be old people .
If American readers got a look at the pimply complexions of their economic gurus , they would cancel their subscriptions in droves . "
If only it was a question of overrated wit .
But it 's much worse .
It 's a sinister and sophisticated English snowjob .
Considering their influence and their influential readership , not to mention where they 're leading us with their anti-Russia campaign , it 's time to set the record straight , to put the " s " back in " limey " and call The Economist for the slimey fucks that they are , before they drag us all down with them again , just as they did with Iraq .

Ron Paul has over the past few months emerged as the dark horse US Presidential candidate .
With a small but growing cadre of devoted supporters , Paul is gaining political traction by campaigning on ideas about financial reform which would dramatically affect the global currency and forex markets .
A staunch supporter of lower taxes , a dramatically smaller government , and long - term conservative monetary policy , a Ron Paul presidency could mean big changes for the US Dollar and its relationship to other currencies .
In this article we investigate the specific affects of a Ron Paul presidency on the US Dollar and on the global forex markets .
As a part of his belief in decreased government spending and entitlement , Ron Paul has openly criticized knee - jerk expenditures enabled by Congress .
In a House floor response to Hurricane Katrina spending , Paul argues that Congress was too quick to throw money at the problem , not considering the affect that this action might have on government spending and thus , the value of the dollar .
Paul criticizes this kind of spending because it causes our budget , economy , and dollar value to suffer .
Ron Paul points out that when the government spends money that we do n’t have , we are forced to " debase " the dollar .
This debasement happens in two ways .
First , we have to borrow from foreign lenders , and second because we have to print more money to make up the difference .
It ’s a risky strategy that causes the dollar ’s value to fall and creates an " inflation tax . "
Paul ’s concern is that " there is no guarantee that gracious foreign lenders will step forward , especially without raising interest rates . "
However , it is worth noting that to - date , this has not proven to be a significant problem .
Dr. Paul proposes that instead of spending to such a degree that we are dependent on foreign backers to lend to the government , we should implement a system that relies on money that we have available .
Under Paul ’s system , " any new expenditures must have offsets greater in amount than the new programs " and that " the Federal Reserve must stop inflating the currency . "
Given this platform , it is reasonable to expect that a Ron Paul Presidency would place a much greater emphasis on a balancing the budget , which could potentially stop the dollar ’s fall .
Ron Paul wants to cut down on defense spending .
He argues that the war in Iraq has been too costly , both in American lives and " hundreds of billions of dollars . "
Paul believes that we should exercise caution when we give foreign aid , but at the same time be careful not to isolate ourselves .
His foreign policy goal is to " have a strong America , conducting open trade , travel , communication , and diplomacy with other nations . "
The implication of this foreign policy can affect the dollar in two ways .
First , it would reduce government spending , assuming that the war funds currently being used are n’t just shifted elsewhere .
A cut in government military spending of hundreds of billions of dollars would mean a more balanced budget which in turn would mean a more valuable Dollar in the forex markets .
Second , a healthier foreign policy could improve economic relations with other countries and perhaps encourage more foreign investment and free trade agreements .
These developments would improve the dollar ’s value as demand for Dollar denominated goods increased .
Paul , like many politicians running for office , is a fan of lower taxes .
His strategy is to let Americans keep more of their money so that they ’ll help improve the country ’s finances .
He believes that lowered taxes will result in positive changes for everyone , " allow[ing ] more spending , saving and investing , which helps the economy . "
Lowered taxes for Americans affect the currency markets in a variety of ways .
With increased money in their pockets , American entrepreneurs are likely to start more new companies and existing companies are more likely to launch bigger projects .
This can increase demand for Dollar denominated goods , which puts upward pressure on the Dollar .
With respect to forex markets in particular , increased money in the hands of Americans typically means more entrants into financial markets , which means that forex markets , along with other financial markets are likely to continue growing .
So if Paul lowers taxes , the obvious question is , where are we going to get money for government spending ?
The answer is , we probably wo n’t need to scramble for money .
It looks like Ron Paul is n’t interested in a high - cost government .
He argues that entitlement programs are not where they need to be , pointing out that " if present trends continue , by 2040 the entire federal budget will be consumed by Social Security and Medicare alone . "
Paul challenges his colleagues to " rethink the very role of government in our society , " essentially implying that the government should stop spending so much money on entitlement programs .
It ’s likely that he ’d cut completely or at a minimum dramatically weaken many government entitlement programs .
He plans to cut welfare for illegal aliens , noting that " Americans have welcomed immigrants who seek opportunity , work hard , and play by the rules .
But taxpayers should not pay for illegal immigrants who use hospitals , clinics , schools , roads , and social services . "
Additionally , he wants to change Medicare , pointing out that the prescription drug plan is just not working .
He argues that it ’s the " biggest entitlement problem facing our nation , " resulting in a plan that " will actually harm many seniors by causing them to lose their private coverage , forcing them into an inferior government - run program . "
Smaller government achieved by dramatically cutting social welfare programs and lowered defense spending is likely in the short term to increase unemployment and civil unrest .
Initially , this might increase volatility in currency markets as investors are made uneasy by the change .
In the longer term , however , a federal budget surplus should strengthen confidence in the Dollar ..
Ron Paul is highly critical of our current paper money system , arguing that it is " nothing short of counterfeiting " and promotes spending over saving .
He supports the idea of a commodity - based money rather than our current fiat system .
Paul condemns doing away with the gold standard and proposes that we get back to putting real value behind our dollars .
In a statement on monetary policy and the economy , Paul points out that the dollar ’s value has fallen dramatically : " The dollar today is worth only four cents compared to the dollar in 1913 , when the Federal Reserve started . "
He ’s concerned that we ’re setting ourselves up for trouble because paper money can be rejected and is essentially without value .
Paul is also worried that a currency which is not backed by a commodity stands on very shaky ground , subject to inflation and military involvement .
He remarks , " the Federal Reserve , our central bank , fosters runaway debt by increasing the money supply — making each dollar in your pocket worth less . "
Paul purports that the real value behind our dollar is " the military might we enjoy , " and that creates a world in which other countries " have little choice but to accept the dollars we declare as today ’s ‘ gold . ’ "
He further argues that this military - money system is the reason why we push regime change in countries like Iraq , Iran and Venezuela : because they have challenged the system .
Paul supports " the economic law that honest exchange demands only things of real value as currency , " and wants to " return to a money of real value . "
The effects of what is perhaps Dr. Paul ’s most novel policy on forex markets is complex .
Reverting to a commodity - backed currency would , in the short term , require a massive revaluation of the US Dollar as the federal government began to amass enough gold to back the dollar .
If this stockpiling was not handled properly it might lead to a run on the dollar which would cause a massive devaluation .
Furthermore , the amount of gold necessary to fully back the US Dollar would likely put immense pressure on global gold supplies and thus might limit the ability of the US government to continue to print money at any level which would cause deflation .
On the other hand , if an accumulation of gold sufficient to back the Dollar was carefully accomplished , it would over time lead to a far more stable currency as lenders would be assured that they can receive something of real value back for their dollar .
Ron Paul , formerly a practicing OB - GYN , wants to dramatically change the US health care system .
He supports a health care system without the middle man , free from HMO and government intervention .
Paul argues that doctors and patients should have the ultimate authority on care .
He aims to improve the care that Americans receive by " rethink[ing ] the whole system of HMOs and managed care . "
In his essay on " free market medicine , " Paul lauds a rural Tennessee doctor who runs a cash practice .
Paul points out that by eliminating insurance and bureaucracy , this doctor is able to lower his overhead and charge lower prices .
He supports a policy to " unravel the HMO web rooted old laws , and change the tax code to allow individual Americans to fully deduct all health care costs from their taxes . "
He does not support the " collusion between organized medicine , politicians , and drug companies , in an effort to move America toward ‘ free ’ universal health care . "
Rather , he proposes that we move back to a system that we had 40 years ago , when patients paid cash for ordinary services and had inexpensive catastrophic insurance for serious injuries or illnesses . "
Dr. Paul wants to lower the government ’s role in health care so that medical care can be delivered in a free market and consumers can reap the benefits of the " competition and financial incentives " that keep costs down .
The effect of this healthcare reform policy on currency markets is two - fold .
One , lowered health care costs will allow consumers to keep more of their money and improve the dollar ’s standing by making our economy more robust .
Secondly , limited government intervention in health care will decrease the amount of money that the government must spend to support it .
This will likely lead to a decrease in the national debt , and thus a rise in confidence in , and strength of , the Dollar .
Conclusion
In conclusion while a number of Ron Paul ’s policies will have mixed effects on currency markets , on the whole , a Ron Paul presidency would probably lead to a stronger US Dollar .
Privilege of China 's wealthiest : A 2nd child
By Jun Wang ( International Herald Leader / paci )
Updated : 2005-09-02 10:04
Jaiwei Du's parents wanted two sons .
But they did not have the chance to have another son before China 's one - child policy began in 1978 , four years after Du was born .
Famous Chinese film director Chen Kaige ( L ) poses a family photo with his actress wife Chen Hong and their two sons in Shanghai .
The star couple have at least one of their children born in the US .
[ baidu ]
According to the National Population and Family Planning Commission of China , families who can have two children are " at the two ends of the social scale . "
They are either so poor that the government never expects them to repay the fine , or so rich that the fine is meaningless .
As China 's economy and income skyrocket in recent years , the rich are finding it easy to evade the one - child policy .
Peasants pregnant with their second or third child typically escape from their hometown to avoid forced abortion by the local population and family planning officers .
The rich do n't need to escape .
Instead , they simply pay the fine .
According to the International Herald Leader , a businessman in Zhejiang Province paid a 0.4 million RMB ( $ 80,000 ) fine for his second child .
High income also means more freedom to travel .
Sometimes the wealthy deliver their children abroad so that the newborn children become foreign citizens , who are not covered by the Chinese one - child policy .
Chinese film director Kaige Chen ( Farewell my Concubine ) , an American permanent resident , and his actress wife have two sons , at least one was born in Los Angeles .
" There are not many people in such high - income level , so such legal loopholes have little influence on population control , " says Weixiong Li , a population officer of the National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference .
But Li admitted that it destroys the justice and equity of the one - child policy and other related laws .
Among young white collar workers in metropolitan cities like Beijing and Guangzhou , people who want two children outnumber those who only want one child by 34.6 percent , according to a 2002 report from the National Population and Family Planning Commission of China .
" The current relatively low birthrate is from the one - child policy , " says Hao Zhou , a sociology professor from Nanjing University .
People naturally want to have more than one child , he says .
" Once there 's opportunity , the birthrate would rebound .
High income creates such an opportunity , " he says .
Forever Is a Long Time
Rob Griffiths , in a piece for the Macworld Editors Weblog titled “ iPhone 1.0 Forever ” :
Unlike most Apple software updates , I held off on running this one until there were some field reports about exactly what happened .
Once those reports started trickling in , I came to a painful but obvious conclusion : I will never install the 1.1.1 update on my iPhone .
I ’ve chosen not to upgrade because I value the productivity , entertainment , and customization abilities offered by the third - party applications I ’ve added to my iPhone .
Me , on the other hand , I did n’t hesitate to upgrade my iPhone .
The third - party hacks were fun to play with , but there is n’t a single one that I miss .
Not one .
( Well , other than my own , and even that one does n’t really matter given how lame the Notes app is regardless of the display font . )
The closest I found to useful was Craig Hockenberry ’s iPhone - native Twitterrific — but even that one , in its current state , is more of a killer proof - of - concept than a finished killer app .
But it ’ll be interesting to see how many people , like Griffiths , are sticking with 1.0.2 for this reason — and whether development efforts will continue , even though they can only , at least for now , target iPhones running the old 1.0.2 OS .
My guess is that until — and unless — hackers succeed in figuring out a way to access the file system of 1.1.1 iPhones , the underground development community is going to wither .
I also suspect most iPhone owners have already upgraded to 1.1.1 .
Griffiths continues :
I also understand that the new encrypted communications between the iPhone and iTunes may very well have been necessary to prevent SIM unlock programs , which directly impact Apple and AT&T revenue , from being created .
I fully believe that Apple has the right to do what it needs to do to protect its revenue , and that of its partners .
Still , with that understanding , I have to ask … what was Apple thinking ?
Apple was thinking exactly what Griffiths wrote in his own preceding paragraph — that they needed to close the unofficially opened access to the iPhone file system because people were using it to unlock iPhones from Apple ’s partner phone networks .
That the 1.1.1 upgrade both breaks SIM - unlocking and third - party applications comes down to the same underlying reason : the closing of known techniques of accessing the iPhone file system .
In fact , my guess is that the 1.1.1 update does n’t actually break compatibility with the third - party apps themselves — if you could install them , my guess is they ’d work just fine .
It ’s just that ( a ) the upgrade to 1.1.1 reinstalls the entire OS , thus removing any third - party apps already installed ; and ( b ) there ’s no longer any known way to reinstall third - party apps .
( The 1.0.2 and 1.0.1 updates also reinstalled the entire OS — it ’s just easier that way . )
Admittedly , for all we know , even if hackers had never figured out a way to SIM - unlock the original iPhone 1.0 OS , Apple still might have closed access to the iPhone file system in the 1.1.1 update .
For example , it ’s worth noting that the iPod Touch , which has no SIM card or network - carrier exclusivity , is locked in apparently the same way as the 1.1.1 iPhone .
But hypotheticals aside , we do know that the 1.0 iPhones were SIM - unlocked .
And if you think Apple could have simply let that be without breaking the contracts they ’ve signed guaranteeing exclusivity to their carrier partners around the world , you ’re nuts .
Back to Griffiths :
What I do n’t understand is that Apple apparently does n’t see any upside to allowing third party applications on the iPhone .
This confuses me , because an active third - party development community can only help , not hurt , Apple ’s bottom line .
That ’s not a valid conclusion from Apple ’s actions .
It ’s likely , and at the very least possible , that everyone at Apple sees some upside to allowing third - party apps on the iPhone — but that they are n’t yet technically ready to do so , and / or that they think the downsides outweigh the upsides .
It ’s foolish to argue that there are n’t any trade - offs whatsoever , most obviously that perhaps so long as the iPhone is open to third - party apps , it ’s also open , or at least more open , to SIM - unlocking .
You can argue that Apple should allow it anyway , but you ca n’t argue that that ’s not a trade - off .
Back to Griffiths :
I think Apple blew it here , and blew it in a big way .
Instead of embracing and extending the development of third - party applications , it seems they ’ve gone in the opposite direction : to make it as hard as possible for third - party applications to exist .
If it ’s true that Apple has no plans to ever allow third - party software development for the iPhone , maybe they have blown it .
( And maybe not — although while I personally hope to see Apple officially open up the iPhone , I do n’t think they need to .
I think the iPhone could be a popular , profitable , long - term platform while remaining closed to developers . )
But that ’s an enormous “ if ” , and one that no one outside Apple ’s executive team knows the answer to today .
It ’s entirely possible that Apple is committed to opening up the iPhone to development but that they are n’t yet ready , and , as per their usual policy , are keeping their mouths shut in the meantime .
The idea that Apple has screwed over or even somehow been rude to the grassroots iPhone developer community is absurd .
Apple never asked for nor encouraged iPhone software development , and the fact that it happened anyway put Apple under zero obligation to support it .
One last bit from Griffiths :
Of course , consumers still do have a choice , but that choice is to purchase a competing brand ’s smart phone .
Is that what Apple really wants us to do ?
Yes , actually .
If “ third - party software development ” is one of your requirements for a phone , buying something other than an iPhone is exactly what Apple wants you to do .
Just like if you “ require ” a hardware keyboard , compatibility with proprietary Microsoft Exchange email servers , freely - customizable ringtones , removable faceplates , or any other features or capabilities the iPhone lacks .
There ’s only one way to pressure Apple into opening up iPhone development , and it is n’t by developing underground iPhone apps .
It ’s by not buying iPhones .
Money talks , and right now , there does n’t seem to be a shortage of people willing to give Apple money in exchange for a completely closed iPhone .
Sgt. Sean Colomey patrols the most gang - ridden neighborhood in the gang capital of America .
It is his job to lead 28 specially trained police through an area where assault weapons seem as common as grass , graffiti " tags " define the turf , and 7 of every 100 residents are members of one gang or another .
He is just the man Police Commissioner Anthony Pacheco wants to know .
A wave of gang violence , one that some say is the most vicious in city history , has engulfed Los Angeles , and the city 's police are mounting an equally historic response .
It is Commissioner Pacheco's job to assess how effectively the LAPD is confronting the gangs – whether it has the tools and personnel it needs , whether police tactics stay within the law .
He sees the response as a huge and necessary undertaking .
No less than " the future safety of L.A. is at stake , " Pacheco says .
So it is that on a recent Friday night Sergeant Colomey , the gang expert , and Pacheco , a civilian appointed to serve as one of five LAPD commissioners , meet in the parking lot of the Southeast Division headquarters at the corner of 108th and Main Streets .
Pacheco will ride along on this shift – it's a chance to pick Colomey 's brain about gang rivalries , to catch the cop 's - eye view of the action .
This ride - along , like others he 's been on over the past 18 months , will help the commissioner decide for himself whether the police crackdown is having an effect .
It 's just one night and just one lens on the gang problem , but Pacheco feels it 's a vital perspective to gain .
Colomey slides on a bulletproof vest , and hands one to the commissioner .
Velcro closes them tight , but it 's small comfort .
The vests can stop bullets from handguns , but not from AK47s .
A Chinese - made copy of the notorious Russian assault rifle can be had on the streets for about $ 100 .
" It 's all over the place , " Colomey says of the gun .
" It 's a military weapon that will send a bullet through you and the next guy and the house next door and keep on going . "
* * *
The latest crime report came as something of a shock to many Los Angelenos .
Crime rates had dropped citywide for five straight years , mirroring the trend in other major metropolises .
But last year L.A. as a whole saw a 14 percent jump in gang - related violent crime .
Police say there are 39,000 gang members in Los Angeles – and 15,000 of them are active in the compact area where Colomey and Pacheco will be on patrol .
Colomey , though , was not shocked .
His division , which encompasses Watts and South Central L.A. , has logged roughly 500 shootings a year for the past few years .
On their ride together through this 9.3 - square - mile community – 200,000 people boxed in by four freeways – Pacheco and Colomey are taking a kind of inventory of 65 gangs who police say rule these streets like terrorists .
" They do everything that terrorist groups do ... rule by fear and intimidation , the threat of violence and murder in every area of these neighborhoods , " says Colomey , a 17 - year veteran .
It 's the apparent spread of gang violence to additional parts of L.A. that has set in motion a kind of " Marshall Plan " attack on the problem , of which the LAPD response is one part .
So far , police department action includes unprecedented collaboration with the feds : the FBI , the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) , and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives ( ATF ) .
It includes injunctions that restrict the activities of certain gang members and nuisance - abatement crackdowns that target gang hangouts .
It includes formal lists of " most wanted " members and " most wanted " gangs and better - coordinated ways to track and prosecute them .
But there 's also plain old enforcement , meaning a bigger show of force and more arrests .
This night would make that clear .
* * *
About half of Colomey 's gang enforcement detail is on duty at any given time , so the sergeant is set for a casual tour of " non-frontline " duty with the commissioner .
That plan changes in the first minute of his shift .
They set off first for the scene of an earlier shooting .
But the parking lot is still visible in the rearview mirror when Colomey and five other cruisers are summoned for backup in a cocaine bust just blocks in the other direction .
That 's a sizable backup squad , but Colomey says the extra hands will be needed for crowd control – local residents who often press the perimeter of an arrest scene .
At least 100 locals have gathered in front yards , in fact .
Some are taunting the cops and videotaping the onslaught of cruisers .
A suspect is already in handcuffs , after an officer felled him with pepper spray .
Police say the man is a gang member who was selling rock cocaine in plain view as a cruiser drove by , and that he had ignored police orders to " show your hands . "
" People from outside the area ask us , is it really that blatant ... the disregard for authority and police ? " says Colomey .
" I tell them , yes , they are not deterred by us at all . "
As Colomey walks between officers at the scene , a woman with a video camera to her eye says , " You do n't have no business here .
You can't come in here without a warrant .
Go ahead , just try to come in here .
I 've got my eye on you .... "
The antagonism is a testament to a long and tense history between the LAPD and Watts , a patchwork neighborhood of single - story , single - family homes , most with manicured front yards but barred windows , too .
This is one of the places where riots erupted after police were acquitted in the 1994 Rodney King beating case , and again in 1995 and 1996 after the O.J. Simpson trials .
Now relations are taut again as police try to clamp down on violence they say is rooted in bitter rivalries between black and Hispanic gangs .
" There are four major wars going on right now [ within the Southeast Division ] , " Colomey tells Pacheco , ticking off pairs of combatants .
The Southeast Division is not the only part of Los Angeles that appears to be spiraling closer toward race war .
In recent months , altercations between black and Hispanic gang members have spilled from L.A. streets into the county jail and back to the streets , a vicious cycle of revenge and competition that has bred more violence .
Even among law - abiding residents here , black - Latino relations have soured , as some feel they are losing out on jobs , affordable housing , and public spaces such as parks .
The result is a thick layer of fear that , some neighborhood activists say , has descended on this city like a pot lid .
In all his years of duty , says Colomey , he 's never seen the climate so foreboding in so many pockets of L.A. , including Watts .
In such a climate , a kind of siege mentality can set in .
Driving past a liquor store at 87th Street and Compton Avenue , Colomey points out groups of girls outside and in cars across the street , and he notes that police do n't have the luxury of assuming they are as innocent as they look .
" Many , many times we find that it is the women who hold the guns for their gang members , do the shootings , and aid in the escapes , " he says .
The shootings , he adds , are always about three things : " drugs , money , guns . "
Later , he adds a fourth : respect .
" Some guys might go to a dance and hit on a girl who 's a girlfriend of an opposing gang [ member ] , and her boyfriend shoots them .
It can be as simple as that , " says Colomey .
" Then you got a retaliation war going on . "
* * *
From behind the wheel , Colomey offers his assessment of how well the LAPD 's antigang measures are working .
Chief William Bratton 's new emphasis on coordinating with the ATF , FBI , and DEA is a dramatic change that is helping to gather evidence and prosecute gang members in ways that were impossible before , says the sergeant .
" It used to be .... we did n't play well in the sandbox together .
That 's all over now . "
Increased police backup from nongang units , another new initiative , is also creating a bigger show of force , he says .
Several federal operations are in progress – attempts to disrupt and eventually dismantle gangs deemed to be the most troublesome and vicious .
By taking frequent ride - alongs , Pacheco says he can take note of mundane problems such as broken radios , an insufficient number of cruiser - based computers that connect police with databases and precinct dispatchers , and the need for cruiser - mounted video cameras .
The videocams were called for after the Rodney King beating , but the LAPD is only now getting around to funding them .
The Southeast Division is slated to get its first cruiser cams in coming months .
Another new tack is increased coordination with parole and probation officers .
More of them have set up office in district headquarters , and the closer proximity to police is resulting in a better ability to give tipoffs about who is back on the streets from jail or prison .
Colomey drives Pacheco past three of his roughest neighborhoods : Nickerson Gardens , Imperial Heights , and Jordan Downs – housing projects with numbered buildings and bars on windows .
A year ago , video surveillance cameras were installed on streetlight poles at Jordan Downs , enough to cover every inch of a six - block development .
Since then , violent crime in the area dropped 41 percent , Colomey says .
" You are looking at what was one of the most violent and dangerous areas for violent crime in the entire US , " says Colomey .
" We think we are onto something that really works . "
Pacheco says he has been distressed , on other ride - alongs , to see young children out and about at 11:30 p.m. or later .
To him , it points to a culture of permissiveness , of parental absence and drug use .
But it also yields more deaths of innocents , children killed by sprays of gang bullets aimed at someone else .
But this Friday night ride - along will end abruptly , well before 11:30 .
* * *
Not long after leaving the cocaine bust , three separate radio frequencies crackle to life .
It 's bad : Shots have been fired at an officer , and the officer has returned fire .
The dispatch continues , adding detail :
Two suspects , alleged gang members , are fleeing in a black Thunderbird , apparently after having shot a man on the sidewalk .
Colomey flips on the siren and speeds down back streets , looking for the getaway car .
He 's on the radio , directing the response .
A high - speed chase ensues , ending in a crash between the Thunderbird and another vehicle .
Arriving seconds later at the crash scene , Colomey and Pacheco see an overturned car , its driver lying on the sidewalk , and the Thunderbird , minus its front end ... and its occupants .
The " perps , " said to be carrying guns , have escaped into the neighborhood .
The next 90 minutes see the arrival of two helicopters , at least a dozen squad cars , three canine units ( complete with assault rifles and Belgian dogs ) , several SWAT units , and three armored vehicles .
Because an officer fired his weapon during the incident , and because two perpetrators with guns are at large , the megawatt response also includes the arrivals of Assistant Chief James McDonnell and South Bureau Chief Charlie Beck .
While copters overhead shine spotlights a half - mile from the scene , canine units begin going house to house looking for the suspects , a search that will last until morning .
* * *
Later , Pacheco sums up the Friday - night ride - along , in the context of dozens of others he has made as commissioner .
For all the hoopla of the high - speed pursuit , multiple shootings , ' copters and canine units , the evening was also typically revealing in many respects , he says .
Foremost , it showed " how thin the ' thin blue line ' is , " he says , how outgunned law officers are compared with the number of gangs and gang members .
It showed how exposed the police are to danger , leaving their cruisers to cuff gang members in hostile places .
It showed , he says , the dedication and continued resolve of veteran officers amid a situation that has gone from bad to worse .
And , Pacheco adds , it underscored the conventional wisdom of those who've watched the gang crisis in L.A. for decades : " You ca n't arrest your self out of a gang problem . "
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ( R ) is in line with that thinking , too .
On Monday , he called for a statewide summit to forge a counterattack on street gangs – one that would involve both law - enforcement and gang - prevention measures .
It remains to seen whether L.A. 's extensive plan for facing down gangs – including job and community development , after - school programs , and other investments – can work .
But Pacheco , for one , is determined to see that the gangs ' grip on Los Angeles – which he characterizes as " wildly out of control " is diminished .
His part of the answer , law enforcement , " is moving forward to confront gangs , " he says .
At the same time , he is unwavering that " robust crime suppression must not violate laws . "
And he has taken a place on the front lines to help make sure that is the case .
For the second time in a month , private consultants to the government are warning that human - driven warming of the climate poses risks to the national security of the United States .
A report , scheduled to be published on Monday but distributed to some reporters yesterday , said issues usually associated with the environment — like rising ocean levels , droughts and violent weather caused by global warming — were also national security concerns .
“ Unlike the problems that we are used to dealing with , these will come upon us extremely slowly , but come they will , and they will be grinding and inexorable , ” Richard J. Truly , a retired United States Navy vice admiral and former NASA administrator , said in the report .
The effects of global warming , the study said , could lead to large - scale migrations , increased border tensions , the spread of disease and conflicts over food and water .
All could lead to direct involvement by the United States military .
SUMMERTIME ( well , in the northern hemisphere ) , the living is easy and holidaymakers are at the seaside .
Canadians have the greatest choice , with the world 's longest coastline .
Leaving aside tiny islands , Monaco has the shortest coast .
As for another holiday activity — slurping ice cream — Canadian data suggest that New Zealanders guzzle the most , a staggering 26.3 litres each , followed by Americans with 18.7 litres each , every year .
Canadians themselves are more modest , licking up just 9.5 litres each .

AT&T announced today that it has purchased 12MHz of spectrum in the prime 700MHz spectrum band from privately - held Aloha Partners for close to $ 2.5 billion .
Aloha purchased the spectrum in Federal Communications Commission auctions held during 2001 and 2003 , but has n't done much with the licenses since the auctions ended .
The licenses to the spectrum cover around 196 million residents of the US and 72 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas , including the ten largest markets in the US .
AT&T is n't divulging much in the way of specifics for the bandwidth , other than saying that the company will use it for voice , data , and video .
" Aloha 's spectrum will enable AT&T to efficiently meet this growing demand and help our customers stay connected to their worlds , " said Forest Miller , AT&T 's group resident for corporate strategy and development .
AT&T 's purchase gives it more options in the upcoming 700MHz spectrum auction .
Set to begin on January 16 , 2008 , the auction carries a combined reserve price of $ 10 billion .
Bidding could significantly exceed that number , should significant competition for the licenses materialize .
The hope of FCC Chairman Kevin Martin — as well as just about everyone who has been stung by the lack of broadband competition in the US — is that the auction will lead to the creation of a viable wireless broadband network .
With 12MHz of Aloha Partners ' spectrum in hand , AT&T could choose to sit out the auction altogether , or bid strategically on particular licenses .
( The spectrum offerings are broken up by wavelength and geographic location ) .
With spectrum covering just under 200 million residents , AT&T could use the auction to simply fill out its geographic reach .
Best of all from AT&T 's perspective , there are none of the pesky open access or public safety regulations attached to this 12MHz of spectrum .
Should AT&T take a reduced role in next January 's auction , there still may be plenty of action — especially if Google decides to jump in .
While the search giant has n't exactly said outright that it intends to bid , it has taken a keen interest in the FCC 's auction rule - making process .
Last week , Google attacked Verizon over the telecom 's attempts to have some of the open access rules overturned .
If AT&T decides to scale back its bidding or take itself out of the auction picture entirely after today 's purchase , it opens the door a bit wider for a new entrant like Google .
If there were a threat level on the possibility of war with Iran , it might have just gone up to orange .
Barnett Rubin , the highly respected Afghanistan expert at New York University , has written an account of a conversation with a friend who has connections to someone at a neoconservative institution in Washington .
Rubin ca n’t confirm his friend ’s story ; neither can I .
But it ’s worth a heads - up :
They [ the source ’s institution ] have “ instructions ” ( yes , that was the word used ) from the Office of the Vice - President to roll out a campaign for war with Iran in the week after Labor Day ; it will be coordinated with the American Enterprise Institute , the Wall Street Journal , the Weekly Standard , Commentary , Fox , and the usual suspects .
It will be heavy sustained assault on the airwaves , designed to knock public sentiment into a position from which a war can be maintained .
Evidently they do n’t think they ’ll ever get majority support for this — they want something like 35 - 40 percent support , which in their book is “ plenty . ”
True ?
I do n’t know .
Plausible ?
Absolutely .
It follows the pattern of the P.R. campaign that started around this time in 2002 and led to the Iraq war .
The President ’s rhetoric on Iran has been nothing short of bellicose lately , warning of “ the shadow of a nuclear holocaust . ”
And the Iranian government ’s behavior — detaining British servicemen and arresting American passport holders , pushing ahead with uranium enrichment , and , by many reliable accounts , increasing its funding and training for anti-American militias in Iraq — seems intentionally provocative .
Perhaps President Ahmedinejad and the mullahs feel that they win either way : they humiliate the superpower if it does n’t take the bait , and they shore up their deeply unpopular regime at home if it does .
Preëmptive war requires calculations ( and , often , miscalculations ) on two sides , not just one , as Saddam learned in 2003 .
When tensions are this high between two countries and powerful factions in both act as if hostilities are in their interest , war is likely to follow .
It ’s one thing for the American Enterprise Institute , the Weekly Standard , et al to champion a war they support .
It ’s another to jump like circus animals at the crack of the White House whip .
If the propaganda campaign predicted by Rubin ’s friend is launched , less subservient news organizations should ask certain questions , and keep asking them :
Does the Administration expect the Iranian regime to fall in the event of an attack ?
If yes , what will replace it ?
If no ( and it will not ) , why would the Administration deliberately set about to strengthen the regime ’s hold on power ?
What will the Administration do to protect highly vulnerable American lives and interests in Iraq , Afghanistan , and around the world against the Iranian reprisals that will follow ?
What if Iran strikes against Israel ?
What will be the strategy when the Iranian nuclear program , damaged but not destroyed , resumes ?
How will the Administration handle the international alarm and opprobrium that would be an attack ’s inevitable fallout ?
If this really is a return to the early fall of 2002 all over again , then I ’m fairly sure that no one at the top of the Administration is worrying about the answers .
Postscript : Barnett Rubin just called me .
His source spoke with a neocon think - tanker who corroborated the story of the propaganda campaign and had this to say about it : “ I am a Republican .
I am a conservative .
But I ’m not a raging lunatic .
This is lunatic . ”
David Keogh , 50 , who worked in Whitehall 's communications centre , was jailed for six months at the Old Bailey for breaching the Official Secrets Act .
The researcher to whom he gave the memo , Leo O'Connor , was jailed for three months on a similar charge for passing the document to his employer , the anti-war Labour MP for Northampton South , Anthony Clarke .
The four - page memo recorded April 2004 Oval Office talks between the two leaders on events in the city of Falluja .
Its contents were so secret that much of the trial was held behind closed doors with the press and public excluded .
The judge , Mr Justice Aikens , said Keogh 's " reckless and irresponsible " actions could have cost British lives .
Ordering him to contribute £ 5,000 towards prosecution costs , Mr Aikens said Keogh , having been a civil servant for 25 years , was well aware of the terms of the Official Secrets Act .
" You decided that you did not like what you saw .
Without consulting anyone , you decided on your own that it was in the best interest of the UK that this letter should be disclosed , " he said .
" Your reckless and irresponsible action in disclosing this letter when you had no right to could have cost the lives of British citizens .
" This disclosure was a gross breach of trust of your position as a crown servant . "
The judge told O'Connor that his actions could also have placed lives at risk .
After the sentencing , Keogh 's solicitor , Stuart Jeffery , said the civil servant " took a moral stance on something that he found shocking " and said he would consider a possible appeal .
" It was never his intention to put lives at risk .
He would state rather that it was his intention to save innocent lives , " Mr Jeffery said .
The trial centred around allegations that Keogh had leaked the document to O'Connor , who in turn left a copy in constituency papers for Mr Clarke in May 2004 .
Keogh told the jury he wanted the memo to be used by MPs to ask questions in the House of Commons , and also to be seen by the 2004 US Democratic presidential candidate , John Kerry .
However , when Mr Clarke found the memo he called the police .
The jury found the pair guilty yesterday after a trial in which government lawyers persuaded the judge that the jury could only hear the contents of the memo in private .
Mr Aikens made it clear he regarded the content as being so sensitive that the press could not report what Keogh said when he was asked in open court what preyed on his mind when he first saw the document .
Keogh was said to have described the contents as " abhorrent " and " illegal " .
According to O'Connor 's statements to police , Keogh believed the memo exposed the US president as a " madman " .
Though the defendants were arrested by police special branch officers soon after the document was handed to police , they were not charged until 18 months later , in November 2005 .
Margaret Beckett , the foreign secretary , hinted that embarrassment was the real issue at stake when she signed a certificate for the court last year .
She claimed the disclosure of the document would have a " serious negative impact " on UK - US diplomatic relations .
" The ultimate consequence would be a substantial risk of harm to national security . "
The prosecution admitted the leak did not contain any " actual damage " , though it could have put British lives at risk .
Martin Howard , a senior Ministry of Defence official , said any damage to British defence operations it might have caused was " short - lived " .
The court heard that April 2004 was a particularly delicate period in Iraq .
It is known , and was widely reported at the time , that British officials and military commanders were already expressing concern about US tactics .
The British were concerned in particular about the US assault on Falluja , including the use of white phosphorous , which causes severe burns .
Peter Kilfoyle , the former defence minister , said yesterday : " There remain unanswered questions about the discussions [ between Mr Blair and Mr Bush ] about the attack on Falluja and the subsequent deaths of many hundreds of civilians . "
British military chiefs at the time were urging Mr Blair to send extra forces only on British terms , not those of the US , whose tactics they privately damned as brutal and counterproductive .
WASHINGTON , Oct. 23 — President Bush is planning to issue a stern warning Wednesday that the United States will not accept a political transition in Cuba in which power changes from one Castro brother to another , rather than to the Cuban people .
As described by an official in a background briefing to reporters on Tuesday evening , Mr. Bush ’s remarks will amount to the most detailed response — mainly an unbending one — to the political changes that began in Cuba more than a year ago , when Fidel Castro fell ill and handed power to his brother Raúl .
The speech , scheduled to be given at the State Department before invited Cuban dissidents , will introduce the relatives of four Cuban prisoners being held for political crimes .
A senior administration official said the president wanted to “ put a human face , ” on Cuba ’s “ assault on freedom . ”
In effect , the speech will be a call for Cubans to continue to resist , a particularly strong line coming from an American president .
He is expected to say to the Cuban military and police , “ There is a place for you in a new Cuba . ”
The web is nothing if not a maze of user accounts and logins .
Almost everywhere you go on the web requires yet another new set of credentials .
Unified login seems to elude us at the moment , so the status quo is an explosion of usernames and passwords for every user .
As a consequence of all this siloed user identity data , Facebook and most other web apps encourage us to give out our credentials like Halloween candy , as Dare Obasanjo notes :
On Facebook , there is an option to import contacts from Yahoo !
Mail , Hotmail , AOL and Gmail which requires me to enter my username and password from these services into their site .
Every time I login to Yahoo !
Mail there is a notice that asks me to import my contacts from other email services which requires me to give them my credentials from these services as well .
This is a deplorable state of affairs .
We 're teaching users that their credentials are of little value and should be freely handed out to any passing website that catches their fancy .
It 's an incredibly dangerous habit to inculcate in users ; it makes them far more vulnerable to phishing :
If users get comfortable with entering their credentials in all sorts of random places then it makes them more susceptible to phishing attacks .
This is one of the reasons services like Meebo are worrying to me .
The last thing we should be doing is coming up with ways to make phishing more powerful .
Phishing is a social engineering exploit so timeless , so effective , and so powerful , I call it the forever hack .
Rainbow table and brute force attacks can be defeated through judicious use of technology .
Phishing can't .
Users collect usernames and passwords like they do Pokemon .
It 's a sorry state of affairs , but for better or worse , that 's the way it is .
We , as software developers , are trusted with storing all these usernames and passwords in some sort of database .
The minute we store a user 's password , we 've taken on the responsibility of securing their password , too .
Let 's say a hacker somehow obtains a list of all our usernames and passwords .
Either it was an inside job by someone who had access to the database , or the database was accidentally exposed to the public web .
Does n't matter how .
It just happened .
Even if hackers have our username and password table , we 're covered , right ?
All they 'll see is the hash values .
Only the most grossly incompetent of developers would actually store passwords as plaintext in the database , right ?
Right ?
Recently , the folks behind Reddit.com confessed that a backup copy of their database had been stolen .
Later , spez , one of the Reddit developers , confirmed that the database contained password information for Reddit 's users , and that the information was stored as plain , unprotected text .
In other words , once the thief had the database , he had everyone 's passwords as well .
Wrong .
I 'm only a mouth - breathing Windows developer , not one of the elite Y - combinating Lisp , oops , Python developers working on Reddit .
And even I know better than that .
You might think it 's relatively unimportant if someone 's forum password is exposed as plain text .
After all , what 's an attacker going to do with crappy forum credentials ?
Post angry messages on the user 's behalf ?
But most users tend to re-use the same passwords , probably because they can't remember the two dozen unique usernames and passwords they 're forced to have .
So if you obtain their forum password , it 's likely you also have the password to something a lot more dangerous : their online banking and PayPal .
My point here is not to drag the good names of the developers at Reddit through the mud .
We 're all guilty .
I 'm sure every developer reading this has stored passwords as plain text at some point in their career .
I know I have .
Forget the blame .
The important thing is to teach our peers that storing plaintext passwords in the database is strictly forbidden -- that there 's a better way , starting with basic hashes .
Hashing the passwords prevents plaintext exposure , but it also means you 'll be vulnerable to the astonishingly effective rainbow table attack I documented last week .
Hashes alone are better than plain text , but barely .
It 's not enough to thwart a determined attacker .
Fortunately , the kryptonite for rainbow table attacks is simple enough -- add a salt value to the hashes to make them unique .
I provided an example of a salted hash in my original post :
hash = md5 ( ' deliciously - salty -' + password )
But IANAC -- I Am Not A Cryptographer .
I meant this only as an example , not as production code that you should copy and paste into that hugely popular enterprise banking solution you 're working on .
In fact , I ripped it almost directly from Rich Skrenta 's excellent post on using MD5 hashes as utility functions .
Thomas Ptacek , on the other hand , is a cryptographer , and he has a bone to pick with my choice of salting techniques .
What have we learned ?
We learned that if it 's 1975 , you can set the ARPANet on fire with rainbow table attacks .
If it 's 2007 , and rainbow table attacks set you on fire , we learned that you should go back to 1975 and wait 30 years before trying to design a password hashing scheme .*
We learned that if we had learned anything from this blog post , we should be consulting our friends and neighbors in the security field for help with our password schemes , because nobody is going to find the game - over bugs in our MD5 schemes until after my Mom 's credit card number is being traded out of a curbside stall in Tallinn , Estonia .
We learned that in a password hashing scheme , speed is the enemy .
We learned that MD5 was designed for speed .
So , we learned that MD5 is the enemy .
Also Jeff Atwood and Richard Skrenta .
Finally , we learned that if we want to store passwords securely we have three reasonable options : PHK's MD5 scheme , Provos - Maziere 's Bcrypt scheme , and SRP .
We learned that the correct choice is Bcrypt .
* editor 's note : Not quite true .
Most " modern " software does not use a modern password scheme .
Windows XP/2000 / NT , phpBB , the majority of custom password schemes ; all vulnerable to rainbow table precomputation attacks .
In summary , if we 're storing passwords , we 're probably storing those passwords incorrectly .
If it is n't obvious by now , cryptography is hard , and the odds of us getting it right on our own are basically nil .
That 's why we should rely on existing frameworks , and the advice of experts like Thomas .
What higher praise is there than that of praise from your sworn enemy ?
Let 's recap :
Do not invent your own " clever " password storage scheme .
I know , you 're smart , and you grok this crypto stuff .
But through this door lies madness -- and abominations like LMHash that have ongoing , worldwide security ramifications we 're still dealing with today .
Take advantage of whatever password storage tools your framework provides , as they 're likely to be a heck of a lot better tested and more battle - proven than any crazy scheme you and your team can come up with on your own .
Security vulnerabilities , unlike functionality bugs in your application , run deep and silent .
They can lay dormant for years .
Never store passwords as plaintext .
This feels like security 101 and is completely obvious in retrospect .
But not everyone knows what you know -- just ask Reddit .
Store the hashes , never the actual passwords .
Educate your fellow developers .
Add a long , unique random salt to each password you store .
The point of a salt ( or nonce , if you prefer ) is to make each password unique and long enough that brute force attacks are a waste of time .
So , the user 's password , instead of being stored as the hash of " myspace1 " , ends up being stored as the hash of 128 characters of random unicode string + " myspace1 " .
You 're now completely immune to rainbow table attack .
Use a cryptographically secure hash .
I think Thomas hates MD5 so very much it makes him seem a little crazier than he actually is .
But he 's right .
MD5 is vulnerable .
Why pick anything remotely vulnerable , when you do n't have to ?
SHA - 2 or Bcrypt would be a better choice .
Of course , none of this guarantees you 'll be able to prevent someone from deducing that Joe User 's Myspace account password is " myspace1 " .
But when they do , at least it wo n't be your fault .
Apple has really screwed up with the new sorting behaviors introduced in iTunes 7.3 and it ’s making a lot of people seriously unhappy .
And , honestly , I ’ve NEVER been mad at Apple for anything in my 25 + years of history with the company ( annoyed at times , but never mad ) , but the more I think about this the more pissed I get .
For those just joining the story , Apple released version 7.3 to accompany the launch of the iPhone .
Included in that release was a new , completely arbitrary rule set for sorting Artist , Album , Composer , Genre , etc tags .
Quoting myself :
Starting with version 7.3 , numbers and other non-alphabetic characters are sorted to the bottom of the list .
My default view now shows Aalborg Symphony Orchestra at the top .
2 pac now begins after the Zs and iTunes suddenly does n’t even know how to handle artists whose names begin with punctuation .
It starts !!!
after songs that do n’t have anything entered into their Artist or Album tags !
* snip * iTunes now ignores the non-alphabetic leading characters and sorts based on the first letter or number it finds in the name .
The program now treats fields that are all punctuation as if they are blank , as if they have nothing typed in at all .
And guess what else ?
It passes that behavior to the iPod .
At first , it seemed that the issue was a bug , but as revisions came out , it became clear that this new behavior was intentional .
Indeed , an Apple support document created July 11 , 2007 , explains the new scheme as if everything is hunky - dory .
The odd thing about this is that there is no rational explanation for it .
Before 7.3 , iTunes used case - insensitive ACSII as its basis .
It ’s a decades old standard that all electronic devices use .
Symbols > Numbers > Letters .
That ’s the order the entire Western world has been using for all of modern memory .
Look on any computer ’s desktop and that ’s how you ’ll see files arranged .
Hell , even the 131 - years - old Dewey Decimal System sorts numbers before letters .
Perhaps more bizarrely though , is that this behavior only appears to affect the first character in the music tags .
Playlists and second character sorting ( unless the whole field is made of punctuation ) still seem to use the ASCII method .
Say whaa ?
If you ’re going to screw up a standard , you might as well be consistent with your screwery .
Seriously , this abrupt abandoning of established convention brings Apple closer to Microsoft ’s behavior regarding standards .
Could you imagine if , on a whim , Apple suddenly changed the way Safari renders web pages to its own specifications , rather than W3C standards , perhaps in order to accommodate the iPhone ?
That ’s how bad this is .
So far , the suggested workaround is to use the Apply Sort Field command to manually restore normal sorting , a process that is cumbersome , tedious , counter - intuitive and should n’t even be necessary .
In my case , I ’d have to apply it to 150 - 200 albums and gobs of composers and I ’m not about to waste my time doing so .
Alternately , you can downgrade to iTunes 7.2 .
I am not alone in my ire .
Others in the passionate - about - iTunes community are equally upset at this development .
Here ’s some choice reactions from several threads around the net .
Code Monkey at iLounge forums :
It ’s not just a “ strange ” decision , but a downright moronic one .
First off , anybody bright enough to use a computer knows that symbols and numbers sort before alphabetical characters .
Second off , what was the whole point of introducing the ability to customize sorting in 7.2 if they were just going to turn around and bork it with 7.3 ?
GadgetGuru72 on the Apple Discussion boards :
Thanks .
I am familiar with all the suggested workarounds .
However , I should n’t have to use a “ workaround ” to get a “ 1 ” or a “ ? ” to sort before the letter “ a ” any more than I should have to use a “ workaround ” to get the letter “ a ” to sort before the letter “ b. ”
Amen to that .
Andrew Wiggins in the comments to another iLounge article :
I ’m extremely irritated that the numbers vs. letters order has changed .
This has messed up with my established order for albums that I was very pleased with .
Comment at engadget : ( sic )
WHAT ON EARTH , HOW ANNOYING they have changed the Digit order , when you sort column be accending , so all those people who had there music sorted by Artist with bands like +44 , 65 Days of Static and 30 seconds to Mars ect … will now find that in that mode they are liseted at the bottom after your XY and Z’s ( if you have any )
Thats just annoying , why the change ?
The rampaging horde at Digg :
The sorting in iTunes 7.3 is totaly screwed .
Apparently numbers now come after letters .
This was by far the most annoying thing in the update .
Brackets and parentheses are ignored in sorting , too !
WTF are they thinking ?
well , I did notice that the sorting on the iPod is the same way .
Numbers come after letters .
In any case , stupid .
The numbers after letters thing is what really gets me .
It ’s completely f’ed my entire library .
Comment at Neowin forums :
I really dislike what they did to the artist ordering .
That alone makes me want to downgrade
Comment at MacRumors forums :
The 7.3 update is what caused the error in sorting ( numbers and symbols after z. )
I was hoping the 7.3.1 update would fix it , but it sounds like it does n’t .

anyone know of a way to change this back ?
is there anything like how you can either view you contacts in address book for first , last or last , first ?
just wondering .
I downgraded my iTunes to 7.2 for the time being .
Someone ’s LiveJournal
Dear $ deity why ?
Why would they do that ?
Everybody knows its punctuation ->[ 0 - 9 ] ->[ Aa - Zz ] , anything else is heresy !
And so on .
I ’ll add more as I run across them .
For now , the only way to get “ standards compliant ” sorting back is to downgrade to iTunes 7.2 .
I ’ve done this already and until I see a version that restores standard procedure ( or at the very least offers the option of using either scheme ) , I will not be upgrading to any future version of the software .
That basically means I ’ll never buy an iPhone or any other product that requires a subsequent version of iTunes .
I ’ll probably save myself some money that way .
If you do n’t have an iPhone , I suggest that you do the same .
Download for Mac. Download for Windows .
In the meantime , though Apple ’s traditionally not very responsive to customer feature complaints , it never hurts to try : http://www.apple.com/feedback/itunesapp.html

BBC News , Washington
The rolling hills around Charlottesville are the sophisticated cradle of the Commonwealth of Virginia .
This is where Thomas Jefferson , that most famous of American Renaissance men , kept his ebony toothbrush , surrounded by his inventions , his fine French wines and , of course , his slaves .
The state of Virginia was the birthplace of eight US presidents
The town of Charlottesville itself is a gracious home to one of America 's oldest and most venerable colleges , the University of Virginia .
The town centre is more lively and funky than perhaps any other in the state .
The Playhouse is staging Harold Pinter , the Slava dance club is hosting a transvestite salsa night and , at the cinema in the pedestrian district , there is a Stanley Kubrick marathon this weekend .
But even towns like Charlottesville need a jail .
Perhaps in keeping with the sense of decorum , the Albemarle County jail is unusually pleasant .
Colour - coded
The red - brick blocks are tastefully minimalist with a nod to Bauhaus and there are neat rows of freshly planted oleander .
In the visitors ' lobby , polished wooden frames adorn the portraits of employees of the month .
There is a glass jar of boiled sweets on the receptionist 's desk .
Captain Jeanette Rush , the chief prison guard , is polite to a fault and generous about her charges .
" They 're people too , " she told us , motioning to the prisoners who shuffle through the corridors in colour - coded uniforms that immediately tell you their status .
Male inmates wear black and grey stripes .
Women prisoners wear red .
The trustees , the prison elite who qualify for special privileges like more free time and longer visiting hours , wear Guantanamo Bay orange .
Elisa Kelly is angry at what she sees as an unjust penalty
Elisa Kelly wears red .
This is hardly surprising .
She has only spent two days in jail and she still does not know her way round .
For instance , she did not know that inmates can create a mobile phone account with a designated user , necessary because jails only allow collect calls .
She was not sure about the registration process , without which she cannot receive her two visitors every month for half an hour .
But what Elisa Kelly does know is that she will be here for two - and - a- quarter years .
It is a relatively short sentence compared to the murderers and rapists with whom she paces around the narrow , pit - like courtyard once a day for 10 minutes .
You might argue that Elisa Kelly , who shares her cell with nine other inmates , is lucky , because her original sentence of eight years was slashed to 27 months after a lengthy and costly appeals process which finally hit a dead end when the US Supreme Court refused to hear her case .
But none of that matters to Elisa Kelly , who barely rises above 5 ft 3in ( 1.62 m ) , wears her blonde hair in a bun and has the muscular stature of a former physical education school teacher .
Tears
Because , even in the presence of Ms Rush , silently and sympathetically listening to our interview , Elisa Kelly vents her anger and lets the tears flow .
" It 's absurd .
It 's an injustice , " she told me with red eyes that matched her uniform .
Elisa 's crime was to hold a birthday party for her 16 - year - old son Ryan and serve his friends beer
Send us your comments
" My boys do n't just think I 'm a good mother .
They think I 'm the best mother ! "
I look over to Ms Rush , fiddling with a large bunch of bronze keys as if they were prayer beads .
She shrugs , smiles , and looks down at the grey carpet .
Elisa 's crime was to hold a birthday party for her 16 - year - old son Ryan and serve his friends beer .
As a precaution , she and her ex-husband , who is serving 30 days for bringing the alcohol onto the property , made sure that none of the kids would be able to drive home .
As they arrived at their 6000ft suburban mansion on the outskirts of Earlysville , she confiscated their car keys , put them in a bucket , barricaded the drive with her Hummer and told them to have a good time .
They were all expecting to have a sleep over and , since Elisa knew most of the kids because she had taught them at school , she did not think it was necessary to warn their parents that beer would be consumed .
A simple pleasure , but a crime if you are under 21 in the US
At about 10 pm the din of music and boys ' voices was drowned out by police sirens .
Some 30 officers with guard dogs swooped on the red - brick house in Bleak House Road .
Someone shouted " cops ! " and many of the boys dispersed into the surrounding forest .
Everyone was caught .
The young guests were breathalysed and about half tested positive .
Elisa and her husband were immediately handcuffed and led away to jail .
They both pleaded guilty .
In Virginia , like in much of the US , you can drive when you are 15 , die in the army at 17 and buy a gun at 18 .
But you cannot let beer or wine pass your lips legally until you are 21 .
On that night in 2003 Elisa knew that she was breaking the law but since she was doing so at home , she did not think that anybody would know - or care , for that matter .
She was wrong .
And now , through sobs and tears , she explains how she made a silly mistake but how her remorse is trumped by her anger at the punishment .
Selective Puritanism
The bizarre and selective Puritanism of the US is as old as the nation .
This country boasts a multibillion dollar porn industry that dwarfs the GDP of most developing countries .
The evening news is cluttered with adverts for erectile dysfunction : " If your erection lasts for more than six hours consult a physician . "
But there were howls of outrage when the singer Janet Jackson allowed her left breast to be exposed in a " wardrobe malfunction " during the Super Bowl half - time show in 2004 .
A friend of mine was lambasted by an elderly gentleman on a deserted beach in North Carolina for allowing her three - year - old son to roam naked in the sand .
The Freis too have repeatedly been criticised for consuming wine in the presence of our children .
Not that we were knocking back bottle after bottle , dribbling uncontrollably or throwing chairs around .
We are talking about a humble bottle of red , shared by two consenting adults .
With food .
Old attitude
History provides an answer of sorts .
There was , of course , prohibition .
The ban on alcohol was the only constitutional amendment ( 1920 ) that was overruled by another constitutional amendment ( 1933 ) .
Henry Ford supported prohibition because he thought that booze slowed down his car workers .
The suffragettes supported it because they blamed alcohol for the rise in domestic violence .
Much of the public supported it because many of the breweries were in German - American hands and , after World War I , beer became known as " the Kaiser 's brew " and " our worst German enemy " .
But the resulting epidemic of deaths caused by moonshine ( some 50,000 in 1923 alone ) and the rise in organised crime ( Al Capone ) eventually killed off prohibition .
And yet , the spirit of prohibition lite lingers even today .
In Washington DC , a city forever vying for the title of murder capital of the US , liquor stores are closed on Sunday .
The same is true in Virginia , Wyoming and 32 other states .
It is not just about the evils and perils of booze .
It is about the intrusion of civic America into the lives of its citizens .
The Presbyterian Puritanism of the pilgrims and the founding fathers still haunts a nation that is forever trying to live up to abstract ideals and forever failing to do so .
It is the sober side of the American dream that will keep Elisa Kelly awake at night in her crowded cell at Albemarle jail on the lush outskirts of Charlottesville .

A Polish pulp fiction writer was sentenced to 25 years in jail yesterday for his role in a grisly case of abduction , torture and murder , a crime that he then used for the plot of a bestselling thriller .
In a remarkable case that has gripped Poland for months , Krystian Bala , a writer of blood - curdling fiction , was found guilty of orchestrating the murder seven years ago of a Wroclaw businessman , Dariusz Janiszewski , in a crime of passion brought on by the suspicion that the victim was sleeping with his ex-wife .
In the novel , the villain gets away with kidnapping , mutilating and murdering a young woman .
In real life , however , Bala got his comeuppance , even though it was seven years after the disappearance of the advertising executive whose murder confounded detectives until they read the book .
The killing of Janiszewski was one of the most gruesome cases to come before a Polish court in years , with the " Murder , He Wrote " sub - plot unfolding in the district court in Wroclaw and keeping the country spellbound .
Janiszewski , said to have been having an affair with Bala 's ex-wife , was scooped out of the river Oder near Wroclaw in south - west Poland by fishermen in December 2000 , four weeks after going missing .
The police tests revealed that he was stripped almost naked and tortured .
His wrists had been bound behind his back and tied to a noose around his neck before he was dumped in the river .
The police had little to go on .
Within six months , Commissar Jacek Wroblewski , leading the investigation , dropped the case .
It remained closed for five years despite the publication in 2003 of the potboiler Amok , by Bala , a gory tale about a bunch of bored sadists , with the narrator , Chris , recounting the murder of a young woman .
The details of the murder matched those of Janiszewski almost exactly .
Bala , who used the first name Chris on his frequent jaunts abroad , was arrested in 2005 after Commissar Wroblewski received a tip - off about the " perfect crime " and was advised to read the thriller .
But Bala was released after three days for insufficient evidence , despite the commissar 's conviction that he had his villain .
When further evidence came to light , Bala was re-arrested .
The case against him , however , remained circumstantial .
Police uncovered evidence that Bala had known the dead man , had telephoned him around the time of his disappearance and had then sold the dead man 's mobile phone on the internet within days of the murder .
When Poland 's television equivalent of Crimewatch aired details of the case in an attempt to generate fresh police leads , the programme 's website received messages from various places in the far east , places that Bala , a keen scuba diver , was discovered to have been visiting at the time of the messages .
All along , Bala protested his innocence , insisting that he derived the details for the Amok thriller from media reports of the Janiszewski murder .
Sentencing Bala to 25 years ' jail yesterday , Judge Lidia Hojenska admitted that he could not be found directly guilty of carrying out the murder .
But the evidence sufficed to find him guilty of planning and orchestrating the crime .
" The evidence gathered gives sufficient basis to say that Krystian Bala committed the crime of leading the killing of Dariusz Janiszewski , " she said .
The court heard expert and witness evidence that Bala was a control freak , eager to show off his intelligence , " pathologically jealous " and inclined to sadism .
" He was pathologically jealous of his wife , " said Judge Hojenska .
" He could not allow his estranged wife to have ties with another man . "
His lawyer said yesterday that Bala would appeal against the verdict and sentence .

· William Burroughs ' accidental killing of his wife Joan while attempting to shoot a glass off her head was later documented in his novel Queer .
He wrote : " I am forced to the appalling conclusion that I would have never become a writer but for Joan 's death . "
· Thirteen years after OJ Simpson 's acquittal for the murder of his wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend Ron Goldman , his controversial account of how he would have committed the crime was published .
In a chapter entitled The Night in Question , Simpson describes his confrontation with Goldman , " Then something went horribly wrong , and I know what happened , but I can't tell you exactly how . "
· In 2001 the son of author Errol Trzebinski was murdered in a similar manner to that described in her book The Life and Death of Lord Erroll .
She believes the killing was a warning against an investigation she was conducting into the suspicious death of the 22nd Earl of Erroll , whom she believes was killed by the British intelligence services .

The Benchmark Escort Mk - I Concept is a modern interpretation of the original Ford Escort model , created with a retro-styling design language .
The author is Rajesh Kutty , an MA Automotive Design from Coventry University .
This revisited Mk - I Escort was created at Benchmark Modelmaking Ltd , UK .
The scale model has not been unveiled to the public yet .
Below we report Rajesh Kutty ‘s integral description of the project , including his considerations about the recent retro-design trends .
Retro-styling
Recently , we have witnessed a resurgence of retro-styled versions of the Mustang , the Challenger , and the Camaro to quote but a handful of cars that have been styled in this manner , with design cues taken from their elder sisters from the past .
These cars provoke our perceptions of the original ’s form and how we link it to the derivatives .
At times there may only be a thin line of difference between the past and the present , particularly in the case of the Miura or the Ford GT ( GT40 ) , which may blot the difference we perceive and hence be inclined to think them as copies of the original .
The recollection of one ’s younger glorious days , arousing the emotion and admiration one had for the cars of the past is what these ‘ retro - styled ’ cars seek to achieve .
Ford being proud of their diverse automotive heritage kicked off this recent trend of design direction known as “ The Living Legends ” , featuring such cars as the Forty - Nine , GT40 , Thunderbird and of course , the Mustang .
Each of these cars , are of course , of American origin .
The concept shown here is what could come out from “ The Living Legends ” stable on the other side of the Atlantic .
About the original Ford Escort
Roger Clark wins in his Ford Escort
Acropolis Rally , Greece , 1968 ( Source : Ford )
The Ford Escort , a small family car , originated in 1968 and evolved from what was the Ford Anglia and is in spirit , today the Focus .
The Mk - I adorned typical cues of that era , such as the ‘ Coke Bottle ’ waistline and the ‘ dog bone ’ shaped front grille and headlamps .
The Mark - I Escort was attributed to making Ford into the unbeatable rally “ force ” of the early 70s .
Due to its seemingly endless ability to be tuned and tailored to its owners needs , it was very popular amongst the “ petrol heads ” in Britain at that time .
One such “ factory - equipped ” version was the Escort Mexico with a 1.6 litre Kent engine .
This came as an outcome of the Escort ’s best achievement at that time , the 1970 London to Mexico World cup rally .
Even today , in Britain there is still a huge fan base and cult following for the original Mk - I Escort .
Benchmark Escort Mk I : Escort revisited
The car depicted here is more faithful in it ’s styling cues to the rally going original than its road going sibling , as can be seen from the bubble wheel arches , the wheels , the paintwork , netted headrests of the ‘ Mexico ’ and the number of lamps that would show the way forward .
The lower pair of fog lamps remain faithful to the car ’s predecessor and are directed outwards as was typical of the rally cars at that time .
The front grille takes inspiration from the three bar grille that its American cousins display and diverge outwards to end up as seats for LEDs of the headlamp .
During the era when the Escort was born , Ford surprisingly did not embellish its face with its long - standing logo , the blue oval .
Instead , it had F - O - R - D incorporated into its bonnet and boot lid , which has been patronized in this concept as well .
Though there is evidence of its contemporary blue oval by having it ornamented on the 20 ” alloy wheels .
One may argue crafting a retro-styled , indisputably handsome car that is evocative , comes at the cost of only so much innovation .
Arguably a differed scale and cleaned up form lacks the “ Power ” and emotive draw of the original match .
However it ’s only fair to make use of a rich heritage , in order to explore potential cues for the next in the product portfolio .
At least it would make up for those of us who never had the opportunity to be in the era when ‘ these ’ beautiful cars did exist .
Project details
This “ Revisited ” Mk - I escort has been originated , styled , designed and modelled in both CAD and 3 - Dimensional form in the U.K. at Benchmark Modelmaking Ltd .
The scale model has been completed to include “ tactile ” realisation of all details right through to the interior to fully convey the design language behind this vision .
It has yet to be displayed to the public .

Bush plans to ' create ' Iraq progress with new reports Adam Doster
Published : Saturday June 23 , 2007 Print This Email This
With the situation in Iraq deteriorating and General David Petraeus commissioned to discuss the military 's progress before more a vote on additional funding for the war in September , President Bush is busy finding ways to build political capital while abdicating himself from responsibility for any failures in the recent troop ' surge . '
According to Sunday 's New York Times , " the administration is commissioning other assessments that could dilute [ Petreaus ' ] conclusions about the impact of the current troop increase .
The intent appears to be to give Mr. Bush , who publicly puts great emphasis on listening to his field commanders , a wide range of options . "
The Bush - influenced reports will likely find that while the troop surge was a sound proposal , the Iraqi government " failed to use the troop increase for the purpose the president intended , to strike the political accommodations that he said would stabilize the country . "
This posturing could allow Bush to begin withdrawing troops slowly , both a political advantage given American 's disapproval of the boondoggle and a logistical answer to the military 's shortage of soldiers .
It will also allow him to maintain his rhetoric about staying in the fight through an American " victory . "
Some administration and intelligence officials also expect American intelligence agencies to submit their own assessment of Iraq 's progress around the time of Petraeus ' anticipated report .
As the Times writes , the papers are " expected to include a judgment about whether Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki is willing or capable of striking the kind of Shiite - Sunni political balance Mr. Bush said was the ultimate objective of the American strategy , and whether the passage of political compromises , none of which have yet cleared Parliament , have any hope of reducing the violence . "
While Congressional Democrats were anxious for Petraeus ' report , which they feel could fuel enough Republican dissent to build a veto - proof majority , the abundance of assessments may create too many contradictions .
" That is exactly what the White House sought to create last December , " the Times writes , " when it ordered other studies to offset the findings of the Iraq Study Group , led by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III and former Representative Lee H. Hamilton . "

25 Tips to Become More Productive and Happy at Work
Have you gotten into a rut at work ?
Would you like to be more engaged , satisfied , and fulfilled in your work ?
Would you like to be more productive and feel a greater sense of accomplishment at the end of each day ?
Well you can .
It just takes a desire and commitment to renew your habits and routines .
Follow these tips and you ’ll see your work life improve .
And that improvement will trickle into the rest of your life too .
Planning .
Establish a routine of planning your week and your day .
This will allow you to have your most productive week all the time .
Start your day an extra 15 minutes early to do this planning everyday .
Write down the top 1 - 3 important things you must do that day .
And most importantly , set and reach your Goals !
Use the power of intention to get there !
( This is what adds jazz to your life !
And focusing on your future helps you get through challenging times . )
Power Question .
Keep a question like this at your desk to help you stay focused : “ Am I making the most of my time right now ? ” or “ Is this the most productive use of my time ? ” Accept That You ’ll Never Finish Your Task List .
For perfectionists and overachievers this is as frustrating as a greyhound forever chasing the mechanical bunny around the track .
Get off that track .
Just make sure you work on your most important stuff first .
Let the fluff slide , not your priorities .
Turn off Your Computer .
“ What ? ! ” you say .
“ Everything is done on my computer ! ”
Well is it really ?
What percentage truly is ?
Plan to have your computer on only for that amount of time each day .
Plan out blocks of time for different computer tasks and work from a checklist to keep you focused .
Giving your eyes a rest from the screen will give you more energy for creating .
Even if you just close your eyes as you think of a response to an email can help too .
Do n’t Check Email First Thing .
Unless this is required in your job , then let it go until after you ’ve completed your top priority of the day .
And then process email in batches , say two or three times a day .
Take Breaks .
It ’s a fact that taking breaks will increase productivity .
It ’s been proven in studies .
If you need to , find someone to help ensure you take a morning and afternoon break .
Make the Most of Your Commute .
How do you spend your commute ?
Make it positive time .
Use it for reading , writing , creative thinking , creative projects , listen to audio books , or , heck , write your own book !
If you enjoy your commute , that happiness will spill over into how you feel at work .
Drop Unimportant Tasks .
Delegate or delete the non-essential items from your to - do list .
The best way to do this is to always do your most important things first .
Somehow , miraculously , extraneous things will fall away .
Transitions .
Make sure you plan in enough time between activities and appointments , and find ways to fail proof being on time .
Choose Happiness , Humor , Enthusiasm , Gratitude , Kindness , and a Positive Outlook .
Being productive and competitive in business does n’t mean that you have to be serious all the time .
Smiling does n’t mean you ’re not working hard .
Enthusiasm does n’t mean you ’re not competitive .
Being positive does n’t mean you ’re blind to challenges .
Choose to enjoy your time at work .
Find others who are like this and spread good cheer .
It ’s contagious and it grows .
Try to avoid gossip and negative chat .
It can be tempting , but it does n’t serve anyone well , including yourself .
Cultivate Compassion for Negative Coworkers .
People who are negative are that way for a reason .
They may have difficulties you do n’t know about .
Try to be compassionate and non-judging .
If you ’re a manager , people still need to meet benchmarks , but you do n’t have to dislike them if they are not cutting it .
When you encounter a negative person , you have the choice to either be affected by the negativity or to be the one who influences the other person .
It ’s a decision .
Choose to stay positive .
Instead of saying ( in your head or out loud ) “ Oh , that Suzy -Q !
Her negativity always ruins my day , ” try thinking “ Poor Suzy - Q .
She must have some difficulties .
I wish her peace .
In spite of her negativity I will try to be a positive influence around her . ”
Pace Yourself , Especially on Bad Days .
Go slow .
Do n’t be in a hurry .
Just take one thing at a time and keep moving forward .
If you ’re having a really low day , you might even want to take care of yourself by playing hooky !
🙂
Take Everything in Stride .
Deadlines , tough bosses , rude clients , slow computers .
Do n’t make them into large dramas .
Do n’t lament the challenges of the world .
Simply accept that they are there , and just keep moving forward .
Conflicts with Others .
Let your goal be “ to make progress . ”
Do n’t get caught up in trying to “ be right ” or to “ win ” the argument .
That will just slow you down .
In your mind ask yourself , “ what will move this conflict forward right now ? ”
And then get busy doing that .
Take Your Vacation Time .
Try doing something different .
If you always go on a trip , try taking a more local vacation , and really get some good rest time .
Or if you always stay local , try visiting a new place .
Variety is one of the keys to happiness .
Pick Your Battles .
Cliche , but true .
It ’s kind of like “ The Boy Who Cried Wolf . ”
When you complain or fight on everything , then your power to ask for things is diminished .
Save it up for when you really need it .
Share Your Results .
This is not about bragging , but about ensuring that you get credit for the hard work you do .
Do n’t keep quiet thinking that the right people know what you are doing .
Speak up and find ways to let the right people know how you are contributing to the success of the company .
Ask for Help .
Do n’t be afraid to collaborate with others .
Do n’t wait for your company to tell you what to do .
Think creatively about how you can work with others to generate a greater result than if you had each worked on this alone .
Face the Tough Stuff Head On .
If there is something difficult that you must do , just bite the bullet and do it .
Do n’t put it off .
Do it first thing in the day .
It ’s like jumping into a cold pool .
Just count to three and do it !
Ask for More Time .
If you are asked a question that stumps you or surprises you , never feel like you have to answer it right away .
( unless you absolutely must )
Seek more time to think about or research your answer .
Simple as this , “ I ’ll have to get back to you with an answer later . ”
This will save you from giveing an answer you will regret .
Breaking Negative Habits .
For one day , observe yourself .
Where do you face difficulties ?
With people ?
Certain people ?
Certain circumstances ?
Take notice and then later on during some quiet time , think about one or two things you would like to work on .
Set up some kind of reminder system to fail proof it , such as a simple yellow sticky note next to your computer .
Learn from Criticism .
Do n’t immediately reject critiques from others , even if you do n’t like or respect them .
Sometimes people you do n’t like may be giving you more honest feedback than you can get from others .
Do n’t take it personally .
Even if it is personal , who cares ?
Listen , process , and then decide what positive action you might want to take .
Adapt .
Adaptation is the number one survival skill of living organisms .
Those that do n’t adapt , become extinct .
In the work world , the same is true for companies , whole groups , and for individuals .
Be open to change .
Give it a chance .
Adapt to new things while using your experience to guide you , and you will have great success .
Learning and Improving .
Always be on the lookout for opportunities to learn and improve your skills .
Look for good seminars and training .
Then ask work if you can attend and will they pay for your admission .
If your company pays for education , use it !
Borrow books from your local library , the company library , or even from your boss .
Borrow some motivational audio tapes from your local library .
Keep learning to continually renew your enthusiasm .
Creative Thinking .
Is your job boring ?
If so , take some responsibility in changing that .
How can you make it more fun , more creative , more varied , etc . ?
What can you do that no one has done before ?
How could you grow enthusiasm at work ?
What is a new way that you could do old things ?
What processes could you alter to save time , work and money ?

Washington
Dick Cheney ’s craziness used to influence foreign policy .
Now it is foreign policy .
He may have lost his buddy in belligerence , Rummy .
He may have tapped out the military in Iraq .
He may not be able to persuade Congress so easily anymore — except for Hillary — to issue warlike resolutions .
He ca n’t cow Condi into supporting his bullying as he once did , and Bob Gates is doing his best to instill some common sense .
Besides ,
Cheney is running out of time to wreak global havoc ; he ’s working for a president who is spending his waning days on the job trying to prevent children from getting health insurance .
But the vice president may have hit on a devious tactic used by his old boss Richard Nixon .
President Nixon and Henry Kissinger liked to use madness as a method .
In 1969 , Nixon told Kissinger to caution the Soviet ambassador that Nixon was “ out of control ” on Indochina , and could do something drastic .
Three months earlier , as Anthony Summers wrote in “ The Arrogance of Power : The Secret World of Richard Nixon , ” “ Kissinger had sent that very same message by proxy when he instructed Len Garment , about to leave on a trip to Moscow , to give the Soviets ‘ the impression that Nixon is somewhat “ crazy ” — immensely intelligent , well organized and experienced to be sure , but at moments of stress or personal challenge unpredictable and capable of the bloodiest brutality . ’
Garment carried out the mission , telling a senior Brezhnev adviser that Nixon was ‘ a dramatically disjointed personality ... more than a little paranoid ... when necessary , a cold - hearted butcher . ’ ” All of which , his aides later reflected , was kind of true .
TWO CLEAR REASONS IMPEACHMENT SHOULD BE A BIG STORY
Polls recently revealed that roughly half the American people favor the impeachment of Bush and Cheney .
There have never been opinion polls like these : half the country , and this is without the impeachment process having even begun .
Even if there were nothing but unprecedented opinion polls like these , that would be a big story .
So , mainstream media , why are n't you telling it ?
But of course there 's more -- much more !-- than the opinion polls .
The Founders gave you , the press , freedom so that you could speak truth to power , so that you could aid a free people in protecting their freedom .
They made the press free , that is , for the very same reason that they gave the Congress the power to impeach a president : as a bulwark against tyranny .
The Constitution is a legal structure , but it is also a kind of imprint from which one can read the main danger from which they were trying to protect us , their heirs .
And this Bushite regime and its lawlessness is precisely what concerned them .
This moment , in other words , is the test for which the Founders tried to prepare us .

Ever wonder what is inside a black SUV following Bush ?
MoveOn deserves a lot of credit for getting members to this town hall meeting ... hopefully , Baird will reconsider his Lieber - stance .
The Oregonian :
For more than three hours Monday night , Rep. Brian Baird was verbally flogged by hundreds of his constituents for no longer supporting the quick withdrawal of troops from Iraq .
More than 500 people packed a high school auditorium in Vancouver while another 175 or so were unable to get inside .
And virtually everyone who got a chance to address the Vancouver Democrat were harshly critical - including several who said they had been long - time supporters and friends .
" You have just broken my heart , " said Phil Massey , a Vancouver ship 's pilot who was n't swayed by Baird 's explanation that the U.S. was finally starting to make some progress in bringing peace to Iraq .
" You have screwed up , my friend .
You have screwed up and you have to change course . "
That was two hours into the meeting and the crowd was still loaded for bear as the room broke into loud applause .
At several points in the evening , Baird simply leaned against the stage with his arms folded , his head down as he let the crowd vent .
But he also vigorously disputed several points made by the speakers and defended his independence from the Bush administration .
He insisted that he is taking the courageous path .
" The easiest thing in the world would have been to go over there ... and just say , using partisan rhetoric , ' Get out now , ' " he said .[..]
While some people left the Vancouver meeting saying they respected Baird 's sincerity , the town hall had to have been a particularly brutal experience for the congressman .
At several points , he pleaded with the crowd to let him finish his explanation .
One woman told him the blood of the troops was now on his hands , and several said he was violating the wishes of his constituents .
" We do n't care what your convictions are , " said Jan Lustig of Vancouver .
" You are here to represent us . "
Some of the angriest comments came from Vietnam veterans .
" I was part of another surge in 1968 ( in Vietnam ) , based on another pack of lies , " said Vancouver resident Bob Goss , who served in the Army there .
" I really think it 's time to get out . "

You are being hunted , chased through a labyrinth by a relentless predator .
Do you consider your options and plan the best possible escape , or do you switch off and rely solely on instinct ?
A new study provides the answer – you do both , flicking from one to the other depending on how far away the threat is .
Earlier studies have found that different parts of a rodent ’s brain are activated in the face of danger , depending on how imminent that danger is .
Now , a study by scientists at University College London has found the same thing in human brains .
Flexible defences
It would be a poor strategy to stick to the same defensive behaviours in all situations .
Simply put , there are threats and there are threats , and we need different kinds of behaviour to cope with different scales of danger .
When a predator is fifty feet away , we have the time and space to consider our options and plan an escape .
But when it ’s five feet away , such luxuries are ill - afforded and behaviour needs to be fast and reflexive .
In the millisecond between life and death , free will takes a back seat in the light of three simple options – fight , flight or freeze .
This sounds fairly obvious , but Dean Mobbs and colleagues actually watched the switch taking place by scanning the brains of several volunteers as they were being chased by a predator .
Of course , ethics committees would frown on letting a bear loose on some volunteers , so the experiment was done in a virtual Pacman - like game , where people had to flee a virtual predator through a maze .
But they were n’t completely let off the hook ; if they were caught , they received an electric shock .
Danger approaches
Using a scanning technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging , Mobbs saw that when the predator was far away , the subjects showed strong activity in the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) .
This part of the brain sits behind the forehead and is involved in planning complex behaviours , among other things .
Mobbs believes that at this point , the PFC is comparing several different strategies of avoiding the threat .
In particular , they saw high activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC ) , a region involved in processing risk and fear .
But as the predator closed in , the activity shifted to different area called the periaqueductal gray ( PAG ) .
Located deep inside the brain , the PAG is much more evolutionary ancient than the prefrontal cortex , and controls more primitive and simple responses – it ’s the fight - or - flight centre of the brain .
If the PAG is triggered in rats , the animals heart rate and blood pressure go up and they either freeze or run .
Mobbs thinks the same thing essentially happens in humans .
With death ( or shock ) fast approaching , the PAG shuts off the brain ’s complex higher functions , and primes it for a fast , instinctive response .
Emotions
A gaining predator even triggers different parts of the amygdala , the brain ’s emotional control centre .
When it ’s far away , the basolateral amygdala lit up – this region connects directly to the PFC and helps to assess the level of the threat .
As the predator neared , the action shifted to the amygdala ’s central nucleus , which connects to the PAG and helps to enact defensive responses .
This shift from planning to impulse was that much stronger when the threat of pain was higher .
If the volunteers were told they were to receive stronger shocks , their PFCs were activated to a lesser extent , while their PAGs showed higher activity .
The switch between the calculating PFC and the impulsive PAG may have saved countless of human lives over the course of history .
But Mobbs thinks it might cause others some problems .
When this careful system goes haywire , it could mean that people misjudge the severity of potential threats , and switch to instinctive mode too easily .
These malfunctions may lie behind anxiety attacks and panic disorders .

Monkeys ( and their neurons ) are calculating statisticians

Here is another example of expanding application of inkjet technology .
Last week Hewlett Packard announced that it had used its ink - jet printer cartridge technology to create a patch that releases drugs through the skin in a controlled and painless way .
The company said it has entered into a licensing agreement with Crospon , an Irish medical device developer , who will manufacture the invention and make it available to pharmaceutical firms as soon as 2010 .
Patches that deliver medication through skin has long been around , for instance smoking patches .
However they did n’t work for drugs that ca n’t be absorbed through the skin , and could only provide continuous flow of just one medication .
The new patch acts very much like a ink cartridge that squirts different colors .
It uses micro-hypodermic needles controlled by a microprocessor to deliver particular drugs below the skin several at specified doses and time .
This allows for timing sensitive medication delivery , which means it can be used for the treatment of diabetes , cardiac disease or hormonal imbalances .
The price of the patch is expected to be relatively inexpensive because it is based on the same technology that has long been employed in HP ink cartridges .
This shameless ploy reminds me of one of the most fundamental strategies recommended when you 're being attacked and can't respond effectively because the facts are simply against you .
Do n't try to respond , just attack the messenger .
By deflecting attention from the substance of what is being said , the focus moves from the issue to the character of who is sending the message .
It is a strategy that the Bush administration has employed since its beginning .
Every time the Emperor is observed walking without clothes , and that pesky child yells that the Emperor is naked , the Bush media machine ( Fox News and others ) steps in and attacks the child as being blind , or crazy , or both , or in the case of the Bush years , of being disloyal and unpatriotic .
It is not new that dissent is characterized as disloyalty .
During times of war ( that is REAL war , like World War 2 ) there was an effort to keep Americans focused on the battle , and dissent , as limited as it may be , was kept in check while our soldiers fought off the Nazi's and Imperial Japan .
Think more dramatically about after that war , when Joseph McCarthy established his drunken and reckless reign of terror on the American people , using Communism as the " War " we were fighting and using anyone who ever read a book by Karl Marx as a scapegoat .
Fast forward to today , where the " War on Terror " has replaced the War on Communism as the war de jour .
While the threat of terrorism is real , the threat of losing our democratic way of life appears to be even more real and immediate in our country today .
It was one of our great sages who observed that democracy will never be defeated from without , it will only be defeated from within .
Are we at that stage where the cancer of extremism within our country , the lack of an open , free and independent press has extinguished an honest and open debate on the issues , where our President believes he is king and not subject to the checks and balances of the co-equal branch of government we call Congress ?
Is democracy being threatened from within ?
The Founding Fathers of our country made it abundantly clear that the key to our democracy is a free and open press by which we can educate , debate and communicate our beliefs , opinions and knowledge .
Thomas Jefferson observed that we must make sure people have the necessary information to make intelligent and clear decisions and that we must do so through educating them .
And in keeping with the spirit , I 'm providing the actual quote from Jefferson to avoid being attacked as unpatriotic for suggesting we educate people as to the facts :
" I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves ;
and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome
discretion , the remedy is not to take it from them , but to inform their discretion by education .
This is the true corrective of abuses of constitutional power . "
So where are we today ?
We have a US Senate that this week could n't find the will to give our troops a respite from war by providing them the opportunity to rest and refresh back home before redeployments ( the Senator Webb amendment ) but can find the time to castigate a grass - roots organization for calling out the general on the ground in Iraq for his less than candid appraisal of the success / failure of his mission .
Is this really happening ?
Where are we when a slightly obnoxious and insolent young man asks pointed questions to former presidential candidate and U.S. Senator John Kerry about his early capitulation of the 2004 Presidential race and gets hauled away by police for asking these pointed questions ?
How well is our democracy functioning when a public institution of higher education pulls the appointment of a leading and highly respected constitutional scholar , to lead California 's newest law school after the announcement is made because he is too liberal and too outspoken in his opinions about the constitution for a cabal of influential right - wing extremists ?
Although reason and good judgment ultimately prevailed and Professor Chemerinsky will lead this new academic endeavor , how is it that we have become so unwilling to let the voices of disagreement and dissent speak ?
While many of us have strong differences of opinion on any number of issues , and clearly the level of intensity has risen as the right - wing of this country has gotten more extreme and more entrenched , it is nonetheless a nation of ideas and differences of opinion that we honor and cherish .
The freedom to speak , to debate , to disagree , to object , to challenge and to dissent are among this nation 's finest traditions .
Is it necessary to agree with MoveOn 's strategy --- with the hostile young man in Florida , with the right - wing ideologues who are still running this country and sadly the majority of our news media ?
Certainly not .
But to attempt to silence their voices because we may disagree is to let the enemies of democracy and freedom win .
Let 's face it :
The Emperor has been naked for some time .
It 's way beyond the time that we stop pretending he 's dressed in his finery .
It 's time we exercise the courage of a young child and call out the facts as we see them and insist that we be able to do so .
To be silent or allow ourselves to be intimidated into silence is not an option .
WASHINGTON , Sept. 18 ( AP ) 
The Senate unanimously approved legislation on Tuesday night that would require equal health insurance coverage for mental and physical illnesses when policies cover both .
The bill builds on 1996 legislation that lifted major restrictions on mental health coverage by adding provisions on co-payments , deductibles and length of treatment .
The House is considering a similar bill that has 270 co-sponsors , more than half the House membership .
The bill , passed by unanimous consent , moves advocates one step closer in their quest for mental health parity .
“ The passage tonight of the Mental Health Parity bill underscores our commitment to treat all patients facing all diseases with the dignity and respect they deserve , ” said Senator Edward M. Kennedy , a Massachusetts Democrat and a co-sponsor .
“ This new legislation will bring dramatic new help to millions of Americans who today are denied needed mental health care . ”

Re-inventing XMLHttpRequest : Cross - browser implementation with sniffing capabilities
Published by Sergey Ilinsky on 16th October , 2007 ( Last Updated on 17th December , 2007 )
This article attempts to summarize some experience in working with the XMLHttpRequest object by showing how to :
Implement a cross - browser XMLHttpRequest object ( to replace the existing one )
Enable interception of the XMLHttpRequest objects operations
Solve multiple browser - specific XMLHttpRequest issues
Contents
1. Re-implementing XMLHttpRequest object
Most people are aware of how to make the Internet Explorer 6.0 browser compatible to the others with respect to its support for XMLHttpRequest object .
if (!window.XMLHttpRequest ) { window.
XMLHttpRequest = function ( ) { return new ActiveXObject (' Microsoft.XMLHTTP ') ; } }
Elegant , is n't it ?
Having this code executed you could have a global XMLHttpRequest object available , which is not that different from what you would get in other browsers .
Unfortunately the instance of such a XMLHttpRequest object wo n't be a JavaScript object - the technique leaves you with a COM object !
We are interested in a real JavaScript object representing instances , so we should use a different approach - wrapping .
Wrapping the native implementation into a cross - browser object
In order to create a real cross - browser implementation of the XMLHttpRequest object and to be able later to fix native XMLHttpRequest bugs along with implementation of sniffing we should re-implement XMLHttpRequest object from scratch by defining a new object that would incapsulate the native one .
Let 's define constructor , public properties and public methods .
In the listing below there is only one property and one method implementation shown , still this should be enough to catch the idea .
// Keep the reference to earlier defined object implementation ( if any ) var xXMLHttpRequest = window.XMLHttpRequest ; // Constructor function XMLHttpRequest ( ) { this .object = xXMLHttpRequest ?
new xXMLHttpRequest : new window.ActiveXObject(' Microsoft.XMLHTTP ' ) ; } // Public properties ...
XMLHttpRequest.prototype.onreadystatechange = null ; ... // Public Methods ... XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send = function ( vData ) { this.object.send( vData ) ; } ...
This way we have a prototyped implementation of the XMLHttpRequest object .
Let 's go further and see how we could enable sniffing .
Enabling object sniffing capabilities
The implementation should be capable of transparent sniffing of all operations done on all instances of the XMLHttpRequest object .
We define custom static members on XMLHttpRequest global object ( constructor ) with names of public methods prefixed with " on " ( onopen , onsend , onabort ) plus onreadystatechange .
Whenever a method will be invoked , we will first call a corresponding static member on the XMLHttpRequest object ( if it is set ) on behalf of the instance with arguments passed into the call .
Take a look at the following piece of code .
// Static members XMLHttpRequest.onsend = null ; ... // Public Methods XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send = function ( vData ) { //
Add method sniffer if ( this.constructor.onsend ) this.constructor.onsend.apply( this , arguments ) ; // Invoke real method this.object.send( vData ) ; } ...
Now we have a cross - browser implementation of XMLHttpRequest object that also allows sniffing of its instances transparently .
Getting the XMLHttpRequest object working with FireBug
The FireBug extension for Firefox does some evil with XMLHttpRequest object by also wrapping it .
Having another object wrapped for the second time actually breaks Firebug that in its own turn breaks the page display .
The exception you would get has the following content : " win.XMLHttpRequest.wrapped has no properties "
Fortunately there is a neat trick - copy the original pointer to the wrapped object .
if ( xXMLHttpRequest.wrapped ) XMLHttpRequest.wrapped = xXMLHttpRequest.wrapped ;
Bringing XMLHttpRequest object up to the standards
So far we 've only re-implemented functionality already available in native XMLHttpRequest objects ( actually some implementations do have a more advanced API including experimental / custom members ) .
Now , if we were to fit and match our new - baked object to the standard we would only see one missing set of API : static properties ( UNSENT , OPENED , HEADERS_RECEIVED , LOADING , DONE ) .
Thanks to the fact the object is now a real Javascript object , we can easily add them .
XMLHttpRequest .UNSENT
= 0 ; XMLHttpRequest .OPENED = 1 ; XMLHttpRequest .HEADERS_RECEIVED
= 2 ; XMLHttpRequest .LOADING
= 3 ; XMLHttpRequest .DONE = 4 ;
Since we are using browser native XMLHttpRequest as the underlaying transport , our implementation is still affected by its bugs .
In the following paragraphs we will see how all of these annoying bugs can be fixed .
2. Fixing native XMLHttpRequest bugs
Despite to the fact that most of native XMLHttpRequest object implementations do not differ much in their API , they still differ a lot in their behavior .
Some implementations suffer from sever issues such as memory leak in Internet Explorer or missing readystatechange calls for synchronous requests in Gecko .
There are other minor issues as well .
In this paragraph I 'd like to highlight issues considered .
Internet Explorer : memory leak in XMLHttpRequest ( on - page )
Bug :
The instance of XMLHttpRequest does n't get garbage collected in case you have a reference to the instance or to an other COM object ( for example : DOM Node etc. ) in its onreadystatechange handler , thus producing runtime memory leaks .
This bug can easily be solved by cleaning the onreadystatechange property when the object readyState has changed to DONE .
if ( self.readyState == self.constructor.DONE ) self.object.onreadystatechange = new Function ;
Internet Explorer : memory leak in XMLHttpRequest ( inter - page )
Bug :
The instance of XMLHttpRequest does n't get garbage collected on page unload in case you have a reference to the instance or to an other COM object ( for example : DOM Node etc. ) in its onreadystatechange handler , thus producing inter -page memory leaks .
Solving this bug can be done by registering an onunload handler in which we would clean the onreadystatechange property of the request in progress .
Internet Explorer : cached document is not checked against modification date
Bug : Internet Explorer does not issue a validation request to the server if resource is available from its cache , no matter what expiration date this file was set to .
To work around the issue we will make an additional request to the server with proper " If - Modified - Since " header set in case the data was found in browser cache ( can be verified by checking the presence of " Date " field in the response headers ) .
If the server responds with status 304 ( Not modified ) , we can safely use data loaded from cache .
Gecko : missing readystatechange calls in synchronous requests
Bug :
When the request is synchronous , no readystatechange is fired .
Thanks to the fact that we have full control over XMLHttpRequest object now , we can easily simulate missing calls to the onreadystatechange handlers .
Worth noting , the Firebug also affects behavior of the native XMLHttpRequest object .
When Firebug is installed and is enabled it solves the issue partially by sending DONE readystatechange ( while still missing the other state changes ) .
Gecko : unnecessary readystatechange DONE when request aborted
Bug :
When the request is aborted , Gecko always fires readystatechange DONE .
To workaround this issue we can simply ignore the readystatechange call ( in our implementation ) made by Gecko if the abort method was called .
Gecko : Annoying < parsererror ...>...</ parsererror > documents
Bug :
If the content retrieved by XMLHttpRequest was invalid with respect to XML well - formedness , Gecko returns a DOM document with an error report wrapped instead of null .
To solve that issue , we can simply check if the documentElement of the responseXML body is " parsererror " element , and if it is , reset the property to the value of null .
// Public Methods XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open = function ( sMethod , sUrl , bAsync , sUser , sPassword ) { ... var self = this ; ... this.object.onreadystatechange = function ( ) { ... if ( self.readyState == self.constructor.DONE ) { ... // BUGFIX : Annoying in invalid XML responses if ( self.responseXML && self.responseXML.documentElement.tagName == " parsererror " ) self.responseXML
= null ; } ... } }
Internet Explorer +
Gecko : duplicate readystatechange OPEN triggered
Bug : Internet Explorer and Gecko web - browsers both issue an unnecessary OPEN readystatechange right after the send method is invoked .
Solution is simple - cache the readyState changes and only dispatch unique ones .
XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open = function ( sMethod , sUrl , bAsync , sUser , sPassword ) { ... var self = this ; var nState = this .readyState ; ... this.object.onreadystatechange = function ( ) { ... if ( nState != self.readyState ) fReadyStateChange( self ) ; nState = self.readyState ; } ... }
Internet Explorer : responseXML is not properly initialized for application / xxx+xml responses
Bug : Internet Explorer does not recognize retrieved XML document as such in case the later was served with application / soap +xml content - type .
Solving the issue is simple - let 's parse the responseText into an XML document .
if ( bIE && !oRequest.responseXML.documentElement && oRequest.getResponseHeader( " Content - Type " ) . match (/[^\/]+\/[^\+]+\+xml/ ) )
{ oRequest.responseXML = new ActiveXObject (' Microsoft.XMLDOM ' ) ; oRequest.responseXML.loadXML(oRequest.responseText ) ; }
Safari : fails sending document created / modified dynamically
Bug : Safari chokes on sending Document if it was modified dynamically , for example by setting some namespaced attribute .
The issue is fixed by manual serialization ( with XMLSerializer ) of Node passed into the send method along with setting appropriate Content - Type ( application / xml ) .
Internet Explorer : custom Content - Type overridden when sending XML nodes
Bug : Internet Explorer overrides any custom Content - Type header with " text /xml " value when sending XML nodes .
The only way to approach solving this issue is following previous bugfix - sending serialized Node with proper Content - Type set manually .
Appendix A. Usage Examples
The examples given below demonstrate normal programming techniques used by developers when working with the XMLHttpRequest object .
You can see that there is no debugging code put into the samples , however whenever the test is executed ( by pressing ' click to run ! ' button ) you can see XMLHttpRequest objects activities reported to the " XMLHttpRequest calling log " below .
This is enabled by having class handlers set to XMLHttpRequest object .
function fReport ( oSelf , sAction , oArguments ) { var oElement = document.getElementById(" log " ).appendChild(document.createElement ( " xmp " ) ) ; oElement.innerHTML
= new Date ( ) + ' - Called " ' + sAction + ' " with arguments : (' + oArguments + ' ) ' ; } XMLHttpRequest.onreadystatechange = function ( ) { fReport ( this , ' readystatechange [' + this.readyState + ' ] ' , [ ] ) ; } XMLHttpRequest.onopen = function ( sMethod , s Url , b Async ) { fReport ( this , ' open ' , [ sMethod , sUrl , b Async ] ) ; } XMLHttpRequest.onsend = function ( vData ) { fReport ( this , ' send ' , [ vData ] ) ; } XMLHttpRequest.onabort = function ( ) { fReport ( this , ' abort ' , [ ] ) ; }

This week 's cartoon : Process is relevant , as long as it produces tangible business results .
Most employees will respond to whatever measurements they are given to perform against .
If they are related to process activity , people will confine their actions within that narrow domain ; and stay away from exploring different ways to do things .
In the end , a great many possibilities for better bottom - line results will be lost .
Hint : you can click on the cartoon to enlarge it .
“ My thinking on productivity has completely changed , ” says Mr. Brynjolfsson , who is also a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research .
By tracking e-mail traffic , instant messages and other digital communications — stripped of personally identifiable information — he and other researchers are beginning to study the flow of work and ideas through the social networks inside companies — minute by minute , bit by bit .
“ We ’re really on the cusp of being able to understand what goes on inside corporations in a much more scientific way than ever before , ” he said .
“ It ’s similar to the way that the microscope opened up biology in the 17th century , so that you could see blood cells .
Now , we can start to see bits of information as they flow through the organism of the corporation . ”
The desire to exploit computing and mathematical analytics is by no means new .
In the 1960s and ’ 70s , “ operations research ” combined computing and math mainly to make factory production work more efficient .
And in that period , “ decision support ” software was intended to help managers more intelligently use information in the big computing file cabinets — databases — that were becoming common in corporations .
But the earlier efforts were limited mainly to information access and reporting systems , says Thomas H. Davenport , a professor at Babson College .
The quantity and quality of data were typically inadequate , he notes , and the software could not do the advanced optimization and predictive calculations of today ’s programs .
Faster and cheaper computing and ample sources of information in digital form — plucked from enterprise resource planning systems , point - of - sale devices and Web sites — mean that most companies now have the tools to do the kind of competitive analytics that only a relative handful of elite companies could do in the past .
“ It ’s really starting to become mainstream , ” says Mr. Davenport , co-author with Jeanne G. Harris of “ Competing on Analytics : The New Science of Winning ” ( Harvard Business School Press , 2007 ) .
The entry barrier , he says , “ is no longer technology , but whether you have executives who understand this . ”
There are plenty who do .
Big retailers like Wal - Mart Stores and Kohl ’s use today ’s advanced computing and math to more accurately predict what sizes of clothes should go to what stores .
Harrah ’s and other casinos decipher slot - machine results to optimize customer traffic and profits , and they use face - recognition software to identify people with criminal records .
And Stockholm and other cities use traffic data and patterns to determine “ congestion pricing . ”
“ This is , after all , shameful for me , ” he said of the $ 930 he receives monthly .
In response to the deaths of the first two men , the city this spring made applications available inside interview rooms , though it is still expected that the interviewer hands out the form .
It stopped short of placing them next to other forms by reception desks .
But a policy of removing recipients from the rolls as quickly as possible went unchanged .
The diarist , a former taxi driver , qualified last December after receiving diagnoses of diabetes , high blood pressure and a bad liver brought on by alcohol abuse .
He lived in a dilapidated row house whose walls and roof had partly collapsed .
Electricity and gas had been cut off .
According to city documents , the man ’s case worker began pressing him to find a job within weeks of his receiving benefits .
Tadashi Inagaki , a professor at the University of Kitakyushu who is leading a committee to investigate the three deaths , said the case worker ’s goal , in keeping with the welfare office ’s practice , was to get the man off welfare within six months .

Three months after he started receiving benefits , the man signed a form saying he no longer needed welfare .
The city said it was voluntary , but an entry in his diary belies that .
Writing that he was about to start looking for work , he added : “ I was just about to give it a try when they cut me off .
Are they telling the needy to die as quickly as possible ? ”
Takaharu Fujiyabu , a former case worker here who is now a lecturer at the University of Kitakyushu , said the city ’s 142 case workers , each handling 73 recipients , must remove five a year from welfare .
Promotions are tied to the quota , he added .
Mr. Misaki , the head of the welfare section , said that the link to promotions existed about 15 years ago but added they were no longer tied .
He said the quotas would be eliminated next year .
In his first year as a case worker , Mr. Fujiyabu recalled , a woman in her 50s , smelling of alcohol , asked for assistance .
“ I was told by my supervisor , ‘ You know , do n’t you think someone like that is better off dead ? ’ ”
Bulgaria and Mongolia Monday signed a joint declaration on strengthening bilateral military cooperation .
The declaration , signed by Bulgarian Minister of Defense Veselin Bliznakov and his visiting Mongolian counterpart Mishig Sonompil , said both countries will exchange information on security , military technology and military economy , strengthen military technological cooperation , and adopt joint measures to improve the training of their armies .
Bliznakov appreciated Mongolia 's active participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions and promised to share with Mongolia his country 's military reform experiences .
Sonompil emphasized Mongolia 's contributions to the world 's peacekeeping missions , and said his country would like to learn from Bulgaria 's peacekeeping experiences .
He said Mongolia now has 400 troops taking part in UN peacekeeping missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and 250 more in Sierra Leone .

After a recent trip to New Orleans an environmental expert was astonished to learn that Hurricane Katrina was not a powerful hurricane when it struck New Orleans in 2005
While not widely covered by the mainstream media the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) released its final data analysis in late Dec 2005 that Katrina was only a Cat 1 or 2 on landfall .
In an overview written for IPS on Jan 11/06 I wrote :
Hurricane Katrina was the worst U.S. natural or environmental disaster ever , and a new analysis of the storm by NOAA ’s National Hurricane Centre released in late December reveals some chilling , overlooked details .
Perhaps most stunning of those is that more than 4,000 people are still missing nearly four months after Katrina ’s landfall in late August .
The official death toll is 1,336 people .
But the most worrisome is that Katrina was not a particularly powerful storm on landfall .
While it was of Category 5 strength briefly while out in the Gulf of Mexico , new data reveals that its winds were in the Category 1 or 2 class when it struck New Orleans .
What Katrina did generate was an enormous storm surge topping 27 feet , sweeping inland some six miles in places .
Katrina ’s “ tsunami ” is what resulted in the flooding of 80 percent of New Orleans , and massive destruction along the Gulf Coast .
Such storm surges are bound to worsen with rising sea levels .

By incorporating the physics of black holes into a highly sophisticated model running on a powerful supercomputing system , an international team of scientists has produced an unprecedented simulation of cosmic evolution that verifies and deepens our understanding of relationships between black holes and the galaxies in which they reside .
Called BHCosmo , the simulation shows that black holes are integral to the structure of the cosmos and may help guide users of future telescopes , showing them what to look for as they aim to locate the earliest cosmic events and untangle the history of the universe .
The research team is led by Carnegie Mellon University and includes scientists from the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Germany .
The research is in press with The Astrophysical Journal .
" Ours is the first simulation to incorporate black hole physics , " said Tiziana Di Matteo , a theoretical cosmologist and associate professor of physics at the Mellon College of Science at Carnegie Mellon .
" It is very computationally challenging , involving more calculations than any prior similar modeling of the cosmos , and the result offers us the best picture to date of how the cosmos formed . "
Di Matteo performed her simulation using the Cray XT3 system at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center ( PSC ) , the most powerful " tightly coupled " system available via the National Science Foundation 's TeraGrid .
Di Matteo 's collaborators included Jörg Colberg at Carnegie Mellon , Volker Springel and Debora Sijacki at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics , and Lars Hernquist at Harvard .
Experimental observations reveal that black holes are important regulators of galaxy formation and , ultimately , the fabric of today 's universe , according to Di Matteo .
Nevertheless , previous simulations did n't take black holes into account because the computing demand was prohibitive .
" Including black holes in computer simulations is critical .
The galaxies we see today look the way they do because of black hole physics , " added Springel , junior research group leader at Max Planck .
" We must do simulations to understand the role black holes have played in forming structures of both the early universe and today . "
The largest black holes , called supermassive black holes , lie at the center of each galaxy .
They can arise initially when the first stars collapse under their own gravity .
Surrounded by dense gas in their central locations , they consume surrounding material , both gas and stars , and rapidly grow to become monstrous in size , some with masses a billion times that of our sun .
But evidence suggests that supermassive black holes are self - regulators -- they do n't feast forever and they never swallow a whole galaxy , Di Matteo said .

In her cosmic simulation , as in reality , galaxies routinely collide .
The supermassive black holes embedded at the center of these galaxies choreograph the dynamics of galaxy collision .
The result is a tremendous belch of energy produced as the merging black holes form a luminous state called a quasar .
" Quasar formation really captures when the fun happens in a galaxy , " Di Matteo said .
" You can only use a simulation to follow a complex , nonlinear history like this to understand how quasars and other cosmic structures come about . "
Di Matteo 's simulation covered multiple scales of time and space up to 100 million light years .
It was impossible to do without a powerful supercomputer .
" The XT3 is ideal for this simulation because it has incredibly fast built - in communication , " she noted .
Di Matteo set up the simulation 's initial conditions to reflect observed cosmic microwave background radiation produced at the birth of the universe .
Then she seeded the simulation with a quarter of a billion particles that represented everyday measurable matter .
For the simulation , Di Matteo used fluid spheres to represent chunks of matter such as cooling gas .
This step was essential so the investigators could calculate all the physical forces on these chunks .
She also factored in gravity exerted by dark matter , the unseen material that comprises 90 percent of the universe .
Additionally , her calculations accounted for the forces associated with various cosmic phenomena , including cooling gas , growing black holes and exploding stars .
To make the computation possible , the scientists used 2,000 processors -- the whole system -- of the parallel Cray XT3 during four weeks of computing time .
Even with this vast computing power , special techniques were needed just to be able to compute all the gravitational forces involved .
For example , a " tree " was built - up in which nearby cosmic particles lay in the same " branch " and nearby branches were linked .
By computing the forces on particles from this entire tree structure , the number of computations required was reduced by a factor of a few million to something manageable .
The results were impressive .
Di Matteo 's simulation allows a scientist to easily follow the collapse of galaxies .
She has also resolved spatial scales that range from structures inside a single galaxy to the filamentary structures that the galaxies inhabit , which are tens of millions of light years long .
" We believe that our work has profound implications for cosmology , " Di Matteo said .
" We have found that the most massive black holes early on are not the most massive black holes we see today , so simulating the dynamic evolution of these structures is critical to understanding cosmic history .
I want us to be bold enough to model the whole universe to scales observed with Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) . "
The SDSS is the largest light survey of the cosmos , which has catalogued nearly 100 million galaxies to date .
" With our simulations , we can predict what next - generation telescopes should see as they peer back 13 billion years to the time just after the Big Bang .
We should be able to answer whether we are getting the universe right with our simulations and how it evolves as we go back in time , " Di Matteo said .
Computing constraints currently hamper future work , but Di Matteo expects to run her next simulations on more powerful computers .
She is also working with faculty from Carnegie Mellon 's School of Computer Science to develop even faster ways of combining the physics of the very large with the very small in the same calculations using a set of tools called dynamic meshing .
The research was supported in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation .
I decided on a new strategy , after I was groped by two groovy young South Americans and then commented on lewdly by two Englishmen in their 50s - see , it 's just like a Benetton ad - on the same day .
Later , I was perusing the peppers in Sainsbury 's when someone hissed " Hello , sweetie " into my ear .
I turned to see a thirtysomething Middle Eastern guy with clear features and bright brown eyes , wearing a neat shirt and pressed chinos .
He must have popped out of the office to bug a woman and pick up some snacks .
" Why do you think it 's OK to harass women ? "
I said calmly , loudly .
The man froze , then a look of fear washed over his features .
He shrank like a worm .
" What ? " he snivelled , his eyes sliding to the floor .
" I did n't say anything bad ... "
" It does n't matter what you said , I did n't say that you could speak to me .
It 's not OK to whisper in a woman 's ear when she 's going about her business . "
He did n't walk away so much as dissolve , and I marvelled at my new method .
How could a compulsive irritant 's bravado be deflated so easily ?
Do they rely on their victims mutely accepting it ?
Of course there are degrees of seriousness .
On Sunday I was jogging in Hyde Park when two boys of 18 or so rode up on bikes alongside the jogger in front of me .
One of them reached out and squeezed the woman 's bottom before making away slowly with his friend .
She went rigid with shock , and stopped running .
I saw the strength drain down her into the ground as she began to shake .
I asked her if she was all right , and suggested that we run together , since the boys had come back into view and were blocking their bikes around two other women who were walking along a parallel path .
We did so , but there was no way to avoid these boys and no way I was going to let them get away with groping three women in two minutes .
As we approached I told them I 'd witnessed everything , I was going to call the police , how dare they .
The boys were well - spoken , and the perpetrator was n't afraid .
He whipped his mobile out of his pocket and tried to give it to me .
" I 'm not calling the police on your phone because they 'll think that we know each other and that it 's all a big joke , " I said coolly .
" The police are back there , I just passed them .
The longer you stick around the easier it is for me to give them a description .
There are CCTV cameras all over the park .
Ca n't you see them ?
You should leave now . "
It went on ; he was enjoying himself at first .
He knew that men who assault women get away with it .
We four joggers were walking slowly in a line , like an army , and I shouted righteous things as the boys finally edged their bikes away .
As we parted the women jokily congratulated me , their she - knight in sports shorts .
I went on ahead and then , as in a nightmare , I saw the boys again up ahead , watching me languidly .
My muscles filled with adrenaline and , fuelled by decades of rage , I began to pursue the boys like a killer cyborg - or a killer midget cyborg in bottle - end specs .
They freaked on instinct and pedalled hard but there I was , powering across the park and shaking my fist , miraculously keeping up .
It 's comical : two cycling harassers fleeing from a bionic art critic .
They were scared by the colossal , muscular force of my anger ; but what was I going to do , stand on one chap while I biffed the other ?
And once the amusement at my own ridiculousness abated , the grief returned .
The street harassment , the job harassment , the jokes , the exploitation , are all part of the same thing .
Thousands of years into " civilisation " and a woman can't even jog in peace .
It 's a shame , because endurance sports are the only thing I 'm above average at .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
TOPEKA , KS - The American Civil Liberties Union today asked the Kansas Supreme Court to reduce the sentence of a young man who is serving 16 years more in prison than he would if he were heterosexual because of Kansas 's so - called " Romeo and Juliet " law .
The law makes sexual relations with a minor a lesser crime if both people are teens , but only applies to opposite - sex relations .
" The Constitution guarantees that all citizens are supposed to be treated equally , but Matthew Limon is set to be in prison until he is 36 years old , while he would have been released before turning 20 if he were heterosexual , " said Dick Kurtenbach , Executive Director of the ACLU of Kansas and Western Missouri .
" We 're not saying the state should n't punish those who break the law .
We are only asking that the state do the right thing and treat gay teenagers the same as it does straight teenagers . "
In February of 2000 , Limon and another male teenager were both students at the same residential school for developmentally disabled youth in Miami County , Kansas .
A week after Limon 's 18th birthday , he performed consensual oral sex on the other teenager , who was nearly 15 years old - three years , one month and a few days younger .
Because Kansas 's so - called " Romeo and Juliet " law gives much lighter sentences to heterosexual teenagers who have sex with younger teens but specifically excludes gay teenagers , Limon was sentenced to 17 years in prison .
A heterosexual teenager with the same record would serve no longer than 15 months for the same offense .
After the Kansas Court of Appeals upheld the conviction in January , the Kansas Supreme Court agreed to hear the case .
The ACLU had taken Limon 's case back to the lower court after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the court to reconsider the matter in light of the Supreme Court 's decision last summer in Lawrence v. Texas , which struck down all same - sex - only sodomy laws .
" The excuses that Kansas is trying to use for sentencing a gay teen to a prison term 13 times longer than a straight teen would receive for the same offense have all been proven wrong by social welfare and public health experts , " said James Esseks , Litigation Director of the ACLU 's Lesbian and Gay Rights Project , who argued the appeal before the Kansas Supreme Court this afternoon .
" Equal protection for all citizens means that a state has to justify treating one group of Americans so much more harshly than it does others , and there is no justification here . "
In friend - of - the - court briefs filed earlier this month , several social work and public health organizations took the state to task for its attempts to justify the harsher sentences for gay teens .
In one brief , the National Association of Social Workers ( NASW ) and its Kansas chapter debunked the state 's claims that the length of Limon 's sentence is justified because young people who engage in same - sex intimacy are so impressionable that they may be swayed into becoming gay .
The NASW pointed to social science evidence that same - sex attractions surface much earlier in life - well before puberty - and that one gay sexual experience can't make someone " turn " gay .
In another brief , several public health groups , including the American Public Health Association and its Kansas chapter , the American Foundation for AIDS Research , and the National Minority AIDS Council , analyzed the state 's claims that the " Romeo and Juliet " law will help prevent HIV transmission , pointing out that the law ignores the realities of HIV transmission among heterosexuals , particularly women .
The public health groups also pointed out that the risk of a male acquiring HIV through unprotected oral sex with another male - precisely what Limon is being punished for - is extremely low .

Are U.S. History Textbooks Still Full of Lies and Half - Truths ?
Mr. Raphael is the author of PEOPLE ’S HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION , THE FIRST AMERICAN REVOLUTION , and FOUNDING MYTHS , which was just published .
It ’s been a quarter century since Frances Fitzgerald in America Revised critiqued our history texts , and a decade since Jim Loewen in Lies My Teacher Told Me revealed many of the biases that lingered on .
Where are we now ?
Have we gotten any better ?
Textbooks in recent years have certainly become more inclusive , but giving the nod to multiculturalism is not synonymous with getting the story right .
We ’ve come a long way , baby — but we have a long way to go .
In conjunction with my latest book , Founding Myths : Stories that Hide our Patriotic Past , I have reviewed twenty - two current elementary , middle school , and high school texts .
Fourteen were displayed at a recent National Council for the Social Studies convention , while eight are approved for use in California , which has among the strictest criteria in the nation .
I compared the mythologies of the American Revolution discussed in my book with those perpetuated in these texts , and the results are startling .
Although some texts fare better than others , all are culpable of some serious lapses .
Most texts do mention African American participation in the war , but they focus primarily on those who sided with the Americans .
In fact , those who sided with the British were far more numerous , but you ’d never guess it from reading the texts .
When they offer numbers , they typically compare the estimated number of black patriot soldiers during the course of the entire war ( 5,000 ) with the number of slaves who sought freedom with the British in a single week ( generally cited as 300 ) .
Likewise , current texts include some mention of the Native American presence in the Revolutionary War , but their narratives display a serious bias .
In chapters on the post - war period — right at the moment of the greatest white incursion onto Native lands in United States history — the Indian presence mysteriously disappears .
Discussions of white conquest appear earlier and later in these texts , but not at the critical point of our nation ’s founding , when it is most relevant but also most embarrassing .
The pan -Indian resistance movements of the 1780s — again , the largest coalitions of Native Americans in our history — are entirely neglected .
With nary a nod to the impact on indigenous people , the texts celebrate the ordinances of 1785 and 1787 — blueprints for westward expansion and death knells for Indian sovereignty .
In their eagerness to find female heroines of the Revolutionary War , eighteen of the twenty - two texts feature the story of Molly Pitcher .
They reify this folkloric legend into a real person , pronouncing unabashedly that she was Mary Hayes .
( The legend did not settle on a flesh - and - blood woman until the 1876 Centennial , based only on the word of a local promoter from Carlisle , Pennsylvania . )
Most texts display one of the nineteenth century romantic paintings of Molly firing her cannon .
These pictures appear old and suitably historic — no matter that these fantasies were painted in the following century .
One text shows a picture of two women soldiers , the first wearing a long dress and the second clad in modern military fatigue .
The captions read , “ Past : Molly Pitcher ” and “ Present : Women marines served in the Gulf War . ”
More than we would like , our texts are based on warmed - over tales of the nineteenth century such as Patrick Henry ’s “ Liberty or Death ” speech ( written by William Wirt in 1817 , forty - two years after the fact ) and Paul Revere ’s Ride ( popularized in 1861 by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow , who distorted every detail of the event to make his story better ) .
Although many historians know better , these stories work so well that they must still be included , regardless of authenticity or merit .
More of the myths are perpetuated in elementary and middle school texts than in AP high school texts , but this raises a troubling question : why are we telling children stories that we know to be false ?
Worse yet : why do we give these tales our stamp of approval and call them “ history ” ?
Of all the texts , the one that perpetuates the most untruths about the American Revolution —
I found a whopping seventeen — is Joy Hakim ’s immensely popular , A History of US .
This is no accident .
Hakim is a masterful storyteller , and she has based her account on how stories play to young readers , not on whether they are true .
How do textbook writers deal with advances in modern scholarship that disprove , or at least deconstruct , the myths ?
In 1996 , David Hackett Fischer published his remarkable deconstruction and reconstruction of Paul Revere ’s Ride .
Fischer showed that Revere was not such a solitary hero .
Instead , he was part of an intricate web of patriots who rode horses , rang bells , and shot guns to sound the warning .
Fischer ’s book was so popular that textbook writers had to deal with this new information : Revere was not alone , they now admit — William Dawes ( and sometimes Samuel Prescott ) rode as well .
They water down the legend , but they do not embrace the real impact of Fischer ’s findings : the mobilization of April 18 - 19 , 1775 , was a truly collaborative effort involving an entire population .
In 1997 , Pauline Maier published a book of equal import , American Scripture .
Maier uncovered ninety state and local “ declarations of independence ” that preceded the congressional document .
The consequence of this historical tidbit is profound : Jefferson was not a lonely genius conjuring his notions from the ether ; he was part of a nation - wide conversation .
Again , textbook writers have watered down the legend while missing the main point .
While many textbooks now state that Jefferson was part of a five - man congressional committee , but do not mention a word of those ninety documents produced in less famous chambers .
Some say these myths are harmless — what damage can stories do ?
Plenty .
They change our view of historical and political processes .
Myths that celebrate individual achievement mask fundamental truths of great import .
The United States was founded not by isolated acts of heroism but by the concerted revolutionary activities of people who had learned the power of collaborative effort .
“ Government has now devolved upon the people , ” wrote one disgruntled Tory in 1774 , “ and they seem to be for using it . ”
That ’s the story the myths cover up .
Consider :
In 1774 common farmers and artisans from throughout Massachusetts rose up by the thousands and overthrew all British authority .
In the small town of Worcester ( only 300 voters ) , 4,622 militiamen from 37 surrounding communities lined both sides of Main Street and forced the British - appointed officials to walk the gauntlet , hats in hand , reciting their recantations thirty times each so everyone could hear .
There were no famous “ leaders ” for this event — the people elected representatives who served for one day only , the ultimate in term limits .
All final decisions were made by “ the body of the people , ” and the people decided that the old regime must fall .
Similar transfers of power were repeated in every county seat outside Boston .
By early fall — half a year before Lexington and Concord — British rule had come to an end , both politically and militarily , for 95 percent of the inhabitants of Massachusetts .
On October 4 , 1774 — twenty - one months before Congress would approve the Declaration of Independence , the people of Worcester proclaimed that the old constitution was dissolved and they should begin to form a new one , “ as from the ashes of the Phenix . ”
Why is this momentous story not part of the core narrative of the Revolution ?
It used to be .
Mercy Otis Warren , a patriot who wrote one of the early histories , called the 1774 rebellion “ one of the most extraordinary eras in the history of man . ”
Other early historians covered the events in some detail .
But then came the myths .
“ The shot heard round the world ” ( Emerson , 1836 ) told us the Revolution started at Lexington and Concord , effectively muzzling the one that came before it .
The Sam Adams myth ( first perpetuated by his Tory opponents , and not adopted by most Americans until the mid-nineteenth century ) said that all revolutionary actions in Massachusetts emanated from a single mastermind ; since Adams was not present at the rural rebellions , nothing possibly could have happened .
Paul Revere ’s Ride ( Longfellow , 1861 ) said that farmers had to be awakened from their slumbers by a man from Boston , even though the farmers themselves had already staged a revolution and spent six months arming themselves to defend it .
The myth that Jefferson was responsible for the ideas in the Declaration of Independence ( started by his political supporters ) hid the fact that people from the hinterlands of Massachusetts were ready to go that route long before .
The end result : not one current textbook chronicles the first overthrow of British rule .
How strange that the story of any revolution can be told without at least a mention of the initial overthrow of political and military authority .
In short , real history gets lost , much of it very important :
The Valley Forge story , developed during the prelude to the war of 1812 , effectively conceals the harder times soldiers had to face two years later at Morristown — the coldest winter in 400 years — and the mutinies that ensued .
That story receives no mention at all in twenty - one of the twenty - two texts .
“ Do not fire till you see the whites of their eyes ” insinuates that Revolutionary warfare was all close combat ; in fact , most killing then , as now , was done from afar .
“ The final battle at Yorktown ” masks the war that continued after ( there were more American deaths after Yorktown than in the first year of the war ) and the global nature of the conflict ( later , the British finally conceded defeat because they were also fighting France , Spain , and Holland in the West Indies , the North Sea , the English Channel , Gibraltar , the Mediterranean Sea , the Cape of Good Hope , India , and the East Indies ) .
None of this appears in any of our current texts .
The reasons that nineteenth century mythologies are still perpetuated in twenty - first century texts are deeply rooted in both narrative structures and American nationalism .
I discuss these at greater length in Founding Myths .
There too , I undertake a more thorough deconstruction of the particular stories : how , when , and why each was created , and how each masks real history .
On my website , rayraphael.com , I give a page - by - page critique of the founding mythologies in each text .

I support the above call for statistics , and on the text texts specifically .
I checked the oldest ( 1924 ) U.S. history textbook , on my shelf - a volume designed for 8th graders .
Written during World War I , it is full of patriotic fervor : stanzas from Oliver Wendell Holmes on the Boston Tea Party , Emerson on Lexington , eight lines from Longfellow beneath a painting of a galloping Paul Revere , etc .
And yet :
There are five distinct mentions of Patrick Henry , from his 1765 anti-stamp tax speech to his opposition to the constitution in 1787 , in this 500 plus page book , but the " Liberty or death " speech appears nowhere .
Maybe our problem is that we need to rely MORE on the ( better quality ) standard textbooks and less on teachers ' faulty memories or expensive gimmicks such as computer graphics .
Richard Newby - 12/23/2006 Ray Raphael mentions Professor Loewen 's book " Lies My Teacher Told Me " in his first paragraph on history textbooks and the American Revolutionary War ( Are History Textbooks Still Full of Lies . . . ?
Let me quote from page 232 in Loewen : " It is even possible that the FBI or the CIA was involved in the murder of Martin Luther King , Jr. " Raoul ' in Montreal , who supplied King 's convicted killer , James Earl Ray , with the alias " Eric Gault , " was apparently a CIA agent .
Certainly Ray , a country boy with no income , could never have traveled to Montreal , arranged a false identity , and flown to London without help .
Despite or because of threse incongruities , the FBI has never shown any interest in uncovering the conspiracy that killed King . "
In July 2002 I emailed my criticism of this passage to Professor Loewen .
My e-mail of July 16 was answered by Professor Loewen on July 18 .
Professor Loewen 's response is far off the mark .
Professor Loewen twice acknowledged to me that he has not read Gerald Posner 's book " Killing the Dream . "
Loewen 's analysis of King 's assassination on page 232 is a dandy topic for research .
I had 16 - year - old students in the 60s who would have pounced on this topic .
With zest !
Mark A Montgomery - 9/26/2006
I enjoyed this article very much .
I learned a lot about some of my own blind spots in US history .
I am equally concerned about the content and structure of textbooks in our public schools .
We do n't pay enough attention to their instuctional design , either .

You can't trash the textbook too often without the students wondering what it was assigned for .
Yes , you have to correct for biases , omissions and distortions , and god forbid you should just go over the text in class the way some students want you to , but the better the textbook the better the overall experience .
Text and lecture should be complimentary , not competing with each other .
John Guy Fought - 6/4/2005
Although the proportion of rifles to ( smoothbore ) muskets in the hands of militiamen seems to have varied regionally , I think you are both underestimating the number and distance of hits and misses by omitting this factor .
Also , 45 seconds seems a bit slow unless you are speaking of volley fire .
Civil
War reenactors manage three aimed shots per minute .
As for bayonets , I suggest that their main use in combat in those days was in fending off or discouraging cavalry attacks on infantry .
chad faulkner ryan - 12/6/2004
All text books are written by a variation of one to a dozen different authors .
Many of which happen to be self involved know it alls that beleive they have the only correct information .
Not all , just a select few .
A great deal of these texts make a valiant effort to convey the most reliable and proven information , and they usually do a decent job .
The fact is that with the availability of information on the internet it is easy to see how small facts or folk tales can be misinterpreted .
When every author of a new history text book wants to put his special mark in he may jazz up a story or elaborate on a statistic .
The human error will always come into play when texts are involved .
Authors always include their opinons in what they write .
Whether it is intentional or not , the authors beleifs are always between the lines .
This bias can greatly alter the composition of the text .
When it comes to an American history book , the author could be extremely patriotic and portray the past the way he sees it .
He could see westward expansion as the great manifest destiny , while someone else may see it as the murder of the indian nation .
Human error and opinon cannot be avoided in texts .
Val Jobson - 9/28/2004
The rugged individualist myth works better in the movies , whether he 's the good guy or the bad guy .
Remember the ads for the movie " The Untouchables " which depicted Al Capone as one man who terrorized an entire city ?
I did a small amount of research after seeing the movie [ no Internet then ] and learned two facts ; 1 . Frank Nitty , the hit man who gets thrown off the roof in the movie , was in fact one of two men who took over leadership of the mob when Capone was jailed .
2 . In the movie Capone smashes a man with a baseball bat and everyone else sits there in shock and fear ; in reality , he led a group of men who all beat two men to death .
The point is that the mob had continuity and it acted as a group .
Demonizing and removing the leader does not mean you have cleaned up the whole mob .
Andrew D. Todd - 9/25/2004
A fair amount can be discovered about ancient climates .
It works out to measuring tree rings , digging up and analyzing pond sediments , stuff like that .
In the case of human bones , starvation episodes during childhood leave a kind of " tree-ring , " the Harris Line of Growth Arrest .
Stephen M Garcia - 9/25/2004
There is much in this article to give one pause .
- The 90 earlier Declarations of Independence
- The five man team to write the DOI
- The 1774 defacto overthrow of the British rule in Massachusetts
- The network of now - unknown people who contributed efforts , far beyond what I had known
I AM impressed with all this .
It is , I agree with the author , important to know that it was NOT the lone small broup or even individual .
The myth of the rugged individualist as archetype or resident genius turns instead into an anarchism of whole communities .
A conpiracy theorist might say , " THAT might just be the lesson someone might not be too crazy about the kids learning about " .
That is a book I would love to read through .
. . and to have my kids and grandkids read as well .
Stephen M Garcia - 9/25/2004
Having been adept at mathematics , I agree , you cannot start with the calculus ( Newton 's fluxions ) .
But history is quite a bit different .
Was there any single point in what the author wrote in this article that a typical 5th - grader ( maybe even a 4th - grader ) could not understand ?
Math may at times be rocket science , but history - to understand what this author is talking about - certainly is not .
Nothing he has stated are confusing to non-advanced students .
Are you , sir , advocating that the schools start out teaching that 2+2 does not equal 4 , as preparation to the day when they can handle the complexities of the true history ?
In what manner do untruths lead the young mind to higher truths ?
Color me perplexed why it would be disadvantageous to teach what really happened - especially when the facts in themsleves in many cases are as fascinating as the myths ?
Vernon Clayson - 9/24/2004
Speaking of lies and half - truths , why should history texts be any different than today 's media reports and the everyday statements by politicians ??
( I also take exception to the mention of the coldest winter in 400 years at Morristown in 1814 , who kept the records in the area that became Morristown in 1414 ? )
Mr. Raphael 's version of history is fine for advanced students but the " myths " he mentions are at best an introduction to beginning students , one has to start somewhere and these young people will grow in the subject .
They do n't start mathematics with methods of the calculus or the sciences with DNA research .
William R. Clay - 9/21/2004 Mr. Lederer ’s analyst of combat closeness during this time period is well done .
It took an extremely well trained army of riflemen ( an admittedly incorrect term for the revolutionary period ) to concentrate fire and maintain it in any volume or accuracy while under return fire .
Over the intervening years the distances in which death could be dealt has indeed increased .
In fact , one could say now that a killing blow could be administered from the other side of the globe with the mid-20th century development of intercontinental ballistic missiles .
That being said the actual range of combat for a rifle platoon today is still far closer than what you might expect .
Let me put it this way , the bayonet is still a valid military tool in the 21st century .
If one is in doubt about the range of combat today , read into the urban firefights in Iraq during the so - called active part of the invasion .
It does n’t get more up close and personal than that .
Ben H. Severance - 9/21/2004
While I agree that textbooks often oversimplify or even overlook some important issues , the textbook should not be the central learning device in the classroom .
The instructor 's lectures should be the principal means of imparting knowledge .
If a textbook provides only cursory coverage of a topic that the instructor considers crucial , then let the instructor address that in class .
Ray Raphael seeks a perfect textbook .
What then is the need for a teacher ?
Besides , the author is overly harsh .
There are many fine U.S. textbooks that competently cover the main people and events and themes of American history .
Regarding the comment about combat from afar or up close , I echo the complaints of John Lederer .
John H. Lederer - 9/20/2004
“ Do not fire till you see the whites of their eyes ” insinuates that Revolutionary warfare was all close combat ; in fact , most killing then , as now , was done from afar .
===================
I am curious whether there is support for this ?
In general military history shows a long term trend for combatants killing range to increase with time .
Artillery , the great killer of today ( possibly about to be supplanted by air ) is generally thought to have first become significant in the Napoleonic wars , small arms fire in the American Civil War ( rifling and the minie ball were the two critical technologies ) .
The effective range in combat of smoothbore muskets is generally thought to be under 100 yds .
My own experiments suggest that this is optimistic for other than expereinced , trained troops .
Flintlocks require substantial discipline and training for accuracy as there is a substantial period of time between trigger pull and actual exit of the projectile during which the shooter must remain on target .
There are a number of accounts of numbers of troops volley firing in combat at individuals at quite close range and missing .
The following are approximate rates of advance for troops :
walk ( slow with time to dress ranks ) = ~ 12 seconds for ten yards
walk ( quick march ) =~ 6 seconds for ten yards
run ( charge ) = ~ 2 - 3 seconds for ten yards
The effective rate of aimed volley fire for a flintlock musket is about 45 seconds .
As one can see , there are attractions to one short range unhurried volley rather than one long range and one hurried short range .
The military literature of the era is replete with admonitions to hold fire till short range .
The worst situation is to shoot at too long a range and then not be able to get off a second shot .
Some attribute accounts of troops fleeing before contact to a number of individual calculations by soldiers that would not be reloaded in time .
Diminution of fire is a second problem .
Mechanical failure ( the flint is a notriously weak element of a flintlock ) and operator error are quite common .
One observer in the Civil War describes a second volley at Bull Run as looking like archery fire at Agincourt for the number of ramrods sailing across the battlefield from the fire of inexperienced troops ( General Bee was killed by one of these ramrods ) .
The " raggedness " so frequently described for a second volley may weel be caused by the inability of many to successfully reload and refire .
Are there any statistical accounts of wound types in the American Revolution ?

How to Work Extremely Hard and Get Nothing Done
Do you ever have a flash of inspiration , stayed up all night working on your idea only to see it ’s brilliance fade away the next morning ?
My computer is littered with projects like these , so many in fact that I ’m almost an expert at working hard and getting nothing done .
Running Standing Still
It can be quite an overwhelming feeling actually , having a dozen partly finished projects sitting around waiting to be completed .
The idea behind them is still good but I start to doubt whether they ’re worth the time I ’m putting in or whether they ’ll be successful or not .
As one loses steam , I hop to another .
I can literally work until the break of dawn every night for a whole week and come to Saturday having brought closure to zero projects !
In terms of productivity , often times I ’m my own worst enemy .
Having bursts of ideas is better than having no ideas at all but it makes staying focused an extremely difficult thing to accomplish ; I guess you could call it web ADD .
Chasing multiple ideas at a time has several negative consequences :
Thrashing
Think of when you ’re trying to do twenty things at once on your computer .
Your PC slows down as it tries to share its finite CPU and memory across the multitude of tasks .
Instead of being more productive by multi-tasking , you end up waiting on the computer and getting less done .
The same thing happens with people , namely me .
I ’m spending so much energy organizing my time for projects and worrying about which to work on , I do n’t get much done .
Sub - Par Performance
Seth Godin has a book out that I should probably read called The Dip : A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit ( and When to Stick ) :
According to bestselling author Seth Godin , what really sets superstars apart from everyone else is the ability to escape dead ends quickly , while staying focused and motivated when it really counts .
Winners quit fast , quit often , and quit without guilt — until they commit to beating the right Dip for the right reasons .
I listened to a conference call with Seth and Andy Wibbels when he released the book and from what I gathered , he says if you ca n’t be the best at what you ’re doing , quit and pursue something you can excel in .
It ’s hard to be the best when you ’re working on ten things at once .
You may not even complete them all and the ones you finish you only turn in a mediocre showing .
Why do I work so hard for a lot of sub - par output when I could spend the same amount of time creating one thing that ’s awesome ?
Poor Return on Effort
Time is money .
Since I ’m working on so many projects at once , it takes forever to finish one of them .
While the many projects are sitting idle , the time I invested in them is lying there with no return on effort .
I ’ve sunk a lot of sweat equity into tasks that may potentially never see the light of day .
Making a Change
Okay , so I know I have a problem , what should I do about it ?
I obviously need to make a prioritized list of all my projects and make a decision for each one : Drop it , Delay it , or Do it .
Drop Project
These are projects that just do n’t make the cut .
It will be tough getting rid of ones I ’ve already invested a lot of time into but if I do n’t drop them now , I ’ll never get anywhere .
Delay Project
I ’ll just put some projects on the back burner for now .
These are ideas I think could be successful but I just do n’t have time to work on .
Maybe down the road once I ’ve finished several active projects things will click and these can come back to life .
Do Project
Finding the right number of projects to put into this category will be difficult .
Obviously just one would allow me to focus all my energy but sometimes it ’s nice to have at least two things on my plate to prevent getting stuck in a rut .
When I hit a wall with a project , I like to be able to switch over to something else for a change to get my creative juices flowing again .
Hmmm , what ’s the magic number ?
I have to remind myself that working my fingers to the bone for progress is n’t my only option .
If I have a project that really has potential there are other ways to get it done with less concentrated effort .
Launch in Beta
I could just take a project I ’m in the middle of and launch it as is .
I guess with Web 2.0 you just do that and call it Beta : )
The good thing about this approach is that I could get a feel for what kind of response I ’d get before sinking any more work into it .
I could garner feedback , then make adjustments as necessary .
Of course , the downside is someone ’s first visit may be their last if they do n’t like half - finished .
Hire Help
I was talking with a friend the other day and made the comment “ I wish there were 48 hours in a day ” .
“ There are ” , he said .
“ Just hire someone to do 24 hours worth of work for you . ”
I ’ve never listed a job on eLance before but will do so soon .
Find Partners
I ’ve actually already done this .
I went in on a site with a friend where I ’m the idea / technology guy and he ’s the subject matter expert with industry connections .
Sadly , I ’ve neglected the site for the last few weeks due to another new partnership but need to get back in the saddle .
The new venture is really more of an apprenticeship with a successful internet entrepreneur that I ’m really excited about .
I ’m helping him create a site and he ’s teaching me his tricks of the trade .
Nothing like learning from someone else ’s experience instead of having to learn from your own mistakes .
Working with a partner really helps divide up the workload and generate great new ideas .
I need to find partners for the other ideas I decide to pursue .
Getting Things Done
I ’m tired of working extremely hard and getting nothing done .
I think I have a pretty good initial plan in place , we ’ll see how it goes .
Hopefully I ’ll get more done in the same amount of time , maybe even by working less .
What techniques do you use to control your flood of ideas and choose the best projects to work on ?
A study reported in the August 1 , 2007 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute concluded that men who consume more cruciferous vegetables , particularly broccoli and cauliflower , have a lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer .
The cruciferous family of vegetables , which also includes cabbage , kale , and Brussels sprouts , has been associated in previous research with protection from colon , breast , prostate , thyroid , cervical , and other cancers , as well as with slower disease progression .
For the current study , Victoria Kirsh , PhD , of Cancer Care Ontario in Toronto and colleagues utilized data from 29,361 men participating in the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial .
Over the 4.2 year average follow - up period , 1,338 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer , including 520 with aggressive disease .
Dietary questionnaires completed by the participants were analyzed for the association of fruits and vegetables with prostate cancer risk .
While total fruit and vegetable intake was not found to be related to prostate cancer risk , higher intake of dark green as well as cruciferous vegetables was found to be associated with a lower risk of the disease , particularly that which was aggressive and had spread beyond the prostate .
Broccoli and cauliflower had especially strong protective associations against aggressive and extraprostatic disease .
Men whose intake of broccoli was greatest , at more than one serving per week , had a 45 percent lower risk of extraprostatic disease cancer than men whose intake was least , at less than once per month .
Cauliflower was associated with an even greater benefit , with a 52 percent reduction in risk experienced by men who consumed the vegetable more than once per week .
The gluocinsolate - derived compounds contained in cruciferous vegetables modify cancer risk by protecting cells from DNA damage , inducing apoptosis , influencing genetic expression , and inhibiting !
prostate cancer cell proliferation .
“ Aggressive prostate cancer is biologically virulent and associated with poor prognosis .
Therefore , if the association that we observed is ultimately found to be causal , a possible means to reduce the burden of this disease may be primary prevention through increased consumption of broccoli , cauliflower , and possibly spinach , ” the authors conclude .

It might sound like a scene straight out of the Jetsons , but a Massachusetts company is developing a small airplane that can land , fold up its wings and drive down the highway .
Terrafugia Inc. , a company founded three years ago by graduates from the Massachusetts Institute of technology ( MIT ) , is in the process of building a prototype of The Transition , a 19 - foot , two - seater the company describes as a roadable light - sport aircraft .
And it 's focused on building something that can take to the roads as easily as it takes to the skies .
" We 're not going to have a flying car , as people think of it , for a while , " said Anna Dietrich , chief operating officer of the Woburn , Mass . - based company .
" I would never say it 's not going to happen , but today the infrastructure is not there , nor is the training , nor are the avionics that would make the training unnecessary ...
What makes sense right now is a roadable aircraft . "
Dietrich said the idea of a such a vehicle , which has an anticipated price of US $ 148,000 , is what fired up their imaginations and pushed them to found the company .
The problem , however , is that the U.S. does n't have the infrastructure in place to make roadable planes a viable alternative yet .
There are roads , not runways , in front of houses , grocery stores and office buildings .
And a sky filled with people who do n't have pilot 's licenses could be problematic .
" You have to be a pilot to fly The Transition , " said Dietrich .
" And we just really do n't have the technology to have an autopilot built in so people can just get in it and say , ' Fly me to the grocery store . '
It 's an airplane designed to be flown by a pilot in the infrastructure we already have , which is the airports . "
She added that there are about 6,000 public airports in the U.S. , and most people are , on average , within 20 miles of one .
The idea , she said , is to take advantage of this under- utilized infrastructure .
A pilot can fly into a small airport , and instead of getting a rental car or waiting for a taxi to drive out to a rather remote spot , he or she can fold up the wings on the aircraft and simply drive off .
Foldable wings , though , may not give some passengers a feeling of safety when they 're 10,000 feet in the air .
Dietrich said making sure the wings stay erect while in the flight was one of their biggest design challenges .
" We tackled that one first , " she added .
" There are a number of interlocks in place , some electrical , some mechanical .
To activate the mechanism that folds or deploys the wings , you have to be on the ground .
There are sensors that tell the plane if you are on the ground .
The engine also needs to be off .
And you have to enter a personal identification number that only the pilot knows ...
We built a lot of safety mechanisms into this . "
Terrafugia executives expect the prototype to be completed sometime in 2008 and the first production model to be delivered in 2009 .
Dietrich said once they 're in the manufacturing phase , they 'll slowly ramp up to full - scale production by 2011 or 2012 .
Dietrich noted that they 've received advanced orders for 30 to 50 Transitions already .

Matzにっき 経由で 、RubyForge : RubyTraits 。
Traits というのは、 Black 、Schärli らにより 2002 年頃に提唱され 、Squeak Smalltalk を使って実験的な実装が行なわれていた新しい多重継承機構やそのためのエンティティ（trait）のことです。Squeak Smalltalk では 3.9 から組み込みになりました。RubyTraits は、この Squeak Smalltalk の Traits の Ruby 版です。なお、ここで多重継承は広い意味で、以下でミックスインは狭い意味で使っています。念のため。
まず 、Traits について。最近わかってきたのですが、どうやら
Traits は、それを備えた言語が動的か、静的か、で説明の仕方やそこから受ける印象がかなり変わるようです。Smalltalk や Perl6 （Roles） （追記 ：Perl6 の Roles は、説明や実装はどちらかというと後者寄り…？）
、 Ruby の場合、トレイトはクラスなどに脱着可能なメソッドの集合と紹介され、コンフリクトを回避するためのトレイト間の合成機能がフィーチャーされます。このとき
Traits は、従来のクラス（や 、Ruby のモジュールを含む擬似的なクラス）を用いたミックスイン機構が抱える問題を克服するために考え出された新しい機能であるといった印象をうけます。
他方で 、Fortress や Scala では、トレイトはメソッドを含めることができるインターフェイスのようなものであると説明されます。これだと、対抗馬というよりはまるで静的言語向けの
Ruby のモジュール様機構そのものであるような印象を受けます。ミックスインに対して云々よりは、クラスやインターフェイスの役回りの一部を肩代わりする新顔といったふうです。実際、静的言語での
Traits の実装では動的言語向けにはない継承パスへ参加する振る舞いがあったり、トレイト同士の合成機能を欠いているなど、Ruby のモジュールとも区別をつけにくくなっているように感じます。
あと関係ないのですが、そもそも「 trait」という言葉自体、「特性、特色、特徴」という意味を持つ都合、古くは
XEROX の Star システムの多重継承機構、C++ のイディオム、比較的歴史の近いところでも
SELF のクラスに当たるオブジェクトの呼称（trait）などに使われていてまぎらわしいので、この点でも注意が必要です。
さて本題 。RubyTraits 0.2 では pure - traits と ruby - traits の二つの実装が提供されています。前者は Schärli らのオリジナル の Traits の振る舞いを模したもの。後者は Ruby ユーザーのメンタルモデルに合わせ て
Traits の仕様のいくつかを改変した（つまりモジュールっぽい挙動をさせる）もののもよう。まずは
Squeak Smalltalk で使い方が分かっている前者を試します。
追記（注意） ：
以下では簡単のためトレイトやそれを use したクラスの定義式 は 「 Trait named : # T 」 、「 Object subclass : # C uses : T」のように略記していますのでそのままでは実行できません。実際にトレイト
T を定義するために は「 Trait named : # T uses : {} category : ' Category - Name ' 」 、また、トレイ ト
T を use したクラス C の定義に は「 Object subclass : # C uses : T instanceVariableNames : '' classVariableNames : '' poolDictionaries : '' category : ' Category - Name ' 」といったような式をどこか（通常はワークスペースですが、Squeak環境の場合は文字が入力できる場所であればどこでもＯＫ）に入力して選択後（独立行なら選択は不要）、do it ( alt / cmd + d ) する必要があります 。
また、 「 クラス名もしくはトレイト名>>」というのは、そのメソッドが定義された場所を示すための便宜的な記法で
Smalltalk の構文ではありません。 「>>」より後がそのメソッドのソースになるので「>>」直後より後のメソッドの定義コード部分を選択してコピーし、ブラウザにペーストしコンパイルするなどして定義してください。クラスブラウザやその他の便利ツール群の使い方は「自由自在
Squeakプログラミング」などのチュートリアルを一読されることを強くお勧めします。クラスブラウザを使いたくない場合は、メソッド定義コード部分を文字列引数にして与えた「T compile : ' hoge ^'' T#hoge ' '' 」 などといった式を do it ( alt / cmd + d ) することで定義できます。その際、コード中のシングルクオートはエスケープ（シングルクオートを二つ重ねる）する必要がある点にも注意してください。なお初回のコンパイル時、イニシャルを要求されることがありますので適当に与えてやってください。言い訳ですが、この手の情報はここに書き始めると長くなるのでこのブログでは省略していることがよくあります。分かりづらくてすみません。^^ ;
▼メソッド #hoge を定義したトレイ ト T をクラス C で use Sqeuak Smalltalk Trait named : #T T >> hoge ^ ' T#hoge ' Object subclass : # C uses : T C new hoge C >> hoge ^ ' C#hoge ' C new hoge C >> hoge ^ super hoge C new hoge C withAllSuperclasses asArray Ruby （pure - traits ） require " pure - traits " T = trait { def hoge ; " T#hoge " end } class C ; use T end C .new .hoge class C ; def hoge ; " C#hoge " end end C .new .hoge class C ; def hoge ; super end end C .new.hoge C .ancestors
この例では最初、クラ ス C にメソッド #hoge は定義されていませんが、 #hoge を定義したトレイ ト T を use すること で C のインスタンスは #hoge をコールできるようになります。このような振る舞いは、#hoge を定義し た Ruby のモジュールを include したときと一緒ですね 。
ここであらため て C に #hoge を定義したとき、まずは両者に違いが生じます。モジュール使用時における同様の場合と異なり、トレイト
T の #hoge は、クラ ス C に定義された #hoge により遮蔽され、通常の方法（たとえば super へのメッセージ送 信 。Ruby では super のコール）ではアクセスできなくなります。こうした違いは、両者における、クラスへのメソッドの提供様式の違いに起因するようです。モジュールが、それをインクルードするクラスの擬似的なスーパークラスになることで自らに定義されたメソッドを提供するのに対し、トレイトは、提供するメソッド群について、まるでそれらが（本当は定義されていないにもかかわらず）最初から定義してあったかのようにクラスに振る舞わせようとします。したがって、C に #hoge がちゃんと定義されたあかつきには 、T が提供した #hoge はお役ご免になる… といった感じでしょうか 。
Traits と
Ruby のモジュールとのさらなる違いは、多重継承時にメソッドの衝突が複数起こったときに際だちます。
▼いずれも #hoge と #fuga を持つ T1、T2 両方を use したとき の C の振る舞 い Squeak Smalltalk Trait named : # T1 T1 >> hoge ^ ' T1#hoge ' T1 >> fuga ^ ' T1#fuga '
Trait named : # T2 T1 >> hoge ^ ' T2#hoge ' T2 >> fuga ^ ' T2#fuga '
Object subclass : # C uses : T1 + T2 C new hoge Object subclass : # C uses : T1 - { #hoge } + T2 - { #fuga } C new hoge C new fuga Ruby （pure - traits ） require " pure - traits " T1 = trait { def hoge ; " T1 #hoge " end def fuga ; " T1 #fuga " end } T2 = trait { def hoge ; " T2 #hoge " end def fuga ; " T2 #fuga " end } class C ; use T1 , T2 end C .new.hoge C .new.fuga class C ; use ( T1 - : hoge ) + ( T2 - : fuga ) end C .new.hoge C .new.fuga
Ruby のモジュールをはじめとする、擬似的なクラス（もしくはクラスそのもの）を用いたミックスイン機構では、衝突したメソッド群のうちどのメソッドを優先するかについて衝突ごとに管理する専用のしくみがありません。Traits では、複数のトレイトはいったん合成してからクラスに use されるため、この時点で衝突を判定でき、各々の衝突をどのように回避するかについて策を講じることが可能になっています。
他方で、ruby - traits のほうでは、トレイトも継承パスに参加するところが pure - traits と違うようです 。
▼メソッド #hoge を定義したトレイ ト T をクラス C で use require " ruby - traits " T = trait { def hoge ; " T#hoge " end } class C ; use T end C .new .hoge class C ; def hoge ; " C#hoge " end end C .new .hoge class C ; def hoge ; super end end C .new.hoge C .ancestors
Sure , Wal - Mart 's $ 100 Toshiba HD - A2 is going to be a little hard to beat this holiday season , but Best Buy is proving no slacker in the Black Friday price war .
Turns out they 've got a $ 200 eMachines desktop on offer , complete with 17 - inch LCD .
Unfortunately , it 'll cost you a fair bit more to get an HD player : Best Buy will have a Philips Blu-ray player for $ 400 , but you can nab an Xbox 360 and a copy of Guitar Hero II ( with guitar ) for $ 350 at a more significant level of bargain - ness .
Yeah , nothing 's blowing our mind like that HD - A2 , but it looks like there 's going to be plenty of cheap - as - free electronics for adventerous shoppers to fight over in a couple weeks .

When most people think of guerilla art they probably think of street graffiti .
Sure , graffiti can be impressively creative or can even have a social or political message .
However , some of the most interesting urban art installations call more directly for social change .
Here are three examples of socially - motivated projects designed to make a difference .
One of the most provocative activist guerilla marking campaigns is the “ it ’s not happening here , but it ’s happening now ” campaign of the Red Cross .
The organization may have a reputation for benign good works , but the Red Cross has actually engaged in a number of amazingly creative guerilla campaigns to raise awareness about various health and human safety issues around the world .
So , first you have to get past the irony of paper - made stickers to save trees .
Once you do , however , you have to appreciate the simple brilliance of the These Come From Trees campaign .
Studies show that these stickers reduce paper towel consumption by 15 % and that a typical coffee shop uses 1,000 pounds of paper towels per year , which is the equivalent of ten trees .
Quick math factoring in hundreds of thousands of cafes , gas stations and restaurants in the US quickly reveal : thousands ( if not hundreds of thousands ) of trees , at least , can be saved .
What place in the world could use more interstate intervention than Los Angeles ?

In an address yesterday in Hanover , N.H. , John Edwards issued a thinly veiled criticism of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , an opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 , without mentioning her by name .
Mr. Edwards has recently been challenging Mrs. Clinton to stop taking campaign donations from lobbyists , a challenge she has rebuffed , saying she will not be influenced by lobbyists or special interest groups .
The following is an excerpt of Mr. Edwards ’s remarks .
“ The choice for our party could not be more clear .
We cannot replace a group of corporate Republicans with a group of corporate Democrats , just swapping the Washington insiders of one party for the Washington insiders of the other .
The American people deserve to know that their presidency is not for sale , the Lincoln Bedroom is not for rent and lobbyist money can no longer influence policy in the House or the Senate .
It ’s time to end the game .
It ’s time to tell the big corporations and the lobbyists who have been running things for too long that their time is over .
It ’s time to challenge politicians to put the American people ’s interests ahead of their own calculated political interests , to look the lobbyists in the eye and just say no .
Wandy Sae - Tan's and Olin Shiver 's Functional PostScript embeds PostScript's base imaging operators in Scheme , resulting in a portable system for doing device and resolution independent graphics from Scheme programs ... like Olin Shiver 's maze generator , whose FPS backend and sample output you may want to have a look at .
This and other FPS examples are listed on the page for graphics resources .
Download version 1.0 of the package and a patch to load FPS into scsh version 0.5.3 or later .
The following explanation has been snarfed from a historic SU project list @ ai.mit.edu .
PostScript is the industry - standard description language for marking devices such as laser - printers .
PostScript , in fact , is a complete programming language .
When you send a PostScript file to a printer , you are really sending a complete program to be executed by the printer .
As the printer executes your PostScript program , it builds up images on the page and prints them out .
PostScript is a simple language .
It has a base set of imaging operators ( such as “ fill in this outline with ink ” or “ rotate this image by an angle ” ) .
These basic operators are composed and applied by programs written in the Forth programming language .
Functional PostScript is a UROP - designed graphics language that takes PostScript 's base imaging operators , and embeds them in a Scheme engine instead of a Forth engine .
A picture description is a small ( or not so small ) Scheme program ; executing the program causes the picture to be rendered .
The resulting language is something fairly similar to the “ picture ” language used in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programming and the 6.001 course for building Escher - like pictures , but with the extremely powerful PostScript primitives at the base .
For example , you can use any PostScript font to render text .
The result is a system that provides device - independent , resolution - independent graphics support from Scheme .
A full description of the system can be obtained on the Web , complete with sources .
( Take a look ; it 's an elegant system . )
The current implementation produces output by rendering the picture to a stream of straight - line PostScript text , which can then be shipped off to any PostScript printer , or viewed from Ghostview or other previewer program .
We 'd like to have a back - end that renders directly to the screen .
This could be done by linking FPS's Scheme with the free Ghostscript C library of PostScript primitives to render to X .
Then we'd have a high - level , device - independent graphics system for doing interactive screen graphics .

Hackers last night mounted the most significant attack since 2002 on the computers that direct traffic on the internet , it emerged today .
The hackers , believed to be from Asia , bombarded the 13 computers , or root servers , that serve as the internet 's central address books .
But although the assault lasting several hours was the largest in the past five years , it had little effect on internet users .
" It was a significant and concerted attack , but the average internet user would have barely noticed , " said Paul Levins , the vice - president of corporate affairs at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( Icann ) , the body that oversees the running of the root servers and the net 's addressing system .
" Ironically , the system gets stronger and better because of the attacks as we 're constantly upgrading the technology , " Mr Levins said .
Hackers periodically try to overwhelm the root servers with requests and information , which can slow down the network response .
The servers are distributed throughout the world and , much like an electricity grid system , can redirect their efforts to where demand is highest .
Root servers manage the internet 's domain name system ( DNS ) , used to translate web addresses such as theguardian.com into the numerical internet protocol ( IP ) addresses used by machines .
When a person types the name of a website into a web browser it looks up the location of that site by consulting a root server .
Two servers seemed to be the target of yesterday 's attack , one operated by the US defence department and the other by Icann .
The US homeland security department confirmed it was monitoring what it called " anomalous " internet traffic .
" There is no credible intelligence to suggest an imminent threat to the homeland or our computing systems at this time , " the department said in a statement .
The attacks began last night and lasted as long as 12 hours .
" The main thing is that there was very little impact on the general public , the servers were able to hold up against the attacks .
The internet in general was designed to even withstand a nuclear attack , " Zully Ramzan , a researcher at Symantec Security Response , told CNET News.com .

New York City students could earn as much as $ 500 a year for doing well on standardized tests and showing up for class in a new program to begin this fall , city officials announced yesterday .
And the Harvard economist who created the program is joining the inner circle of Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein , according to an official briefed on the hiring .
The economist , Roland G. Fryer , who has published several studies on racial inequality in public schools , met this month with school principals around the city to push his program , which uses money raised privately .
Both Mr. Klein and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg have been eager to hear Professor Fryer ’s thoughts on how to reverse the persistent lagging of poor and minority students , who make up most of the city ’s public school enrollment .
But educators have been skeptical , saying students have to love learning for its own sake , not for cash prizes .
Now Professor Fryer will be the Department of Education ’s “ chief equality officer , ” a member of the chancellor ’s senior staff .
The title is meant to reflect his primary focus  to improve the performance of black and Hispanic students .
' Like Martha Stewart ' : Congress investigating student loan corps ' sale of stock before Bush budget Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday February 13 , 2007 Print
This Email This Following a sale of 400,000 shares of stock by the chairman of the board of a major student loan corporation just before its stock prices dipped , two Congressional committees have initiated an investigation into communications between the White House , Education Department , and the Sallie Mae Corporation .
One nongovernmental analyst told RAW STORY that the situation was " reminiscent of Martha Stewart . "
Mutliple news sources reported last week that Sallie Mae Corporation Chairman Albert Lord ( pictured above ) had sold 400,000 shares of his stock in the nation 's largest student loan provider on Thursday , Feb. 1 , and Friday , Feb .
2 . The following Monday , Feb. 5 , the federal government released its Education budget , which included a substantial cut in federal subsidies for aid providers .
Sallie Mae 's stock price , which closed on Friday the 2nd at $ 46.46 , fell to $ 42.37 on Monday the 5th .
The sale before the roll out of the federal education budget saved Lord more than $ 1.5 million .
" This is reminiscent of Martha Stewart , " said Michael Dannenberg , Director of the Education Policy Program at the New America Foundation , who also produces the Higher Ed Watch blog .
" The sale of 400,000 shares is an irregular sale by Mr. Lord , " he added .
" I do n't know if there 's fire behind the smoke , but there 's certainly smoke . "
Two Congressmen today sent three letters to White House Counsel Fred Fielding , Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings , and Sallie Mae Corporation Chairman of the Board Albert Lord , seeking communications between the White House , Education Department , and Sallie Mae since Nov. 1 of last year .
Rep. George Miller ( D - CA ) , Chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee , and Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) , Chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services , requested the transmission of written correspondence , e-mails , meeting minutes , notes , telephone and meeting logs in the next ten days .
Education and Labor Committee Tom Kiley would only comment to RAW STORY that his office was " hoping for cooperation " with the committees ' requests , and would offer no judgment on whether the Sallie Mae Corporation 's defenses of its chairman 's stock sale were legitimate .
At press time , Sallie Mae , the Department of Education , and the White House had not responded to RAW STORY 's phone calls inquiring about the Miller and Frank letters .
Yesterday , a Sallie Mae spokesman told the Indianapolis Star newspaper that the sale of stock before the federal budget release was " utterly coincidental . "
The Chairman of Sallie Mae 's audit committee also told the Washington Post that Lord is " honest as the day is long . "
At the same time , there are extensive links between the Bush administration and the Sallie Mae Corporation , particularly in the White House and Education Department .
In 2004 , the Washington Post reported that Sallie Mae provided $ 250,000 to the Bush - Cheney Inauguration Committee .
At the time , Lord was the Vice Chairman of Sallie Mae 's board .
Additionally , Theresa S. Shaw , the Chief Operating Officer for Federal Student Aid in the Department of Education , served as a Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer at Sallie Mae until 1999 .
Shatner has won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for Boston Legal
Leonard Nimoy is reprising his role as Vulcan Spock in the film , which is due out in the US on 25 December 2008 .
The film chronicles the early days of the Enterprise crew .
" I can't believe it , I 'm not in the movie at all .
Leonard ,
God bless his heart , is in , but not me , " Shatner told the Associated Press news agency .
" I thought , ' what a decision to make ' , since it obviously is a decision not to make use of the popularity I have to ensure the movie has good box office .
It did n't seem to be a wise business decision . "
Since his Star Trek days , the 76 - year - old actor has continued to work in film and TV and has had particular success in award - winning series the Practice and Boston Legal .
NEW STAR TREK FILM CAST Captain Kirk - Chris Pine Older Mr Spock - Leonard Nimoy Young Mr Spock - Zachary Quinto Scotty - Simon Pegg Nero - Eric Bana Uhura - Zoe Saldana Chekov - Anton Yelchin Sulu - John Cho Leonard ' Bones ' McCoy - Karl Urban
Director JJ
Abrams announced last summer that Nimoy , 76 , would come back as Spock , made famous with his crew mates by the 1960s television show and six Star Trek films .
The director also said Shatner would probably have a part in the film .
But Shatner said he had had a couple of meetings with Abrams , creator of Lost , without anything coming of them .
Little - known actor Chris Pine has been chosen to play the young Captain Kirk in the new film .
Heroes star Zachary Quinto will play the young Spock and Lord of the Rings actor Karl Urban will play Leonard " Bones " McCoy , the Starship Enterprise 's medical officer .
The movie will show the crew meeting at the Starfleet Academy and embarking on their first mission .
The Paramount Pictures film is expected to begin shooting in November .
The Abrams film will be Star Trek 's 11th big screen outing .
The most recent Trek film , Star Trek : Nemesis , was released in 2003 .

Hello everyone .
This is a statement about the current Gtk+ maintenance situation that I have recently been working on with lots of input kindly provided by Matthias Clasen , Mikael Hallendal and other folks at Imendio AB .
Please note that this email has a Reply - To : header set for gtk - devel - list because it is cross-posted to a number of lists with tries to reach out to everyone likely to have an interest in the current and future prospects of the Gtk+ project and thus in the current maintenance situation .
Gtk+ Maintenance Description ============================
This document describes the tasks that are involved with the maintenance of the Gtk+ project and outlines what could be improved by adding additional full time maintainer resources .
Sections included herein : Description of Gtk+ Maintenance Tasks 1 . Making regular and frequent releases 2 . Communication tasks
3 . General bug report handling and regressions 4 . Refactoring and test suites 5 . Optimizations and new features Concrete improvements by adding maintainers Remarks on Gtk+ project task assignments Description of Gtk+ Maintenance Tasks -------------------------------------
Gtk+ is a large free software project with a very complex code base and a large
user base with very different needs .
The following tasks are involved in its
maintenance and ongoing development :
1. Making regular and frequent releases Making releases is a very large task for projects at the scale of Gtk+ .
A single release is usually multiple days of full time work because it consists of very time consuming tasks such as continuously adapting and fixing the build system , running the test suite and fixing the newly changed code and generating appropriate change lists out of hundreds of ChangeLog lines ( often thousands ) .
As a multiplying factor , this needs to be done for several packages , since often new versions of GLib , Pango and Gtk+ are released together .
Also , at any given time , there are usually at least two branches which have to be maintained and released in parallel ( for some periods three branches , since embedded platforms still stick to Gtk+ - 2.6 ) , similar to the Linux kernel .
The Gtk+ project has seen periods with too infrequent releases in the past , which imposed various problems in terms of users not receiving ( security ) bug fixes early enough , and as a side effect this produced many messy workarounds in third party code ( which in turn tend to aggravate backwards compatibility constraints for the Gtk+ project ) .
In particular the Gtk+ - 2.6 branch used on many embedded devices gets almost no attention from upstream these days .
2 . Communication tasks
It usually comes as a surprise upon reflection about how large the amount of time is an experienced maintainer has to spend on pure communication tasks .
Especially with successful open source projects that have large user bases , many communication forums tend to evolve , such as large Bugzilla databases , IRC channels , web forums and mailing lists .
Gtk+ makes no exception in that regard , and while the bigger part of such forums or mailing lists are specifically dedicated to non developer discussions , or development subjects that do not directly affect project maintenance , participation in the remaining core development forums is crucial and more often than not it greatly exceeds time spent on actual coding .
However , naturally such exercises involve a lot of indirect programming work , such as analyzing Bugzilla traces and scenario descriptions , analyzing programming code and providing detailed reviews of patch or design submissions .
What adds up to this is then a significant number of related forums that also need monitoring to some extend , for Gtk + specifically these are for instance various Gnome core developer forums , the window manager specification list , usability list , accessibility list and others .
3 . General bug report handling and regressions
The more exposure a software project gets , the greater is the number of bugs that are reported against the code base .
Due to the limited amount of maintenance resources available for Gtk + over the years , the number of bugs has been steadily increasing , because the rate of incoming reports has most often been higher than the rate at which bug reports could be fixed and closed .
Aside from producing a sometimes frustrating and unproductive atmosphere on the core developer and user sides of the project , this situation also tends to render outside submissions useless , because patches can become outdated before a core developer gets around to handle them , or because contributors fail to be available several years after a patch or report has been submitted .
In some cases , such delayed bug reports concern hard regressions , where newer releases break established functionality and subsequent releases maintain the breakage .
It is very important to have the required resources available to fix such regressions , in order to avoid putting long term investments from all involved parties at risk .
However , if the shortage of maintenance resources denotes the standard , rather than the exception , the ability to remedy regressions adequately can not always be provided .
4 . Refactoring and test suites Besides others , modern software development teaches us two crucial undertakings for long term ( 5 - 10 years and longer ) software maintenance and sustainable development that Gtk+ in the past has notoriously been falling short on .
These are refactoring and test coverage .
With refactoring , even large code bases can be constantly reworked to stay robust and well deigned .
Without it , there is no chance to remedy poor designs , and as code is changed it becomes more inefficient and increasingly harder to maintain .
This goes hand in hand with test coverage .
Changing old code in the absence of instantaneous feedback through test coverage is risky at best , and at worst the code contains more bugs than before .
Gtk+ has not seen significant refactoring attempts after the release of 2.0 in 2002 and that is unlikely to change without a significant increase of investments into core development .
Gtk + also lacks proper automated test coverage in various areas such as the drawing primitive implementations in the various backends , thorough automated tests of container layout algorithms and stress testing of themable widget display and interaction .
While some work is currently going on in a subset of these areas , the commitment here still must be vastly improved to reach a satisfying level of coverage , especially in areas that are partly still research topics like automated UI testing .
5 . Optimizations and new features Important and sometimes crucial optimizations in terms of memory and CPU resource reduction had to be postponed or suspended , sometimes for years , due to lack of developer resources on the project .
While the same can be said about some of the feature requests Gtk+ receives , the situation in general has been much better with features that could be split into or be identified as very specialized tasks in good isolation which could be implemented in an overseeable time frame .
So on occasions , a contributor or company may turn up to undertake the implementation of e.g. a text widget , a rendering backend or platform port , or a file chooser dialog .
Once this is integrated into stock Gtk+ however , the contributing party usually withdraws resources after some time and the code in question just adds up to the stock maintenance load of Gtk + .
An aggravating fact for GDK backends is that the core maintainers often do not have access to the platforms these work on , so GDK backends generally fall into neglect , unless they have a dedicated maintainer working on the platform in question .
Concrete improvements by adding maintainers
-------------------------------------------
The Gtk+ project and any user of the toolkit will see a number of benefits from having one or more full time maintainers added to the project : * More regular and frequent releases :
By having a shorter and guaranteed release cycles , new code will be available to the end user earlier .
This means that : - New features will be on the market earlier .
- Less changes between releases making it safer to stay up to date .
-
Test suites and build system gets more attention on regular bases .
-
More users of latest versions of Gtk+ meaning bug reports will be more up to date and target close in time releases .
-
The turn around time from bug report to fixed version is shortened .
* Better communication :
As described , a lot of time goes into communicating with the community , adding more resources to improve this situation , will benefit the project in the following ways : - Community relations will improve and allow more people to participate and provide feedback .
- New developers will get more mentoring and faster get into the project .
- Commercial vendors feel more confident in using the toolkit with better response times from the core team .
* Better bug handling :
There are currently a vast number of bug reports and patches lingering in the Bugzilla database .
More people actively working through them ensures that : - More fixes will make their way into the upstream version .
- Patches and bug reports will not rot in Bugzilla .
- Contributing developers will not be left hanging while waiting for someone to find the time to look at their contributions .
*
More active hands on the source ( refactoring and test suites ) :
With more people actively and continuously working through the code base , the following areas can improve : - Code can be continuously refactored and improved to keep the code base maintainable .
- Newly added test cases and results from these will get more attention and improve future code quality .
- Optimizations of slow or wasteful code paths can be carried out more often and ensured to not break existing tests .
- New features will have a shorter time to market .
Remarks on Gtk+ project task assignments
----------------------------------------
New resources or man power requirements for the 5 categories listed : 1 . Making regular and frequent releases 2 . Communication tasks
3 . General bug report handling and regressions 4 . Refactoring and test suites 5 . Optimizations and new features
Can be split up and assigned according to experience level : * Active Contributor
Areas where contributions can be made without much coding abilities : - assisting in release work , such as test building , running the test suite , compiling NEWS from ChangeLogs .
- bug triage and verification .
- communication , especially user forums and compiling FAQs .
- language translations .
* Inexperienced Developer
Areas where contributions can be made with proper coding abilities : - assisting in release work , such as running and debugging items of the test suite .
- eventually make stable branch maintenance releases .
- communication in application developer forums , user forums and tutorials .
- provide review of documentation , clarify and improve it .
- help extend the test suite by writing new tests .
- may be able to handle some regressions .
- implement simpler features or simpler optimizations .
* Experienced Developer
Areas where contributions can be made with significant experience in the programming domain ( GUI toolkits , X programming , familiar with some parts of Gtk+ ) : - make releases , mentor release work .
- communication , core developer forums and reference documentation .
- can classify and comment / help on many bug reports .
- help in extending and debugging the test suite and regressions .
- refactor some of the code portions .
- implement isolated or specialized features .
- work on most optimization tasks .
* Senior Gtk+ Developer
Here , Gtk+ senior means someone who is familiar with most parts of the toolkit and library chain and normally is an experienced developer .
He should be able to cover all of 1 - 5 , and is required for all sorts of mentoring for the other developers and contributors .
Depending on his background , it probably takes an experienced developer 2 , 3 , or more years of full time work on Gtk+ to become knowledgeable enough with the code base for being a Gtk+ senior .
As outlined , pretty much everyone from the online community can help to some extend with the tasks described .
We hope that more people make use of this opportunity in the future and thank everyone for taking the time to read through this document .

Memorizing does not have to be as hard as most people make it .
The problem is that most people only know how to memorize by reading the same thing over and over again .
You have to learn to memorize .
In this post we are going to look at how the brain remembers and then show how to use that knowledge to come up with a method for memorizing verbatim text .
Any tip or trick that will improve your memory even slightly is well worth the effort .
In this article we are going to focus on a technique that will let you easily :
Memorize a speech Memorize the Bible Memorize lines Memorize Scripture
At the end of this article is a Javascript tool that makes it easy to implement this method .
If you are reading the RSS or Email version , the tool may not show up .
Synapses and Neurons and How to Memorize
In the simplified model of the brain in this discussion , we ’ll be looking at neurons and synapses .
Neurons are parts of the brain that can send and receive electrical signals .
Synapses are the paths between neurons .
When you remember something neurons fire signals down particular synapse pathways to other neurons which in turn fire signals to other neurons .
The particular sequence represents a memory .
In fact , scientists have been able to make people “ re live ” experiences from the past by poking around in their brain with an electric probe and starting this interaction .
Strong Pathways
Synapses appear to exhibit plasticity .
The strength of the signal they convey is determined by use .
The more a particular synapse is used , the stronger the signal it conveys .
For example , consider remembering your home telephone number .
Since this is a number you use on a regular basis it probably comes very easily to mind .
When you try to recall the number some neurons fire of a signal down some synapses that carry a very strong signal to other neurons which do the same thing .
The number comes with very little effort .
Now consider a number that you will have trouble remembering .
Lets say your driver ’s license number .
For most people an attempt to recall this number will cause neurons to fire down very weak synapses .
If you are like me , the signal is so weak that it will probably not create the necessary chain reaction to recall the number .
In fact all I get is a vague impression that the first letter is an S or E .
To improve your memory of this number it is necessary to fire a signal down the synapses that will trigger this memory .
How to Memorize – Practice Recalling not Repeating
This is the crucial concept of any type of memorization .
The act of reading something you want to memorize fires different connections than the act of recalling .
This is how you learn to memorize –your practice recalling , not repeating .
This means that simply reading a particular piece of text over and over again is going to be the long road to memorization .
You need to let your brain practice recalling the data so it can strengthen the same pathways that will fire when you need to remember the information later on .
You ca n’t practice recalling until the information is at least partially contained in your short term memory .
Now lets look at coming up with a method for memorizing text using our understanding of how the brain works .
So lets say we are trying to memorize the Gettysburg Address by Lincoln .
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent , a new nation , conceived in Liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal .
Now we are engaged in a great civil war , testing whether that nation , or any nation so conceived and so dedicated , can long endure .
We are met on a great battle - field of that war .
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field , as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live .
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this .
But , in a larger sense , we can not dedicate — we can not consecrate — we can not hallow — this ground .
The brave men , living and dead , who struggled here , have consecrated it , far above our poor power to add or detract .
The world will little note , nor long remember what we say here , but it can never forget what they did here .
It is for us the living , rather , to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced .
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us — that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation , under God , shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth .
The 278 word speech is not a particularly long oration , but it will work for our demonstration purposes .
Our goal is to create a method that will force our brain to practice recalling the speech–even before we have it fully memorized .
So first of all we need to get it into our mind so our brain has it–even if we ca n’t recall it .
Here are a few methods that will work :
Read through it aloud .
Copy the text by hand .
Read through the text and create a short outline .
Have someone else read it to you .
There are other methods as well , just do something to get a general familiarity with the piece .
Now we need to come up with a method to give our brain , just enough information to recall the original text without simply reading the original .
F s a s y a o f b f o t c , a n n , c i L , a d t t p t a m a c e .
N w a e i a g c w , t w t n , o a n s c a s d , c l e .
W a m o a g b-f o t w .
W h c t d a p o t f , a a f r p f t w h g t l t t n m l .
I i a f a p t w s d t. B , i a l s , w c n d — w c n c — w c n h — t g.
T b m , l a d , w s h , h c i , f a o p p t a o d .
T w w l n , n l r w w s h , b i c n f w t d h .
I i f u t l , r , t b d h t t u w w t w f h h t f s n a .
I i r f u t b h d t t g t r b u — t f t h d w t i d t t c f w t g t l f m o d — t w h h r t t d s n h d i v — t t n , u G , s h a n b o f — a t g o t p , b t p , f t p , s n p f t e .
What we ’ve done is taken the first letter of each word .
Now try to recite the speech while looking at the text above .
You ’ll probably get part way into it and get confused .
Backup a few letters and look beyond the letter you are struggling with to see if you can figure it out .
Remember you are trying to help your brain find the right connections .
If you have to consult the original , make note of what confused you and start over .
I have found this method to be much more productive for memorizing verbatim text than just about anything else .
I used it extensively in school when I was trying to find how to memorize scripture quickly .
It will help improve your memory by giving you a way to practice .
However , keep in mind that it is simply one method .
When you need to memorize something , think about how to help your brain practice recalling the information –not merely reading it over and over again .
Your goal is to quickly get the information into your short term memory so you can start practicing the recall process and move the information into long term memory .
Below is a tool to help you produce first letter text as shown above .
Simply paste the original text in the top box and hit the button .
All the letters other than the first one of each word will be stripped out and placed in the bottom box .
You can then copy this into a document for printing .
Growing up Irish in Queens and on Long Island , Daniel Cassidy was nicknamed Glom .
“ I used to ask my mother , ‘ Why Glom ? ’ and she ’d say , ‘ Because you ’re always grabbing , always taking things , ’ ” he said , imitating his mother ’s accent and limited patience , shaped by a lifetime in Irish neighborhoods in New York City .
It was not exactly an etymological explanation , and Mr. Cassidy ’s curiosity about the working - class Irish vernacular he grew up with kept growing .
Some years back , leafing through a pocket Gaelic dictionary , he began looking for phonetic equivalents of the terms , which English dictionaries described as having “ unknown origin . ”
“ Glom ” seemed to come from the Irish word “ glam , ” meaning to grab or to snatch .
He found the word “ balbhán , ” meaning a silent person , and he surmised that it was why his quiet grandfather was called the similarly pronounced Boliver .
He began finding one word after another that seemed to derive from the strain of Gaelic spoken in Ireland , known as Irish .
The word “ gimmick ” seemed to come from “ camag , ” meaning trick or deceit , or a hook or crooked stick .

December 1 , 2005 Cartoon on Bush recalls
Yale frat hazing
Contributing Reporters Cartoonist Garry Trudeau ' 70 said he thinks a little - known fact about President George W. Bush ' 68 's past -- that his first mention in The New York Times occurred in 1967 when , as former president of the Delta Kappa Epsilon chapter at Yale , Bush defended the fraternity 's practice of branding its pledges with a red - hot coat hanger -- deserves more national attention .
On Sunday , Trudeau 's cartoon " Doonesbury " featured fictional character Mark Slackmeyer explaining the President 's position against current anti-torture legislation by revisiting a series of 1967 Yale Daily News articles that exposed DKE 's rush activities , which at the time included brandings and alleged beatings .
Soon after these stories were published , the University 's Inter - Fraternity Council fined the fraternity for performing " physically and mentally degrading acts , " and the Times published an article in which Bush defended the brandings , comparing them to cigarette burns .
" At the time , it caused quite a stir on campus , even generating some national attention , " Trudeau said .
The News article , published Nov. 3 , 1967 , featured a photograph of a half - inch high " D " burned into a pledge 's naked backside .
Trudeau drew his first cartoon for the News for the story -- a picture of smiling pledges , naked and bent over at the waist , with a figure holding a DKE branding iron standing over them .
In a News story the next day , Bush is quoted calling the branding " insignificant . "
He said he did not understand how the News " can assume Yale has to be so haughty not to allow this type of pledging to go on . "
Trudeau 's recent cartoon comes on the heels of the controversy over Sen. John McCain 's Anti-Torture Amendment to the Defense Appropriations Bill .
The amendment , which would outlaw torture and " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment of detainees in U.S. custody , " passed in the Senate 90 - 9 on Oct. 5 , but Bush has threatened to use his first - ever veto on the bill if McCain 's provision is included in the final passage .
Trudeau said he drew parallels between Bush 's connection to fraternity hazing and his national policy today because he feels that it reveals a lot about the President 's philosophy .
" While you can't draw a direct line between a 19 - year - old 's fraternity activities and national policy … this is part of a larger picture of this administration 's belief that the ends justify the means , " Trudeau said .
" I do n't think [ Bush ] gives much thought to what it means to torture people or how it makes us look in the eyes of the world . "
The 1967 Yale Daily News article provided a look into the covert hazing practices of fraternities in general , but focused on the DKE branding .
Some pledges at the time told the News their branding was preceded by a physical beating .
" By that time , my body was so numb [ from the beatings ] that the iron felt good , like a match was being held close to my body , " an anonymous DKE pledge told the News in 1967 .
While the article provoked outrage in the Greek community , most of those who complained expressed anger that fraternities ' reputations were being called into question , though few charged that the story was fabricated .
" Once the article came out , nobody denied its truth , " Trudeau said .
" It became simply a question of characterization . "
But in a 1967 letter to the News , Collister Johnson ' 68 -- who recently served as Bush 's Ohio campaign manager and national field director during the 2004 presidential election -- wrote that the article contained " embellished facts " and " smacks of sensationalism . "
Johnson could not be reached for comment yesterday at his home office in Virginia .
Albert Evans ' 68 , a college acquaintance of Bush's and the president of the Inter - Fraternity Council in 1967 , said the majority of DKE 's rush activities at the time were performed in the spirit of good fun and camaraderie .
" What DKE was doing was clearly outside the rules , and they were sanctioned for that , " Evans said .
" At the same time , it was n't of the order that somebody was killed . "
Although he was quoted by the News at the time as saying that the branding was " not as bad as it sounds , " Evans said he disapproved of the practice when it was revealed .
" My personal reaction was , ' I can't believe they 'd do that , ' but not , ' Why are n't these people being expelled ? ' "
Evans said .
" We all did something in our four years we 're just as glad was n't reported in the Yale Daily News . "
The White House did not respond to requests for comment before press time .
IN MARCH 1986 this newspaper celebrated “ The Charm of Nuclear Power ” on its cover .
The timing was n't great .
The following month , an accident at a reactor at Chernobyl in Ukraine spread radioactivity over Europe and despair in the Western world 's nuclear industry .
Some countries never lost their enthusiasm for nuclear power .
It provides three - quarters of French electricity .
Developing countries have continued to build nuclear plants apace .
But elsewhere in the West , Chernobyl , along with the accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979 , sent the industry into a decline .
The public got scared .
The regulatory environment tightened , raising costs .
Billions were spent bailing out lossmaking nuclear - power companies .
The industry became a byword for mendacity , secrecy and profligacy with taxpayers ' money .
For two decades neither governments nor bankers wanted to touch it .
Now nuclear power has a second chance .
Its revival is most visible in America ( see article ) , where power companies are preparing to flood the Nuclear Regulatory Commission with applications to build new plants .
But the tide seems to be turning in other countries , too .
Finland is building a reactor .
The British government is preparing the way for new planning regulations .
In Australia , which has plenty of uranium but no reactors , the prime minister , John Howard , says nuclear power is “ inevitable ” .
Managed properly , a nuclear revival could be a good thing .
But the industry and the governments keen to promote it look like repeating some of the mistakes that gave it a bad name in the first place .
It 's going nuclear 's way
Geopolitics , technology ( see article ) , economics and the environment are all changing in nuclear power 's favour .
Western governments are concerned that most of the world 's oil and gas is in the hands of hostile or shaky governments .
Much of the nuclear industry 's raw material , uranium , by contrast , is conveniently located in friendly places such as Australia and Canada .
Simpler designs cut maintenance and repair costs .
Shut - downs are now far less frequent , so that a typical station in America is now online 90 % of the time , up from less than 50 % in the 1970s .
New “ passive safety ” features can shut a reactor down in an emergency without the need for human intervention .
Handling waste may get easier .
America plans to embrace a new approach in which the most radioactive portion of the waste from conventional nuclear power stations is isolated and burned in “ fast ” reactors .
Technology has thus improved nuclear 's economics .
So has the squeeze on fossil fuels .
Nuclear power stations are hugely expensive to build but very cheap to run .
Gas - fired power stations — the bulk of new build in the 1980s and 1990s — are the reverse .
Since gas provides the extra power needed when demand rises , the gas price sets the electricity price .
Costly gas has therefore made existing nuclear plants tremendously profitable .
The latest boost to nuclear has come from climate change .
Nuclear power offers the possibility of large quantities of baseload electricity that is cleaner than coal , more secure than gas and more reliable than wind .
And if cars switch from oil to electricity , the demand for power generated from carbon - free sources will increase still further .
The industry 's image is thus turning from black to green .
Nuclear power 's moral makeover has divided its enemies .
Some environmentalists retain their antipathy to it , but green gurus such as James Lovelock , Stewart Brand and Patrick Moore have changed their minds and embraced it .
Public opinion , confused about how best to save the planet , seems to be coming round .
A recent British poll showed 30 % of the population against nuclear power , compared with 60 % three years ago .
An American poll in March this year showed 50 % in favour of expanding nuclear power , up from 44 % in 2001 .
Fear of fission
Yet the economics of nuclear still look uncertain .
That 's partly because its green virtues do not show up in its costs , since fossil - fuel power generation does not pay for the environmental damage it does .
But it is also because nuclear combines huge fixed costs with political risk .
Companies fear that , after they have invested billions in a plant , the political tide will turn once more and bankrupt them .
Investors therefore remain nervous .
How , then , to get new plants built ?
America 's solution is to lard the industry with money .
That is the wrong answer .
Nuclear and other clean energy sources do indeed deserve a hand from governments — but through a carbon tax which reflects the benefits of clean energy , not through subsidies to cover political risk .
Exposure to public nervousness is a cost of doing business in the nuclear industry , just as exposure to volatile prices is a cost in the gas industry .
It may be that fears of nuclear power are overblown : after all , the UN figure of around 4,000 eventual deaths as a result of the Chernobyl accident is lower than the official annual death - rate in Chinese coal mines .
Yet there are good reasons for public concern .
Nuclear waste is difficult to dispose of .
More civil nuclear technology around the world increases the chance of weapons proliferation .
Terrorists could attack plants or steal nuclear fuel .
Voters will support nuclear power only if they believe that governments and the nuclear industry are doing their best to limit those risks , and that such risks are small enough to be worth taking in the interests of cheap , clean energy .
One of the reasons why the public turned against nuclear power last time round is that it found itself bailing the industry out .
It would be wrong , not just for taxpayers but also for the industry , to set up another lot of cosy deals with governments .
The nuclear industry needs to persuade people that it is clean , cheap and safe enough to rely on without a government crutch .
If it can't , it does n't deserve a second chance .
While the rest of us patiently wait for either UniquePhones or iPhoneSIM free to call high noon on AT&T 's legal team and release their software unlocks , 17 - year - old George Hotz is cashing in on all those hours of work it took him to work his hardware magic : Terry Daidone , the founder of phone reseller CertiCell , traded three locked 8GB iPhones and one Nissan 350 Z to get his hot little hands on Geohot 's unlocked unit .
Geohot says he 'll give the three phones to his first PayPal contributor and two of his hacking accomplices , and we 're betting that car will come in handy when he heads off to college this week .
Hey , we 've got an unlocked iPhone sitting around here somewhere -- but we 're not settling for anything less than an actual sentient KITT .
Thomas Dodd did n’t arrive on the scene of the Nuremberg Trials with expectations of serving as one of the lead prosecutors .
He was signing on , he thought , as one of the American legal team ’s evidence compilers and interrogators .
But as the slow - motion , cumbersome process moved forward — beset by difficulties of having France , Britain and Russia as co-prosecutors and blurred lines between military and civilian tribunal techniques — his ability to cross-examine and cut to the chase landed him the position of second in command to Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson .
Distrustful of the Russians , despairing of the bureaucratic and limelight - seeking military , homesick to the core , Dodd writes home nightly over a 15 - month period what his son points out is a " first draft of history . "
The letters are bright with character sketches , from the major Nazis on trial to his bodyguard .
His observations about the littered , ruined landscape of Germany are haunting ; his arrival in Nuremberg follows so quickly on the heels of Germany ’s surrender that the scent of rotting bodies in the rubble created by Allied bombing is still present in the streets .
Incredible moments of historical hope are recounted too , such as the following description of a double - header played between two divisions of the American army :
But the sight and the significance of 40,000 Americans in baseball mood in the Nazi stadium was significant .
There , where Hitler corrupted and misled the youth of Germany , I heard thousands of young American soldiers calling the umpire names , I heard players called " bums " and all the old chatter and ribaldry of every American ballpark .
It made that arena sing .
Tucked between the grousing about the incredibly slow trial preparation , the " celebrities " drawn to the scene , the parties , the blow - ups over contract bridge games , are the shining , nuanced , philosophical passages reflecting on the meaning of justice , accountability and honor .
He exudes the exhilaration of a lawyer well aware that the daunting process of trying the men responsible for the blood lost and the havoc wreaked during World War II is unprecedented , and that care must be taken as the world watches the proceedings .
" What a disordered period of history we live in , " he writes in one letter .
In another , " Wars bring changes — lasting changes for the worse .
I know of nothing good from war .
All that silly talk about the advance of science and such leaves me cold .
Give me peace and retarded science . "
And as the evidence is compiled , he remarks , " It is a terrible page in the history of the human race . "
Frustrated at the questioning , day after day , he writes wearily to his wife : " Well — the same old song .
It would be relieving to hear one of them admit some blame for something .
They blame everything on the dead or missing . "
The passages like the latter go to the heart of why his son and family felt it was time the world saw these letters .
Chris Dodd explicitly draws the connection in his opening explanatory chapters between the Bush administration ’s disregard for rule of law and current treatment of prisoners , and the monumental undertaking of his father ’s generation to set up an international framework that would honor civilization over barbarity , and balance the understandable desire for vengeance with the painstaking weight of moral authority .
" Of course we must give these defendants a fair hearing — a most fair hearing , " he tells his wife , " otherwise this whole effort is a farce .
No decent lawyer feels otherwise . "
Reading this , it ’s impossible not to grieve for what has been lost for America under Gonzales and Bush .
Indeed , as his son points out :
On the morning of December 13 , 1945 , my father presented to the court an argument that has an eerie connection to the present .
He charged the Nazis , among many other heinous crimes , with " the apprehension of victims and their confinement without trial , often without charges , generally with no indication of the length of their detention . "
The senior Dodd also displayed a depth of understanding about human character that seems to be out of reach of the administration responsible for Abu Ghraib , Gitmo and " collateral damage . "
He writes , " Please do not think I am becoming soft about the Nazis — but in this mission , as in most realistic affairs , one knows that things are not all black and white .
For nothing ever is .
There are always shadings .
I have learned such in these few months . "
Dodd ’s journeys around ravaged Europe and the growing alarm at the Russian territorial and political grabs — presaging the ensuing Cold War — are explored throughout .
There are times when he despairs of America ’s own ability to deal with , or pay attention to , what evil countries far from us are capable of .
He writes , " ... I am inclined to believe that our people are too selfish , too shallow , too greedy and too irresponsible .
It is , I fear , something that must be changed if we are to prosper and play our proper part in the world . "
Yet for all his frequent professions of impatience and despair , he manages to hold on to a belief in humankind ’s — and America ’s — ultimate ability to honor justice and live up to a higher moral standard than crude barbarity .
His final sentences in the following passage are challenges we need to meet as a nation , and it is fitting to reflect upon them in our own dark time .
Resisting the pull of cynicism since 1969 .

The crows used two tools to get to their treats
Problem - solving crow
A University of Auckland study has revealed that New Caledonian crows can use separate tools in quick succession to retrieve an out - of - reach snack .
The birds were using reasoning that was more commonly seen in great apes and humans , the New Zealand team reported in the journal Current Biology .
New Caledonian crows are renowned for their tool - making ability .
The birds ( Corvus moneduloides ) , which are found on the South Pacific island of New Caledonia , use their bills to whittle twigs into hooks and cut and tear leaves into barbed probes that can extract bugs and grubs from crevices .
Tasty treats
To further test the crows ' tool - using talents , scientists set seven wild birds a tricky task .
The crows were presented with :
A scrap of meat , which was tucked away , out of reach , in a box ;
A small twig , which was too short to reach the food ;
And another longer twig , which was long enough to reach the food , but was locked away well out of bill - grabbing range in another box .
The birds surprised the scientists with their quick thinking .
Alex Taylor , lead author of the paper , said : " The creative thing the crows did was to use the short stick to get the long tool out of the box so that they could then use the long stick to get the meat . "
Russell Gray , another author of the paper , told the BBC News website : " What is most amazing is that most of them did this on the first trial .
It is just a puzzle why this one species on this island in the middle of the South Pacific can do this amazing thing
Russell Gray
" The first time we gave them the problem , six out of seven tried to do the right thing .
" They took the little tool and they tried to get the big tool out , which we had made quite hard to reach , and four out of the six managed to get the big tool out and then use this to get to the food . "
In another experiment , the positions of the long and short twigs were reversed .
The team found that all apart from one crow briefly attempted to use the long twig to try to retrieve the short twig from box before quickly correcting their mistake and using the long twig to directly access the food .
The scientists said the crows ' performance was comparable to that of the great apes in similar experiments .
Human - like reasoning
The team believes that because the birds were able to solve the problem on their first attempt they were using analogical reasoning rather than trial and error .
Analogical reasoning is the process of solving a problem using experience gained from solving related previous problems .
Professor Gray said : " The birds were making an analogy : instead of using a tool to get food they used the tool to get another tool to get the food . "
This kind of reasoning , added Professor Gray , was commonly seen in humans and possibly in great apes .
" It might explain why the New Caledonian crows - out of all the crow species in the world - only these crows routinely make and use tools , " he said .
" It is just a puzzle why this one species on this island in the middle of the South Pacific can do this amazing thing - and we do n't really know the answer to this . "
During the Q&A session after the speech , Sibel was asked where we should draw the line between disclosure and national security .
Sibel responded thusly ( mp3 - 3 mins ) "
I can tell you , just from my case ( and from other whistleblower cases that I 've represented ) it almost does n't deal with any classified information at all .
That 's why they went and retroactively classified the information .
Even with Congress , one important thing that I have tried to emphasize - and unfortunately the mainstream media is not there really as far as these real issues are concerned ...
When I went to Congress , I did n't know which Congressmen , Congresswomen , Senators to go to !
Because part of my case dealt with our representatives , ( and this was based on some counter - intelligence operations ) were getting cash bribery from foreign governments .
And when I internally started reporting this , and it was not getting anywhere , this great agent that I worked with ... said : " Well , let 's say you go to Congress .
How are you going to determine who is clean to go to ? "
And to me that was really sobering , because he told me : Just based on Turkish counter - intelligence operations , you know of FOUR corrupt congressional people .
Take a look at this room ( of translators ) , we have the Chinese Department , we have , you know , the Arabic , including Saudi Arabia and everything .
How many ( other corrupt Congressfolk ) do you think they have come across ? [ snip ]
When the two Senators , Senator Leahy and Senator Grassley , one Democrat and one Republican , they heard this information , the FBI discussed the entire case with them during an unclassified meeting - meaning the staff members present during that meeting , none - or most - of them did n't have clearances .
So the FBI had decided in the beginning that this was not classified .
What happened later ?
3 months later ?
when the Attorney General says ' Oops , this is really going to hurt us ' - meaning those who were guilty - ' so we 're going to decide to classify it '
I 'm a bit of a dunce , and I 'd never fully appreciated this .
Sibel has repeatedly mentioned that she often had to suggest that certain hearings be held inside SCIFs ( Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities ) but I had presumed that was simply because the Senate Judiciary Committee staffers did n't really know what they were doing .
But here we have the FBI - presumably Counter - Intelligence agents who likely know a thing or two about classification , secrecy and national security - confirming Sibel 's allegations in unclassified sessions with Congress .
As I said , I 'm a dunce .
The ACLU timeline on Sibel 's case reads :
" JUNE 2002 : Senators Grassley and Leahy write the Justice Department Inspector General a letter asking specific questions about Edmonds ' allegations and write that the FBI has confirmed many of her allegations in unclassified briefings .
This letter is later retroactively classified in May 2004 . "
You'd think that I 'd have understood this already .
That 's the beauty of the Sibel Edmonds case - there 's always something ' new ' to learn .
And this week I learnt that even the FBI did n't think that the information in Sibel 's case deserved to be classified , even as a precaution .

A reader notices this intriguing poll of 600 Iowa GOPers :
Do you see President George W. Bush as a conservative Republican in the mode of Ronald Reagan ?
( Republicans Only ) Yes 5 %
No 79 %
Undecided 16 %
More striking :
Do you favor a withdrawal of all United States military from Iraq within the next six months ?
( Republicans Only ) Yes 54 %
No 37 %
Undecided 9 %
All troops .
Next six months .
Among the Dems , the pro-withdrawal number is 81 percent .
It 's over , Mr President .

The index placed Iraq at the bottom of the list
The Global Peace Index , compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit , looked at 24 factors to determine how peaceful each country was .
It places the US at 96th on the list and the UK at 49th , while New Zealand ranks second and Japan fifth .
The authors say it is the first attempt to produce such a wide - ranging league table of how peaceful countries are .
Factors examined by the authors include levels of violence and organised crime within the country and military expenditure .
The survey has been backed by the Dalai Lama , Archbishop Desmond Tutu , former US President Jimmy Carter and US economist Joseph Stiglitz , who are all Nobel prize laureates .
It is also supported by Queen Noor of Jordan .
' Wake - up call '
Scandinavian and other European countries generally performed well in the survey .
TOP FIVE COUNTRIES 1 Norway 2 New Zealand 3 Denmark 4 Ireland 5 Japan
But Britain 's ranking comes partly from its involvement in Iraq and other conflicts .
The United States is 96th - between Yemen and Iran - again because of such things as its military spending , its involvement in Iraq , violent crime at home , and a high prison population .
The survey also places Russia and Israel at the wrong end of the scale - 118th and 119th respectively .
The brainchild of Steve Killelea , an Australian entrepreneur , the survey is meant to inform governments , international organisations , and campaign groups .
Mr Killelea said : " This is a wake - up call for leaders around the globe .
Countries need to become more peaceful to solve the major challenges that the world faces - from climate change to decreasing biodiversity .
BOTTOM FIVE COUNTRIES 117 Nigeria 118 Russia 119 Israel 120 Sudan 121 Iraq
" There is also a strong case for the world becoming more peaceful and it is now crucial for world leaders and business to take a lead , " he said .
He added that the high positions of Germany , which ranked 12th , and Japan revealed that " there can be light at the end of what may seem at the moment like a very dark tunnel . "
The study is published just before the G8 summit of leading countries next week .
The authors say they are trying to supplant what they call some " woolly " definitions of peace with a scientific approach , that includes levels of violent crime , political instability , and a country 's relations with its neighbours .
But questions have been raised over the way some of these factors are brought together .
The authors themselves acknowledge that there is a lack of data in many countries .
What impact the new survey will have is unclear .
The authors also argue that some countries - like Japan - may benefit from sheltering under the US military umbrella .
It was bound to happen : AT&T is going after the mercenary group trying to profit from the iPhone unlocking .
Apparently they can hunt these guys down , but it 's still undecided whether or not they 're in the clear or in hot water .
You can still do a 100 % unlock with the TurboSIM method but , once again , there is only one true way to really blow up the Death Star : Support the iPhone Dev Team to get the FREE software unlock and keep advancing native software development for the iPhone .

Press Release
August 25th , 2007 iphoneunlocking.com , a subsidiary of UniquePhones ( www.uniquephones.com).
was poised and ready to release remote software unlocking services for the iphone today at 12 noon EST .
The sale of unlocking codes is on hold after the company received a telephone call from a Menlo Park , California , law firm at approximately 2:54 a.m. this morning ( GMT ) .
After saying they were phoning on behalf of AT&T , the law firm presented issues such as copyright infringement and illegal software dissemination .
Uniquephones is taking legal advice to ascertain whether AT&T was sending a warning shot or directly threatening legal action .
The logistics of different continents as well as it being a weekend factors into how the situation develops .
Until an assessment is made of the potential of legal action , Uniquephones is unable to release the unlocking software for sale .
The company spokesperson also said that the company would also be evaluating what to eventually do with the software should they be legally denied the right to sell it .
A substantial delay caused by any legal action would render the unlocking software a less valuable commodity as well as creating unforeseen security issues for the company

Oh , and keep your eyes open during tomorrow and the weekend because the shit is about to hit the fan .

Hei , denne artikkelen er over ett år gammel og kan inneholde utdatert informasjon
( Dagbladet.no ) : Mye regn og et ødelagt kloakksystem skapte katastrofe i Guatemala City i dag .
Fredag morgen lokal tid ga bakken plutselig etter , og det åpnet det seg et gigantisk hull , som slukte flere hus og en truck .
Tre personer er så langt savnet .
Det hundre meter dype hullet åpnet seg i en av byens fattigste og mest overbefolkede bydeler .
De tre som er savnet er en 53 år gammel mann og to tenåringer , en gutt og ei jente .
Det ble funnet et lik nede i kloakken som omringet hullet , men det er uklart om det er et offer etter denne ulykken .
- Huset ristet sånn at vi våknet , forteller Edward Ramirez , som bor 50 meter unna hullet , til nyhetsbyrået AP .
Han fortalte at folk i området skal ha hørt rare lyder og følt risting i bakken i rundt en måned før ulykken .
Nå er både Ramirez og 1000 andre personer fra nabolaget evakuert fra hjemmene sine , og myndighetene advarer om at bakken er ekstremt ustabil .
Politiet assisterte de evakuerte på vei ut av området ; mange av dem bar med seg verdifulle eiendeler som TVer og kjøleskap .
Rundt det stinkende hullet kommer det fremdeles både bråk og skjelvinger i bakken , og myndighetene frykter at det kan utvide seg enda mer .
En talsmann for det lokale vannverket fortalte at kloakkledningen kollapset etter å ha blitt tettet , og at byen var klar over problemet .
Militæret regnet med at en kontrollert eksplosjon ville rense opp rørene , men rakk ikke å fikse problemet før hele systemet kollapset .
Det er også fare for at det kan åpne seg flere lignende hull i byen .
A team of computer scientists tasked with examining the source code of voting machines used in California ( and elsewhere across the country ) finally released their much - anticipated report on Thursday and it contains significant information that could lead the secretary of state to decertify the machines on Friday ( the last day by which Secretary of State Debra Bowen can make decisions that affect voting machines that will be used in 2008 ) .
The team , led by UC Berkeley computer scientist David Wagner , conducted the most thorough security examination of e-voting machines that has been done to date and examined both touch - screen and optical - scan systems ( a separate Red Team conducted hacking tests on the machines and released their report last week ) .
Wagner 's source code team found that the Diebold system still had many of the most serious security flaws that computer scientists had uncovered in the system years ago , despite Diebold 's claims that problems had been fixed .
These include vulnerabilities that would allow an attacker to install malicious software to record votes incorrectly or miscount them or that would allow an attacker with access to only one machine and its memory card to launch a vote - stealing virus that could spread to every machine in a county .
They also found that the Diebold system lacked administrative safeguards to prevent county election workers from escalating their privileges on the election management software that counts the votes .
Essentially , the researchers found that the Diebold software was so " fragile " that it would require an entire re-engineering of the system to make it secure .
From the Diebold report ( PDF ) :
Since many of the vulnerabilities in the Diebold system result from deep architectural flaws , fixing individual defects piecemeal without addressing their underlying causes is unlikely to render the system secure .
Systems that are architecturally unsound tend to exhibit “ weakness -
in - depth ” — even as known flaws in them are fixed , new ones tend to be discovered .
In this sense , the Diebold software is fragile .
Here 's just a sample of what the researchers found in the Diebold system :
Data on the memory cards for the optical - scan machines is unauthenticated
The connection between the voting machines and the server that contains the vote - counting software is unauthenticated
The memory card checksums do not adequately detect malicious tampering
The audit log does not adequately detect malicious tampering
The memory card “ signature ” does not adequately detect malicious tampering Buffer overflows in unchecked string operations allow arbitrary code execution Integer overflows in the vote counters are unchecked Votes can be swapped or neutralized by modifying the defined candidate voting coordinates stored on the memory card Multiple vulnerabilities in the AccuBasic interpreter allow arbitrary code execution A malicious AccuBasic script can be used to hide attacks against the optical - scan machine and defeat the integrity of zero and summary tapes printed on the optical - scan machine
The touch - screen machine automatically installs bootloader and operating system updates from the memory card without verifying the authenticity of the updates
The touch - screen machine automatically installs application updates from the memory card without verifying the authenticity of the updates Multiple buffer overflows in .ins file handling allow arbitrary code execution on startup
The list goes on .
The researchers also describe an interesting scenario for hacking the voter - verified paper audit trail that gets printed out from touch - screen machines ( see p. 15 of the report ) .
The researchers found that although some vulnerabilities could be mitigated by making changes to election procedures , poll workers and election officials likely would n't be able to implement them adequately ( see this story on last year 's primary in Cuyahoga County , Ohio , to see why relying on poll workers and election officials to make voting systems secure can be problematic . )
Two other systems ( Sequoia and Hart InterCivic ) were also examined , with similar results .
Regarding the Sequoia system , the researchers write that " virtually every important software security mechanism is vulnerable to circumvention . "
You can see the Sequoia report here and the Hart InterCivic report here .
I am a big fan of the agile philosophy of software development as summarized by the Agile Manifesto .
The agile approach fits well with my pragmatic mindset , and I consider myself an agile practitioner , despite currently working in a bureaucratic environment providing application development and maintenance services to a large , process - heavy government client .
But then I read an interview with Alastair Cockburn in which he talked about what it means to be agile .
Cockburn provided a top ten list of indicators that you are not agile .
As I read this list , I realized with a sinking feeling that most of these applied to my current team .
I went back through the list and recorded my team 's score out of 10 for the indicators for which we were agile .
I even gave us half a point for those items for which we were partially agile .
Our final score was a measly 3 out of 10 ( 10 being fully agile ) .
Clearly we are not agile .
Would I have to revoke my agile membership ?
I still believed in the agile approach , so how could I not be agile ?
Or was I mistaken ?
I re-read the Agile Manifesto , and still agreed with what it said .
What about the principles of agile software ?
I re-read those as well , and again found myself in agreement .
There were a few principles that are difficult or impossible to apply in my current environment , but that has not stopped me from trying to do what I can .
I agree with the agile values and principles and try to apply them within my work environment .
I believe this is the fundamental indicator of whether you as an individual are agile or not , rather than a list of specific practices .
Therefore I am agile .
A separate question is whether I , as part of a team , am doing agile software development .
Despite the flaws with Cockburn 's top ten list , it does help evaluate this second question .
The answer for myself is no .
I am an agile software developer doing non-agile software development .
The distinction may be subtle , but it is significant .
To help you see it , imagine the opposite case of a non -agile developer working on an agile software development process .
They may be following the team 's agile processes while pushing for more formal documentation and more detailed processes .
Your team 's approach does not necessarily reflect the beliefs and values of each team member .
Another way of viewing this distinction is that agile can be thought of as both a philosophy consisting of a set of values and principles , and as a set of practices which implement and uphold these principles and values .
I am unable to follow all of the practices at work , but I still subscribe to and apply the values and principles .

Author Naomi Klein : America is succumbing to fascism Nick Langewis and Mike Aivaz
Published : Saturday October 13 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Author Naomi Klein sits down with Bill Maher to discuss her new book , The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism .
The Shock Doctrine shares a sentiment that , while corporations are engineered to profit off of situations , planned or otherwise , the United States under President Bush has corporations opportunistically poised to collect taxpayer - funded payouts from disasters such as 9/11 , Katrina and the Iraq occupation .
Calling it the " mission statement of the Bush administration , " Klein says that politicians are seeing themselves as facilitators between disasters and their friends in the private sector .
Each time there 's a disaster , says Klein , politicians use the " shock " felt by the citizenry to " push through a further privatization agenda " with little opposition .
" In New Orleans , " continues Klein , " it 's the privatization of the school system , the public housing .
After September 11th , it was the launching of a new economy in privatized homeland security , and in Iraq it 's the Blackwater economy -- The worse things get in Iraq , the more privatized -- and profitable -- this war becomes .
So it 's not about the corporations taking advantage ; we expect corporations to do that .
It 's about the politicians who think the government should be an ATM machine and just transfer wealth to their friends in exchange for a deposit in the form of campaign contributions . "
" But you 're talking about our government and corporations as if they 're two different things , " quips Maher .
" Now , we all know that communism is when the government takes over private business .
But , when corporations take over the government , that is what has been defined as fascism .
Do you think that 's where we 're at ? "
Klein agrees , adding : " You could call it crony capitalism , you could call it corporatism ; but it certainly not the free market . "
" And , the irony is , " she continues , " it 's the free market ideology that gets used to propel this vision forward which has absolutely nothing to do with - - it 's not free for anybody but the contractors ... "
Governments have historically colluded with business to manipulate the public after traumatic events , says Klein ; The Shock Doctrine , she says , aims to prepare the public for the next disaster , as to not remain vulnerable to big business and big government .
The following video is from HBO 's Real Time with Bill Maher , broadcast on October 12 , 2007 .

While Anton was waxing about Church & Turing , I figured that Occam's Razor would be the type of proof one would postulate when giving the nod to Lambda Calculus over Universal Turing Machines .
This leads inexorably to the question of what is the smallest ( as measured in binary bits ) Turing Machine that can possibly be constructed .
John Tromp provides an answer to this question in his always fun Lambda Calculus and Combinatory Logic Playground :
Pictured you can see the 210 bit binary lambda calculus self - interpreter , and the 272 bit binary combinatory logic self - interpreter .
Both are explained in detail in my latest paper available in PostScript and PDF .
This design of a minimalistic universal computer was motivated by my desire to come up with a concrete definition of Kolmogorov Complexity , which studies randomness of individual objects .
All ideas in the paper have been implemented in the the wonderfully elegant Haskell language , which is basically pure typed lambda calculus with lots of syntactic sugar on top .
Interestingly , the version based on the Lambda Calculus is smaller than the one on Combinators .
A statement I found of interest in the paper about PL's :
Although information content may seem to be highly dependent on choice of programming language , the notion is actually invariant up to an additive constant .
Not sure if that statement means that PL research is ultimately doomed . :-)
— A man who was pardoned after spending 18 years behind bars for a rape he did n't commit has been sued for child support for the years he was in prison .
Dwayne Allen Dail , 39 , was cleared in August of the 1987 rape of a 12 - year - old Goldsboro girl .
The girl identified him as her attacker , and hair found at the scene was similar to his .
DNA evidence found on a fragment of the girl 's nightgown years after the trial proved Dail was n't involved in the attack , however .
Gov. Mike Easley pardoned
Dail two weeks ago , making him eligible to receive $ 360,000 from the state – $ 20,000 for each year he spent in prison .
Dail , who now lives in Florida , was served Tuesday with a lawsuit by Lorraine Michaels , the mother of his son , who is seeking back child support .
The suit does not specify how much money she wants , as is normal in North Carolina , but asks a " reasonable sum for the care and maintenance of the minor child " for the years Dail was in prison .
" Since his release , Mr. Dail has not indicated any intention to provide support to Ms. Michaels , " Michaels ' attorney , Sarah Heekin , said in a statement .
" In order to fully protect my client ’s statutory rights , it was necessary to file an action for child support prior to the minor ’s eighteenth birthday . "
Dail said he was devastated by the suit .
He said his son recently moved to Florida to live with him .
" I was thrown in prison .
What could I do ?
I missed my whole life .
I missed my son's whole life .
I 'm not the person to be compensating anyone for anything – not me , " Dail said .
" I 'm sure the mother had her issues over the years , but nothing like the issues that Dwayne Dail dealt with for 18 ½ years , ” said Chris Mumma , the attorney who helped establish Dail ’s innocence .
Heekin , who said she filed the suit last week , works in the same law office as Don Strickland , the former Wayne County assistant district attorney who prosecuted Dail for rape .
In a city obsessed with tumbling home values and horrible traffic , maybe it ’s appropriate that the two collided on the Hollywood Freeway .
For 10 days now , a sagging house parked on the freeway ’s northbound shoulder in the Cahuenga Pass has had people gawking -- and talking .
The old advertising slogan , “ If you lived here you ’d be home now , ” has been uttered a thousand times .
Radio reports have repeatedly blamed snarled commuter traffic on “ that house on the freeway . ”
Internet bloggers have joked about how the house has given new meaning to the term “ easy freeway access . ”
Commuters have noted with disgust that taggers are scrawling fresh graffiti on the home every night .

On Monday , state highway officials gave the owner of the green stucco bungalow until midnight to pick it up and move it .
If it was n’t gone by this morning , Caltrans was prepared to hire a mover and bill the job to the homeowner .
That was just the latest bad news for Patrick Richardson , who was trying to save money Sept. 15 by moving the house himself from Santa Monica to the Santa Clarita Valley .
Richardson , 45 , of Castaic , obtained a permit from Caltrans to transport the oversize load on the freeway .
Instead of taking the shortest route -- up the 405 Freeway and over the Sepulveda Pass -- he took a longer and more level route through downtown L.A. and north on the 101 Freeway .
By the time the 20 - foot - wide structure reached the downtown area , wheels were reportedly coming loose from the trailer hauling the house .
Richardson made emergency repairs and lumbered onward , only to come to a halt again in Hollywood .

That ’s where his house struck the 14 - foot - 10 - inch Western Avenue bridge .
The impact sheared off the top of the structure ’s roof .
A SigAlert was called when it took hours to free the stuck house .
Richardson eventually was able to limp another 3 1/2 miles to Barham Boulevard , where the shoulder beneath the overpass was wide enough for the house to be parked out of traffic lanes .
There the structure has sat , day after day , rush hour after rush hour .
Firefighters at Cahuenga Pass ’ Fire Station 76 first encountered the house down at Western Avenue .
They were astounded when it suddenly came to rest directly in front of their firehouse .
“ Every morning it has a new set of writing on it , ” said Engineer Fred Martinez , referring to taggers ’ vandalism .
“ We hear brakes locking up as people slow down to take pictures of it . ”

One of the shutterbugs has been Josh Williams , co-editor of a local blog , la.curbed.com .
He has photographed the house on his way from Hollywood to Woodland Hills , where he works .
“ By Tuesday , people started tagging it up and there was graffiti all over it , ” Williams said .
“ Then probably by Thursday or Friday , somebody put a ‘ For Rent ’ sign on it , and now they have Caltrans trucks out there and more cones .
It ’s just taking on a life of its own . ”
Maybe the house should be turned into some sort of L.A. monument , Williams joked .
Joe Smith , a clerk at a Cahuenga Boulevard mini-mart , said he has seen unusual scenes on the Hollywood Freeway but nothing like the house .

“ Every day I ’m surprised to see it still there .
It ’s dangerous , ” he said .
Tony Keymetlian joked that the new digs were tantalizingly close to his work at a boulevard pizzeria .
“ I want to move in there , ” he cracked .
“ It ’s a very weird scene out there . ”
The house has already generated urban myths .
Keymetlian ’s co-worker , Apo Kimetlian , said he ’d heard that homeless people had broken in and started living there .
Some of the structure ’s interior furnishings , including a TV , apparently were stolen , he said .
( Officials could not confirm those reports . )
Meanwhile , the house continued to take a toll on commuters .
Caltrans coned off the far right lane next to the structure , and as of Monday evening , traffic was backed up to downtown L.A. 's four - level interchange .
The cones were later removed around 8 p.m .

As spectators watched from above the freeway and from their cars , Richardson ’s fiancee , Kimberly Bigman , was at the house with friends who were prepared to help the owner resume transporting the house .
Judy Gish , a Caltrans spokeswoman , said Richardson had until midnight to obtain final approval from the California Highway Patrol and continue the move .
“ He loses jurisdiction at midnight .
It becomes abandoned property , ” Gish said .
If Caltrans has to hire a professional mover to complete the job , it will , she said .
And the bill will be sent to Richardson .

“ By hook or crook , it ’s going to be moved , ” she said .

Times staff writer Tami Abdollah contributed to this report .
Fifteen years after a former rough sleeper called John Bird launched a magazine to help the homeless , there are Big Issue vendors on almost every high street .
But what sort of people are they ?
How did they end up where they are ?
And what do they think of us , their customers ?
From the alcoholic Oxbridge graduate to the twentysomething with two young children , they tell us their stories
My life went downhill five years ago .
I grew up in Shelford , a small village just outside of Cambridge .
Everything was good until my mum committed suicide .
I was 28 at the time , and I 'd lived at home with her until that point .
After that , I decided to move into Cambridge .
I was very messed up in the head .
I slept near the river , mostly on my own .
The worst thing was not having any privacy .
No clothes , no possessions , no TV , nowhere to relax .
Sometimes you just want to get away and shut everyone out , but you can't .
After a year of being homeless , someone told me about the Big Issue .
When I first started , I needed beer for Dutch courage .
It 's not easy .
I 've been threatened with being stabbed , punched , all sorts .
You have to be really restrained when that happens , but last week I ended up retaliating .
Some guy said to me , " A please and thank you would be nice . "
I could n't help it , and said , " You want me to thank you for blanking me ? "
He tried to get me debadged - went to my office , the police , everything .
But mostly you 've just got to bite your lip and smile .
My pitch is outside Sainsbury 's and I have a few regular customers .
Tourists are very hard to sell to , though - they sometimes refuse to acknowledge me .
Maybe they just do n't want to read a British magazine .
Fair enough .
Americans buy them , though .
Humour is the best way to sell .
My best lines are , " Form a long orderly queue " or " Please do n't all rush at once . "
If you 're looking miserable , then nobody will buy off you .
But the more miserable you get , the less you sell .
So on a bad day you just have to force a smile and start again .
Right now , my immediate plan is to find a council flat .
I 'm in a probation hostel at the moment , because I ended up in prison a while back when life was n't going well .
After I get my own place I 'll hopefully get a job , something that uses my skills .
Before my mum died , I did a business and finance HND at university .
When customers are friendly and tell me I 've brightened their day , that makes my day .
That 's what makes it worth it .

Women make up only 10 % of the Big Issue sales force .
" It can be intimidating standing on the street , especially if you 're a woman , " says a spokesperson .
Some members of the public " are even happy to approach the women and proposition them inappropriately " .
I 've made a lot of friends .
Not just customers , but friends .
The sort that give you Christmas and birthday cards .
One of my customers sent me a postcard from her holidays in Italy .
It was addressed to my pitch here and the postman delivered it .
But there are also a lot of nasty people - you get a lot of abuse from young lads going out drinking at the Bigg Market on a Friday and Saturday night .
A couple of weeks ago , I got me books kicked out of me hand and someone 's ring on my face .
You try to put this on one side and look at the good things .
I was married but my husband had a lot of problems .
I thought I would make a fresh start for myself and my kids and build a new life for myself , so I left the house .
I should n't have done but I had no other option .
So I 've been on the streets since 2000 .
My eldest daughter is 22 .
She is studying for a law degree and I 'm helping her through university .
My other three are 13 , 11 and 10 .
They are with me mam , but it 's only a little house .
I 've got myself in a hostel .
Four years ago , a young lass took us to the Big Issue people , saying it would help , and it has .
I 'd like to get a flat or house with a nice little garden and full - time employment .
The Big Issue Foundation [ the charity behind the magazine ] gives you some money to help you get a home .
My income from selling the magazine goes on food and clothing .
I 'm on a housing association list but I have n't got anywhere yet .
I do n't think much of the association .
I 've been saving up to buy a lot of things to go in the house , when I get it .
I 've got myself a TV , a chest freezer , a bed , a wardrobe and a new duvet .
I 've also got different ornaments , towels and tea - towels .
I 've got them all in boxes at me mam 's and I 've got me settee in the Big Issue office .
I 'm trying to save up for carpets and curtains now .
Malcolm , 26 Birmingham
I 've been homeless for six years and five months .
My dad died , I lost my job because I lost my driving licence and I needed to drive to get to work , and then my relationship broke down .
I found myself on the streets , in my clothes , with nothing .
For about four years , I was in denial .
If I had somewhere to go , then I was n't homeless .
Then it hit me really hard .
Homelessness is one of the most horrendous things I 've experienced in my life .
I would n't wish it on anybody .
You can get a job but it is hard to keep it .
I started college to get a forklift truck driver 's licence but I was waking up in all different places and my punctuality affected things and I started falling behind .
When you work for eight hours , where are you supposed to go afterwards ?
The worst thing is , if you have n't got a postcode , you can't get a doctor .
When I found myself walking around town , I made new friends with other homeless guys .
One of them introduced me to the Big Issue .
I 've been selling it in the city centre for 18 months .
I do n't give people a sob story .
If someone walks by , I 'll say " Big Issue ? " , and if they say " No " , I say , " Have a nice day . "
Even if people swear at me , I 'll say " Have a nice day . "
No word of a lie - a few days later those people who 've had a bad day will come back and buy a mag off me .
I have two daughters , aged four and one .
The elder girl 's mother judges the cover before opening the book and it is difficult to visit .
But I regularly spend time with my one - year - old .
If it is sunny , I can take her to feed the ducks , but if it is pouring with rain I can't be walking the streets with her .
Someone suggested I go to a library with her but I can't take a one - year - old there .
Yesterday , though , I got the keys to a one - bedroom flat in Birmingham .
The only reason it has finally paid off is because I 've accessed all the services like the Big Issue .
The foundation has given me support , telling me what I have to do to get a flat .
I hope to go back to college .
The flat is halfway between my two daughters .
It means I have somewhere to take them .
John , 49 Norwich
I studied history at Oxford from 1975 - 78 , then worked in marketing at Monsanto for five years before joining Extel , broadcasting horse racing from tracks to betting shops .
I was already a heavy drinker in my mid-20s , and by my late - 20s it was completely out of control .
I used alcohol as an escape valve from pressures in my social and working life , but it is the worst escape valve you can have .
By my mid-30s , I 'd lost everything - my job , my home , my marriage .
I was living in a Salvation Army hostel in Poplar , east London .
Then I came up to Norwich .
It was just a dart in a map to make a new start .
I got some part - time jobs , and when I was there I was good .
But when I was drinking , I just went missing , and I continued to lose jobs as a result .
When I was working , I lived in shared flats ; when I was out of work , I slept rough .
But there is a good end to my story .
I 'm just over 14 and a half months sober now .
I 've had amazing help from Norfolk Community Alcohol Service ; I attend AA regularly , I live in a housing association bedsit , and I have a wonderfully supportive partner called Trudy .
I have also been selling the Big Issue for the past 18 months , and that has transformed my life .
When I started with the Big Issue , I was a degenerate , incontinent wreck .
Selling the magazine has given me something to do to fill my time and allowed me to participate in the community .
It 's not the money I make that 's important , as I might only sell 10 copies a day ; it 's having a function .
I have 25 to 30 regulars who come every week .
They have supported and encouraged me , and we 've become friends .
From my pitch in London Street , 200 yards from Norwich cathedral , I 've come into contact with a number of teachers in local schools who have invited me to participate in drug and alcohol awareness education .
That has fired my enthusiasm to work in teaching and this week I 'm starting a PGCE at Norwich City College to teach adult numeracy and literacy .
Selling the magazine has allowed me to come out of myself ; to stand up and have some self - respect .
It 's given me a chance to get my life back .
At 49 I did n't think there was any future for me .
Now I feel there is a future ahead .
Two years ago I attempted suicide .
Luckily , it did n't work , and I 'm bloody glad it did n't .
Jimmy , 58 Newcastle
I was born in Gateshead and I 've lived in the north - east all my life .
Gateshead has n't changed much - it 's still the same rough place .
I used to have a house but it was a rough area and I got sick of people breaking my windows .
The council did n't do anything about it .
I had a nervous breakdown but the doctor did n't give me any treatment for it .
I gave up on the house and started sleeping in the park .
I got a flat in Gateshead but last year the authorities sent officials round while I was away .
They changed the locks and did £ 100 worth of damage .
They said I had n't paid my rent .
I was paying the rent but they said they did n't get it .
I 'm now staying on the floor of a friend 's house until I can get things sorted out .
It can be difficult not having a home .
I like my independence but you can't always get it .
I have been selling the Big Issue for years .
If it is a good issue I can sell about 100 , but it depends .
I spend the money I make on food - I do n't take drugs .
I do n't even smoke .
All sorts buy the magazine - well - to - do people , businessmen , black people , Chinese , local councillors .
I prop the magazine on my arm and just say , " Do you want to buy a Big Issue , madam ? " I do n't hassle people .
Some people get nasty and say " Look at him " or " Get a job " then they call you names when they walk past .
It can be hard .
But the best bit is when you get a nice smile or a nice laugh .
James , 45 Glasgow
I 've been selling the Big Issue on and off for the last 12 or 13 years , since the very beginning .
Before that I had a house , a wife and kids , but we separated and I ended up on the streets .
It was terrible .
I was sleeping anywhere I could .
You 've no privacy , no money .
People look down on you like a piece of garbage .
But I met a couple of guys who helped me out , and I ended up moving to a hostel .
That 's where I heard about the Big Issue .
I never thought I would be homeless , but it could happen to anybody .
Before this I was an apprentice upholsterer , did removals , and worked in the building trade .
It 's been brilliant selling the Big Issue , though .
It gives you a lifeline - independence , money , food and a roof over your head .
Once in a while I can afford to go to a wee bed and breakfast .
You feel embarrassed at first trying to get people to buy it , but then you get used to it .
There 's nothing else you can do .
I do n't need to ask anybody now ' cos I have quite a few regulars .
They all know I 'm here so it 's really good .
I can just stand outside Marks & Spencer and chat to my customers .
At first people were too intimidated to stop and take the magazine , but it 's just like selling a newspaper .
Right now I 'm trying to find a house of my own .
I 'm 45 now so there 's not much chance of me getting a good job .
It 's OK though .
I 've met a lot of famous people doing this - footballers , actors , even Rab C Nesbitt came by once .
The hardest thing is that you 're on your feet all day , standing constantly in the same spot .
But I do n't whinge .
I get used to it .
At least I 'm doing something to help myself .
Paddy , 39 Egham , Surrey
Low points ?
I never think like that .
Life can only get better , and I 've got the energy to go .
I 've been in Egham for two or three months .
Before that it was Kingston , Guildford , all over , then I heard there was a free pitch here , outside the Tesco .
I 'm up at six every morning , and I work all day .
I work seven days a week , rain , hail or snow .
I 'm from Belfast .
I came over here for a two - week holiday and I stayed .
It was the time of the troubles in Belfast , so it seemed a good idea .
My ex-partner used to drink , so I ended up on the street .
This was 87 .
I stayed in hostels , hotels , with friends .
But the reason I did n't keep staying in the hostels was the drink and the drugs .
I do n't drink , smoke , do drugs .
Now I 'm waiting for a flat .
I stay with friends , or my ex-girlfriend , and I can go to the day centre and take a shower .
I have family - four brothers , four sisters .
I can go back and stay with them but I want to make a life for myself .
I 'm one of the first Big Issue sellers - I 've sold it since the start , all over the country .
I 've worked for the Big Issue , too , opening the pitches , doing inductions for new sellers , showing them how the Big Issue works , explaining to them things .
Like if you 're on the streets and you come into the Big Issue , you need a letter from the day centre to say you 're homeless , and I take them to the training pitch in the West End .
Business has been up and down .
I have a lot of people who do n't buy the magazine but give me the money , they 'll say they 've bought it somewhere else but " get yourself a coffee " .
People are really nice .
I usually sell between 100 and 200 copies a day .
I 've had footballers , boxers , TV stars - Frank Bruno , Alex Higgins , Ronnie O'Sullivan .
I used to see Chris Evans every day .
Nice guy .
I want to have a little business , I want to sell fast food , teas , coffees , sandwiches , so when my kids leave school they can come and work for me - I do n't want them getting into drugs .
I 've got three kids - a set of twins , two girls , they 're 15 , and a boy , he 's three and a half .
They 're fine about their dad being a Big Issue seller .
It 's a proper job , I 'm up in the morning , at the day care centre having a shave , then off to work .
I 'm respectable .
I 'm going to give it another year selling the Big Issue , then I 'm going to start my business .
But I am going to do it .
I am .
You gotta make things happen .
Richard , 33 Nottingham
I 'm from Derby originally and I 've been homeless , on and off , for four years since I fell out with the girlfriend .
We moved into a house together but it did n't work out so I moved out and into a hostel .
My family do n't live in the area - they are in Ripley , North Yorkshire , and my brother is living in London .
I sell the Big Issue from a patch on Bridlesmith , one of the main shopping streets in the centre of Nottingham .
I work there in the afternoons , seven days a week .
Saturday is the best day , when things are busy with all the shoppers .
The magazine sells itself .
If people want it , they want it .
I do n't like to push it on them .
All kinds of people buy it - office people , students , even teenagers .
You get the whole range , depending on what 's on the cover .
Most people are pretty friendly .
It is very rare to get hassle , but sometimes you do just get general things like people saying " Get a job . "
But this is a job .
You are selling a magazine to customers .
I 'm not claiming dole because I think I 'm earning enough just to support myself on this .
I also get food from the Big Issue organisation .
It is hard to describe to people what it feels like to be homeless and it is certainly hard to understand how it feels if you have a home .
Since becoming homeless , I have been in and out of work with construction jobs .
I have got my first year in City & Guilds in joinery and carpentry and my last job was a three - month contract on a building site .
I have n't got any fixed plans but I want to get back into work - anything in construction - and get on with my life .
Normally , the first step is to get your footing - if you get your place right , then it is easier to get a job .
And it is hard to get a job if you do n't have an address .
Gareth , 28 Cardiff
I 'm originally from the West Country .
After school I worked in heating and ventilation , but I was made redundant when the company went bust .
For the next couple of years I worked as a printer .
I met a girl called Catherine , and we were together for four years .
It was a tricky break - up - she left me for my best mate , and we have a daughter who 's now three years old .
I was made redundant from my job at a helicopter company about the same time .
I came to Cardiff to get away from it all , because I just could n't handle it .
I did n't mean to be homeless , though .
I came to look for my mother 's side of the family , hoping to stay with them .
But they 'd all moved away .
So I ended up on the streets for about a month and a half .
It was n't frightening .
It was a bit of life experience - hardened me up a bit .
I learned how to survive .
For the previous four to five years I 'd had everything on a plate - I was in a relationship , I had a job , I was n't worried for anything .
And then all of a sudden , bang - nothing .
One of the guys I was crashing with was selling the Big Issue .
He introduced me to it and I 've been selling them ever since .
I 've been given my own pitch in the city centre , because I sell so many - about 35 a day .
I do n't have a particular patter - I just say " Big Issue , sir ? " or " Big Issue , madam ? " I think I look approachable .
The best thing about my job is I can watch the women go past every day .
The worst thing is people 's prejudice towards me .
They know nothing about me , they do n't know where I 've come from , they do n't know what qualifications I 've had , they know nothing about my life , but because I sell the Big Issue they turn their noses up and brand me a drug user .
At the moment I 'm taking it day by day , because I 'm still hurting about what 's happened to me in the last couple of years .
I 'm not dealing with it too well , to be honest .
I do hope to get a job of some description in the future , but for the moment this will keep me going .
And actually I enjoy doing it .
I get up in the morning and look forward to going out there all day and having a bit of a laugh .
I 've made good friends with some of the vendors , and I 've got some regular customers who buy a copy every week .
They take the time to talk to me and find out about me , and they understand .
But I do wish people would n't judge me .
What does £ 1.40 hurt , to help me out and put a smile on my face ?
When I 've really got nothing .
All it 's doing is putting food in my stomach , and clothes on my back .
And buying a Thornton 's double choc ice cream .
That 's my treat for the day

Scientists discover fossil bones of largest bird ever
An artist 's impression of a Gigantoraptor is released during a news conference announcing its discovery in Beijing June 13 , 2007 .
China has uncovered the skeletal remains of a gigantic , surprisingly bird - like dinosaur , which has been classed as a new species and genus .
Eight metres long and standing at twice the height of a man at the shoulder , the fossil of the feathered but flightless Gigantoraptor erlianensis was found in the Erlian basin in Inner Mongolia , researchers wrote in the latest issue of Nature .
The researchers said the dinosaur was discovered in April 2005 .

SAN FRANCISCO -- Xu Xing , a Chinese paleontologist , puzzled over the thigh bone of a monstrous new dinosaur he and his partners had discovered in the rich fossil beds of the Gobi desert .
The bone was so big , he said in an e-mail to The Chronicle , that he thought he and his colleagues had merely found another of those familiar plant - eating , long - necked , semi-aquatic creatures called sauropods , well known in the evolutionary past of the dinosaur world .
Then he thought the bone most likely came from a tyrannosaur -- perhaps the voracious and towering T. rex , the prime predator of fright movies .
But no , it was n't T. rex at all ; it was a fossil from the largest bird - like creature ever seen , Xu said .
More than 26 feet long and 16 - 1 / 2 feet tall , it was a young adult that must have weighed at least a ton and half when it was alive more than 70 - million years ago , he said .
It thrived in the late Cretaceous period only a few million years before all the dinosaurs on Earth became extinct .
" When I went back to my geologist colleague Lin Tan 's lab to check the skeleton , I was shocked , " Xu wrote in his e-mail , " I said to Tan , 'it is not a sauropod , it is not a tyrannosaurus , it is a tyrannosaurus - sized oviraptor .
We have a gigantic chicken ! ' "
And that 's the report the journal Nature is publishing today : the discovery of a creature Xu's team has named Gigantoraptor erlianensis , a giant bird - like dinosaur from the Gobi's Erlian basin , long known to science for its famous fossils and to prospectors for its vast oil reserves .
From the fossil record , the world 's leading paleontologists are now sure that all modern birds are descended from the dinosaurs ; in fact the scientists often term birds " modern dinosaurs . "
And paleontologists , studying the fossils marking the evolution of birds during the age of dinosaurs , have observed that as the bird - like dinosaurs approached birdness , they seem to have evolved into smaller and smaller types .
So what 's an enormous beast like Gigantoraptor doing among the avian world 's ancestors ?
It 's a curious twist in the long up - and - down saga of evolution that has intrigued science ever since the Cambrian explosion of 500 million years ago , when -- in the short span of 10 million years -- the ancestors of countless familiar life forms emerged , seemingly all at once .
Said UC Berkeley 's Kevin Padian , a leading expert on dinosaur evolution and curator of the university 's Museum of Paleontology who has seen the report from Xu and Tan :
" We have dwarf sauropods , so why not giant oviraptors ( the term means 'egg thief ' ) ?
If resources are available , all animals will take the opportunity to increase their size .
Dinosaurs can get small , and dinosaurs can get big , and the bigger ones grow faster than the little ones , because getting bigger fast can reduce the number of predators around .
" It all goes to show that when it comes to the diversity of dinosaurs , we 're still just scratching the surface . "
The details in the report by Xu and Tan are fascinating : " Growth lines " in one bone showed that the creature grew to adult size in only seven years -- faster than most other two - footed , meat - eating dinosaurs and " probably died in the eleventh year of life . "
The animal had no teeth in its bird - like beak so its diet is a mystery , Xu said , because it had the relatively small head and long neck typical of plant - eaters , and the sharp claws of many meat - eaters .
And while the fossil - hunters found no evidence of feathers -- as many dinosaur species show -- the beast could well have had feathered arms and feathers on its tail , most likely for sexual display .
Finally , although most two - footed dinosaurs had stout legs to carry their weight , and short arms , Gigantoraptor 's legs were relatively long and slender , and its arms were unusually long -- " more bird - like than its small relatives in many features , " Xu said .
Mark Norell at the American Museum of Natural History has hunted dinosaur fossils with Xu in the Gobi Desert in the past but was not involved in this discovery .
He studied the Gigantoraptor 's fossil bones last year at Xu's Institute of Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing .
" It was really a surprise when I first saw it , " Norell said in a telephone conversation .
As dinosaurs evolved toward birds , he said , they got smaller and smaller , their fossils show .
Until now , bird - like dinosaurs were at most 10 or 11 feet long -- certainly not 26 feet , he said .
Paul Sereno , a paleontologist at the University of Chicago who read the Nature report , called it " a big find , really exciting -- a class act . "
" But what kind of environment on Earth was this animal adapted to ? " he wondered .
" It 's off the charts , and with no teeth what did it eat ?
Did it use those long legs to escape from predators ?
It 's clearly a pre-flight bird , but no one would have predicted its evolution , so the door seems open to a new way of living for a new kind of dinosaur . "
The African bee is an aggressive foe of human and elephant
Oxford University researchers found that elephants would quickly vacate a spot after hearing recordings of bees .
The insects are able to inflict painful stings inside the animals ' trunks , and it is thought that elephants have learned to avoid them .
The research is reported in the scientific journal Current Biology .
" We 're a bit cautious about how effective this would be on a large scale , " lead researcher Lucy King told the BBC News website from Kenya , where she is running field trials .
" But bees may become one deterrent that farmers could use in the right situation . "
Elephants are partial to maize , the principal crop for millions of Africans .
Typically the animals seek out the crops just before harvest time .
On the run
The Oxford team set up concealed loudspeakers in trees where elephants regularly came to find shade .
Elephants are smart and would work out that there are no painful beestings
Lucy King
The buzzing clearly had the animals concerned .
Ninety - four percent of the elephant families left the tree within 80 seconds of hearing bee sounds , nearly half of the time at a run .
White noise , by contrast , only scared away 27 % of the families .
" So you could use sounds to deter elephants , " noted Dr King , " but there are two major hiccups .
" Firstly , farmers do n't have money to pay for a loudspeaker and a minidisc , and on that level it 's not practical .
Secondly , elephants are smart and would work out that there are no painful beestings ; we do n't know if that would happen after three playbacks or 30 , but it is clearly going to happen . "
It might be more practical and more desirable , she believes , to use real bees rather than their sounds .
De-fence
Another of the projects that the group is running in Kenya involves creating a " beehive fence " , where the passage of a hungry elephant would trigger bees to start flying and buzzing , giving the animal cause to turn and not come back .
Elephant families would respond to the buzzing , often leaving quickly
In certain situations , putting more bees into rural communities could help crop yields and provide honey either for local consumption or sale .
But African bees are quite aggressive and cause painful stings , so some communities might not welcome them .
Lucy King has felt their dark side more than once , having had a swarm settle on her during field trials .
" I was just covered in the things , and they are very scary , very aggressive , " she recalled .
" They sting you and they die ; and when they sting you it releases a pheromone that encourages others to sting you .
I was stung once on the jugular vein , so I 've been very lucky . "
The research was partly funded by the organisation Save the Elephants , which has as part of its mission " to develop a tolerant relationship between the two species " of human and African elephant .
An Earth - like planet is likely forming 424 light - years away in a star system called HD 113766 , say astronomers using NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope .
Scientists have discovered a huge belt of warm dust - enough to build a Mars - size planet or larger - swirling around a distant star that is just slightly more massive than our sun .
The dust belt , which they suspect is clumping together into planets , is located in the middle of the system 's terrestrial habitable zone .
This is the region around a star where liquid water could exist on any rocky planets that might form .
Earth is located in the middle of our sun 's terrestrial habitable zone .
At approximately 10 million years old , the star is also at just the right age for forming rocky planets .
" The timing for this system to be building an Earth is very good , " says Dr. Carey Lisse , of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory , Laurel , Md. " If the system was too young , its planet - forming disk would be full of gas , and it would be making gas - giant planets like Jupiter instead .
If the system was too old , then dust aggregation or clumping would have already occurred and all the system 's rocky planets would have already formed . "
According to Lisse , the conditions for forming an Earth - like planet are more than just being in the right place at the right time and around the right star - it's also about the right mix of dusty materials .
Using Spitzer 's infrared spectrometer instrument , he determined that the material in HD 113866 is more processed than the snowball - like stuff that makes up infant solar systems and comets , which are considered cosmic " refrigerators " because they contain pristine ingredients from the early solar system .
However , it is also not as processed as the stuff found in mature planets and the largest asteroids .
This means the dust belt must be in a transitional phase , when rocky planets are just beginning to form .
How do scientists know the material is more processed than that of comets "
From missions like NASA 's Deep Impact - in which an 820 - pound impactor spacecraft collided with comet Tempel 1 - scientists know that early star systems contain a lot of fragile organic material .
That material includes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( carbon - based molecules found on charred barbeque grills and in automobile exhaust on Earth ) , water ice , and carbonates ( chalk ) .
Lisse says that HD 113766 does not contain any water ice , carbonates or fragile organic materials .
From meteorite studies on Earth , scientists also have a good idea of what makes up asteroids , the more processed rocky leftovers of planet formation .
These studies tell us that metals began separating from rocks in Earth 's early days , when the planet 's body was completely molten .
During this time , almost all the heavy metals fell to Earth 's center in a process called " differentiation . "
Lisse says that , unlike planets and asteroids , the metals in HD 113766 have not totally separated from the rocky material , suggesting that rocky planets have not yet formed .
" The material mix in this belt is most reminiscent of the stuff found in lava flows on Earth .
I thought of Mauna Kea material when I first saw the dust composition in this system ; it contains raw rock and is abundant in iron sulfides , which are similar to fool 's gold , " says Lisse , referring to a well - known Hawaiian volcano .
" It is fantastic to think we are able to detect the process of terrestrial planet formation .
Stay tuned ; I expect lots more fireworks as the planet in HD 113766 grows , " he adds .

Lisse has written a paper on his research that will be published in an upcoming issue of Astrophysical Journal ; he will also present his findings next week at the American Astronomical Society Division for Planetary Sciences meeting in Orlando , Fla .

Well , they ’re at it again in Jena .
This time it ’s 1st Amendment rights that seem to be nettling the powers - that - be .
LaSalle Parish Schools Superintendent Roy Breithaupt has told a group of students at Jena High School that they can’t wear t- shirts that say “ Free the Jena 6 . ”
They cause “ too much of a stir , ” he says .
As we ’ve reported at S&R , the case of the students known now as the Jena 6 has revealed a pattern of racism and repression towards the small minority of blacks in this central Louisiana town .
There has clearly been a dual system at work – one set of punishments for white students who ’ve fostered problems ( and who created the scenario that led to the attack on a white student that resulted in the over harsh response by Jena ’s legal system ) .
And now the school superintendent – who was party to the inequitable treatment of Jena High ’s black students – has muzzled the symbolic protest of black students against the unfair treatment they believe their friends and relatives have received .
As the parent of one of the students noted :
They werenâ€™t doing anything other than wearing the shirts ,
The school doesnâ€™t have a dress code .
They were covered .
Theyâ€™re trying to tell them what they can and canâ€™t wear .
– John Jenkins , father of one of the Jena 6
There ’s a history of symbolic speech in public schools dating back to the 1960 ’s when a student won the right to wear a black arm band in protest of the Vietnam War .
Over the course of the last 40 years or so , students have had their free speech rights upheld in some cases , denied in others .
The denials mostly had to do with obscenity charges or with , as in the case of the recent “ Bong Hits 4 Jesus ” case in Alaska , the endorsement of illegal activity – both of which fall into the category of causing discipline or educational problems for a school .
If the students at Jena choose to push this case , they stand a good chance of winning .
Simply because other students , teachers , or administrators disagree with a sentiment expressed symbolically – whether that sentiment is against what they believe is an unjust war or for the freeing of persons they feel are unfairly being punished – does n’t mean that the students expressing the sentiment cannot do so .
Given the tenor of the Roberts SCOTUS decisions , however , one must wonder whether these students , already being taught that there are two kinds of justice in the America they live in – one kind for whites , one for them – will receive yet another lesson in the unfairness of things … .
Trying to turn its troubled ship around , Dell sought guidance last week from end users on the company 's new IdeaStorm site ( " Where Your Ideas Reign " ) .
Judging from the thousands of responses so far , users want penguin power but they loathe " craplets . "
Dell is listening , and has already announced plans to offer more machines without operating systems , along with a plan to reduce the amount of pre-installed software on its other systems .
85,000 users have already gone to the trouble of creating an account and voting for the " pre-installed Linux " option , and another 55,000 have asked for " pre-installed OpenOffice . "
In a blog post on Friday , Linux Software Architect Matt Domsch announced that Dell is expanding its n-Series ( no operating system ) product line to include Latitude notebooks .
In a separate statement , the company explained why it would not be offering pre-installed Linux : customers want too many variants .
" There is no single customer preference for a distribution of Linux , " said Dell .
" We do n't want to pick one distribution and alienate users with a preference for another . "
One of the other top suggestions on the IdeaStorm site is the removal of the extra software that Dell installs on most of its computers as a way of earning extra revenue .
This software goes unused by most power users and simply clutters up the system with " craplets . "
Dell has pledged to make it easier for customers to opt - out of most installed software in the future .
Dell does n't promise that this will be free , however .
When Managing Editor Eric Bangeman sat down for a roundtable discussion with Michael Dell at CES this year , one topic of discussion was paying for the privilege of getting a crapware - free PC .
Dell has seen the bright light that is " Web 2.0 " in recent months and has expanded their customer feedback tools to include a corporate blog and the new IdeaStorm site .
They are also at pains to keep users informed about how their ideas are being implemented inside Dell , which seems like a great strategy for any company to adopt .
The danger is that feedback comes only from the most vocal fans / critics , and a company can sometimes be led to think that such opinions represent mainstream opinion .
Dell 's current moves are smart , though , because they simply expand customer options .
Those who want to install Linux are free to do so , but Windows users can continue to receive preinstalled copies of their OS .
Those who value time more than money can pay for a craplet - free experience , and those who do n't mind a few uninstallation routines can save a few bucks .
Sounds good to us .
The camper van was stolen close to the border
English couple Jock and Kath Fordyce were attacked as they slept in their camper van on the first night of their holiday in County Louth in June .
Back home in Skegness the couple , both in their 60s , told BBC Radio Ulster 's Evening Extra they felt lucky to be alive .
During the attack , Mrs Fordyce 's skull was fractured and her ribs were broken .
Their van was later found on fire across the border near Meigh .
When the door was broken in , I honestly thought it was curtains for us ,
Kath Fordyce
Despite their ordeal , they said they are determined to return to Ireland to thank the people who helped them .
Jock Fordyce said : " Any human being doing a thing like that , they 're savages really . "
He said the attack would not put them off returning to Ireland .
" The time we were in Ireland , especially in Our Lady of Lourdes and St James ' Hospital , we could not have got better service anywhere in the world . "
Mrs Fordyce said she had been touched by the kindness shown to her by Irish people after the attack .
" I was completely overwhelmed by the number of cards and letters and flowers we received .
I 've never seen so many flowers in my life . "
She said she gets flashbacks about the attack , has bouts of dizziness and has difficulty sleeping .
" But we are alive , that 's the main thing .
When the door was broken in , I honestly thought it was curtains for us , " she said .
" I did n't think we would see the children again . "
Two men have been in court in connection with the attack on the couple .
They face charges of hijacking , aggravated burglary and stealing cash and belongings while armed with a hatchet and a machete .
The battle over à la carte TV programming could move into the courtroom if a judge agrees to certify a new class - action claim against the cable and satellite industries .
LA antitrust lawyer Maxwell Blecher has filed suit in federal court on behalf of several consumers who believe that cable and satellite operators are acting illegally by refusing to provide à la carte options to subscribers .
The lawsuit complains that the traditional bundling practices are an " unlawful restraint of trade " and that antitrust laws are being broken .
Everyone who 's anyone is named in the lawsuit , including Time Warner , Comcast , Cox , DirecTV , EchoStar , and Cablevision .
The suit claims that consumers are being ripped off by the arrangement , and it wants a judge to force the companies to provide à la carte service .
This is an issue that the FCC has wrestled with for the last few years , with Chairman Kevin Martin convinced that à la carte would be good for consumers ' pocketbooks and the moral formation of their children .
Pro-family groups have long called for the ability to purchase channels separately so that parents do n't need to pay for content they do n't want children to see .
Earlier this year , Martin told Congress that he would be in favor of à la carte restrictions , but that the FCC would require additional authority in order to implement them .
A bill was introduced but has so far not gathered much momentum .
Such proposals have been fiercely resisted by the companies that would be affected , and Martin even took the unusual step of publicly calling out corporate " astroturfing " against the issue .
Blecher believes that his clients can force a change in practice through the courts , bypassing the FCC entirely .

Kind of reminds you of certain religious institutions , does n't it ?
Short little insecure men , hiding behind names and titles , sending everyone on Mission Impossible while they themselves indulge in secret sin .
The preacher stands in front of thousands and shakes his finger .
Nobody else knows that he had a stripper in his hotel room last night .
Somebody tells you , ' Here , follow all these rules and be the best person you possibly can , and you might have a shot at being accepted by God someday . '
Then they string you along and get you under their thumb .
No wonder people are cynical .
Well it 's no accident that Jesus ' own biggest enemies 2000 years ago were precisely those same self - righteous hypocrites .
When Jesus showed up , they were terrified of losing their cushy jobs and political clout .
Eventually they murdered him for exposing their racket .
True spirituality had been buried in a big pile of bureaucracy , and the religious establishment used it to gain leverage , to have power over people , to get priority seating in expensive restaurants , and to line their pockets with cash .
They had everyone thinking that pleasing God was a never - ending performance marathon .
Well Jesus painted a totally different picture .
He told this story :
Two men went up into the temple to pray , one a holy man and the other a tax collector .
The holy man stood and prayed , ' God , I thank you that I am not like other men , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even like this lousy tax collector .
I fast twice a week , I give tithes of all that I get . '
But the tax collector , standing far away , would not even lift up his eyes to heaven , but beat his breast , saying , ' God , be merciful to me a sinner ! '
Jesus explains : " I tell you , this tax collector went home forgiven , rather than the holy man ; for every one who praises himself will be humbled , but he who humbles himself will be praised . "
Beware of the proud holy man who hangs a bunch of rules around your neck .
That humble tax collector had it right .
He was doing the only thing you and I can do to be accepted by God .
He just asked – with humility .

2000 years ago , they would n't even dare say the word ' God . '
God was distant , remote , and terrible .
But Jesus had his own words for God , and he used them freely .
They were controversial , even scandalous .
His words for God : ' Daddy ' and ' Your heavenly father ' .
So when the Religious Gestapo condemned him for hanging out with ruffians and women of ill - repute , he told an even more scandalous story :
' There was a man who had two sons .
The younger one said to his father , ' Dad , I wish you were dead .
Why do n't we pretend you are dead , and give me my share of the family estate . '
So the father divided his property between them .
A few days later , the disrespectful son packed his bags and headed for a distant land .
He squandered his inheritance on wine , women and song .
And when he had spent everything , a great famine arose in that country , and he got hungry .
So he got a job feeding pigs .
( Jews considered pigs to be repulsive . )
This young man would gladly have eaten the pods that the swine ate ; but no one gave him anything .
When he came to his senses , he said to himself , `How many of my father 's hired servants have bread enough to spare , but I 'm here starving !'
He went back to his father .
But while he was still far away , his father saw him and had compassion , and ran and embraced him and kissed him .
The son said , ` Father , I have sinned against heaven and before you ; I am no longer worthy to be called your son . '
But the father said to his servants , ` Go get the best robe , and put it on him ; and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet ; and bring the fatted calf and kill it , and let us eat and have a huge party ; for this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . '
Jesus sums it all up like this : ' I tell you , there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who comes back than over ninety - nine people who are already good . '
The father in the Prodigal Son story was not concerned with his dignity .
He was not concerned with what was ' fair . '
When his son wanted to go his own way , he let him go .
But he was watching out the window the whole time , hoping he would come back .
That 's Jesus ' picture of God – just like the father in this story .
Loving .
Forgiving .
Approachable .
Not distant and condemning .

Do you know what the most important invention in the history of the world was ?
It was n't the computer .
And it sure was n't the light bulb or the telephone .
( Or even the electronic voting machine . )
It was the printing press .
In 1445 , Johannes Gutenburg invented the world 's first movable type printing press .
He did n't know it , but he was unleashing a revolution that continues to this day .
Even the mighty Internet in 2004 is just an extension of Gutenberg 's original , revolutionary machine .
The first book he printed was the Bible .
And that led to controversy , too , because Luther translated it into German , the people 's language , instead of Latin , the lingo of the religious elite .
Suddenly , ordinary folks could not only afford a copy , but they could read it for themselves instead of getting some guy 's self - serving interpretation .
Soon the cat wasout of the bag -- there were copies scattered all over Europe .
When people started to read it , they were alarmed at what they saw , because between the covers of this book was an amazing story that had seemingly little to do with the politics and shell games he saw in the church .
Luther wrote a list of 95 accusations against the church , among them : priests taking bribes and granting ' indulgences ' , the institution setting itself up as a ' middleman ' between man and God .
He argued that God did n't need a middleman , or a distributor , or an agent , or a bureaucracy .
People could go direct to the source .
This little ' schism ' in Wurms , Germany unleashed a firestorm of protest and permanently changed the way people approached education .
No longer was a big , faceless institution responsible for your spiritual progress -- YOU were .
Now that you had the knowledge in your hands , you were accountable before God to do something about it .
It 's no coincidence that the scientific enlightenment and industrial revolution began within 50 years of this reformation .
Now that ordinary folks had access to knowledge and the freedom to pursue it , the possiblities were limitless .
The printing press took the handcuffs off of knowledge and spirituality , and the world has never been the same .
Equal access to knowledge empowered people everywhere , and it was only natural that the rennaisance , and in time , democracy too would follow .
What 's troubling now is that most people still do n't do anything with the knowledge that 's available to them .
Why would you accept a ' canned ' answer or empty platitude when you can open the book and read about it for yourself ?
People have debates about Jesus , but most have never read the real story , they just believe what they 're told .
How sad .
If you want a ' Just the facts ma'am . ' version of what really happened , grab a Bible ( please , a modern English version that 's easy to read , not something from the 1600's ) and read the book of Luke .
A truly fascinating story will unfold .
I dare you to read for one hour and then stop !
And you know what ?
Nobody will need to tell you what it means .
You 'll be quite able to figure it out for yourself .

~~~ Lie # 4 ' Women are spiritually inferior and must submit to the authority of men . '
~~~
In the religious bureaucracy of the ancient world , women were basically property .
If she burned his toast , he could divorce her and send her away destitute .
If she saw a crime in progress and reported it to the police , her testimony in court would be thrown out , simply because she was a woman .
Women were n't considered smart enough to recount what really happened .
Is n't that special ?
Get this .
Jesus gets crucified .
His body is taken down and put in a guarded tomb .
Three days later , some of his female friends come to the tomb , the door is wide open , and nobody 's inside .
They 're shocked .
But they 're even more shocked when Jesus shows up .
He talks to them .
These women are the first people to see this astonishing event and report it .
The men do n't believe it until they see for themselves .
Well here 's the kicker :
Had somebody invented this resurrection story out of thin air , they would * never * have said that women found the empty tomb , because women in that culture were considered inferior and unreliable anyway .
So what this proves is :
1 ) This story can't possibly be made up , because no person who invents such a hoax would ever put women in this role .
The fact that women are the first witnesses to the fact virtually proves that Jesus DID actually rise from the dead .
A conclusion that has staggering implications .
2 ) This also shows that Christianity considers women to be equal to men .
Jesus had many women in his inner circle , and there were female leaders and prophetesses in the early church .
When religion runs amok , it 's always in the interest of one of three things : - Money - Sex - Power
Do n't you agree ?
And what could be more convenient than for selfish men to shove women around and say it 's the will of God ?
You know , the thing about genuine spirituality is that it is n't used as a weapon to control people .
Yes , Jesus gave some pretty stern warnings and he talked about some heavy subjects .
But how often do you see him bossing his followers around ?
He did n't do that .
Instead , he took off their shoes and washed their dirty feet to show them how they should serve each other .
His life and death are the deep irony of God engaged in the humble service of mankind .
~~~Lie # 5 :' There is no single truth .
Everyone needs to explore and find a truth that works for them . '~ ~~
This one 's a real hot potato .
And it 's not something you hear so much from ancient religious institutions .
Rather , it 's simply the ' politically correct ' way to talk about spirituality these days .
It tends to be expressed something like this :
' You 've got your truth , and I 've got my truth .
You find a faith that works for you , and I 'll find a fav ith that works for me . '
Well here 's my question :
How many conflicting versions of the truth can actually be true ?
I 'm not going to use this space to promote an agenda today or to push any specific claim of Ultimate Truth .
I 'm just going to highlight a very simple , logical reality that each of us , in our search for Truth , must recognize .
Pardon me if I offend you , but I 'm going to put it bluntly .
It is impossible for all religions to be true .
In other words , if Islam is essentially true , then Buddhism , Hinduism and Christianity are not .
If Buddhism is essentially true , then Islam , Christianity and Hinduism are not , and so on .
How can I say such a thing ?
Because if you * really * study these religions , it will become clear that each makes bold , fundamental assertions about reality that are not compatible with the others .
For example , Hinduism states that divinity is present in everything .
Christianity , Judaism and Islam all assert that God is distinctly separate from what he has created .
The implications of these different views run very deep , and they are fundamentally incompatible .
It 's logically impossible for both views to be true .
So why bring this up , anyway ?
Well first I have to make a confession .
I would * like * to believe that all religions could be true .
I would personally * like * to believe that all paths lead to God .
It feels good .
It 's a kinder view of the world .
It puts everyone on equal footing .
But .... it just does n't make sense .
Truth is , by nature , exclusive .
There are always more wrong ways to do something than there are right ways .
There are always more wrong answers to any given question than right ones .
True ?
And you know what ?
This really raises the stakes .
It puts a real sense of urgency in our search for truth , because it shows that if we 're not careful , we can fall for a half - truth .
On the other hand , if you diligently search , seek out the facts , and your spiritual journey brings you to a place where the pieces fit in place - if everything makes logical sense and it feels right in your heart - then you should not hesitate to share your joy with others .
OK ... now let 's stop right now and make something very clear :
If we possess the truth , it does n't give us the right to be unkind to those who disagree .
It did n't give Bin Laden the right to declare Jihad , hijack airplanes and fly them into the World Trade Center .
It did n't give so - called ' Christians ' the right to kill people in the Crusades .
It does n't give us the right to be disrespectful or violent .
What it does give us is the right , and the confidence , to go out into the marketplace of ideas and * see * if our Truth stands up to hard scrutiny .
C.S. Lewis was talking about this very thing when he said , ' You do n't need to defend a Lion .
You just need to let him out of his cage . '
If you really do have the truth , then you have nothing to fear .
You do n't need to burn books or censor speech .
Truth is its own best defense .
In our modern , sophisticated culture , spirituality getslocked up in a cage .
It 's a taboo subject .
Discussions about religion are not considered ' polite conversation . '
So nobody talks about it .
The result ?
People do n't talk to each other .
They live in fear and isolation .
Some folks harbor ideas and notions that make absolutely no sense , but because those ideas are never brought out into the light of day , they 're never questioned .
Others have great wisdom , but they 're afraid to share it !
How sad .
In your search for the truth , know that you 're not just looking for something that sounds good .
As with any other kind of truth , it may * not* feel good all the time .
Know that you 're looking for something definite , something that will , by nature , make some pretty bold claims .
Also , please understand that if someone tells you they possess the truth , they 're not being arrogant .
Fact is , they 're either sadly deceived or else they 're right .
You can't put someone down for being deceived , and you can't fault someone for being right !
The real challenge is to discern the difference .

At first blush this does n't seem like an ' Organized Religion ' thing .
The reason I include it here is that many large religious organizations do teach it today .
Let me ask you something :
Do n't you think it 's a lot easier for a leader to sneak in his own agenda when there 's no outside authority with which to compare it ?
Mortimer Adler , one of the greatest living literary scholars , spent decades researching a book called ' The Great Ideas . '
He read every single major piece of literature in Western history , and his book explores the 102 most influential ideas that have defined Western culture .
In the first chapter , he talks about ' The Twentieth Century Delusion . '
What 's that ?
It 's the fact modern people * think * that we are more enlightened about all subjects than people were 1000 years ago .
Are we more enlightened about science and technology ?
Yes .
Are we more enlightened about morality , philosophy and politics ?
Hardly .
In college I took a class called ' English Authors Before 1800 . '
I was amazed at how sharp those writers were .
Once you get past the ' old English ' language , you discover that Shakespeare 's characters are just like the people you talk to every day .
The book of Proverbs in the Bible was written 3000 years ago , but its advice has saved my butt many , many times .
' A soft answer defuses anger , but harsh words stir up evil . '
' A friend loves at all times , and a brother is born for adversity . '
' The fool hates to be corrected by his father , but a wise son listens to advice . '
Are we really wiser in the 21st century than people were thousands of years ago ?
Solomon , the author of Proverbs , said ' There is nothing new under the sun . '
Many people have laughed at that statement .
But he was n't talking about technology .
He was talking about the issues of the human heart .
Malcolm Muggeridge said , ' News is old things happening to new people . '

Daniel predicted the rise and fall of the Babylonian , Persian , Greek and Roman empires , in sequence , including remarkable details ..... in 550 BC .
So is the Bible a translation of a translation of a translation ?
Could it be reliable ?
Is it worth taking seriously ?
For centuries , the oldest existing copies of the Old Testament were from 1100 AD .
Because so many prophesies in the O.T. had come true , many scholars declared that it was written after the fact .
For example , Isaiah described the cruicifixion of Jesus with remarkable precision ..... 700 yearsit happened .
Daniel predicted the rise and fall of the Babylonian , Persian , Greek and Roman empires , in sequence , including remarkable details ..... in
Astonishing stuff .
The skeptics had the upper hand in this debate until a boy threw rocks into a cave in the Qumran valley in 1947 and discovered what are now known as the ' Dead Sea Scrolls . '
Not only did these scrolls date back to 200BC , proving that these astonishing predictions were written BEFORE the events took place , but the text was virtually identical to the later versions .
Similarly , we have 5,000 ancient manuscripts of the NewTestament , some of them dating back to 60 A.D.
The text is unquestionably solid .
There are plenty of people who say that the Bible is flaky and full of holes , but honestly , the facts simply do n't support that conclusion .
Take the ' Gospels ' , same - generation accounts of Jesus ' life in Matthew , Mark , Luke and John .
There are * no * other events in ancient history that are documented as well as Jesus ' life .
If we can't believe those history books , how can we believe any other ones ?
Of course the only reason anybody doubts this stuff is that it talks about miracles .
Jesus feeds 5000 people with five loaves of bread and two fishes .
He heals the blind and the lame .
He himself rises from the dead .
Can this be believed ?
Or was it just a big conspiracy ?
Well , that is THE question .
Right ?
Chuck Colson , a former US Government official who went to jail for his involvement in the Watergate scandal , tells this story : “ Watergate was a conspiracy to cover up , perpetuated by the closest aids to the President of the United States .
But one of them , John Dean , testified against Nixon , to save his own skin - only two weeks after informing the president about what was really going on .
Two weeks !
The real cover - up , the lie , could only be held together for two weeks , and then everybody else jumped ship in order to save themselves .
What 's more , nobody 's life was at stake . '
Why do I bring this up ?
Because conspiracies planned by big groups of people always fall apart .
Somebody always narks .
Well , in the case of Jesus , eleven disciples were crucified , tortured , stoned to death and burned to the stake because they stuck to their story .
They were all ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED that Jesus rose from the dead .
The historical narrative reports that the first witnesses to the resurrection were women .
Given the legal standing of women at that time , nobody would have written the story that way had it been made up .
What do you think ?
Well , you really can't make an informed decision until you read the story .
Fortunately there are four versions of that story -- Matthew's , Mark's , Luke 's and John's .
Read one or all and decide for yourself .
If you do n't read the story , you 're not in any kind of position to decide .
Examine the evidence so you can make an educated decision .

Just a few days ago , a close friend of mine , Laurin , passed away after a fierce 18 month battle with cancer .
What a horrible experience this was for him and his wife Diana .
I 've visited the slums of Sao Paulo Brazil , where 500,000 homeless street kids sniff glue and steal for a living .
Sometimes the police hunt them down and kill them , just to reduce the crime rate .
Last year my wife spent a week in Mozambique where she saw an infant in her mother 's arms , dying of pneumonia in a hospital waiting room .
She met hundreds of other kids with malaria and malnutrition .
We 've given some money for a medical clinic , and every bit helps .
But the problems are so huge , what little you try to do still seems like a teardrop in the ocean .
If you took all the parties , the humor , the success and happiness in the world , and put it side by side with the suffering and pain , the comparison would be almost absurd .
There 's a lot of sickness and sadness in this world .
How can God let it go on ?
Well , I can't give you an answer .
I can only tell you a true story .
A certain man threatened the Religious Gestapo , who inturn convinced the Roman government that He was a threat to them , too .
His followers were disappointed that He did n't overthrow the Romans and declare himself King , like the Messiah was supposed to do .
So they abandoned Him .
The ancient Romans pioneered what was possibly the most cruel form of torture ever devised by man : Crucifixion .
They would drive spikes into their victim 's ankles and wrists , smashing his nerves .
He would hang there in blinding sheets of pain , slowly suffocating and dehydrating for days , until he finally expired .
Jesus was whipped and beaten , literally beyond recognition , then nailed to a cross between two common criminals .
One of these criminals was cursing and shouting at Him in a fit of rage : ' HEY !
If you 're the KING , why do n't you get yourself down from there !
And US , TOO !!!'
The other guy went along with this ... for a little while .
But he saw that Jesus was n't hurling insults at his torturers .
Instead
He was asking God to forgive them (?! ) .
He sobered up .
He said to the other criminal , ' Hey dude , you and I are here because we deserve it .
But this man Jesus has done nothing wrong . '
Then he said to Jesus , ' Remember me when you take charge of your Kingdom . '
Jesus simply replied , ' Today you 'll be with me in Paradise . '
Stop the camera .
What you have here , in this brief conversation , is a snapshot of the entire world .
You have two criminals who have gotten themselves into a horrendous , awful mess .
And you have the Son of God , who has not only chosen to live with us in our world of pain and suffering , but has personally taken all of it upon his own shoulders .
Even though he is completely innocent .
One thief refuses to accept any responsibility for his actions .
He 's unwilling to admit that he created the very mess that he 's in .
He lives in denial until the bitter end .
He grits his teeth and dies in his sin .
The other thief comes clean .
He recognizes that Jesus possesses divine authority .
He admits his guilt .
He is required to do nothing , other than to let go of his pride .
He asks for forgiveness .
Forgiveness granted .
Jesus ' pardon does n't make the cross or the agony go away .
But finally the struggle ceases and this man crosses the Great Divide .
The intense pain dissolves and he steps into a New World , designed by God Himself -- with renewed body and soul .
That 's a picture of the entire world , right there .
You and I are in this mess together , and we 've all contributed to it .
We 've all rejected God in some way or another , we 've allcommitted some kind of crime , and we all experience suffering .
The situation is what it is .
So we have a simple choice : Accept that fact that God has suffered with us -- or mock him and be furious because the suffering exists in the first place .
Which way do you want it ???
The decision is yours .
You and I will never get a true ' answer ' about the pain and suffering we experience in this life .

Following the pattern set by several Indian states that include Orissa , Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu , the Gujarat state assembly has not simply passed an anti-conversion law but recently amended its contents , classifying two distinct Indian religious identities – Jains and Buddhists – as Hindus .
Not only is such a classification an unwarranted assault on these distinct religions but it also amounts to a violation of the principles of plurality as guaranteed under the Indian Constitution .
The state of Gujarat has a population of close to five - and - a - half lakh Jains .
It is a state with the third largest Jain population in India , the first being Maharashtra , with a Jain population of 13,01,842 , and the second , Rajasthan , with 6,50,493 Jains , according to the 2001 census .
The total population of the Jain religious community in India is 42,25,053 .
This means that there is one Jain among every 243 Indians .
Though few in number , Jains are to be found in 34 out of 35 Indian states and union territories .
Moreover , Jains are the only real religious minority after the Buddhists because they are a minority in every state .
For instance , Sikhs , the other national minority , are a majority in Punjab and Christians , otherwise a minority , are a majority in the eastern Indian states while Hindus are a minority in Punjab , Jammu & Kashmir and the eastern states .
Since the first census conducted under the British in 1873 , Jains have been regarded as a significant religious community along with Christians , Muslims and Sikhs .
Ironically , it is the Gujarat government ’s Freedom of Religion ( Amendment ) Bill 2006 that has suddenly awakened the Gujarat Jain community , which belongs mainly to the Shwetambara sect , to the dangers of being subsumed by the majority .
( There are two major sects , the Digambara and Shwetambara , among the Jains , just as there are Shias and Sunnis among Muslims and Catholics and Protestants among Christians . )
This section of the Jains , the Shwetambaras , have so far taken the position that while they remain Jains as far as their religious identity is concerned , they are Hindu by culture , whatever that means .
There have also been some contradictions in their stance vis -à - vis their minority status itself : while they have been ambivalent in claiming this status in general , the religious heads of their educational trusts , like the Tapovan Trust , have not dithered in securing educational minority status for their institutions !
Before commenting on the constitutional and legal aspects of the Gujarat government ’s bill classifying Jains and Buddhists as Hindus , relying ( inaccurately ) on Article 25 , Explanation II of the Constitution , it would be useful to discuss the current religio- Hindutva environment in India and the historiographical context in which these two Sramanic - Indic religions – Jainism and Buddhism – arose in ancient India .
There has been near irreparable damage done to the religious identity of these two major religions by a conscious attempt at “ Hinduisation ” of these faiths or appropriation within the “ all - Hindu ” fold , in large measure attributable to a Vedic - Brahmanic influence .
Prior to independence and the adoption of the Constitution , the ideologues of a “ Hindu Rashtra ” ( Hindu state ) , including Veer Savarkar , consciously appropriated anti-Brahmanic religions like Jainism and Buddhism as part of Hinduism .
Thereafter , right from India ’s birth as a republic and our adoption of the Indian Constitution , a significant section of the Jain community has been disturbed by their inclusion along with Sikhs and Buddhists in Explanation II of Article 25 of the Constitution within the “ Hindu ” definition , done , ostensibly , to carry out certain reforms of religious institutions .
On January 25 , 1950 , a delegation of Jains met the then prime minister , Jawaharlal Nehru , and other central leaders to draw their attention to the anomalous position of Jains under sub-clause ( b ) of Clause 2 of Article 25 and a petition was submitted to him .
Jawaharlal Nehru clearly assured the delegation that Jains were not Hindus and their separate status would be preserved .
Six days later his principal private secretary , AV Pai replied to the petition where he said : “ It is clear that Buddhists are not Hindus and therefore there need be no apprehension that the Jains are designated as Hindus .
There is no doubt that the Jains are a different religious community and this accepted position is in no way affected by the Constitution . ”
Addressing a public meeting in Allahabad on September 3 , 1949 , Nehru had said : “ No doubt India had a vast majority of Hindus but they could not forget the fact that there are also minorities , Moslems , Christians , Parsis and Jains .
If India was understood as a “ Hindu Rashtra ” it meant that the minorities were not cent per cent citizens of the country ” ( The Statesman , September 5 , 1949 ) .
It may be recalled that the then deputy prime minister of India , Vallabhbhai Patel , in his letter of August 25 , 1946 addressed to Bhagchand Soni , president , All - India Digamber Jain Mahasabha , assured the Jain community that they need have no concerns about their religious rights and promised that “ in free India there would be no restrictions upon the religious liberty of any community and there need be no apprehensions in this regard ” .
It is important to note in the foregoing context that during the pre-independence period , in a decision of the erstwhile Madras High Court , the acting chief justice , Kumar Swami Shastri , held in Gateppa vs Eramma & Others ( AIR 1927 ) :
“ Were matters res integra , I would be inclined to hold that modern research has shown that the Jains are not Hindu dissenters but that Jainism has an origin and history long anterior to the Smritis and Commentaries which are recognised authorities on Hindu law and usage .
The Jain religion refers to a number of previous Tirthankaras and there can be little doubt that Jainism as a distinct religion was flourishing several centuries before Christ .
In fact , Jainism rejects the authority of the Vedas , which form the bedrock of Hinduism , and denies the efficacy of the various ceremonies which Hindus consider essential .
So far as Jain law is concerned , it has its own law books of which Bhadrabahu Samhita is an important one .
Vardhamana Neeti and Aradhana Neeti by the great Jain teacher , Hemchandra , deal also with Jain law . ”
In Hirachand Gangji vs Rowji Sojpal ( AIR 1939 , Bombay 377 ) , a judge of the Bombay High Court , Rangnekar observed :
“ It is true that the Jains reject the scriptural character of the Vedas and repudiate the Brahmanical doctrines relating to obsequial ceremonies , the performance of Sraddhas and offering of oblations for the salvation of the soul of the deceased .
Amongst them there is no belief that a son by birth or adoption confers spiritual benefit (…)
Hindus in their conduct towards the dead , omitting all obsequies after the corpse is burnt or buried .
Now it is true , as later historical researches have shown , that Jainism prevailed in this country long before Brahmanism came into existence or converted into Hinduism .
It is also true that owing to their long association with the Hindus , who formed the majority in the country , the Jains have adopted many of the customs and even ceremonies strictly observed by the Hindus and pertaining to Brahmanical religion . ”
In Ratilal Panachand Gandhi vs State of Bombay ( 1954 , ’ 56 Bom. LR 1184 ( SC ) ) the Supreme Court , taking a wider view of fundamental rights and a more realistic view of what religion is and how its nature and content should be determined , laid down :
“ It may be noted that ‘ religion ’ is not necessarily theistic and in fact there are well - known religions in India like Buddhism and Jainism which do not believe in the existence of god or of any intelligent first causes .
Religious practices or performances of acts in pursuance of religious beliefs are as much part of religion as faith or belief in particular doctrines ” ( Religion , Law and the State in India by J. Duncan M. Derrett , 1968 ) .
When the National Minorities Commission arrived at its recommendation that the Jain community be declared a minority religious community this was done in consideration of the following : 1 ) the relevant constitutional provisions 2 ) various judicial pronouncements 3 ) the fundamental differences in philosophy and beliefs ( theism vs atheism , principally ) vis-à - vis Hinduism , and 4 ) the substantial number of the Jain population in the country who resolved to recommend to the government of India that Jains deserve to be recognised as a distinct religious minority and that , therefore , the government of India may consider including them in the listing of “ minorities ” .
The commission ’s recommendation was issued on October 3 , 1994 .
So far Jains have been declared a minority in Maharashtra ( which has the largest population of Jains in India ) , Karnataka , Madhya Pradesh , Rajasthan , Uttar Pradesh , Chhattisgarh , Jharkhand and Uttaranchal .
I am currently pursuing the issue of national minority status for Jains in the Supreme Court of India .
Hindus and Jains are fundamentally different .
Scholar , social reformer and freedom fighter , Lokmanya Tilak said : “ In ancient times innumerable animals were butchered in sacrifice .
But the credit for the disappearance of this terrible massacre from the Brahmanical religion goes to the share of Jainism ” ( Bombay Samachar , December 10 , 1904 ) .
Thus instead of saying that the Jains assimilated so - called Hindu culture or customs it would be more appropriate to say that the Hindus of modern India have adopted Jain culture .
There was no such thing as Hindu during Vedic times .
It is significant to note that Jains do not believe in the most characteristic Hindu - Vedic - Brahmanic ritual , Sraddha ( ceremonies performed to honour the dead ) .
Impact of so - called Hindu culture
The principle of ahimsa ( non-violence ) and the prescription of strict vegetarianism are the prime and unique characteristics of Jain religion and ethics .
They could not have developed in Vedic - Brahmanic Aryan culture .
There is ample evidence to show that meat - eating was not a taboo among immigrant Aryans .
However , abstention from meat came naturally to the native inhabitants of India because of the region ’s climate .
That the concept of ahimsa was foreign to Vedic culture is demonstrated by eminent Indologist , W. Norman Brown , in his Tagore Memorial Lectures , 1964 - 65 , Man in the Universe :
“ Though the Upanishads contain the first literary reference to the idea of rebirth and to the notion that one ’s action – karma – determines the conditions of one ’s future existences , and though they arrive at the point of recognising that rebirth may occur not only in animal form but also in animal bodies , they tell us nothing about the precept of ahimsa .
Yet that precept is later associated with the belief that a soul in its wandering may inhabit both kinds of forms .
Ancient Brahmanical literature is conspicuously silent about ahimsa .
The early Vedic texts do not even record the noun ahimsa nor know the ethical meaning which the noun later designated …
Nor is an explanation of ahimsa deducible from other parts of Vedic literature .
The ethical concept which it embodies was entirely foreign to the thinking of the early Vedic Aryans , who recognised no kinship between human and animal creation but rather ate meat and offered animals ( in ) sacrifice to the gods “ ( pp 53 - 54 ) .
Therefore Brown concludes :
“ The double doctrine of ahimsa and vegetarianism has never had full and unchallenged acceptance and practice among Hindus , and should not be considered to have arisen in Brahmanical circles .
It seems more probable that it originated in non-Brahmanical environment and was promoted in historic India by the Jains and adopted by Brahmanic Hinduism . ”
Hermann Jacobi , the renowned German Indologist , said : “ In conclusion , let me assert my conviction that Jainism is an original system , quite distinct and independent from all others ; and that , therefore , it is of great importance for the study of philosophical thought and religious life in ancient India . ”
However , the personal law Acts , the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 , the Hindu Succession Act 1956 , the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act 1956 and the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act 1956 , all apply to Hindus , Buddhists , Jains and Sikhs – as is declared by their opening provisions .
All four Acts clarify that the “ expression ‘ Hindu ’ in any portion of this Act shall be construed as if it included a person who , though not a Hindu by religion , is nevertheless a person to whom this Act applies by virtue of the provisions contained in this section . ”
Clearly , this is a rule of interpretation that cannot , by any dint of imagination , be treated as a definition of the word “ Hindu ” in general .
Nor can it ever be stretched to claim that in law Hinduism , Buddhism , Jainism and Sikhism are one and the same religion .
It is necessary to differentiate between “ Hindu by religion ” and “ Hindu for the purpose of application of laws ” – the latter expression referring to those non-Hindus who share with Hindus certain laws .
This is true of the so - called “ definition ” of the expression “ Hindu ” in Article 25 of the Constitution as well as in the Hindu law Acts of 1955 - 56 and the legislation relating to Hindu religious endowments .
Thus the provision of Explanation II in Article 25 has no religious connotation .
Instead of saying the same thing four times of four different religious communities – Hindus , Buddhists , Jains and Sikhs – Article 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) says it once , for the Hindus , and then adds that the same provision be read in the Constitution for three other communities as well – the Buddhists , the Jains and the Sikhs .
The authors of the Constitution did not intend to merge the Buddhists , Jains and Sikhs into the Hindu religion nor were they indeed competent to do so .
Hinduism , Buddhism , Jainism and Sikhism remain , under the Constitution and the law of India , four different faiths , and their followers , four different religious communities .
Although Sikhs and Buddhists have been distinctly recognised as religious minorities and notified as such , the Sikhs , being unsure of their constitutional position , made a strong representation to the Constitution Review Commission headed by former chief justice of India , MN Venkatachaliah , that the anomalous position of the Sikhs , along with Buddhists and Jains , being included in the definition of Hindus in Explanation II of Article 25 ( relating to religious freedom ) be amended and got a recommendation to that effect .
As regards Buddhists , the case is not very different .
Buddha is almost universally adopted by Hindu theology as an incarnation of Vishnu .
Philosopher and educationist , Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan , himself had no philosophical or theological difficulty in calling Buddha a Hindu .
It is a well - attested historical Indological fact that Buddha was a junior contemporary of Mahavira ( the 24th Jain prophet erroneously called the founder of Jainism ) during the sixth century BC .
Moreover , no less a person than Indian Buddhist , Bhikshu Dharmanand Kosambi ( father of the eminent scholar - historian - archaeologist , DD Kosambi ) has written , on the basis of Buddhist scriptures , that Buddha was for some time a disciple of Mahavira in the initial stages of his search for an ascetic / renunciatory discipline .
But finding the Jain renunciatory practice too severe , Buddha left to search for his own Middle Path .
Hermann Jacobi also believes that “ Jainism goes back to a very early period and to primitive currents of religious and metaphysical speculation which gave rise to the oldest Indian philosophies .
They ( the Jains ) seem to have worked out their system from the most primitive notions about matter . ”
In the Buddhist scripture , Majjima Nikaya , Buddha himself tells us about his ascetic life and its ordinances , which are in conformity with the Jain monk ’s code of conduct .
He says : “ Thus far , Sariputta , did I go in my penance .
I went without clothes .
I licked my food from my hands .
I took no food that was brought or meant especially for me .
I accepted no invitation to a meal . ”
Buddhism scholar , CAF Rhys Davids has observed that Buddha found his two teachers , Alara and Uddaka , at Vaishali and started his religious life as a Jain .
In Digha Nikaya ’s Samanna Phal Sutta , the four vows of Lord Parshvanath ( who flourished 250 years before Mahavira ’s liberation ) have been mentioned .
The Anguttara Nikaya Attakatha contains references to Boppa Sakya , a resident of Kapilavastu , who was Buddha ’s uncle and who followed the religion of the Nigganathas i.e. Jains .
Critical and comparative study has brought to light several words such as “ asrava “ , “ samvara ” etc that have been used by Jains in the original sense but which have been mentioned in Buddhist literature in a figurative sense .
On the basis of these words Jacobi concluded that Jainism is much older than the religion of Buddha and it is therefore incorrect to assume that Jainism is an offshoot of Buddhism .
As regards Hinduism being the “ parent faith ” of India , this is the most deep - rooted Hindu shibboleth from which even Radhakrishnan was not immune .
Within such misrepresentations no exception is made even for Buddha or Buddhism .
It is incredible but true that in his foreword to the book brought out to commemorate the 2500th anniversary of Buddha ’s Mahaparinirvana ( death ) , S. Radhakrishnan stated : “ The Buddha did not feel that he was announcing a new religion .
He was born , grew up and died a Hindu .
He was restating with a new emphasis the ancient ideals of the Indo - Aryan civilisation ” ( 2500 Years of Buddhism , Ministry of Information and Broadcasting , Government of India , 1956 ) .
Notwithstanding several such irreconcilable inconsistencies and reservations on the meaning of the term “ Hindu ” , in practical terms the majority of those residing in India – those who believe in the Vedas and those who do not believe in them ( such as the Jains , the Sikhs and the Buddhists ) – are all clubbed together as Hindus on the specious consideration that they all follow a Hindu way of life and hence are taken to be followers of Hinduism .
This is precisely where the crux of the minority problem , its communalisation , lies .
Merely because Jains , Buddhists and Sikhs have grown together through the centuries side by side with Brahmanic Hindus and , inevitably , other religious and ethnic minorities , and there is thus an intermingling of custom , tradition and culture , this cannot mean that the non-Hindu or non-Vedics have forsaken their individual religious and ethnic identities .
The whole terminological muddle and the fundamentalist division in the Indian context can be traced to the desperate and impossible quest of fanatic elements within the original Vedic - Brahmanic i.e. those committed to the so - called Hindutva philosophy to fraudulently gobble minorities like Jains , Buddhists and Sikhs as part of their grand design to create a Hindu Rashtra as a theological counterpoint to the dominant minority , the Muslims in India .
This was accomplished , in a skilful bit of constitutional draughtsmanship , by distinguished members of the Fundamental Rights Sub - Committee comprising stalwarts like Vallabhbhai Patel , BR Ambedkar and KM Munshi when Article 25 , relating to religious freedom and , in particular , Explanation II ( which included Buddhists , Jains and Sikhs in the definition of Hindus ) was finalised without proper discussion .
Article 25 and religious freedom A careful reading of Article 25 as a whole makes it crystal clear that there is no reference to the Hindu religion except with regard to Hindu religious institutions of a public character in sub-clause ( b ) of Clause ( 2 ) .
It is also clear that the provision for social welfare and reform or throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus also specifically refers to the Hindu religion .
It is therefore impossible to fathom what constitutional purpose the founding fathers had hoped to serve by construing the reference to Hindus to include a reference to persons professing the Sikh , Jain or Buddhist religion .
Why was it necessary to drag in these three – the Sikh , Buddhist and Jain religions – and club them together with the reference to Hindus ?
Granted , the founding fathers were keen to provide social welfare and reform , to throw open Hindu religious institutions or temples to all classes and sections of Hindus , they were moved to end untouchability by law or hoped to bring about other unspecified social or religious reforms vis -à - vis the Hindu religion .
This concern does not however explain the rationale of including the other three religions of Indian origin under the specious umbrella of the Hindu religion .
Jainism and Buddhism do not recognise or propagate casteism .
In fact , Mahavira , the reformer of the ancient religion of Jainism , specifically spread the message of a casteless society and also spoke out against the slaughter of animals in sacrificial Vedic yajnas .
Buddha did the same .
Sikhism too does not propagate untouchability .
The question thus remains :
What constitutional purpose was sought to be fulfilled by the inclusion of Sikhs , Jains and Buddhists as Hindus ?
As B. Shiva Rao ’s classic exposition , The Framing of India ’s Constitution : A Study , reveals , Article 25 relating to religious freedom , and particularly its Explanation II , was finalised by the Fundamental Rights Sub - Committee without proper discussion .
The real conundrum is why the founding fathers resorted to this devious means of social welfare and reform of Hindu religious institutions through a blatant invasion of admittedly distinct Sikh , Buddhist and Jain religious identities .
Clause ( b ) of Article 25 and its specious Explanation II is truly a religious Pandora ’s box .
There is no reason why the religious institutions of the Sikh , Buddhist and Jain faiths should be treated on par with the Hindu religious ones to push forward Hindu social welfare and reform .
It is nothing but a surreptitious if clumsy attempt to take away the religious freedom guaranteed by that very same Article under a phoney Hindu pretext .
It is an extremely unconvincing and untenable endeavour that cannot be sustained by constitutional rationalisation and only confirms suspicions that the particular clause was not discussed threadbare .
Nor does it appear from the Constituent Assembly debates that Jain , Buddhist and Sikh protagonists were given a fair opportunity to discuss its implications .
If our constitutional stalwarts , even its very architect , Ambedkar , who had earlier publicly burnt the Manu Smriti ( one of the most controversial works of Hindu literature on Hindu law and ancient Indian society , widely criticised for its discrimination of women and codification of the caste system ) , could be such unwitting victims of the so - called Hindutva tradition that they would obliterate the separate religious identities of well - defined religious minorities ( albeit under the constitutional cover of certain limited objectives ) one can well understand the logic behind the Frankensteinian spread of Hindutva today , intent as it is on eliminating smaller religious denominations such as Jainism , Buddhism and Sikhism .
While Sikhs and Buddhists cannot be easily dealt with , given the militant and uncompromising character of the one and the universal impact of the other , Jains alone are left to fend for themselves within their non-violent creed .
This constitutional subterfuge , or terminological sleight of hand , was very much in evidence in the then law minister , Ambedkar ’s comments during the clause by clause discussion of his Hindu Code Bill in Parliament from February to September 1951 when various eminent members , Hindus , Muslims , and Sikhs in particular , took serious objection to the term “ Hindu ” comprising Buddhists , Sikhs and Jains .
They objected to its communal and discriminatory character and were strongly critical of its indirect , circuitous definition of who a Hindu is .
Some members very clearly stated that the bill , in whatever form it was passed , should not be forced on any section of the Hindu community or on the Sikhs or Jains .
Ambedkar tried to brush aside these objections in a magisterial manner by saying that the :
“ peculiarity about the Hindu religion , as I understand it , that it is one religion which has got a legal framework integrally associated with it … it would not be difficult to understand why Sikhs are brought under the Hindu religion , why Buddhists are brought under the Hindu religion and Jains are brought under the Hindu religion …
In this country although religions have changed the law has remained one …
The Jains come and ask : ‘ What are you going to do to us ?
Are you going to make us Hindus ? ’
The Sikhs say the same thing .
The Buddhists say the same thing .
My answer to that is this : I can not help it .
You have been following a single law system and it is too late now for anyone to say that he shall reject this legal system wholesale …
That can not be done .
Therefore , the application of the Hindu law and the Hindu code to Buddhists , Jains and Sikhs is a historical development to which you and I cannot give any answer ” ( Dr Ambedkar and the Hindu Code Bill , Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar : Writings and Speeches , Volume 14 , Part Two , 1995 , pp 886-888 ) .
Ambedkar ’s contention of the historical and hegemonic operation of Hindu law in India was categorically rebutted by Hukam Singh and BS Mann .
BS Mann quoted JD Mayne ’s Hindu Law and Usage , which says :
“ As regards the village communities , the Punjab and the adjoining districts are the region in which alone they flourish in their primitive rigour .
This is the tract which the Aryans must have first traversed on entering India .
Yet it seems to have been there that Brahmanism most completely failed to take root and the religious element has never entered into their secular law . ”
Commenting on this , Mann said : “ If I have enjoyed emancipation from Manu for so long a time , will it not be tyranny of the times if I have to submit now to a modern Manu ?
Let me give credit to Manu that at least he was original in many respects , but my modern Manu – Oh , what a fall has he had ! ”
This misinterpretation of history is compounded by what that doyen of Indian Indologists , RG Bhandarkar , wrote : “ India has no written history .
Nothing was known till within recent times of the political condition of the country , the dynasties that ruled over the different provisions which composed it and the great religious and social revolutions it went through .
The historical curiosity of the people was satiated by legends .
What we find of a historical nature in the literature of the country before the arrival of the Mahomedans comes to very little ” ( Early History of the Dekkan Down to the Mahomedan Conquest , 2nd Ed. 1983 , p. i - ii ) .
Tara Chand ’s seminal work entitled Influence of Islam on Indian Culture brought out the impact of Islam on Indian religious and cultural life .
In its preface he stated :
“ The history of India which furnishes a striking illustration of the impact of many divergent cultures which were gradually transformed by a process of mutual adjustment surely needs the attention of a student of sociology and history who endeavours to understand the interaction of human mind and the effects of cultural contacts as presented in the customs , religion , literature and art of a people . ”
Misleading stereotypes about Jainism Apart from a few exceptions , most histories and encyclopaedias of world religions fail to mention Jainism as an independent religion .
There are pervasive misconceptions about the origin of Jainism , about its relation to Vedic - Brahmanic Hinduism , about Mahavira being the founder of Jainism , about Jainism being an offshoot of Buddhism or Hinduism , or a reformist sect of Hinduism .
There are misrepresentations galore .
Jainism is overshadowed by Hinduism and Buddhism and , if noticed at all , is mentioned in passing as one of the ancient Indian religious movements subsidiary to Buddhism .
Such is the pervasive impact of misleading Indian historiography ; its deleterious effects are noticeable in the work of even the most eminent historians , both right and left wing .
One of the consequences of this failure is the dominance of misleading stereotypes about the nature of Indic religious thought and practice .
I believe this has a vital bearing on the devastating impact of misconceived Indological and “ oriental ” stereotypes in Indian ethno- religious historiography , enough to necessitate a paradigmatic revaluation .
In her Representation of Jainism and Buddhism in Indian History Textbooks , Tara Sethia of the history department , California State Polytechnic University , Pomona , has noted how “ In reviewing six leading college textbooks on Indian history , however , I find a very different message .
In this paper I will demonstrate that in these textbooks the coverage of Jainism and Buddhism is less than adequate ; and their representation in historical narrative is often superficial , impertinent , misleading and at times even reminiscent of orientalism .
This is a particularly vexing situation given the emerging scholarship pertaining to India as well as world history .
Recent scholarship about India has questioned the orientalist approach in the Indological discourse .
Over the last few decades , specialised studies about India have increasingly become far more inclusive in both content and approach .
Historians are becoming increasingly interdisciplinary in their analysis … ”
Further , “ For instance , it will be reasonable to expect to learn about Jainism and Buddhism from an Indian history textbook in terms of the following .
What was the historical milieu of their ‘ founders ’ and the larger context in which these ‘ religions ’ emerged and subsequently evolved ?
How are Buddha and Mahavira represented in Indian history ?
What do we learn about their world view , key concepts and fundamental teachings or lessons ?
What do we learn about their followers , patrons and persecutors ?
What has been their larger historical significance in terms of the historical change and impact within and outside India ?
Equally important is the question of how this information about religious traditions is integrated in the larger scheme of historical narrative about India . ”
“ Indian history has acquired something of a religio - cultural bias .
Whole chapters devoted to the teachings of Buddha , the mathematical and musical theories of ancient India or Hindu devotional movements are standard fare in most Indian histories ” ( Keay , p. xix ) .
Chandragupta Maurya and Jainism
But such distortions are not confined to orientalist interpreters of ancient Indian history .
I quote below an excerpt from The Age of Mauryas by the eminent historian , Romila Thapar : “ Chandragupta is said to have accepted Jainism in his later years , and in fact to have abdicated the throne and become a wandering ascetic dying through slow starvation in the orthodox Jain manner .
Considering the difficulties that he faced in making himself king and building an empire , it is hardly likely that he would have abdicated at the end of his reign in order to become a wandering ascetic .
It is possible though that he accepted the teachings of Mahavira and became a Jaina .
This interest may be excused as originating in the fact that he was of low origin , a Vaisya , and by accepting Jainism he eluded the contempt of the higher caste nobility .
The teachings of Mahavira were at this period regarded more as an offshoot of Hinduism , an extreme discipline , and the Jainas themselves as a sub-sect of the earlier religion , we can discountenance the above idea .
The interest it would seem was largely intellectual .
Accepting Jainism did not raise one ’s social prestige in the eyes of high caste Hindus whose social ethics were already being determined by caste rules ” ( emphasis added ) .
I am aware that this is an earlier historical reading by the eminent liberal progressive historian , Romila Thapar .
I am also aware that that her readings of ancient Indian history have progressed from her A History of India ( Pelican , 1966 ) to Early India : From the Origins to AD 1300 ( Allen Lane , 2002 ) .
In A History of India ( Volume I ) Thapar has perceptively noted that “ much of the early history of India was reconstructed almost entirely from Sanskrit sources i.e. from material preserved in the ancient classical language ” ( p. 18 ) .
In her latest version , “ substantial changes in the readings of early Indian history ” are made .
Mauryan India is Thapar ’s special field of historical study .
That is why one is forced to question her cavalier and even presumptuous remarks – so unhistorical in character – regarding Chandragupta .
I quote once again the particular sentence : “ This interest may be excused as originating in the fact that he was of low origin , a Vaisya , and by accepting Jainism he eluded the contempt of the higher caste nobility . ”
I simply fail to understand this judgemental remark on what Chandragupta did , making a totally unhistorical presumption on his alleged inferiority complex as a Vaisya and the even more questionable presumption that he did so to elude the contempt of “ higher caste nobility ” .
One is almost led to wonder whether Chandragupta ’s soul materialised by some transmigratory power before Romila Thapar to make the guilty confession , stating : “ Well , Madam , you know how embarrassing it was to be a Vaisya with such glittering nobility around me ! ”
I only make an issue of such “ historical ” interpretations or misinterpretations in order to demonstrate how even personal historiography from historians apparently unaffected by any transparent cultural bias can go astray .
But since the issue has been raised it must be dealt with in a rational historical manner .
Here I can do no better than to quote the celebrated historian , Radha Kumud Mookerji .
Radha Kumud Mookerji has commented at length on the theory of the base birth of Chandragupta in his Chandragupta Maurya and His Times ( 1943 ) :
“ The theory of the base birth of Chandragupta Maurya was first suggested by the derivation which a commentator was at pains to find for the epithet Maurya as applied to Chandragupta by the Puranas . ”
After explaining how the commentator on the Puranas was wrong in obtaining , grammatically , Maurya from Mura , and how it is impossible “ to derive by any grammar Maurya as a direct formation from Mura ” , Mookerji states : “ The derivative from Mura is Maureya .
The term Maureya can be derived only from masculine Mura , which is mentioned as a name of a gotra in a Ganapatha in Panini ’s Sutra ( IV . I , 151 ) .
The commentator was more interested in finding a mother than in grammar !
The only redeeming feature of the commentator is that not merely is he innocent of grammar and history , he is also innocent of any libel against Chandragupta .
For he has not stated that Mura , the supposed mother of Chandragupta , was a Sudra woman or a courtesan of the Nanda king …
Thus even the commentator of the Purana cannot be held responsible for the theory of Chandragupta ’s low origin ” ( pp 9- 10 ) .
Mookerji also makes an earnest invocation that is echoed by all those in pursuit of serious history : “ Heavens save us from commentators who supplement texts by facts of their own creation ! ”
This is precisely the watchword in my humble efforts to trace the evolution of the Sramanic religious tradition of Jainism and Buddhism and its impact on the Indic civilisation .
Further , to press home the conclusion drawn from Jain and Buddhist sources , Mookerji notes that the “ Mahavamsa ( a Ceylonese Buddhist account from about the fifth century AD ) states that Chandragupta was “ born of a family of Kshatriyas called Moriyas ( Moriyanam khattiyanam vamse jatam ) ” and that the Buddhist canonical work , Digha Nikaya ( II , 167 ) , mentions the Kshatriya clan known as Moriyas of Pippalivana .
Even more monumental evidence , according to Mookerji , derived from both the Buddhist and the Jain tradition , connects the peacock , mayura , with the Moriya or Maurya dynasty .
Thus the Ashoka pillar at Nandangarh has been found to bear at its base , below ground , the figure of a peacock , while the same figure is repeated in several sculptures on the Great Stupa at Sanchi associated with Ashoka .
Therefore Mookerji concludes that the “ Buddhist and Jain tradition are at one in declaring for him ( Chandragupta ) a noble birth ” ( pp 14 - 15 , ibid ) .
The date of the foundation of the Maurya dynasty by Chandragupta is believed to be about 322 BC .
This was determined on the basis of known dates of corresponding individuals or events such as the invasion by Greek king , Alexander the Great , which brought the Greeks into contact with India , or historical fragments of Greek traveller and geographer , Megasthenes ’ Indica .
Chandragupta Maurya ’s ascension to the throne and his historicity is an important landmark or even a high watermark in the vague almost non-existent ancient Indian historical accounts .
I emphasise the significance of the Chandragupta Maurya dynasty in ancient India because Chandragupta ’s role was also crucial in the spread of Jain religious and cultural traditions in the whole of South India .
In a remarkable monograph , Jainism or the Early Faith of Asoka with Illustrations of the Ancient Religions of the East From the Pantheon of the Indo - Scythians with A Notice on Bactrian coins and Indian Dates ( read at the meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society , February 26 , 1877 , published Trubner & Co , London , 1877 ) , Edward Thomas describes Chandragupta ’s Jain Sramanic faith .
Thomas also quotes Abul Fazl , “ accomplished minister of Akbar … known to have been largely indebted to the Jaina priests and their carefully preserved chronicles ” , from Fazl ’s Ain-i-Akbari , “ three very important entries , exhibited in the original Persian version quoted below , which establish : ( 1 ) that Asoka himself first introduced ‘ JAINISM ’ into the kingdom of Kashmir , ( 2 ) that ‘ Buddhism ’ was dominant there during the reign of Jaloka ( the son and successor of Asoka ) , and ( 3 ) that Brahmanism superseded Buddhism under Raja Sachinara … ” which evidence he uses “ to infer that Asoka ’s conversion to Buddhism occurred late in his life or reign ” and that the “ annals of Kashmir , on the other hand , more emphatically imply that either he did not seek to spread , or had not the chance or opportunity of propagating his new faith . ”
Thomas emphasises that the “ leading fact of Asoka ’s introduction or recognition of the Jaina creed in Kashmir , above stated , does not however rest upon the sole testimony of the Muhammadan author , but is freely acknowledged in the Brahmanical pages of the Rajatarangini . ”
The BJP and Hindu Rashtra A pertinent pointer to the implicit concept of Hindu Rashtra in Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) ideology is available in the former prime minister , Atal Bihari Vajpayee ’s letter dated July 17 , 2000 , commenting on the Islamic scholar , Rafiq Zakaria ’s book , Discovery of God , and displayed on the back cover of Zakaria ’s book , Communal Rage in Secular India .
Vajpayee ’s appreciation states :
“ Yet you have succeeded in presenting it in a fresh , simple and highly persuasive manner , with the power of your central thought that GOD IS ONE .
This monotheistic thought is the defining principle of India ’s age - old civilisation .
Our ancient sages articulated it in these words : Ekam Sat Viprah Bahudha Vadanti
( The truth is one , wise men describe it differently ) .
They also taught us the secular canon which is the basis of our nationhood : Sarva Panth Samabhava ( Equal respect for all faiths ) . ”
It is worth noting here that as a true swayamsevak ( volunteer of the RSS ) , Vajpayee knows what he means .
Remember his proclamation : “ The Sangh is my soul . ”
Yet he makes a glaring linguistic slip in translating panth ( religious sect or order ) as faith .
When he received the RG Joshi Foundation ’s Rashtriya Ekatmata ( National Unity ) award in Mumbai in 1995 , Vajpayee had declared that Hindutva and Indian - ness are one and the same .
The former prime minister ’s well - known expertise in doublespeak notwithstanding , is there any dictionary – apart from the unique RSS glossary of Savarkarian Hindutva – that translates “ panth ” as “ faith ” ?
Can this be seen as anything other than a systematic linguistic sabotage of the basic structure of the Constitution ?
Given the Vedic pedigree and genesis of the term Hindutva , one can appreciate Atal Bihari Vajpayee ’s somewhat tortuous journey towards accepting the “ synonymity ” of Hindutva and Bharatiyatva ( Indian - ness ) .
But does this mean that the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) will change its name to the “ Hindu ” Janata Party ?
It is inconceivable that the BJP will ever take this ultimate nomenclatural ideological leap .
The term “ Hindutva ” , for all its rigmarole about all - inclusive Hindu-ness , cannot connote the comprehensiveness , breadth or a certain secular cultural synthesis peculiar to the confluence of a medley of religions , eastern and western , that have grown together over centuries in the term “ Bharatiya ” .
And if ever the BJP rechristens itself in reckless Hindu manifestation , it will immediately be branded as “ fundamentalist ” and “ communal ” , as the Muslim League or the Vishwa Hindu Parishad ( VHP ) are .
It is thus easy to see why despite all its ideological compulsions to paint the Indian map a saffron colour the BJP has prudentially continued with the term “ Bharatiya ” and still harbours inner reservations that “ Hindutva ” and “ Bharatiyatva ” can not be one and the same .
Yet while the BJP is willing to strike but afraid to wound the “ Bharatiyatva ” concept frontally ( despite Vajpayee ’s categorical assertion that Hindutva is synonymous with Bharatiyatva ) , because it is still the Bharatiya Janata Party and not the “ Hindu ” Janata Party its Hindutva ideology received judicial imprimatur from the Supreme Court of India in its judgement in the 1995 Manohar Joshi election petition case .
The Supreme Court judgement in cases against elected representatives of the Shiv Sena and BJP , which upheld the concept of Hindutva as a “ way of life of the people in the subcontinent ” , reveals how even the highest judicial forum is not immune to the deceptive spell of Vedic Hindu metaphysical concepts and so - called Hindu tradition .
The judgement is at once a high watermark of Hindutva ’s impact on the highest judicial echelons of the country as well as a crucial challenge to the preambular secular constitutional character of the Indian nation .
In this case the Supreme Court chose to act outside its jurisdiction and to do so unnecessarily i.e. arriving at a definition of “ Hindutva ” and “ Hinduism ” – something even leading scholars have shied away from .
The apex court rushed in where angels fear to tread only to open another Pandora ’s box .
The court did not pause to consider that if Hinduism and Hindutva per se was a way of life this could equally be true of Islam , Christanity or any other religion .
In ancient times India was known as “ Jambu Dvipa ” or “ Bharat Varsha ” .
As Sanskrit scholar and author Mahamahopadhyaya PV
Kane says in his monumental History of Dharma Shastra , the correct word to describe our country must be “ Bharatvarsha ” .
It is incredible therefore to encounter such colossal ignorance of our ancient heritage and culture .
Yet perhaps it is not ignorance at all .
Perhaps the learned judges were simply unable to dissociate from the profound impact of their Hindu upbringing and look dispassionately at the fundamentalist manifestation of the “ Hindu ” spectre flaunted by the BJP .
Such “ faithful ” aberrations at even the highest judicial level are sufficient indication of the irreparable damage being wrought on India ’s secular constitutional fabric .
In a strong rebuttal of the Supreme Court ’s pronouncements in an article in the Economic and Political Weekly of September 21 , 1996 , writers Brenda Cossman and Ratna Kapur have argued that “ Hindutva continues to be a political category that at its core is an attack on the legitimacy of minority rights ” and that the “ Supreme Court has failed to understand the assault on religious minorities that is a constituent element of the concept of Hindutva .
From its roots in the writing of Savarkar to its contemporary deployment by the likes of Bal Thackeray , Manohar Joshi , Sadhvi Ritambara and LK Advani , Hindutva has been based on the idea of Indian society fractured by the conflict between Hindus and Muslims , wherein the majority of Hindus have been and continue to be oppressed at the hands of the Muslim minority .
Hindutva is a call to unite against these religious minorities ; at best it is a call to assimilate these minorities into the ostensibly more tolerant fabric of Hinduism , and at its more modest assimilationist mode and in its more extreme and violent mode , Hindutva is an attack on the rights , indeed , on the very legitimacy of religious minorities .
As a call to assimilate or otherwise undermine the very identity and integrity of minority communities , it is based on a total disregard and lack of respect for other religious groups . ”
This is precisely the dilemma and danger the Jain community is contending with in its fight for recognition as a minority community .
In a powerful theoretical exploration of Hindutva and fascism and the RSS ’ ability to capitalise on such anti-secular traditions , political commentator Aijaz Ahmad says in his book , Lineages of the Present : Political Essays , that we in India need to be especially careful in our understanding of the relationship between fascism and the oppression of minorities .
As Ahmad puts it , “ Racism , in our case , communalism , can arise as the centrepiece of fascist demagogy and fascists can then fashion a comprehensive programme for organising the heretofore unorganised mass morbidity ; countless members of the minority can undoubtedly suffer in the process and there may be even a fully fledged holocaust ; but the real object of the fascists is not the elimination of the minority but the construction of a fascist state , hence the subjugation of the whole society . ”
The basic ideological ambivalence in the terms “ Bharatiya ” and “ Hindu ” can be best appreciated by comparing two statements made by Atal Bihari Vajpayee , one in 1980 and the other in 1995 .
In 1980 Vajpayee said : “ I still feel that instead of the phrase “ Hindu Rashtra ” we should use “ Bharatiya Rashtra ” .
Contrast this with his statement in December 1995 : “ There is no difference between Hindutva and Bharatiyatva , in Hindutva alone are the roots of Bharat . ”
Vajpayee ’s ideological evolution over a decade and a half , his progression to “ Hindutva ” being indistinguishable from “ Bharatiyatva ” , clearly demonstrates the Bharatiya Janata Party ’s inexorable march towards a “ Hindu ” India , thus returning full circle to Savarkar ’s vision of India in his book , Hindutva :
“ Asindhu Sindhu Paryanta yasya Bharatbhumika pitrubhu punyabhu sarvaih hindu iti smritah ” i.e .
“ One who considers the country or nation spread between the Sindhu river and the sea as his Fatherland and Holy Land is verily a Hindu . ”
It is pertinent to note that instead of “ Motherland ” Savarkar calls the country “ Fatherland ” , a peculiar definitive patrilineal concept characteristic of Vedic and “ Hindu ” Brahmanism that later developed into the racist and fascist Nazi concept of a pure Aryan “ Vaterland “ , thus making the fascist genealogy of Hindutva clearly evident .
According to this convenient portmanteau definition of “ Hindu ” , most Indians , except of course Muslims and Christians , comprising those who believe in the Vedas as well as those who do not believe in the Vedas ( such as Jains , Buddhists and Sikhs ) are lumped together as “ Hindus ” .
As explained by Hindutva ideologue , JS Karandikar , in his Marathi book Hindutvavada : “ Although Jains , Buddhists , Vedic , Burmese , Arya , Sikh , Manbhava , belong to different religious sects , Hinduism is alone the spring source of all these sects and these have grown into separate branches at various times for various reasons .
This leads to the pan-Hinduistic position of Vivekananda , stating that any religion in the world has its ultimate origin in Hinduism , but we do not want to connect Christian and Islamic religions by such far - fetched relationship . ”
Yet the Jains , Buddhists and the Sikhs have been counted as separate religious denominations right from the first census in India in 1873 under the Indian Census Act .
On April 11 , 2006 , Mahavir Jayanti day , LK Advani , leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha , issued a press statement in Pune under the following headings :
Ø “ Communal reservations , fuelled by the politics of minorityism , could lead to fragmentation of Hindu society .
Ø
“ Let there be a national debate on extending quota obligations to minority education institutions . ”
After paying his tributes to Mahavira , Advani went on to say : “ I salute the Jain samaj in India which has shown how , in spite of being relatively small in number , a community can prosper in trade , commerce and various professions solely on the strength of the hard work and dedication of its members .
The Jain community has always been in the forefront of philanthropic activities in education , health care , care of the destitute and the disabled , care of animals .
It is also a model to all others in terms of national integration and social harmony .
“ Demand for “ minority status ” to Jains is flawed and fraught with peril : Lately I have heard a few voices – marginal and not mainstream – from within the Jain community that they be declared as a minority community .
The principal reasons behind this demand are twofold :
“ Firstly , those who raise this demand think that with the Congress party and some other parties announcing religion - based reservations for minorities , securing a “ minority ” status for the Jain community would enable its members to enjoy the benefit of quotas in education and jobs … ” ( Press Release issued by the BJP office , Pune , April 11 , 2006 ) .
This was definitely a prelude to the Freedom of Religion Bill in Gujarat .
Impact of the Hinduisation process on the Jain population
In this context it is imperative to note the insidious impact of the Hinduisation process on the Jain population .
Hinduism has never been a proselytising religion like Christianity or Islam but the relentless Hindutva propaganda that Jains are Hindus results in the surreptitious “ conversion ” of Jains through their misleading enumeration as Hindus in the census .
This becomes glaringly evident if we look at the census figures .
The growth rate of the Jain population between 1951 - 1981 was , on an average , 24 - 25 per cent per decade as the community ’s population doubled , over 30 years , from 16,18,406 in 1951 to 32,06,038 in 1981 .
This more or less conforms to the demographic pattern whereby a given population doubles , on an average , in three decades .
In previous decades i.e. before 1951 the census enumeration of Jains was faulty .
Hence , in pursuance of a Jain delegation ’s representation to Vallabhbhai Patel , the government of India issued a direction that Jains should be properly designated as distinguished from Hindus .
As a result , for the next three decades there was a reasonably dependable census enumeration of Jains .
However , in the 1991 census the Jain population is enumerated at 33,52,706 , which shows a growth rate of just four per cent even as the rest of the Indian population registered a growth of about 23.8 per cent .
Contrast this with the growth rate of the Jain population at 26 per cent in the very next decade i.e. from 1991 - 2001 .
This only confirms the apprehensions of the Jain community that the BJP - VHP propaganda that Jains are Hindus is taking its demographic toll .
Historiographical ambiguity of “ Hindu ” and Hinduism Tracing the genealogy of the term “ Hindu ” , which was in use among Europeans from the early 17th century , Will Sweetman , the distinguished scholar of Asian religions , said :
“ One of the most striking advances in modern scholarship is the view that there is no such thing as an unbroken tradition of Hinduism , only a set of discrete traditions and practices reorganised into a larger entity called “ Hinduism ” . ”
Perhaps the first to criticise the term Hinduism and to advocate abandoning its use was Canadian scholar of religion , Wilfred Cantwell Smith :
“ The term “ Hinduism ” is , in my judgement , a particularly false conceptualisation , one that is conspicuously incompatible with any adequate understanding of the religious outlook of Hindus .
Even the term “ Hindu ” was unknown to the classical Hindus .
“ Hinduism ” as a concept certainly they did not have .
And indeed one has only to reflect on the situation carefully to realise that it would necessarily have been quite meaningless to them . ”
The far - reaching and politically damaging consequences of such an inherently deceptive connotation are documented in a clinching argument by the American historian of India , Robert Frykenberg , who argues that : “ the concept of “ Hinduism ” as denoting a single religious community has already done enormous , even incalculable , damage to structures undergirding the peace , security and unity of the whole Indian political system .
What ’s more , continued popular use of this concept and popular belief in the existence of a monolithic “ Hinduism ” – in short , fervent adherence to any doctrine which assumes that there is one single religion embraced by the “ majority ” of all peoples in India – can still do even greater damage .
If such usages and beliefs continue to be dogmatically and persistently maintained , there is no telling how much more harm such a notion may do to the well - being of India ’s peoples . ”
As famed German sociologist , Max Weber has pointed out : “ Only in recent literature have the Indians themselves begun to designate their religious affiliation as Hinduism .
It is the official designation of the English census for the complex of religion also described in Germany as Brahmanism . ”
And as explained by him further : “ In truth , it may well be concluded that Hinduism is simply not a ‘ religion ’ in our sense of the word . ”
How did this modern myth of Hinduism begin ?
It had its origin in the “ orientalism ” created by the colonial Sanskrit scholars of the 19th century .
In his book , Orientalism and Religion : Post - Colonial Theory , India and ‘ The Mystic East ’ , religion and philosophy scholar , Richard King observes :
“ William Jones in his role as Supreme Court judge in India , initiated a project to translate the Dharmasastras in the misguided belief that this represented the law of the Hindus , in order to circumvent what he saw as the ‘ culpable bias ’ of the native pundits .
In taking the Dharmasastras as a binding law book , Jones manifests the Judaeo - Christian paradigm within which he conceived of religion and the attempt to apply such a book universally reflects Jones ’ ‘ textual imperialism ’ .
The problem with taking the Dharmasastras as pan-Indian in application is that the texts themselves were representative of a priestly elite ( the Brahmin castes ) , and not of Hindus in toto .
Thus even within these texts there was no notion of a unified Hindu community , but rather an acknowledgment of a plurality of local , occupational and caste contexts in which different customs and or rules applied . ”
King goes on to say : “ It was thus in this manner that ‘ society was made to conform to ancient dharmasastras texts , in spite of those texts ’ insistence that they were overridden by local and group custom .
It eventually allowed Anglicist administrators to manipulate the porous boundary between religion as defined by texts and customs they wished to ban ’ ” ( author ’s italics quoting from Rosane Rocher ’s British Orientalism in the Eighteenth Century , p. 242 ) .
This colonial construct of “ Hinduism ” contributed , according to Richard King , to the merging of the Brahmanical forms of religion with Hinduism , which is notable in the “ tendency to emphasise Vedic and Brahmanical texts and beliefs as central and foundational to the ‘ essence of Hinduism ’ and in the modern association of ‘ Hindu doctrine ’ with the various Brahmanical schools of the Vedanta ” ( p. 102 ) .
Hindutva ideology and infiltration
In October 2006 , during a public meeting on the Malegaon bomb blasts organised by Citizens for Justice and Peace , Mumbai , hard - hitting speeches were made by BG Kolse Patil , former judge of the Bombay High Court , and SM Mushrif , former commissioner of police , Pune , on how the RSS has infiltrated the Indian administration .
There has long existed a strong suspicion , ever since the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi , that RSS cadres have infiltrated various administrative departments in the country .
This fact was also noted by Vallabhbhai Patel when the RSS was banned in the wake of the Mahatma ’s assassination .
Describing the antecedents of the conspiracy to murder the Mahatma and the lack of security despite the bomb explosion at a meeting that Gandhi was addressing in Delhi on January 20 , 1948 , Gandhi ’s personal secretary , Pyarelal observes in Mahatma Gandhi : the Last Phase ( 1958 ) :
“ What , however , surprises one , is that in spite of the definite and concrete information of which the authorities were in possession , they should have failed to trace and arrest the conspirators and frustrate their plan .
The failure was an index of the extent of the rot that had permeated many branches of the services , not excluding the police .
In fact later it was brought to light that the RSS organisation had ramifications even in the government departments and many police officials , not to mention the rank and file , gave their sympathy and even active help to those engaged in RSS activities …
A letter ( to ) Sardar Patel after the assassination of Gandhiji from a young man , who according to his own statement had been gulled into joining the RSS organisation but was later disillusioned , described how members of the RSS at some places had been instructed beforehand to tune in their radio sets on the fateful Friday for the “ good news ” .
After the news , sweets were distributed in RSS circles in several places …
The rot was so insidious that only the supreme sacrifice could arrest or remove it ” ( p. 756 ) .
If the poisonous rot of RSS ideology ran so deep at the dawn of India ’s freedom , one can only shudder at its hydra - headed extent and its cancerous damage to the body politic today .
There is striking evidence that even supposedly independent arms of the Indian administration , such as the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) , are now under the RSS ’ sway .
According to reports , while addressing an RSS rally former director of the CBI , Joginder Singh proclaimed that the “ RSS is the only hope of the nation ” .
In 1964 I corresponded at length with the chairman of the Gandhi Memorial Fund , RR Diwakar , expressing shock and indignation at the revelation of a Poona editor that six months prior to the actual assassination , Nathuram Godse had divulged his plan to murder Mahatma Gandhi .
Diwakar then consulted some highly placed individuals and there was a furore in Parliament .
Ultimately , the government of India appointed a commission of inquiry to investigate once again the conspiracy to murder Mahatma Gandhi .
Twenty years after Mahatma Gandhi ’s assassination , the Jeevan Lal Kapur Commission of Inquiry concluded : “ All these facts taken together were destructive of any theory other than the conspiracy to murder by Savarkar and his group . ”
Inspiration for the RSS cadres and their paramilitary training was derived from Benito Mussolini ’s fascist paramilitary groups , the Blackshirts , after RSS mentor and founder , BS Moonje visited the Italian dictator in 1931 .
As detailed in Marzia Casolari ’s article , “ Hindutva ’s foreign tie - up in the 1930s : Archival evidence ” ( Economic and Political Weekly , January 22 , 2000 ) :
“ To understand militant Hinduism , one must examine its domestic roots as well as foreign influence .
In the 1930s Hindu nationalism borrowed from European fascism to transform ‘ different ’ people into ‘ enemies ’ .
Leaders of militant Hinduism repeatedly expressed their admiration for authoritarian leaders such as Mussolini and Hitler and for the fascist model of society .
This influence continues to the present day .
This paper presents archival evidence on the would - be collaborators . ”
As Marzia Casolari notes : “ Defining the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) and , in general , the organisations of militant Hinduism as undemocratic , with authoritarian , paramilitary , radical , violent tendencies and a sympathy for fascist ideology and practice , has been a major concern for many politically oriented scholars and writers .
This has been the case with the literature , which started with Gandhi ’s assassination and continues up to the present day with works such as Amartya Sen ’s “ India at Risk ” , ( The New York Review of Books , April 1993 ) and Christophe Jaffrelot ’s The Hindu Nationalist Movement in India ( Viking , New Delhi , 1996 ) .
The latest book published on the subject is the well - known Khaki Shorts and Saffron Flags ( Orient Longman , New Delhi , 1993 ) , which came out soon after the destruction of the Babri Masjid .
As a result , the fascist ideological background of Hindu fundamentalism is taken for granted never proved by systematic analysis .
This is an outcome that is , to a certain extent , explained by the fact that most of the aforementioned authors are political scientists and not historians .
“ It is a fact that many of those who witnessed the growth of Hindu radical forces in the years around the second world war were already convinced of the Sangh ’s fascist outlook .
Particularly acute was the perception that the Congress had of these organisations and their character .
There is no need to mention the already well - known opinion of Nehru who right from the beginning had pointed at these organisations as communalist and fascist .
Less well known is the fact that , as shown by a confidential report circulated within the Congress most probably at the time of the first ban of the RSS after Gandhi ’s assassination , the similarity between the character of the RSS and that of fascist organisations was already taken for granted …
“ To demonstrate this , I will reconstruct the context from which arose the interest of Hindu radicalism in Italian fascism right from the early 1920s .
This interest was commonly shared in Maharashtra and must have inspired BS Moonje ’s trip to Italy in 1931 .
The next step will be to examine the effects of that trip , namely how BS Moonje tried to transfer fascist models to Hindu society and to organise it militarily , according to fascist patterns .
An additional aim of this paper is to show how , about the end of the 1930s , the admiration for the Italian regime was commonly shared by the different streams of Hindu nationalism and the main Hindu leaders . ”
As emphasised by Casolari : “ More generally the aim of this paper is to disprove Christophe Jaffrelot ’s thesis that there is a sharp distinction between Nazi and fascist ideology on one side and RSS on the other as far as the concept of race and the centrality of the leader are concerned . ”
Hope for the Jains For the Jains in India , however , there are some encouraging judicial straws in the wind .
The latest division bench judgement delivered by Dalveer Bhandari in the Supreme Court is a significant pointer that all is not lost for the Jain minority .
The judgement dated August 21 , 2006 , in the case of Committee of Management , Kanya Junior High School Bal Vidya Mandir , Etah , UP vs Sachiv , UP , Basic Shiksha Parishad , Allahabad , UP & Others , delivered by judges , SB Sinha and Dalveer Bhandari , emphatically states : “ ( The ) Jain religion indisputably is not a part of Hindu religion .
The question as to whether the Jains are part of the Hindu religion is not open to debate .
Jains have a right to establish and administer their own institution .
But only because an institution is managed by a person belonging to a particular religion the same would not ipso facto make the institution run and administered by a minority community .
A minority is determinable by reference to the demography of a state .
Whether an institution is established and administered by a minority community or not may have to be determined by the appropriate authority in terms of the provisions of the statute governing the field .
Furthermore , minority institutions are not immune from the operations of the measures necessary to regulate their functions .
To what extent such regulations would operate , however , again is a matter which would be governed by the statute .
“ Minority communities do not have any higher rights than the majority .
They have merely been conferred additional protection .
This has been laid down by an 11 - judge bench of this court .
[ See : PA Inamdar & Others vs State of Maharashtra & Others , ( 2005 ) 6 SCC 537 . ]
“ The court in the said judgement also dealt with the object of Article 30 ( 1 ) of the Constitution .
The court in para 97 of the judgement observed the relevant para which reads as under : “ The object underlying Article 30 ( 1 ) is to see the desire of minorities being fulfilled that their children should be brought up properly and efficiently and acquire eligibility for higher university education and go out in the world fully equipped with such intellectual attainments as will make them fit for entering public services , educational institutions imparting higher instructions including general secular education .
Thus the twin objects sought to be achieved by Article 30 ( 1 ) in the interest of minorities are : ( i ) to enable such minority to conserve its religion and language , and ( ii ) to give a thorough , good , general education to children belonging to such minority .
So long as the institution retains its minority character by achieving and continuing to achieve the abovesaid two objectives , the institution would remain a minority institution . ” ”
In view of the foregoing evidence I would respectfully submit that the proposed Freedom of Religion ( Amendment ) Bill 2006 as passed by the Gujarat assembly is clearly a violation of the constitutional religious identity of Jains and Buddhists and urge that it should be rejected .

We 're really proud of that .
We have great people here that make it happen , and that 's only going to be enhanced by this .
That 's really what Frank and John and the other folks at EA are looking for .
They 're looking for excellence in games , the best story - driven games in the world .
We 're proud to be part of that team .
GZ : I think there 's been a lot of discussion outwardly about the structural changes that have gone on at EA , around the new label law they 've adopted .
One thing you have to keep in mind , too , is that John has an opportunity to work right on the ground level with some really great developers -- BioWare - Pandemic .
What we bring to our products is to create that passion , excitement .
What what better way to do it than to do it in the largest video game company in the world .
RM : We can only talk from our perspective in working with John , spending a lot of time him and Frank recently , and how much respect we have for both of them .
How passionate they are about the things that we bring , and how excited they are to have us join .

They are the best publisher in the world , and I think the fans are going to see great things in the future from us as a team .
GZ : Yeah , we own .
It 's almost done , and it 's really awesome .
Ray and I have finished it multiple times .
We 've played it a ton , and we can really confidently say it 's the best thing BioWare 's ever made .
It 's a truly amazing game .
We 've done a lot of other things , in the past , talking aboutin the past as well , that 's something we 'll be talking more about shortly , and a couple other little things under our hat that we 're not talking about .
We 've got unique IP we 're creating , as well as the Sonic DS game we 're working on as well .
Lot of things in the oven right now .
RM : Yep . Microsoft and Sega are great partners , and we 're proud to work with them .is... certainly Microsoft has added a ton of value to that product , and it's an Xbox 360 exclusive , and we really hand - crafted it , really carefully , to make sure that it 's taking full advantage of the platform , and the fans are going to get a great game out of it .
It 's been a great partnership with Sega as well .
We 're really proud to work on the Sonic RPG for DS.GZ : There 's certainly the opportunity to .
One of the things we 're quite excited about is , I just think in their ' technology club ' , so to speak , there 's a lot of amazing technology in the company , and we 've got some really great technology as well .
So a real sort of organic way we can sort of share what we 've done and learn what they 've done and find things that can make better games , and that 's just great for the gamers .
RM :
You gotta go back to our mission statement in the studio : to deliver the best story - driven games in the world .
I think that really says a lot about what our value set is and what we 're trying to pursue .
I think we 're excited to pursue that , and innovate even more in that space .
GZ : Certainly , we have a good idea what the game is and it's really exciting , and we 've been tantalizing folks because we 've been talking about how it 's been playing .
We played that last week , and it 's really cool .
It 's a great place to be right now .
Online is a huge market , and we think that the talent that we can bring and the thought and the know - how to the online space is great .
Making a massively multiplayer game in the BioWare mold , in some way , is very exciting .
I think we can't help but think that 's something worth getting .

The new age limit will mean that teenagers hoping to follow in the footsteps of Kate Moss , Lily Cole and Naomi Campbell , who all began modelling at 14 or 15 , will no longer be used to sell clothes .
However , fashion bosses have decided not to ban ' size zero ' models , who have sparked accusations that those , particularly the young , who seek to emulate them end up with eating disorders .
The new guidelines will come as part of the independent report into the ' size zero ' crisis .
The inquiry , under Labour peer Baroness Kingsmill , follows the death last year of two South American models working on the international circuit , one from anorexia and the other from malnutrition .
Kingsmill 's Model Health
Inquiry will release an interim report on Wednesday which also recommends better health and nutritional advice for models , improving ways in which they can complain about their working conditions and education for models ' agents about eating disorders .
The British Fashion Council , the industry 's trade body which commissioned the inquiry , has indicated that it will accept and implement the recommendations .
Industry representatives welcomed the moves .
Gavin Myall , managing director of top London agency ICM Models , said : ' I have been quite vocal on the fact that we would like it to be 16 or above .
We do have models below that age but very few , and whenever they are on jobs they are accompanied by parents and do not do shows . '
Myall also agreed with the inquiry 's refusal to propose a ban on ' size zero ' models , who are the equivalent of a UK size four .
' I do not think putting a limit on size is the answer .
Saying someone cannot work because they are not a certain size is not right , but no reputable London agency looks after size zero models . '
Susan Ringwood , chief executive of the eating disorders campaign group Beat , added : ' Banning size zero models is n't the whole answer .
The taller , younger and skinnier that someone is at the same time , that is a risk to health .
But you can also be very slender and very healthy .
You can't tell if someone is unhealthy just by looking at them . '
But the industry needed to use more models whose size is closer to that of British women - whose average size is 16 - said Ringwood .
' The fashion industry needs to widen its definition of beauty and embrace a more diverse aesthetic in the way that Dove and John Lewis have by using more normal - sized women , which is healthy . '
She endorsed any ban on under - 16 models ' because using young girls to sell women 's clothes is distasteful ' .
' Using the slender bodies of 14 - and 15 - year - old girls , who do n't have adult curves and shapes , means clothes hang beautifully on them but that 's unhealthy because it creates a chasm between the way we are in our bodies and the aspiration that that sets up .
It makes people think they are buying the youth of the model as well as the clothes themselves , ' said Ringwood .
The Model Health Inquiry 's members include fashion designers Betty Jackson and Giles Deacon , supermodel Erin O'Connor , Storm Models boss Sarah Doukas and consultant psychiatrist Dr Adrienne Key .
They have spent the past six weeks holding discussions with models , designers , magazine editors , photographers and models ' agent about the problem and remedial action .
Models have demanded the industry introduces a standard contract of employment to prevent exploitation by unscrupulous agents through , for example , excessive working hours .
Hilary Riva , the BFC 's chief executive would only say : ' The British Fashion Council commissioned the independent Model Health Inquiry to look into the health issues of models on London 's catwalks and looks forward to receiving the interim report on Wednesday . '
The facts about thin
· ' Size zero ' models became the subject of international debate when organisers of Madrid Fashion Week banned models with a body mass index below 18 last year .
· The deaths of models Luisel Ramos and Ana Carolina Reston from South America have been attributed to the size - zero trend .
· Although Milan and Madrid prohibited size zero models from their catwalks , London did not adopt the same policy last year .
· The European Union 's move is expected to halt the trend of girls trying to copy size zero fashion models .

1 R eichstag Fire - 27 Feb 1933 The Reichstag ( the German Parliament ) burned down .
A Dutch Communist named van der Lubbe was caught red -handed with matches and fire - lighting materials .
Hitler used it as an excuse to arrest many of his Communist opponents , and as a major platform in his election campaign of March 1933 .
The fire was so convenient that many people at the time claimed that the Nazis had burned it down , and then just blamed the Communists .
Modern historians , however , tend to believe that van der Lubbe did cause the fire , and that Hitler just took advantage of it .

2 G eneral Election - 5 March 1933
Hitler held a general election , appealing to the German people to give him a clear mandate .
Only 44 % of the people voted Nazi , which did not give him a majority in the Reichstag , so Hitler arrested the 81 Communist deputies ( which did give him a majority ) .
Goering become Speaker of the Reichstag .

7 N ight of the Long Knives - 30 June 1934
The SA were the thugs who Hitler had used to help him come to power .
They had defended his meetings , and attacked opponents .
By 1934 there were more than a million of them .
Historians have often wondered why Hitler turned on the SA .
But Hitler was in power in 1934 , and there was no opposition left - the SA were an embarrassment , not an advantage .
Also , Rohm , the leader of the SA , was talking about a Socialist revolution and about taking over the army .
On the night of 30 June 1934 - codeword ' Hummingbird - Hitler ordered the SS to kill more than 400 SA men .

Life is full of choices , sometimes too many choices .
Should you buy the SUV or the gas - saving hybrid car ?
Should you have the artery - clogging cheeseburger or the lean turkey sandwich ?
Sometimes we make the " right " choices , but other times we make the choices of fools .
Oddly enough , those foolish choices do n’t usually bother us for long .
Instead , they are quickly rationalized until the guilt goes away .
Why are humans so good at fooling themselves ?
Recent research by Louisa Egan , Laurie Santos and Paul Bloom at Yale University demonstrated with capuchin monkeys and 4 - year - old kids that the ability to self - deceive is deeply engrained in us primates .
Capuchins will choose one color M&M over another ( and let 's face it , all M& M 's taste the same ) and then downgrade the other color , and little kids will do the same with stickers .
Our brains , then , were n't so much designed to make choices as to pretend , no matter what , that we made the right choices .
The goal seems to be mental peace ; as we all know too well , the time from bad choice to righteousness is very uncomfortable and so the sooner we justify our decisions , the better .
Thank goodness .
Is there anything more irritating than a dinner partner who goes on and on about what they ordered ?
" Maybe I should have ordered the chicken , not the fish " heard over and over throughout dinner is enough to lob a fork across the table .
How many times can you roll your eyes at the friend having an extramarital affair who keeps explaining away his bad behavior by saying , " But my wife and I have grown apart . "
We hate to hear endless backpedaling from others , and yet we do it every day ourselves .
This kind of shilly - shallying is , in fact , so prevalent in human behavior that it must have some evolutionary basis .
That is , it must be advantageous .
Embarrassing and annoying , but advantageous .
How ?
For one thing , the brain needs to get on to other , more important decisions .
Worrying about something as silly as the choice of a new pair of shoes distracts a person from the truly important choices in life , such as how to find a mate and pass on genes .
Also , the worried brain is a useless organ .
When the time comes to make evolutionarily significant decisions , such as jumping out of the way of a car and making sure your genes are n't eliminated form the gene pool , it 's a good idea to have a clear head .
One does n't want anxiety about the choice of paper vs. plastic to get in the way of feeding the baby , that packet of one 's genes .
Rationalization , then , is the background noise that clears the mental air .
It 's our way of patting ourselves on the back in congratulations and reassurance , saying to ourselves in a comforting voice , " Really , this choice is great , the best choice .
You were right .
Now , can we get on with it ? "

Using a novel computing paradigm involving counting single electrons , computer engineers have designed nano - sized circuitry that allows tunneling electrons to perform mathematical division calculations .
While other methods utilizing quantum mechanical behavior have been proposed to increase computing power , these technqiues have yet to take full advantage of quantum mechanical properties on the nanoscale — namely , high speed and low power consumption .
Cor Meenderinck , a PhD student in Computer Engineering , and Sorin Cotofana , an Associate Professor in Computer Engineering , from the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands , have recently published their research on a quantum mechanical behavior called single - electron tunneling ( SET ) in IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology .
Building on their past SET paradigms that perform addition and multiplication operations , Meenderinck and Cotofana have presented three schemes that use tunneling electrons to quickly divide .
Electron tunneling is a phenomenon on the quantum scale that enables single electrons to “ jump ” across forbidden energy states due to their wave - like properties .
A few scientists have recently been experimenting with SET circuits based on tunnel junctions that consist of a thin insulating material layered between conducting material .
Although charge transport across an insulator is prohibited in classical mechanics , electrons can tunnel one at a time through an ultrathin insulator in quantum mechanics .
Electrons can represent bits , making SET a potential candidate to succeed CMOS technology .
“ As far as we know , very few people have been designing circuits with SET and we are not aware of any division implementations , ” Cotofana told PhysOrg.com .
“ Thus comparison is limited to CMOS .
Our circuits basically compute analog values .
However , due to the discreteness of electrons ( if the circuit is designed properly , an electron tunnels or not and electrons are localized on either side of the junction ) we end up with digitized values ; that is , the number of electrons present in a reservoir is the represented value . ”
Meenderinck ’s and Cotofana ’s first SET design to perform division was based on a sequential approximation of the quotient .
The scheme uses electron counting , with three charge reservoirs that store electrons for the dividend Z , quotient Q , and product of Q and the divisor D ( Q x D ) .
In brief , here ’s how it works :
The value of charge reservoir Q is reset to zero before each computation , and electrons tunnel from Q to reservoir Q x D , one at a time , until the value of reservoir Q x D equals that of reservoir Z .
The final answer to the problem is the value of reservoir Q ; since removing electrons increases the value of the reservoir , this is a positive value .
The researchers improved this simple but limited design by transferring electrons in groups using a “ building blocks ” method , which decreased unwanted delay and could calculate a remainder .
In reservoir Q , electrons are grouped in blocks in logarithmic numbers ( e.g. in groups of 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , etc. ) .
An electron block estimates if its transfer would cause the value of reservoir Q x D to exceed that of reservoir Z .
If so , the electron block is not transferred , and the next smaller electron block evaluates the same condition .
For example , for 22 divided by 4 , one block of 4 electrons , zero blocks of 2 electrons , and one block of 1 electron are transferred to create a positive charge of 5 in reservoir Q .
The remainder is calculated with a subtraction block , which evaluates the difference between the values of reservoirs Z and Q x D ( in this case , 22 - 20=2 ) .
The researchers ’ third scheme is fine - tuned further , and is based on the computation of periodic symmetric functions ( PSF ) .
A PSF block based on an electron trap has a periodic transfer function , of which the period can be dynamically adjusted by using a voltage controlled capacitor .
A device called a varactor would be used in place of a capacitor , which is currently still theoretical for the nanoscale .
The PSF scheme resulted in the best performance out of the three schemes , with a worst - case delay of 18 ns and a worst - case energy consumption of 2.3 eV .
Meenderinck explained that an accurate comparison to CMOS is difficult , but to give an idea of the difference , he looked at a recent publication on CMOS dividers ( ‘ Low Power Self - Timed Radix - 2 Division , ’ Jae - Hee Won and Kiyoung Choi , ISLPED , 2000 ) .
“ We calculated a delay of 18 ns and an energy consumption of 3.7e - 19 J , ” he said .
“ The scheme of Won and Choi has a delay of 33.8 ns and an energy consumption of 3.4e - 9 J. Clearly , the energy consumption is the key benefit of our SET circuit .
Considering that power has become one of the main design constraints , SET becomes a serious candidate for the post - CMOS era . ”
Meenderinck also added that , although the latency of the two circuits does not appear to differ much , that number could change when using alternative equations .
“ We used the equations of the orthodox theory , which is generally accepted by the research community in the field , ” he said .
“ However , there are some researchers ( mainly from the circuit theory area ) that disagree with this theory .
For example , J. Hoekstra proposed a circuit theory ( ‘ On the impulse circuit model for the single - electron tunnelling junction , ’ International Journal of Circuit Theory and Applications , 2004 ) in which the delay is calculated as the RC product of the circuit .
Using this theory , the delay we report would be much smaller — reduced by a factor of 100 or more . ”
For engineers who use SET to look beyond traditional ways of computation , Meenderinck and Cotofana predict that the technique has the potential to make many such improvements in future computing .

A prisoner grasps the window grill of his room inside a jail in Gaza July 10 , 2007 .
A Belgian inmate made a dramatic escape from jail for the fourth time Sunday evening after his armed accomplices landed in the prison grounds in a hijacked helicopter , prosecutors said Monday .
REUTERS / Suhaib Salem
BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - A Belgian inmate made a dramatic escape from jail for the fourth time Sunday evening after his armed accomplices landed in the prison grounds in a hijacked helicopter , prosecutors said Monday .
Nordin Benallal , self - styled “ escape king ” with several convictions for armed robbery and carjacking , has previously run from a prison van , walked out of jail wearing a wig and sunglasses and scaled a prison wall with a rope ladder .
Sunday , Benallal ’s accomplices hijacked a helicopter near the prison in Ittre , some 30 km ( 19 miles ) south of Brussels .
On landing , the helicopter was crowded by other prisoners , making takeoff impossible and causing it to crash .
The pilot and a prisoner were slightly injured .
Benallal and his cohorts then briefly seized two prison warders as hostages and fled in a car parked nearby .
It marked the second time this year that a prisoner has escaped from a Belgian jail using a helicopter .
In April , two men posing as tourists hijacked a helicopter and flew into the yard of a prison near Liege , in the east of the country , to pick up an inmate .
Countrywide : " Home price depreciation at levels not seen since the Great Depression "
An amazing conference call with Countrywide Financial ( CFC ) , the largest US mortgage underwriter .
It was beyond ugly .
Here are some notable quotables from Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo :
- " During the quarter , softening home prices continued to affect many areas of the country , and delinquencies and defaults continued to rise across all mortgage product categories as a result . "
- Delinquencies and defaults rising across all investment tools .
- Lower home prices may effect credit .
- S&P Case - Schiller is strong tracking tool for health of housing market
[ Editor : we have referenced this many times ] - CFC continues to study further tightening of loan standards for both subprime and prime - CEO believes markets will force the weaker mortgage companies to either work with bigger players or look elsewhere for business - For a Fed Governor to say that the lending group had this coming is unbelievable .
The WTF line that I do n't get is this one :
" no one saw the deterioration of real estate values coming . "
Here comes the money shot :
" Company is seeing home price depreciation at levels not seen since the Great Depression " - Previously , the company had stated they expected a turnaround in mid-2008 ; now , they say they are not sure when housing declines will cease .
Refuse to rule out house price declines in 2009 ;
- Surprising comment regarding the prime portfolio : so far what they have seen in deliquencies is due to people losing job , losing health , lost marriage , more so than any resets .
Stated that the " definition of prime may not be as high as some people think . "
- Expects to hear mergers and people going out of business in the near future ; - The company cut its 2007 earnings forecast to a range of $ 2.70 to $ 3.30 a share , down from previously lowered guidance of $ 3.50 to $ 4.30 range ( projected in April ) .
In the beginning of the year , the company said it expected to earn $ 3.80 to $ 4.80 a share . >
All told , a simply brutal and market moving nearly 3 hour conference call . . .

An example visualization of Internet topology produced by Walrus :
Source : Courtesy of Young Hyun , CAIDA
The image above is a screengrab of a Walrus visualization of a huge graph .
The graph data in this particular example depicts Internet topology , as measured by CAIDA 's skitter monitor [ 3 ] based in London , showing 535,000 - odd Internet nodes and over 600,000 links .
The nodes , represented by the yellow dots , are a large sample of computers from across the whole range of Internet addresses .
Walrus is an interactive visualization tool that allows the analyst to view massive graphs from any position .
The graph is projected inside a 3D sphere using a special kind of space based hyperbolic geometry .
This is a non-Euclidean space , which has useful distorting properties of making elements at the center of the display much larger than those on the periphery .
You interact with the graph in Walrus by selecting a node of interest , which is smoothly moved into the center of the display , and that region of the graph becomes greatly enlarged , enabling you to focus on the fine detail .
Yet the rest of the graph remains visible , providing valuable context of the overall structure .
( There are some animations available on the website showing Walrus graphs being moved , which give some sense of what this is like . )
Hyperbolic space projection is commonly know as “ focus+context ” in the field of information visualization and has been used to display all kinds of data that can be represented as large graphs in either two and three dimensions [ 4 ] .
It can be thought of as a moveable fish - eye lens .
The Walrus visualization tool draws much from the hyperbolic research by Tamara Munzner [ 5 ] as part of her PhD at Stanford .
( Map of the Month examined some of Munzner 's work from 1996 in an earlier article , Internet Arcs Around The Globe . )
Mr Obama and Mr Cheney share a French ancestor
Lynne Cheney said she had discovered while doing family research for a new book that her husband and the Illinois senator were eighth cousins .
She said she traced a common ancestor of the two men to be a 17th century immigrant from France .
She described the connection as " amazing " .
" This is such an amazing American story that one ancestor ... could be responsible down the family line for lives that have taken such different and varied paths . "
According to Mrs Cheney 's spokeswoman , Mr Obama is distantly related to Mareen Duvall , whose son Samuel married the granddaughter of Mr Cheney 's ancestor , also called Richard Cheney .
Mr Obama 's spokesman , Bill Burton , responded to the news by saying : " Every family has a black sheep . "
Mr Cheney , the brooding neo-conservative closely associated with the decision to invade Iraq , has little else in common with Mr Obama .
Mr Obama , the son of a Kenyan man and a white woman from Kansas , has earned epithets like " rock star " because of his popularity among young Democrats , and a reputation as a liberal because of his voting record in the Senate .
As well as McLaren ... did Ferrari have an advantage ?
I think so
Nigel Stepney
In the latest twist to the " spy- gate " saga , Stepney claims he received key information about McLaren 's set -up .
" I got weight distribution , I got other aspects of various parts of their car , and I was Ferrari 's employee at the time , " he told grandprix.com .
Stepney was sacked by Ferrari in July , and a team spokesman dismissed his claims as " not credible " .
" We can not take into consideration quotes from a man like him , " the spokesman added , " a man who gave 780 pages of Ferrari documents to the chief designer of McLaren , who exchanged 320 e-mails and SMS messages with him .
" Can he sound credible talking about that ? "
McLaren were fined £ 49.2 m and stripped of the constructors points for the 2007 season following a World Motor Sport Council hearing in Paris last month after being found guilty of possessing confidential Ferrari information .
But Stepney believes Ferrari 's conduct should also have been questioned .
" I got information on them [ McLaren ] .
Ferrari got off lightly , " Stepney said .
" I got information about when they [ McLaren ] were [ pit ] stopping .
I got weight distribution , I got other aspects of various parts of their car and I was Ferrari 's employee at the time . "
No one has been balancing the argument , no one has asked the question
Nigel Stepney
Former Ferrari head of performance
Stepney claims the information came from McLaren chief designer Mike Coughlan .
It was Coughlan 's sharing of similar information about Ferrari with drivers Fernando Alonso and Pedro de la Rosa that led the World Motor Sport Council of F1's governing body the FIA to punish McLaren last month .
And Stepney added : " I was aware of certain stuff they [ McLaren ] were doing at tests , fuel levels for example .
I think Ferrari should have been docked points personally .
" The question is : did I use the information , did I talk about it ?
I spoke to some people [ at Ferrari ] about it .
I can't prove it , there are no e-mails or anything ; points about the fuel and the differences between the teams were discussed inside .
" But as well as McLaren having an advantage , did Ferrari have an advantage ?
I think so .
" It looks like information was flowing only one way .
No one has been balancing the argument , no one has asked the question . "
In another twist , the BBC has seen a copy of a letter from Stepney to FIA president Max Mosley in which he claims he told the governing body about his concerns surrounding a part of the Ferrari car before the start of the season .
606 : DEBATE
No doubt there is MUCH more to come out , re Stepneygate
antifanatic
McLaren used that knowledge as part of their defence to the World Council , claiming Stepney had informed them about what he perceived to be an illegal floor on the Ferrari in a legitimate attempt at " whistle - blowing " .
Stepney says in the letter that he communicated his concerns to FIA technical adviser Peter Wright first by telephone and then e-mail , and only passed them to Coughlan later on .
At the hearing , which was on 13 September , Mosley dismissed McLaren 's claims , saying : " If there was any hint of whistle - blowing , it was not in those documents [ e - mails to Wright and FIA race director Charlie Whiting ] .
" He had the opportunity to whistle - blow at the beginning .
He did not .
Instead , he communicated the information to McLaren .
" The fact is that he did not give us information , despite being in touch with our people . "
The part of the floor Stepney had questioned was declared illegal following a request for clarification from McLaren after Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen had won the Australian Grand Prix .
Mike [ Coughlan , McLaren 's chief designer ] really had no reason to use any of this information at McLaren and to the best of my knowledge he never contemplated the idea
Nigel Stepney
Stepney also describes in the letter - the full text of which has been published on grandprix.com - how McLaren chief designer Mike Coughlan came into possession of the 780 pages of confidential Ferrari information that led to the team 's punishment .
Stepney said he had been discussing a new direction in his career with Coughlan , who is an old friend from their time at Benetton and Ferrari in the 1980s and 1990s .
Stepney said Coughlan took the documents at a meeting they had in Barcelona in April , but added : " He told me : ' Do n't worry , I wo n't use any of this stuff . '
" Mike really had no reason to use any of this information at McLaren and to the best of my knowledge he never contemplated the idea .
" You can not take items from one concept of car design , manufacture them and expect that they are going to benefit the concept of another car design .
" There was never any intention of using this information in any other team . "

When I was a kid Christmas was the most exciting day of the year .
I ’d rip open the packages to see if I finally owned what I ’d spent months hoping for .
In technology we do n’t have a scheduled yearly Christmas , but occasionally we get exciting new technology .
And I can dream of the great things I ’d like to see .
Here ’s my wish list of what I ’d like to see databases do :
Automatic Transactions
Many times when testing or troubleshooting I need to see the history of record changes .
I wish the following SQL were valid :
SELECT * FROM item_master
WHERE item_master.item_id = 475
FROM SYSDATE – 1 TO SYSDATE
Some of you are going to argue , “ What ’s wrong with creating a trigger and writing changes to a transactional table ? ” .
There is n’t anything wrong with that approach , but it ’s a time waster : create the trigger , create the table , maintain the table when fields are added / dropped , create reports on the transactional table , blah , blah .
Millions of databases around the world face the same problem and apply the same generic solutions .
Generic problems should be solved in one place , not millions of places .
Automatic Indexing
In my opinion discussions about which database is fastest is usually a moot point .
In the practical world the fastest database is the one with the best indexing .
( And sufficient IO capacity )
Most databases are severely under indexed .
Above a certain cost threshold databases should keep statistics on queries and automatically create indexes for costly or common queries .
( Probably a combination of the two factors : a very common query with low cost deserves and index as much as a uncommon query with high cost )
The RDBMS would also need to track the cost savings of the new indexes and drop them if they no longer provide sufficient savings .
There would need to be a cap on index creation if a table has too many indexes ( i.e. if the indexes are interfering with updates and inserts )
Index creation would need to be load aware so it would n’t kick off during the busiest time of the day .
. . as you can see this would not be trivial .
Automatic indexing would not replace manually defined ( i.e. permanent ) indexes , but it would be awesome .
Especially for purchased applictaions .
Purchased applications are chronically mal - indexed ( one reason is that no one customer uses the application in exactly the same way ) and no one at the customer sites knows what goes on under the hood to fix it .
Indexing problems in purchased applications are rarely resolved in a timely manner ( or at all ) .
Appeal to MySQL Developers
I wish these features were part of Oracle or SQL Server , but other than natural product evolution I do n’t think the giants have much innovation left in them .
If we ’re going to see innovation in databases it has to come from somewhere else .

When you 're looking for a soul mate , why let a spouse slow you down ?
There 's a new emphasis in marriages on emotional togetherness , a standard some relationships just cannot meet .
Good thing nobody bats an eye anymore when young , childless couples divorce .
gentleman in waiting Peter Nadeau , 37 , is comfortable being divorced and hopeful he 'll find a better match next time .
He 's pictured at home in Somerville .

( Photos by Tanit Sakakini )
At 24 , Kathryn Murphy had the life she thought she wanted : two Ivy League degrees , the beginnings of a promising career , and a marriage proposal from a man she adored .
She had met him at a party in New York City soon after graduating from college and was instantly attracted to his intelligence , humor , and ambition .
The couple ran the Boston Marathon together and planned adventures around the world .
So when he presented her with a diamond ring after less than two years of dating , Murphy had no second thoughts .
" You 're 24 years old , and the guy you 're in love with proposes with a big ring , " she says over a snack at the Grafton Street Pub & Grill in Harvard Square , her face still flushed from yoga class .
" Are you going to say no ? "
Murphy and her fiance had a good reason to hurry into marriage :
Her father was terminally ill .
The couple pushed their original wedding date forward six months to make sure he could attend .
But instead of the emotional security the energetic blonde says she was hoping for , once " the realities of life and marriage " set in , she found herself floundering .
" I had never , ever been independent , " she says .
" I 'd never been self - supporting .
I sort of started to panic , like , ' Oh , my God .
What happened to me ? ' "
As the couple approached their fourth anniversary , Murphy , then working as a writer , realized she did not share her husband 's vision for the future .
He wanted , she says , to be " a cutting - edge academic researcher traveling around the world .
Although I wanted to want that , really wanted more stability . "
Instead of stability , she got more upheaval :
The couple , who had already lived in Los Angeles and New Jersey , moved to Boston for her husband 's career .
" Any sense of my ' self , ' which really had n't had a chance to develop yet , was gone , " Murphy remembers .
" Maybe I was too young to know how to be in a partnership while still being myself . "
Acknowledging that their marriage was in trouble , the pair followed all the prescribed steps :
They sought counseling ; they talked , and talked some more .
But the process only fed Murphy 's misery and her conviction that they would not be compatible in the long run .
Murphy says she and her husband " looked at each other and said , ' We 're young , we do n't have kids .
Let 's cut our losses . ' "
They separated five years after their wedding and divorced a year later , when Murphy was 30 .
Newly single , she veered away from writing and toward the more lucrative field of law , so she would be able to support herself comfortably .
Now 33 , Murphy is remarried , has finished her second year of law school , and is expecting her first baby this month .
" I believe in marriage , " she says .
" If it does n't work , I do n't believe that means you have to be with the wrong person or be miserable for the rest of your life .
I do n't believe the intention of marriage is to make you unhappy . "
What the intention of marriage is has been a matter of national debate , especially since Massachusetts became the first state to offer marriage licenses to same - sex couples .
But now the reasons that male - female couples marry are in flux - especially among Murphy 's peers .
Academics , therapists , and divorce attorneys say that for young , childless couples where both parties are educated , employed , and capable of financial independence , emotional fulfillment tends to outrank other reasons to get married to a degree that would have been almost unimaginable for their parents or grandparents .
Today , emotional fulfillment may be the only reason to marry - and the lack of it can mean the end of a marriage .
Divorce at 20 or 30 is n't new , and the numbers of failed first marriages have remained fairly constant for the last 30 years ; about one in five couples will experience separation or divorce within five years of marriage .
And true love , of course , has always been the ideal - think Jane Austen or Romeo and Juliet .
But Andrew Cherlin , a professor of sociology at Johns Hopkins University who studies marriage and family life , says that changing domestic economics - specifically , the rise of two - income families - is causing a shift in what couples are looking for when they enter a marriage .
" Three or four decades ago , you had to be married to make it " both financially and emotionally , he says .
Now , the choice is " a matter of personal happiness , " Cherlin says .
It used to be that a union was judged by how well it fulfilled both parties ' economic and social needs , while today , young people judge the success of a marriage by how well it fulfills their emotional needs .
What has also changed in the last 30 or 40 years is that many of the traditional perquisites of marriage - shared household expenses , children , sex - are no longer tied to a marriage license .
So when young people , often already living together , decide to get that piece of paper , they expect it to transport them to a higher emotional plane .
And when that does n't happen , they leave - facing little stigma and with few regrets .
A HAPPY , EMOTIONALLY FULFILLING MARRIAGE IS , OF COURSE , A good thing for society and for the individuals involved .
But therapists and divorce lawyers who work with young couples ( and young former couples ) see downsides to this narrowing in marriage 's focus .
The most obvious one is that almost no one is happy all the time , and people who expect instant , permanent bliss will be disappointed .
" We have a society that tells us that things need to be perfect in order to be acceptable , " says Stephen Howard .
A divorce attorney at K&L Gates in Boston , he estimates that about a third of his clients are childless couples in their 20s and 30s .
" You have to have the perfect car , the perfect house , the perfect job , the perfect husband or wife , " Howard says .
" If people perceive that some aspect of their life is not perfect , they get into self - doubt . "
The doubting person 's marriage , he explains , " unwinds from there . "
The second hazard is missing the difference between having a happy marriage and looking to that marriage as the primary source of one 's happiness .
Jeffrey McIntyre , a couples therapist in Cambridge , believes that young couples often run into difficulty because they do n't cultivate enough community involvement or friendships outside their marriages .
" As our culture has become more fragmented and isolated in the last 20 years , " McIntyre says , " we 've loaded up all of our intimate relationships and partnerships with huge expectations that this person is going to take care of everything . "
I 've never been married , but in the long relationships I 've had , there 's always been a stretch when we wanted to spend every weekend minute together , followed by another stretch when we did so out of habit .
Being part of a couple means having a social safety net :
Even if you never get around to anything more ambitious than Chinese takeout on a Friday night , it seems not to matter the way it does when you 're eating spare ribs solo .
But there 's a difference between enjoying the comfort of being part of a couple and suddenly realizing that your other social connections are n't quite as strong as they once were , a shift that married friends - and McIntyre - assure me becomes even more challenging once the knot is tied .
McIntyre has firsthand experience of looking to one person to fill multiple needs :
His wife , Nancy Miriam Hawley , is also his business partner .
Hawley says their practice has seen an increase in the number of young couples seeking therapy not because they 're fighting or have radically different ideas about , say , money or children , but because they 're simply not in love anymore .
Perhaps most bewildering , these couples are surprised that the passion has n't lasted .
For Arden Reamer , an upbeat , dark - haired MBA from Brookline , a lack of passion led to separation after just 20 months of marriage , when she was 30 years old .
" It did n't go wrong all at once , " she says , then corrects herself .
" It never went wrong .
But I changed .
I felt that I was n't as connected to this man romantically and passionately . "
Reamer , now 36 , and her former husband first bonded around their shared love of hiking , bicycling , and the outdoors .
But she felt something missing emotionally , and the absence became more pronounced as time passed .
She describes her ex as " very independent but distant , " much more distant than she wanted him to be .
Still , the couple tried counseling .
" It was about trying to work on the relationship and really trying to be with him , but my romantic feelings were gone , " says Reamer , a former financial analyst .
She says that by the time she and her ex-husband reached counseling , " there was too much resentment built up . "
She adds : " I did n't feel like I wanted to start a family with him .
He was my best friend , but I did n't feel in love with him anymore . "
While she believes her ex assessed their marriage in a similar light , she says that his attitude toward divorce was markedly different .
" My guess is he felt very stuck with [ the marriage ] , but he wanted to stay together , " she says .
" I felt I was starting a new decade of my life , and I wanted more for myself . "
When the couple split , " I felt numb , " Reamer recalls .
After several years of dating and single life , Reamer remarried last year and had a baby , whom she is caring for full time .
She says she believes she has found what a marriage should be : " intimacy , partnership , passion , and attraction . "
IT MAY BE EASY TO SHAKE YOUR HEAD AT young couples that split up quickly , to mutter under your breath that perhaps they ought to have worked out their true feelings before they promised before God or a justice of the peace to stick things out when the going got tough .
It 's tempting to dismiss them as self - absorbed and say that of course no relationship is as exciting and spark - filled after six years as it was after six months .
But none of the divorced people interviewed for this article went to the altar with the idea of divorce as a mental escape hatch .
Instead , they spoke of a pressure to marry that is every bit as intense as it was in the 1950s , albeit for different reasons .
" When everyone had to marry , it was n't special , " says Cherlin , the Johns Hopkins sociologist .
" Today , it distinguishes you more .
It sets you apart more from everybody else . "
Marriage , in other words , has become a luxury rather than a necessity - the lifestyle equivalent of a Jaguar convertible - and the desire to marry is closely linked to the desire for achievement .
" Marriage , " says Cherlin , " is a symbol of the good life . "
Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney is highlighting his long marriage as part of his presidential campaign .
Getting hitched gets celebrities onto the covers of magazines .
For young people , the desire to feel part of the success story can be a recipe for hasty decisions .
" I think many young people get married because they feel like it 's the next step of what you should do in life , " says Greg Jutkiewicz , 28 , a summer camp director from Ashland whose marriage led to separation after only 15 months .
In a cramped office filled with images of smiling teens and children , he reflects on how a relationship that was once on a fast track to marriage is now making the slower , more painful transition from separation to divorce .
" It was really important for her to be married and to be engaged , " he says of his soon - to - be ex-wife .
" It was something she really wanted , and she wanted it quickly . "
He says he got caught up in the hype , too .
Compact and dark - haired , Jutkiewicz speaks slowly , as if choosing his words carefully .
He now wishes he and his ex - who were 26 and 25 when they tied the knot - had spent their engagement discussing their relationship more and the wedding 's color scheme less .
" We were on different pages with a lot of things , " he remembers .
Still , Jutkiewicz was startled and hurt when his wife announced that she wanted out of the marriage .
He believes she became dissatisfied because she had expected the state of being married to transform their relationship - to turn Jutkiewicz into a guy who spends a lot of time at home , as opposed to the way he describes himself : a guy who " has no problem working for 23 hours a day and sleeping for one . "
The idea that marriage will be transformative and a source of unparalleled emotional fulfillment is attractive in a Holy Grail kind of way .
Last summer , I attended a lovely wedding in which the groom made a speech to the bride in front of guests .
He told her he'd spent his single days trying to find someone perfect , only to eventually find someone " better than perfect . "
The moment spoke to something I 've noticed at other friends ' weddings .
Instead of a brief exchange of vows , many couples are also delivering testimonials about the quality of their relationship .
Wedding websites that tell the story of the marriage proposal , often in intimate detail , have become commonplace .
" People want to show off when they get married , " says Cherlin .
" They want to display their marriage to their friends . "
Increasingly , the theme of the display seems to be the quality of the romantic connection .
WHILE TWENTY - SOMETHINGS WANT EMOTIONAL fulfillment from their marriages , they also see attaining that happiness as an important life achievement .
As a result , divorce can inspire feelings of failure akin to a job loss , along with a broken heart .
" I think when you 've always been sort of a success - driven person , it 's difficult to admit that you failed at something , " says Kathryn Murphy , the law student .
" Society rewards you for certain things .
It 's like : ' You got married - check ! ' "
Her divorce meant she had to " uncheck that box " - a process that meant reevaluating the rest of her life plan , too .
Still , she discovered that the sense of failure she felt after her divorce was almost exclusively internal .
Murphy 's friends and family supported her decision , and she found almost no stigma attached to her divorced status when she started dating again .
Reamer , too , was pleasantly surprised .
She can't recall a single suitor looking askance .
It seems that as happiness has become the central goal of marriage , the taint surrounding divorce has waned .
" If marriage is based on personal fulfillment , it 's hard to argue that an unfulfilled person should stay married , " says Cherlin .
" There 's much less reason for other people to tell you to stay married . "
Certainly , a space alien who looked at our magazine racks might assume women are supposed to don bridal veils every year or two , rather than once in a lifetime .
Reese Witherspoon splits with her husband at 30 , then shows up at the Oscars looking better than ever .
A divorced Brad Pitt is embraced not just by Angelina and her brood , but by the world .
Perhaps more significant , according to a February poll by the Pew Research Center , only 9 percent of voters would be less likely to vote for a divorced presidential candidate , whereas 39 percent would be less likely to vote for a candidate who admitted to an extramarital affair .
If our expectations for our leaders mirror our hopes for ourselves , we prefer the honesty of divorce to a marriage held together at any cost .
In some social circles , divorce may even be an asset .
Friends tell me that on the Internet , divorced men in their 30s or 40s without children often have better luck than their never - married peers because they 've proved that they are n't afraid of commitment - never mind that they 've also proved that they are n't afraid of ending a commitment .
One of my friends prefers dating divorced men , because , as she puts it , " they 've been broken in . "
She imagines such men have learned from their mistakes and have figured out how to have relationships .
There are no data to indicate whether an early divorce has any effect on either happiness or longevity in later marriages , but some of those who divorce young do feel an added pressure to get it right the second time around .
I spent several years dating a man who had been married and divorced by his mid-20s .
He used to joke that if you get divorced once , everybody will sympathize , but if you get divorced twice , the only person who will talk to you is Jerry Springer .
It is , perhaps , a peculiar distinction :
If there 's no stigma surrounding a first divorce , why should there be a stigma surrounding a second ?
Perhaps it 's related to the desire for marriage to produce fulfillment :
We can accept that people misjudge their own happiness once , but misjudging twice calls into question the efficacy of the new definition itself .
And a generation that continues to strive toward marriage , and that knows it can have all the old trappings without that piece of paper , wants very much to believe in the happy ending .
Peter Nadeau , a museum exhibit designer from Somerville , has been divorced for eight years , but his eyes still tear up when he talks about his ex .
He remembers her as a woman he traveled well with and was " very much in love with " in his 20s .
An artist , he designed the engagement ring he had made for his bride .
Nadeau , whose shoulder - length brown hair and earrings blend into the hipster crowd in Davis Square 's Diesel Cafe , is now 37 and has lived with two girlfriends since his marriage , and ended a few relationships when the women began pushing for more .
Divorce , he says , " taught me to take my time . "
His ex-wife was n't the one .
He loved her , yet " she did n't let me in " emotionally , he says .
He has yet to find the person he feels confident will be a true " life partner . "
As for the woman with whom he thinks he can find that elusive happiness ?
" Someone who knows who they are , is comfortable with themselves , is OK doing absolutely nothing sometimes and picking up at a moment 's notice other times .
Someone who enjoys being around people , is not afraid of the water , loves to cook , loves to eat . "
Nadeau holds up his hands and laughs , as if to point out the impossibility of accurately describing the woman of his dreams .
" A life partner , " he repeats .
" That 's what I 'm going for . "
Which takes me back to that wedding last summer .
The " better than perfect " speech was a sweet moment , and I was happy for my friends .
But afterward , another unmarried guest came over to talk .
" Dating was hard enough when I felt like I had to find perfection , " he said .
" Now I feel like I have to top it ! "
He was kidding - mostly .

I love this video from Brigham Young University 's MAGICC lab [ via RC Groups ] .
They show UAVs doing laser range finder - based obstacle avoidance , optical flow - based canyon following , formation flying , cooperative timing including simultaneous arrival ( and a successful recovery from a midair collision ) .
There are even some bloopers .
The MAGICC site has lots more videos , though I could n't find a high resolution version of the YouTubed highlight reel .

US President George W. Bush says a nuclear Iran would mean World War III .
Israeli newscasts feature Gog & Magog maps of the potential conflict .
US President George W. Bush said a nuclear Iran would mean World War III .
Israeli newscasts featured Gog & Magog maps of the likely alignment of nations in that potential conflict .
Channel 2 and Channel 10 TV showed the world map , sketching the basic alignment of the two opposing axes in a coming world war , in a manner evoking associations of the Gog and Magog prophecy for many viewers .
The prophecy of Gog and Magog refers to a great world war centered on the Holy Land and Jerusalem and first appears in the book of Yechezkel ( Ezekiel ) .
On one side were Israel , the United States , Britain , France and Germany .
On the other were Iran , Russia , China , Syria and North Korea .
US President Bush said Wednesday during a press conference that Iran attaining nuclear weapons raises the risk of " World War III . "
" If Iran had a nuclear weapon , it'd be a dangerous threat to world peace , " Bush said .
" So I told people that if you 're interested in avoiding World War III , it seems like you ought to be interested [ in preventing a nuclear Iran ] … I take the threat of Iran with a nuclear weapon very seriously . ”
Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Iran Tuesday and slammed the US ’s refusal to rule out the use of force against Iran ’s nuclear project .
" Not only should we reject the use of force , but also the mention of force as a possibility , " he said .
Russia has blocked tougher UN sanctions in the UN Security Council , where it has veto power .
The Russian president asserts that there is no evidence Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons rather than a peaceful nuclear power program .
Israel ’s Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni called for a new Security Council resolution against Iran at a press conference following her meeting with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Wednesday .
" I do believe there is a need for another Security Council resolution , ” she told reporters .
“ In the past , the need to get everybody on board - including Russia and China - led to some compromises on the nature of the sanctions .
I hope this will not be the case this time . "
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert announced Wednesday a sudden trip to Moscow Thursday morning , where he will meet with Putin about Iran .
Other topics of discussion will reportedly be Russia ’s continued supply of weapons to Syria , which have then made their way into the hands of various terrorist groups based there as well .
With their vast arsenals of electronic gear , they are the most entertained generation ever .
Yet the YouTubing , MySpacing , multi- tasking teens and young adults widely seen as Hollywood ’s most wanted audience are feeling — can it be ? — a bit bored with it all .
A new Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll , the first in a series of annual entertainment surveys , finds that a large majority of the 12 - to 24 - year - olds surveyed are bored with their entertainment choices some or most of the time , and a substantial minority think that even in a kajillion - channel universe , they do n’t have nearly enough options .
“ I feel bored like all the time , ‘ cause there is like nothing to do , ” said Shannon Carlson , 13 , of Warren , Ohio , a respondent who has an array of gadgets , equipment and entertainment options at her disposal but can’t ward off ennui .
They do seem to be passionate about their electronic devices , though , especially their computers , which ranked even above cellphones when respondents were offered a “ desert island ” choice of one item .
Still , the poll suggests that the revolution in entertainment , media and technology for which many in Hollywood are already developing strategies has not yet taken hold .
For example , respondents say that traditional sources such as television advertising and radio airplay still tend to drive their decisions about movies and music more than online networking sites .
Those interested in keeping up with current events report a surprising interest in conventional news sources , especially local TV news .
And although many see their computers as a perfectly good place to watch a TV show or a movie , there does not appear to be widespread desire to take in , say , “ Spider - Man 3 " on their video iPods .
But there ’s little comfort here for movie theater owners .
The multiplex is n’t very popular either .
Even though 2006 ’s box - office grosses are running 7 % ahead of last year ’s , the poll found waning interest in seeing movies in theaters .
Although the youngest teens say they ’re hitting the multiplex as often as ever , many young adults report that they ’re seeing fewer films in theaters .
The main complaints are expensive tickets and concessions , but rude moviegoers and “ bad movies ” are factors too .
“ It does n’t seem like there ’s anything good , ” says Emma Standring - Trueblood , a 16 - year - old who is soon to start her junior year at Oak Park High School near Agoura Hills .
“ I ’d say a good episode of ‘ The West Wing ’ is better than most of the stuff that gets out there . ”
A signature trait of those surveyed is a predilection for doing several things at the same time , with a majority of females in every age group and males from 15 to 17 and 21 to 24 saying they prefer to multi-task rather than to do one thing at a time .
Nathaniel Johnson , a 17 - year - old senior at Claremont High School who took part in the survey , spoke for the 62 % of boys in his age group who like to multi-task .
He ’s a big fan of what the computer allows him to do : “ You can open five or six programs simultaneously : work on a project , type a report , watch YouTube , check e-mail and watch a movie . ”
Unlike some of his peers , who report doing as many as four or five things simultaneously — such as homework , instant messaging , surfing the Net , talking on the phone and listening to music —
Nathaniel discovered through trial and error that he could do only three things well at a time .
“ Generally , ” he said , “ you feel overwhelmed at some point if you are trying to do too many things at once . ”
Like many others surveyed , Nathaniel rarely does his homework in a quiet environment .
For him , homework and hard rock are inseparable .
“ Most people think it ’s horribly distracting , ” he said , “ but I did get a 4.0 GPA . ”
( A small number of the multi- taskers managed to fit in a video game too , but a great majority of young males who play video games — including 74 % of younger teens — do not engage in other activities while doing so . )
Young people multi-task , they say , because they are too busy to do only one thing at a time , because they need something to do during commercials or , for most ( including 64 % of girls 12 to 14 ) , it ’s boring to do just one thing at a time .
The poll , under the supervision of Los Angeles Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus , interviewed 839 teenagers ( ages 12 to 17 ) and 811 young adults ( 18 to 24 ) from June 23 to July 3 using the Knowledge Networks ’
Web panel , which provides a representative sample of U.S. households .
The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for both age group samples .
Maybe it is part of the human condition that the young are bored , but some think that this generation — children of baby boomers , sometimes called millennials — has been spoiled by the sheer volume of entertainment and technology choices available .
“ I think there is more media gratification that younger people feel entitled to , ” said Jordan Levin , who should know .
Levin , a former chief executive of the WB network , was instrumental in developing the hit young adult shows “ Felicity ” and “ Buffy the Vampire Slayer . ”
Levin is now a partner in Generate , an entertainment company whose programs , thanks to an exclusive deal with MTV Networks , will be seen on television , cellphones and the Internet .
Kids , Levin said , “ have grown up in an environment where they expect to get what they want , where they want it , when they want it . ”
Throughout Hollywood , the race is on to develop entertainment that captures the attention of this distracted generation .
The head of MTV Films just left to start a Viacom division that will make episodic shows for cellphones , iPods and computers .
BitTorrent , once known as a top site for Internet pirates , has begun serving original — and lawfully shared — programming .
The studios also are looking to video games for artistic inspiration , which makes sense given the poll finding that 67 % of boys ages 12 to 17 regularly play games on their computers .
Among the game - inspired movies in the works : “ Halo , ” “ Hitman ” and a sequel to “ Resident Evil . ”
Some theater owners have taken notice of the huge teen demand for video games .
National Amusements is renovating a theater to create a CyberZone video gaming site in Ypsilanti , Mich. , which will offer nearly 80 PCs , PlayStations and Xboxes in an area adjacent to its movie screens .
Despite the technological advances that are changing the way entertainment is delivered and consumed , good old - fashioned word of mouth — with a tech twist , thanks to text messaging — continues to be one of the most important factors influencing the choices that young people make .
As the Times / Bloomberg poll found , those recommendations ( or pans ) play a significant role in determining attendance .
When asked how soon after seeing a movie they told their friends about it , 38 % of teens and 40 % of young adults said they told their friends the same day .
“ Those text messages are a very powerful tool , ” said Jeff Blake , chairman of marketing and distribution for Sony Pictures Entertainment .
“ You certainly have the feeling that what they say in their text messages is just as important — if not more important — as the quote we put at the top of our ad .
These kids listen to each other . ”
When it comes to the content of their entertainment , those surveyed tended to be quite tolerant of violence , gross - out humor and swearing in movies .
Yet a surprisingly high number of teenage boys ( 58 % ) and even more teenage girls ( 74 % ) said they were offended by material they felt disrespected women and girls .
( How they reconcile that with their preference for the often - sexist aesthetic of rap music , the top music choice among respondents who specified a genre , is a topic for another poll . )
Respondents who considered themselves religious were much more likely to be offended by gay and lesbian content .
Young men 18 to 24 are n’t offended by much ; even material that disrespects women bothers only about 40 % of this group .
Twelve - year - old Melina Erkan , a seventh - grader in Monroe , Conn. , said she used to watch a lot of music videos on MTV and VH1 but has become increasingly turned off by the prevalent images of scantily dressed women .
“ Sometimes in the music videos these days , the women they have dancing in the background , they dress really cheap , and women do n’t really look like that and act like that , ” she said .
“ When I see that , I change the channel to something I like . ”
Hannah Montee , a 21 - year - old college student in Liberal , Mo. , said she had practically stopped watching TV because of all the vulgarity she saw .
“ I get tired of hearing all the cussing and the sexual innuendoes , ” she said .
Younger teens report that their parents keep a tight rein on their entertainment and technology habits .
Nearly 3 out of 5 in this group say their parents restrict what they download , whether it ’s music , movies or other content .
And although for many teenagers adult intrusion is unwelcome , parents can take some solace in the fact that about 15 % of 12 - to 17 - year - olds answered “ my parents ” when asked how they found out about the music they ’d most recently acquired .
Only 4 % of the 12 - to 17 - year - olds reported that their parents did n’t know much about their entertainment and communication choices .
About a quarter of young teenage boys said they fought with their parents about video games or the music they listened to , whereas girls tended to fight with their parents about cellphone use .
( Girls play video games , but fewer than 1 % of female poll respondents of all ages said they would choose a video game console if they could have only one item on a desert island from a list that also included a computer , a cellphone , a television , an iPod or an MP3 player . )
Renee Hampton , a 14 - year - old ninth - grader in Chapmansboro , Tenn. , battles with her parents over the time she spends online .
Though most teens her age reported spending less than two hours a day on the computer , Renee said that this summer she was spending eight hours a day online .
“ My parents think I need to get outside more , ” she said .
“ I say that I get outside enough . ”
Renee loves Japanese cartoons and spends a lot of her online time creating animated music videos with anime characters , which she posts on the phenomenally popular site YouTube.com .
Certain websites , she reported , are off - limits , but she was n’t sure why .
“ Hey , Mom , ” she said .
“ Why are you against MySpace ? ”
“ I have heard too many things about perverts on there and that it ’s not a good place for children , ” her mother replied .
“ Mom , ” Renee said , “ that ’s so stupid . ”
Renee may be frustrated , but her peers reported similar parental involvement .
About a third of boys and girls ages 12 to 14 said their parents did n’t let them go on social networking sites such as MySpace .
About 15 % of the kids 15 to 17 said their parents restricted access , but by age 18 , parental control had melted away .
Another concern for adults is multi-tasking .
For the most part , experts have not looked closely at how teens ’ and young adults ’ thinking skills , especially when it comes to homework , may be affected by what one software executive has dubbed “ constant partial attention . ”
“ It ’s like being in a candy store , ” said Gloria Mark , a UC Irvine professor who studies interactions between people and computers .
“ You are n’t going to ignore the candy ; you are going to try it all . ”
Mark , who has studied multi-tasking by 25 - to 35 - year - old high - tech workers , believes that the group is not much different from 12 - to 24 - year - olds , since the two groups grew up with similar technology .
She frets that “ a pattern of constant interruption ” is creating a generation that will not know how to lose itself in thought .
“ You know the concept of ‘ flow ’ ? ” asked Mark , referring to an idea popularized by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi about the benefits of complete absorption and focus .
“ You have to focus and concentrate , and this state of flow only comes when you do that .
Maybe it ’s an old - fogy notion , but it ’s an eternal one :
Anyone with great ideas is going to have to spend some time deep in thought . ”

How the poll was conducted
The Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll was conducted from June 23 to July 3 using the Knowledge Networks ’
Web - enabled panel , which provides a representative nationwide sample of U.S. households .
Of the 4,466 minors and young adults invited to participate in the survey , 1,904 ( 43 % ) responded to the survey , with 1,650 qualifying .
The 1,650 qualified respondents included 839 minors ( ages 12 to 17 ) and 811 young adults ( ages 18 to 24 ) .
The margin of sampling error for both groups is plus or minus 3 percentage points .
In order to provide as representative a sample as possible , the survey results were weighted to U.S. census figures for 12 - to 24 - year - olds in the United States in terms of age , race or ethnicity , gender and region , and for urban or rural residence and Internet access .

Contrary to expectations
So most young Americans get their news from Jon Stewart ’s “ The Daily Show ” ?
Do n’t be so sure .
The first annual Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll managed to bust a number of myths .
Among them :
Myth : More young adults cast ballots for “ American Idol ” than vote in political elections .
Truth : Only 21 % of poll respondents ages 18 to 24 said they had voted for an “ American Idol ” contestant .
But 53 % said they had voted for a candidate for public office .
*
Truth : Nearly 7 in 10 of 12 - to 17 - year - olds said their parents knew how they spent their time online .
Nearly 3 out of 5 12 - to 14 - year - olds said their parents restricted what they could download .
About a third of boys and girls ages 12 to 14 are not allowed to go on social networking sites such as MySpace.com .
Only 19 % of boys and 13 % of girls reported having no parental restrictions on computer use .
*
Truth :
More than half of teens ages 12 to 17 do n’t use social networking sites .
*
Truth : Fifty - seven percent of teens and young adults said they first heard new music on the radio .
At least 3 out of 10 in both groups learned about new music by watching a music video on TV .
*
Truth : Almost half of teens said they spent up to two hours on the Internet each day , 29 % said they spent up to four hours and 15 % said they spent more than four hours .
Twenty - three percent said they spent more than four hours watching TV .
Many do both simultaneously .
*
Truth :
The main reason young people give for not liking the theater experience is that tickets and concessions cost too much .
Bad movies were ranked below moviegoers who talk during the feature and too many advertisements .
*
Truth : Just 3 % of teenagers and 6 % of young adults cited such programs as “ The Daily Show ” as their main source of information about current events .
Only 10 % of teens and 11 % of young adults said blogs or other websites were their best source .
Teens and young adults said they most frequently kept up by talking with friends and family and watching local TV news .

The Entertainment Poll
Today
A new Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll finds that most 12 - to 24 - year - olds are bored with their entertainment choices .
Their solution ?
Even more options .
Plus : Busting myths about teens and young adults .
Tuesday
The old Hollywood movie model does n’t interest younger audiences .
They want to see films as soon as they come out at home — whether on TV , computer or the next new gadget .
Wednesday
Within the music industry , copied CDs are considered a greater threat than illegal peer - to - peer downloading .
But young people are confused about where sharing ends and piracy begins in the era of iTunes .
Thursday
Is new technology the answer for TV and video ?
Teens and young adults — the generation most likely to be the early adopters of this new technology — have yet to fully embrace it .
Friday

Times staff writer Matea Gold contributed to this report .
Starting today , the Isohunt team will deny access to all US visitors on their TorrentBox and Podtropolis tracker .
They are forced to take this action because of their involvement in a lawsuit initiated by the MPAA .
The IsoHunt crew released this statement today :
As of earlier today , we have disabled access from users in the US to our trackers .
This goes for ALL trackers ( torrentbox , podtropolis ) we run .
This is due to the US ’s hostility towards P2P technologies , and we feel with our current lawsuit brought by the MPAA , we can no longer ensure your security and privacy in the US .
So , if you ’re outside the US , you may notice less peers .
We encourage you to add other public , unhampered trackers to torrents you post , in addition to Torrentbox and Podtropolis ’s trackers .
IsoHunt is not alone in their battle with the MPAA .
Last month TorrentSpy , another site named in the MPAA lawsuit blocked access to US users on their site .
However , the takedown of IsoHunt ’s trackers will have an even bigger effect on the BitTorrent community worldwide , especially because TorrentBox runs one of the biggest public BitTorrent trackers .
As mentioned by the Isohunt team , this means that users outside the US will see less peers connected to their torrents which may result in slower download speeds .
The MPAA announced the lawsuit ( PDF ) against Torrentspy , Torrentbox and Isohunt in February 2006 .
Isohunt owner Gary later told Torrent Freak that they will not bow down to the MPAA .
Isohunt hired a top - notch lawyer , specialized in Internet copyrights .
It now seems that this was n’t enough to keep the trackers in the air .
For now , the websites are still available to US visitors .
The MPAA argues that the sole purpose of these BitTorrent trackers and sites is to share copyrighted content .
But they are wrong according to Gary , who said , “ We process copyright takedown requests daily , and have done so for hundreds of requests in the past , if not thousands .
We work with all copyright owners , and even the RIAA email us routinely .
The MPAA is the only organization unwilling to cooperate with us . ”
Luckily , quite a lot of torrents are tracked by more that one tracker these days .
And if that does n’t work there ’s always DHT .
You can read more about how to protect yourself from failing BitTorrent trackers in this article .
Long live the hydra !
To be continued .

Evan Davis | Notes on Real Life |
If you ’ve ever stayed at a Travelodge Hotel , you might have noticed they do n’t have shampoo in the bathroom .
Well , that ’s “ value engineering ” .
It is a phrase you might want to remember , as it governs your life more than you know .
The concept is perhaps best described by the company ’s own website :
“ Pay for things you do n't want ?
That 's crazy !
Our research shows that most people staying in a hotel simply want a clean , comfortable place to get a good night 's sleep , and are happy to forgo the unnecessary " frills " offered in other stuffy , over - priced establishments .
So we make sure we provide good quality essentials such as a comfortable bed and a decent quality shower , but get rid of unnecessary extras . ”
It ’s worth reading the whole page , and their justification for not having various specific items in rooms , from hairdryers ( answer : most customers do n’t need one ) to bathmats ( answer : the floors have enhanced slip resistance ) .
Similarly , if you ever buy a kitchen at Ikea , you might find the cupboard doors a millimetre or two thinner than the doors at the more expensive kitchen suppliers .
That ’s also value engineering .
If you ’ve sat at a pizza restaurant and found the service a little too efficient , that ’s value engineering of sorts too .
In none of these examples , has the product or service level arisen by chance .
In each case , someone has thought carefully about it .
They ’ve engaged in an exercise – formal or informal – called value management to optimise their processes , trim costs and enhance quality .
In big companies they do this in a structured way , engaging consultants in a fairly scientific process using so - called FAST diagrams .
In small companies , they do it more haphazardly , maybe sitting in a VE workshop , with key designers and contributors throwing in ideas .
The whole concept of value engineering itself emerged from the American giant , General Electric , during the second world war .
Since then it has been dressed up , supplemented and rediscovered in different forms .
But at its most ambitious , the broad discipline of value analysis is the task of asking what a company is really trying to achieve , and how it best gets there .
A good example ( provided to me by Professor John Roberts , an expert in this area ) is that of meeting the objective , “ to increase profitable capacity in a manufacturing operation ” .
You do n’t just ask , “ how do we build more capacity most efficiently ” ; you also ask whether the best way to increase profitable capacity is to stop wasting existing production time on unprofitable lines .
But at its narrowest , value engineering is about paring costs .
And that probably remains its most common everyday application : thinking about every aspect of a process and a product to deliver an objective as cost - effectively as possible .
It ’s the Travelodge shampoo experience .
I have never sat in a VE meeting , but I know people who have , and it is amazing how much you can save , if you just think about it in a systematic and open - minded way .
Indeed , try it yourself next time you want to do some big work around the house : come up with a plan for that new bathroom , and then have a VE workshop with yourself .
Ask yourself about all the materials you are using and what they are for .
Ask about the schedule of work and whether it minimises costs ; ask yourself whether you really need a full length bath , a shorter bath or a shower ?
Could you save money on tiles by getting a bigger mirror ?
Do you need tiles or could you paint the wall ?
You ’ll probably find there are lots of options for saving money – and some for spending money .
And even if you reject them ( the full length bath is much nicer ) the exercise may have been instructive .
Thinking about big projects constructively is rarely a waste of time .
Note that value engineering is not ( in principle ) just about delivering the cheap and cheerful .
Upmarket hotel chains will always decide to offer shampoo , but they also need to think about value .
Should the bathroom walls be in marble or tile .
VE is about delivering the best customer experience for a given cost , so it only involves reducing costs where the saving is bigger than the reduction in value for the customer .
Business loves these kinds of concepts .
It can take them , give them initials , and read books about them .
But in truth , value engineering is only a means of implementing a very basic concept of economic welfare : that you improve welfare when what you do costs less than the value someone derives from it .
Should a hotel supply shampoo ?
Yes , if it costs 10 p and the hotel customer values it at 11 p .
No , if it costs 10 p and the customer values it at 9p .
This basic intuition is in practice obviously very complicated to implement .
We do n’t know what value the customer puts on the shampoo .
Not all customers value it , but some value it a lot .
If a few value it , could n’t we sell it them ( which is what Travelodge do ) ?
Or give it to them at the desk ?
Or can we re-use it so that the cost is actually less than 10 p ?
But the idea is simple .
Cost versus benefit .
It should run through every business decision .
Now a lot of people recoil at businesses making things cheaper .
They assume that when a hotel cancels the shampoo , or makes the kitchen wood thinner , it allows them to make more profit at the expense of the customer .
But that ’s rarely the case .
It is in the interest of a hotel chain to offer customers all those things they really value .
After all , Travelodge would be silly not to offer us shampoo if we valued it at 11 p , because they could make more profit and get more satisfied customers by offering it and raising their price by 10.5 p .
Similarly , it is in the interests of the hotel chain to offer customers only those things that customers value .
After all , they would be silly to offer us shampoo we valued at 9 p , if they could make more profit and get more satisfied customers by dropping it , and cutting their price by 9.5p .
In other words , Travelodge has just the right incentive to offer shampoo if customers value it .
And removing the shampoo may be a favour to customers rather than a rip - off .
Indeed , often when service is annoyingly low - grade , it is not because a company is incapable of offering high grade service , it is because they have worked out just what their customers really value and want to pay .
And that ’s value engineering for you .
Since I was reminded of the phrase fairly recently , I have found myself muttering it under my breath quite lot ; either when I encounter something that has obviously been value engineered – from an airline meal to the packaging for an electronic device .
Or ( less often in fact ) where it seems to me something could benefit from value engineering if only they bothered to pursue it .
But be grateful for the modern companies that think carefully about what they ’re doing , even if it sometimes means you ca n’t wash your hair when you want to .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter on Wednesday denounced Vice President Dick Cheney as a “ disaster ” for the country and a “ militant ” who has had an excessive influence in setting foreign policy .

Cheney has been on the wrong side of the debate on many issues , including an internal White House discussion over Syria in which the vice president is thought to be pushing a tough approach , Carter said .
“ He ’s a militant who avoided any service of his own in the military and he has been most forceful in the last 10 years or more in fulfilling some of his more ancient commitments that the United States has a right to inject its power through military means in other parts of the world , ” Carter told the BBC World News America in an interview to air later on Wednesday .
“ You know he ’s been a disaster for our country , ” Carter said .
“ I think he ’s been overly persuasive on President George Bush and quite often he ’s prevailed . ”
Asked to comment on Carter ’s remarks , Megan Mitchell , a spokeswoman for the Republican vice president , said , “ We ’re not going to engage in this type of rhetoric . ”
Carter , a Democrat who was president from 1977 to 1981 and won the 2002 Nobel Peace prize for his charitable work , is a strong critic of the Iraq war and has often been outspoken in his criticism of President George W. Bush .
In a newspaper interview in May , Carter called the Bush administration the “ worst in history ” in international relations .
Carter did have kind words in the BBC interview for U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
“ I ’m filled with admiration for Condoleezza Rice in standing up to ( Cheney ) which she did even when she was in the White House under President George W. Bush , ” Carter said , referring to Rice ’s former role as White House national security adviser .
“ Now secretary of state , her influence is obviously greater than it was then and I hope she prevails , ” Carter added .
The short answer is : Americans may think Bush is useless , but there is not an overwhelming desire to withdraw now .
Or as Charles Franklin elaborates in a fascinating post :
The CBS / New York Times polls taken 9/4-8/07 finds results similar to other recent polls : Bush War Approval : 26 %
War worth cost : 34 %
US Did right thing : 41 % ( All in the ballpark of the trends above . )
Do you think the Republican or the Democratic party is more likely to make the right decisions about the war in Iraq ? :
Republican : 32 %
Democratic : 42 % A Democratic advantage , but not an overwhelming one .
His conclusion ?
Bottom line : Frustrated anti-war forces are understandably angry that the 2006 election victory and subsequent Democratic Congress has failed to bring change to Iraq policy .
The trend lines above show how support for the war has declined dramatically since 2003 .
Anti-war forces can correctly point to substantial majorities who are critical of various aspects of the war .
But change in Congress also requires that Republican members perceive that opinion against the war is so overwhelming that it is time for them to also abandon ship .
That mark in public opinion has not been reached .
So long as a substantial minority ( say 40 % + ) support the current policy ( or at least oppose a rapid withdrawal ) then Republicans can count on a public that is too divided on the issue to pose the certainty of electoral catastrophe .
This is n't to say Republicans do n't wish the issue would go away , or that they relish running in 2008 with nearly 6 years of inconclusive war on their watch .
But opponents of the war will not prevail in Congress unless a more massive opposition emerges --- and one united on the specific details of how to end the war .
Over to you , Senator Obama .
Let 's see if you have what it takes to be a president .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

To test this model , Dr. Couzin and Nigel Franks , an ant expert at the University of Bristol in England , filmed a trail of army ants in Panama .
Back in England , they went through the film frame by frame , analyzing the movements of 226 ants .
“ Everything in the ant world is happening at such a high tempo it was very difficult to see , ” Dr. Couzin said .
Eventually they found that the real ants were moving in the way that Dr. Couzin had predicted would allow the entire swarm to go as fast as possible .
They also found that the ants behaved differently if they were leaving the nest or heading back .
When two ants encountered each other , the outgoing ant turned away further than the incoming one .
As a result , the ants headed to the nest end up clustered in a central lane , while the outgoing ants form two outer lanes .
Dr. Couzin has been extending his model for ants to other animals that move in giant crowds , like fish and birds .
And instead of tracking individual animals himself , he has developed programs to let computers do the work .
The more Dr. Couzin studies swarm behavior , the more patterns he finds common to many different species .
He is reminded of the laws of physics that govern liquids .
“ You look at liquid metal and at water , and you can see they ’re both liquids , ” he said .
“ They have fundamental characteristics in common .
That ’s what I was finding with the animal groups — there were fundamental states they could exist in . ”
Just as liquid water can suddenly begin to boil , animal swarms can also change abruptly thanks to some simple rules .
Dr. Couzin has discovered some of those rules in the ways that locusts begin to form their devastating swarms .
The insects typically crawl around on their own , but sometimes young locusts come together in huge bands that march across the land , devouring everything in their path .
After developing wings , they rise into the air as giant clouds made of millions of insects .
“ Locusts are known to be around all the time , ” Dr. Couzin said .
“ Why does the situation suddenly get out of control , and these locusts swarm together and devastate crops ? ”

Dr. Couzin traveled to remote areas of Mauritania in Africa to study the behavior of locust swarms .
Back at Oxford , he and his colleagues built a circular track on which locusts could walk .
“ We could track the motion of all these individuals five times a second for eight hours a day , ” he said .

“ Eat , drink and be merry , for tomorrow we may die . ”
It ’s an appealing philosophy to some , but for an average person in the modern world , on any given day the utterer is roughly 26,000 times more likely to be wrong than right about tomorrow ’s survivability .
More often than not , one must answer for all reckless consumption and merriment ; yet most of us continue to make choices which are detrimental to our futures .
Almost everyone occasionally falls victim to this defect of human reasoning , an irrational bias referred to as temporal myopia .
Like visual myopia , temporal myopia causes clarity to decrease with distance , but it applies to our perception of the future rather than of our sense of sight .
Instead of inspiring caution , our brains ’ typical response to this uncertainty is to sharply reduce the importance of the future in our decision - making , an effect known as hyperbolic discounting .
Consequences which occur at a later time , good or bad , tend to have a lot less bearing on our choices the more distantly they fall in the future … even when one ’s life is at stake .
For instance , the eating - drinking - merriment philosophy may sound like that of a warrior before battle , but hundreds of thousands of heart patients embrace that strategy daily , and against the better advice of their doctors .
According to Dr. Edward Miller , the dean of the medical school and CEO of the hospital at Johns Hopkins University , over half a million people undergo coronary - artery bypass graft surgery every year in the US , and of those only about ten percent make the necessary lifestyle changes to prevent future surgeries , chest pains , and premature death .
About ninety percent of those patients decide to forego survival and comfort in favor of the short - term pleasures of unhealthy foods and laziness .
This irrational affliction is ubiquitous in humanity , though most of the time the risks are not so immediate as death .
Consider the oft - used example of monetary rewards .
If someone were to offer you the choice between $ 50 right now or $ 100 tomorrow , the latter would seem the clear choice .
But as the delay gap widens , the importance of the extra $ 50 quickly diminishes for most people , despite the fact that its actual value is constant .
For instance , confronted with a choice between $ 50 today or $ 100 one year from now , would you still wait for the $ 100 ?
Statistically speaking , the vast majority will take the $ 50 .
But the pattern follows a hyperbola , so once a certain time threshold is crossed , the devaluing effect of time diminishes ; for example , most will opt to take $ 100 in ten years over $ 50 in nine years .
In essence , hyperbolic discounting is the human tendency to prefer smaller payoffs now over larger payoffs later , which leads one to largely disregard the future when it requires sacrifices in the present .
Being mortal creatures with limited lifespans and resources , the human survival instinct has evolved to appreciate that one cannot enjoy a conserved resource tomorrow if one does n’t survive today .
This hard - wired tendency may be the bias behind our temporal short - sightedness , causing many people to make decisions which lead to short - term happiness and long - term disaster .
It turns out that hyperbolic discounting is the same logical flaw that causes people to over - commit their future schedules ; Research has found that most people will make commitments long in advance that they would never make if the commitment required immediate action .
The same defective reasoning causes people to underestimate the future consequences of drug use , unhealthy diets , procrastination , unprotected sex , infidelity … basically anything that ’s any fun at all .
Financial institutions such as banks and credit card companies build their businesses on hyperbolic discounting , because borrowing money and paying interest are actions which spend future resources for benefit in the present .
In a society where credit is available to almost anyone , hyperbolic discounting has created an environment where it ’s rare for people to save up for expensive items , even when interest rates are so high that the amount paid is much greater .
This undervaluation of the future is not rational , yet almost everyone is subject to it to some degree .
Fortunately , understanding the psychology of hyperbolic discounting can help one to avoid its detrimental effects .
Because one ’s self - centered biases are at the heart of the problem , the best approach is to take an objective view of any decision that has future consequences .
Some suggest that when you are confronted with such a choice , you should imagine that the decision belongs to someone else ⁠ — perhaps a close friend⁠ — and that you have been asked for advice .
Removing oneself from consideration makes one less blind to the future consequences , but taking rational actions based on on that new insight can still be harder than nailing Jell - o to a tree ; being aware of the consequences does n’t mean that they are assigned the appropriate importance .
Seeking a truly objective view from a trusted individual often provides the most practical input .
The spongy matter housed within the human skull is certainly extraordinary , but it ’s an imperfect machine .
There are many tasks for which the human brain is ably suited , but clearly it can be surprisingly bad at planning for the future .
And often we fail to learn from such mistakes , which is why most people have more than one regret .
Of course our mortality urges us to consider the now over the later , so sometimes the possibility of one ’s death plays an important role in decision - making .
But as medicine advances and lifespans increase , it will be interesting to see what becomes of temporal myopia .
Perhaps over time our minds will evolve to truly appreciate that it is important to seize the day , but not at the expense of tomorrow .
Editor ’s Note :
This article originally used Alcoholics Anonymous ( AA ) as an example of third - party support ; but further investigation showed that AA is not a well - designed program , hence it made a poor example .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Michelle Hammond and Jeremiah Holland were intrigued when a friend at the Oakland Tribune asked them and their two young children to take part in a cutting - edge study to measure the industrial chemicals in their bodies .
Tests showed Rowan 's blood had high levels of a chemical that can cause thyroid dysfunction in rats .
" In the beginning , I was n't worried at all ; I was fascinated , " Hammond , 37 , recalled .
But that fascination soon changed to fear , as tests revealed that their children -- Rowan , then 18 months , and Mikaela , then 5 -- had chemical exposure levels up to seven times those of their parents .
" [ Rowan 's ] been on this planet for 18 months , and he 's loaded with a chemical I 've never heard of , " Holland , 37 , said .
" He had two to three times the level of flame retardants in his body that 's been known to cause thyroid dysfunction in lab rats . "
The technology to test for these flame retardants -- known as polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) -- and other industrial chemicals is less than 10 years old .
Environmentalists call it " body burden " testing , an allusion to the chemical " burden , " or legacy of toxins , running through our bloodstream .
Scientists refer to this testing as " biomonitoring . "
Most Americans have n't heard of body burden testing , but it 's a hot topic among environmentalists and public health experts who warn that the industrial chemicals we come into contact with every day are accumulating in our bodies and endangering our health in ways we have yet to understand .

" We are the humans in a dangerous and unnatural experiment in the United States , and I think it 's unconscionable , " said Dr. Leo Trasande , assistant director of the Center for Children 's Health and the Environment at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City .
Watch Anderson Cooper get his blood drawn for testing »
Trasande says that industrial toxins could be leading to more childhood disease and disorders .
" We are in an epidemic of environmentally mediated disease among American children today , " he said .
" Rates of asthma , childhood cancers , birth defects and developmental disorders have exponentially increased , and it can't be explained by changes in the human genome .
So what has changed ?
All the chemicals we 're being exposed to . "
Elizabeth Whelan , president of the American Council on Science and Health , a public health advocacy group , disagrees .
" My concern about this trend about measuring chemicals in the blood is it 's leading people to believe that the mere ability to detect chemicals is the same as proving a hazard , that if you have this chemical , you are at risk of a disease , and that is false , " she said .
Whelan contends that trace levels of industrial chemicals in our bodies do not necessarily pose health risks .
In 2004 , the Hollands became the first intact nuclear family in the United States to undergo body burden testing .
Rowan , at just 1 ½ years old , became the youngest child in the U.S. to be tested for chemical exposure with this method .
Rowan 's extraordinarily high levels of PBDEs frightened his parents and left them with a looming question :
If PBDEs are causing neurological damage to lab rats , could they be doing the same thing to Rowan ?
The answer is that no one knows for sure .
In the three years since he was tested , no developmental problems have been found in Rowan 's neurological system .
Trasande said children up to six years old are most at risk because their vital organs and immune system are still developing and because they depend more heavily on their environments than adults do .
" Pound for pound , they eat more food , they drink more water , they breathe in more air , " he said .
" And so [ children ] carry a higher body burden than we do . "
Studies on the health effects of PBDEs are only just beginning , but many countries have heeded the warning signs they see in animal studies .
Sweden banned PBDEs in 1998 .
The European Union banned most PBDEs in 2004 .
In the United States , the sole manufacturer of two kinds of PBDEs voluntarily stopped making them in 2004 .
A third kind , Deca , is still used in the U.S. in electrical equipment , construction material , mattresses and textiles .
Another class of chemicals that showed up in high levels in the Holland children is known as phthalates .
These are plasticizers , the softening agents found in many plastic bottles , kitchenware , toys , medical devices , personal care products and cosmetics .
In lab animals , phthalates have been associated with reproductive defects , obesity and early puberty .
But like PBDEs , little is known about what they do to humans and specifically children .
Russ Hauser , an associate professor of environmental and occupational epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health , has done some of the few human studies on low - level phthalate exposure .
His preliminary research shows that phthalates may contribute to infertility in men .
A study led by Shanna Swan of the University of Rochester in New York shows that prenatal exposure to phthalates in males may be associated with impaired testicular function and with a defect that shortens the space between the genitals and anus .
The Environmental Protection Agency does not require chemical manufacturers to conduct human toxicity studies before approving their chemicals for use in the market .
A manufacturer simply has to submit paperwork on a chemical , all the data that exists on that chemical to date , and wait 90 days for approval .
Jennifer Wood , an EPA spokeswoman , insists the agency has the tools to ensure safe oversight .
" If during the new - chemical review process , EPA determines that it may have concerns regarding risk or exposure , the EPA has the authority to require additional testing , " she said .
EPA records show that of the 1,500 new chemicals submitted each year , the agency asks for additional testing roughly 10 percent of the time .
The EPA has set up a voluntary testing program with the major chemical manufacturers to retroactively test some of the 3,000 most widely used chemicals .
Trasande believes that is too little , too late .
" The problem with these tests is that they are really baseline tests that do n't measure for the kind of subtle health problems that we 're seeing , " Dr. Trasande said .
In the three years since her family went through body burden testing , Michelle Hammond has become an activist on the issue .
She 's testified twice in the California legislature to support a statewide body burden testing program , a bill that passed last year .
Michelle also speaks to various public health groups about her experience , taking Mikaela , now 8 , and Rowan , now 5 , with her .
So far , her children show no health problems associated with the industrial chemicals in their bodies .
" I'm angry at my government for failing to regulate chemicals that are in mass production and in consumer products . "
Hammond says .
" I do n't think it should have to be up to me to worry about what 's in my couch . "

All About Cancer • Infertility
The most effective diplomats , like the most effective intelligence officers and foreign correspondents , possess empathy .
They have the intellectual , cultural and linguistic literacy to get inside the heads of those they must analyze or cover .
They know the vast array of historical , religious , economic and cultural antecedents that go into making up decisions and reactions .
And because of this — endowed with the ability to communicate and more able to find ways of resolving conflicts through diplomacy — they are less prone to blunders .
But we live in an age where dialogue is dismissed and empathy is suspect .
We prefer the illusion that we can dictate events through force .
It has n’t worked well in Iraq .
It has n’t worked well in Afghanistan .
And it wo n’t work in Iran .
But those who once tried to reach out and understand , who developed expertise to explain the world to us and ourselves to the world , no longer have a voice in the new imperial project .
We are instead governed and informed by moral and intellectual trolls .
To make rational decisions in international relations we must perceive how others see us .
We must grasp how they think about us and be sensitive to their fears and insecurities .
But this is becoming hard to accomplish .
Our embassies are packed with analysts whose main attribute is long service in the armed forces and who frequently report to intelligence agencies rather than the State Department .
Our area specialists in the State Department are ignored by the ideologues driving foreign policy .
Their complex view of the world is an inconvenience .
And foreign correspondents are an endangered species , along with foreign coverage .
We speak to the rest of the globe in the language of violence .
The proposed multibillion - dollar arms supply package for the Persian Gulf countries is the newest form of weapons - systems - as - message .
U.S. Undersecretary of State
R. Nicholas Burns was rather blunt about the deal .
He told the International Herald Tribune that the arms package “ says to the Iranians and Syrians that the United States is the major power in the Middle East and will continue to be and is not going away . ”
The arrogant call for U.S. hegemony over the rest of the globe is making enemies of a lot of people who might be predisposed to support us , even in the Middle East .
And it is terrifying those , such as the Iraqis , Iranians and Syrians , whom we have demonized .
Empathy and knowledge , the qualities that make real communication possible , have been discarded .
We use tough talk and big weapons deals to communicate .
We spread fear , distrust and violence .
And we expect missile systems to protect us .
“ Imagine an Iranian government that was powerful , radical , and in possession of nuclear weapons ; imagine the threat that would pose to Israel and to the American - led balance of power , which has been so important in the Middle East since the close of the Second World War , ” Burns said in a speech at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston last April 11 .
“ That is our first challenge . ”
“ Our second challenge is that Iran continues to be the central banker of Middle East terrorism , ” he went on .
“ It is the leading funder and director of Hamas , Hezbollah , Palestinian Islamic Jihad , and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine general command .
Third , Iran is in our judgment a major violator of the human rights of its own people ; it denies religious , political , and press rights to the people of a very great country representing a very great civilization .
And so we see a problem that is going to be with us for a long time , and we are trying to fashion a strategy that will work for the long term . ”
George W. Bush ’s latest salvo , on Aug. 28 , was more of the same .
“ Iran ’s active pursuit of technology that could lead to nuclear weapons threatens to put a region already known for instability and violence under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust , ” he said .
Bush warned that the United States and its allies would confront Iran “ before it is too late . ”
These kinds of words , pouring out of the administration , send a clear message to any Iranian :
You are in trouble .
Bend to our will or we destroy you .
These were the same words , with a few minor changes , that the Bush administration delivered to Saddam Hussein , who , despite numerous compromises , including letting the U.N. inspectors back into his country , was overthrown and put to death during a U.S. occupation .
And the Iranians know that without the bomb , which no intelligence agency thinks they can produce for a few years , they are now probably going to be attacked .
The Pentagon has reportedly drawn up plans for a series of airstrikes against 1,200 targets in Iran .
The air attacks are designed to cripple the Iranians ’ military capability in three days .
The Bushehr nuclear power plant , along with targets in Saghand and Yazd , the uranium enrichment facility in Natanz , a heavy - water plant and radioisotope facility in Arak , the Ardekan Nuclear Fuel Unit , and the uranium conversion facility and nuclear technology center in Isfahan , will all probably be struck by the United States and perhaps even Israeli warplanes .
The Tehran Nuclear Research Center , the Tehran molybdenum , iodine and xenon radioisotope production facility , the Tehran Jabr Ibn Hayan Multipurpose Laboratories , and the Kalaye Electric Co. in the Tehran suburbs will also most likely come under attack .
But then what ?
We do n’t have the troops to invade .
And we do n’t have anyone minding the helm who knows the slightest thing about Persian culture or the Middle East .
There is no one in power in Washington with the empathy to get it .
We will lurch blindly into a catastrophe of our own creation .
It is not hard to imagine what will happen .
Iranian Shabab - 3 and Shabab - 4 missiles , which cannot reach the United States , will be launched at Israel , as well as American military bases and the Green Zone in Baghdad .
Expect massive American casualties , especially in Iraq , where Iranian agents and their Iraqi allies will be able to call in precise coordinates .
The Strait of Hormuz , which is the corridor for 20 percent of the world ’s oil supply , will be shut down .
Chinese - supplied C-801 and C - 802 anti-shipping missiles , mines and coastal artillery will target U.S. shipping , along with Saudi oil production and oil export centers .
Oil prices will skyrocket to well over $ 4 a gallon .
The dollar will tumble against the euro .
Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon , interpreting the war as an attack on all Shiites , will fire rockets into northern Israel .
Israel , already struck by missiles from Tehran , will begin retaliatory raids on Lebanon and Iran .
Pakistan , with a huge Shiite minority , will reach greater levels of instability .
The unrest could result in the overthrow of the weakened American ally President Pervez Musharraf and usher into power Islamic radicals .
Pakistan could become the first radical Islamic state to possess a nuclear weapon .
The neat little war with Iran , which few Democrats oppose , has the potential to ignite a regional inferno .
We have rendered the nation deaf and dumb .
We no longer have the capacity for empathy .
We prefer to amuse ourselves with trivia and gossip that pass for news rather than understand .
We are blinded by our military prowess .
We believe that huge explosions and death are an effective form of communication .
And the rest of the world is learning to speak our language .

Google Street View has changed the way that people interact with online maps as well as real cities .
Controversial and illicit images as well as strange photographic glitches have only heightened the public ’s fascination with this interactive panoramic mapping system .
The now - infamous Google Street View van has captured embarrassing moments , created accidental celebrities and documented interesting urban changes over time .
The following images illustrate this variety .
Lurkers and Gawkers : Google Street View has become notorious for showing people at moments they might rather not have preserved online .
The two men above are at least fortunate enough not to be showing their face to the camera .
Another individual caught in a compromising situation was not so lucky .
Accidental Celebrities : Some Google Street View pictures show individuals who are apparently aware of ( or who even pose for ) the Street View camera van .
Many images , such as those above , have been widely circulated on the internet – making their subjects into a form of impromptu or accidental celebrity .
Controversial Images : A lot of the more popular Google Street View images in public circulation involve celebrities , from ‘ real life ’ or from their actions caught on camera .
However , while it is apparently true that a knife - sharpening van was photographed outside of OJ Simpson ’s house , the individual show in the lower image ( despite popular rumors ) was simply fixing his bicycle .
Mysterious Street View Van :
While it is not provable either way , the above image seems to suggest that the Street View van may have callously knocked over a few flimsy roadblocks .
Perhaps they were worried about disrupting the images they were capturing ?
The Street View van itself has been caught on film a few times .
Changes Over Time :
One of the interesting aspects of Google Street View is the impressive way in which it documents cities in time , and their changes over time .
The above set of images shows a building under construction , but if a user shifts perspective in Street View the picture shows the finished renovation .
More Google Street View Images :
The number of popular images has grown steadily as Google Street View has spread from cities like San Francisco and New York City to Los Angeles and Houston .
A number of sites feature additional Google Street View pictures , including Wired : Threat Level and StreetViewFun .
More strange splicings and as well as sexy and illicit images can also be found in our archives .
Who would think you could get so much work done just by twiddling your thumbs ?
Mathematica 6 brings with it a host of new ways to interact with your output .
Want to set up an arbitrary number of parameters and explore their multi-dimensional space ?
That ’s trivial to do with the Manipulate function .
However , once you start exploring this space , you immediately realize that your exploration is restricted by the mouse pointer .
There ’s only one pointer on the screen .
It can only interact with one control ( slider , checkbox or whatever ) at a time .
Fortunately , hardware developers realized long ago — long before multi- touch interfaces like Apple ’s iPhone , which are in vogue at the moment — that most people have 10 fingers and so in theory can access many more degrees of freedom than the two degrees provided by a typical mouse .
Enter the gamepad .
By including native support for controllers , gamepads , joysticks and other human interface device ( HID ) systems , Mathematica lets you make more efficient use of your hands , instead of limiting you to current pointer technologies .
We have tweaked mappings for a dozen or so different brands , to make sure that the joystick values have the proper orientation .
It seems each hardware company takes a slightly different approach to assigning values and directions , and so normalizing across brands was an important part of providing unified access to these devices in Mathematica .
Of special note is the Logitech Dual Action USB gamepad , which had the highest signal - to - noise ratio in our tests .
Notice in the picture above ( it ’s the dark blue controller at the very bottom ) that it has two analog joysticks and more than enough buttons to keep most of your fingers occupied .
The 3 Dconnexion products such as SpaceNavigator ( bottom center ) and the SensAble PHANTOM line ( top right ) also have custom support , as do the sudden - motion sensors and tablet digitizers found in some laptops .
Mathematica natively supports all these devices .
In fact , that native support extends to every Manipulate output .
Any Manipulate you create , or any of the Demonstrations available through the Wolfram Demonstrations Project , will immediately respond to a gamepad if you happen to have one plugged in .
By default , Manipulate attaches sliders and 2D sliders to joysticks , and checkboxes to buttons .
If there are more sliders than joysticks , buttons on the controller device are paired off to form a pseudo joystick , with each pair of buttons moving a value back and forth along its domain .
So in the following output , based on an example from the Manipulate tutorial , the first two variables are controlled by the left joystick , the next two by the right joystick and the fifth variable by the horizontal axis on the hat switch control .
You just plug it in and it works .
Mathematica ’s native support for controller devices also extends to 3D graphics .
In that case , the natural action is to change the orientation of the 3D image on screen .
Even though you can do this same thing with the mouse , using a controller turns out to be incredibly useful in practice and , like the support in Manipulate , has the benefit that you do n’t need to read documentation or change your input to use the controller .
Because these automatic behaviors are so useful in practice , controllers have become almost as ubiquitous as mice around here .
If there ’s not one hooked up to your computer , there ’s probably one very nearby .
Even the young children of some employees have found themselves enthusiastically exploring the parameter space of some Demonstration or other with a gamepad .
Do they understand all aspects of the object they ’re investigating ?
Of course not .
But that hands - on experience could easily become the intuitive basis for future , more rigorous investigations .
It ’s worth pointing out that controller support is not limited to Graphics3D and Manipulate .
In fact , most of the support in these functions is built from the ControllerState function , which gives immediate , low - level access to the instantaneous state of all attached controller devices .
Using that function , along with other interface primitives like Dynamic , it ’s easy to build interactive , controller - centric features in Mathematica with just a few lines of code .
There were other interesting design issues involved in supporting controller devices .
For instance , how should scoping work ?
If there are lots of Manipulate functions or 3D graphics on the screen , which ones should respond when you wiggle a joystick ?
And how do you sometimes ignore controllers like the sudden - motion sensor included in all new Apple laptops , so that 3D graphics do n’t move every time you move your laptop ( which , if it ’s on your lap , will happen constantly ) ?
Well , the scoping of controller state is implemented by selection .
By default , if there is an output within the current selection , then controllers will have an effect on that output , and not otherwise .
Of course , if you want your output to always listen for a controller no matter what the selection is , there ’s an option to do that .
There ’s also an option to change the relative priority of controllers when there are several present .
Between the low - level ControllerState and the automatic support in functions like Manipulate and Graphics3D , Mathematica 6 provides simple and powerful interfaces for you to access data with any controller device .
So start twiddling your thumbs , and get back to work !
From the comments :
MOST PEOPLE who work at Google are in SUPPORT roles !!
And they are getting paid way less than industry standard for working 50 , 60 + hours a week for it !
Screw the free food , screw the laundry - the MAJORITY of people working at Google are in buildings without any of these amenities , and are certainly without extra money from stock options .
[ … ] they are the ones working their asses off , in overtime , but that does n’t matter because they are salaried but way below industry standards for support positions , to make sure that YOU , the user , has an accessible Help Center , has a kind , email response , has an answer to your question .
Yes , there are foosball tables in the support buildings , but who has time to play them ?
Giant overhead projectors alerting them to the current turnaround time for their emails is Big Brother enough to ensure that they do n’t even THINK about playing foosball when they should be answering support emails .
Breakfast , lunch , and dinner are not nice alternatives - they are NECESSARY to ensure that all of the support peons remain dutiful and consistent with their email turnaround times .
Wow , sounds like they ’re overworked .
Ca n’t Google just hire more people ?
HAHAHAHAHAHA !!!!!
For a response to that , please see the above comments .
It ’s as hard to get a support role here if you ’re an MBA with a PhD as a hobby , as if you invented nuclear physics .
I ’ve been here almost 5 years , and as soon as my refresher grant has vested , I am out like Lance Bass .
It ’s a load of corporate baloney - the 400 - person company that I started at has become a nightmare that has eaten my soul .
God help the users .
WOMEN really are better than men at shopping .
And they really do prefer pink .
And , surprisingly , it is possible that these facts are connected .
The first conclusion was drawn by Joshua New of Yale University and his colleagues .
The second was drawn by Anya Hurlbert and Yazhu Ling of Newcastle University in England .
The connecting theme is that in the division of labour that forms the primordial bargain of human hunter - gatherer societies , it is the men who do the hunting and the women who do the gathering .
Blackberry - picking aside , urban humanity does little gathering from the wild these days , so Dr New decided to look at what seemed to him to be the nearest equivalent — shopping at a farmers ' market .
There is a fair amount of evidence that men are better than women at solving certain sorts of spatial problems , such as remembering the locations of topographical landmarks .
Many researchers suggest such skills may have been important in the past for man - the - hunter , who needed to be able to find his way round the landscape .
If that is the case , then woman - the - gatherer might have been expected to develop complementary skills not shown by males .
And that , as he writes in this week 's Proceedings of the Royal Society , is what Dr New found .
Dr New used the market to test two hypotheses .
The first was that women remember the locations of food resources more accurately than men do .
The second was that the more nutritionally valuable a resource is , the more accurately its location will be remembered .
To prove these conjectures he recruited 41 women and 45 men and led each of them individually on a merry dance around the chosen market .
In the course of this peregrination , each participant visited six of the 90 food stalls in the market .
At each of those stalls , participants were given a piece of food to eat .
They were asked their preference for the taste of the food , how often they ate that food in normal life , how attractive they found the stall and how often they had made purchases from that stall in the past .
After visiting all six stalls , they were taken to the centre of the market and asked to point toward those stalls , one at a time , using an arrow on a dial .
In addition , they were asked to rate their own sense of direction .
In the pink
On average , women were 9° more accurate than men at pointing to each stall — a significant deviation if you have to walk some distance to get to a place .
This was not because those women had more experience of visiting the market than the men had .
Nor did the women rate themselves as having a better sense of direction — indeed the men rated their own navigating skills more highly .
Dr New suggests that these results show women are better than men at the particular task of relocating sources of food .
That contrasts with the idea that men are better at navigation in general .
In other words , women 's minds are specialised for their ancestral task of gathering the sort of food that can not run away .
That such food is in a different mental category from the one occupied by general landmarks was suggested by the answer to the second hypothesis .
The higher the calorific value of the food sold by a stall , the more accurately Dr New 's volunteers were able to point towards it .
And that result applied to both sexes , though women still did better than men .
How much the participants liked the food did not have an effect on this accuracy .
Indeed none of the secondary attributes of the food or stall in question ( taste preference , the frequency of an item in a volunteer 's normal diet , the appearance of the stall and how often a volunteer used that stall in daily life ) were found to affect pointing accuracy .
Only the calorific value of the item in question was relevant .
For their part Dr Hurlbert and Dr Ling , who report their study in Current Biology , used coloured patches flashing on a computer screen to find the preferences of their set of volunteers .
These volunteers were men and women of British and Chinese origin who were in their early 20s .
Mostly , the two researchers found that people of different sexes and from different continents did not differ in their colour preferences .
But there was one exception .
Among both the British and the Chinese , women preferred reddish hues such as pink to greenish - blue ones .
Among men it was the other way round .
Moreover , though anatomical sex is binary , mental “ gender ” is more pliable .
To see how masculine or feminine the brains of their participants were , Dr Hurlbert and Dr Ling used what is known as the Bem Sex Role Inventory , which asks about personality traits more often associated with one sex than the other .
This showed that the more feminine a brain was , regardless of the body it inhabited , the more it liked red and pink .
All this suggests a biological , rather than a cultural , explanation for colour preference .
And Dr Hurlbert and Dr Ling have produced one .
They suggest that their result may be connected with the fact that the colour of many fruits is at the red end of the spectrum .
An evolved preference for red , pink and allied shades — particularly in contrast with green — could thus bring advantage to those who gather such things .
And if they can also remember which tree ( or stall ) to go and visit next time , then so much the better .
さてイグノーベル賞受賞者、岡村長之助の話題の続き。ネットにはまるで情報のない岡村先生について調べてみた結果である。
岡村長之助は明治34年（1901年）6月2日生まれ。昭和3年（1928年）に、愛知医科大学（名古屋大学の前身。今の愛知医科大学とは別物）を卒業している。
昭和8年の医師名簿には住所は名古屋市南区豊田町とあり、昭和53年の医籍総覧には、名古屋市港区の「港北病院」とある。港北病院の標榜科は内科。おそらく生涯名古屋で内科医として地域医療に携わった人物なのだろう。ちなみに『人類および全脊椎動物誕生の地−日本』の奥付にある「岡村化石研究所」の住所も、港北病院と同じである。
古生物学会での学会発表や論文執筆をしていた70年代後半から80年頃には、岡村先生は70代後半。『人類および全脊椎動物誕生の地−日本』を自費出版した1983年には82歳。イグ・ノーベル賞を受賞した1996年には、もし存命だったとしたら95歳である。いつ亡くなったかは正確にはわからなかったが、90年代の間に港北病院は廃院になっているので、90年代に亡くなったことは確からしい。
なお、港北病院と岡村化石研究所があった場所には、現在はマンションが建っている。
というわけで、岡村先生は精神科医ではなく、内科医だったのである。私の同業者ではなかった。なんとなく残念。
お待たせいたしました。岡村先生が発見した、人類の歴史を書き換えるミニ化石とはいったいどんなものなのか。岡村先生唯一の著書『人類および全脊椎動物誕生の地−日本』に掲載されていた、ミニ人類の化石を、岡村先生の熱い文章とともに紹介していこう。
まず、岡村先生の主張はこうである。進化論も神の創造説も間違っている。種は永久に不変であり、4億年の昔にはすでに現代人と同じ形態を持つ人類がいて、直立して二足歩行していた。また他の動物も現代と同じ姿のまま4億年前に存在していた！
しかも体長数ミリという微小な姿で！
この主張自体は、200年前の博物学者キュヴィエが唱えた種の不変説に近い。キュヴィエは神による創造を信じていたが、創造説を否定する岡村先生は、種はいったいどうやって発生したと考えていたのか。誰もがそうした疑問を抱くだろうが、岡村先生は慎み深く何も語ろうとしない。ただ、ミニ人類やミニ動物の驚くべき化石を提出してみせるだけである。
最初に掲載されているのがこの写真。
「 卵形で高さ0.7ミリ、前頭部は丸くて広く平らで、よく前方に突出し、顎は小さく、諸獣のように吻を作って前方に突出することなく、上下顎には歯が見え、歯列は浅い抛物線を描き、頤は細小でオトガイ隆起も確認できる。もうこれだけでこの標本が直立した人類に属することは明らかである。眼窩および鼻根のあたりが不正確なのは永年の間の破壊と炭酸カルシウムの不整沈着のためである。又頭頂には矢状稜が見られる」
さすが岡村先生、一枚の標本から驚くほど多岐にわたる情報を読み取ってみせる。
しかし、岡村先生の本領はまだこんなものではない。
「次に早くも出現したのは、図5の人類の完全な典型的標本である。現代女性のプロフィールとどこが違おうか。倒卵円形の頭部は高く直立して高さ0.8ミリを計測し、前頭部はよく発達して前方に突出し、したがって大きな大脳皮質前頭葉を十分に容れることができ、顔の相と同時に智力の程度を押し測ることができる。（中略）眼は入り目で両眼は鼻根に接するまでに近接して前方を見、そのため両眼視域は諸生物中最大値を示し、そして虹彩、強膜までも黒眼、白眼として識別できる。全く現代人そのままの姿であり、これは従来の化石としての概念を遙かに打ち破るものであって、既述のように屍蝋化後の石灰化が永く密封状態に置かれたものと解すべきで、微化石が幸いした現象ではなかろうか。口唇は割合に小さく見え、直線的に強く後方に退き、軽いオトガイ隆起を見せている。頭髪は波状で豊富に残っており、特にパーマネントしてあるようにも見える。パーマが肩の辺りまで垂れ下った姿は、現代女性の美を意識しての身ごなしと変りはない。前頭部には小動物像が載せてあり、他にも常に見られるもので、当時の身分をあらわす標象であったらしい」
だんだんついて来られなくなってきているのではないだろうか。最初の化石ではまだまがりなりにも骨格について語っていたが、今度は黒目白目や髪の毛まで識別できるというのだ。それって……化石？
「 図7は正に現代少女の胸像を見るのと違いはない。自然科学の対象とするような生気のない標本的存在ではない。大きくて丸く意味あり気に眼を開き、固く口を噤んだこの少女の内に秘められた緊張した激情は、十分に抑え付けられたものとなっている。私はその心情を形容する術を知らない。たゞそれ程の精神生活をこの微少な長岩人はすでに営んでいたのである。全身に拡がった四角い紋様は炭酸カルシウムの結晶とは思われず、帽子や着衣の破片では無かろうか。ただ鼻が小さくて低いのは、当時の遺伝的形質の一つで、他にもしばしば遭遇するものである。いずれにしても高頭で大きな顔面角を持ったと見られる智的なミニ少女である」
岡村先生はついにミニ人類の心の内面にまで踏み込み始める。写真をコピーしてスキャンした、かなり画質は悪い画像で判断するほかないのだけれども、私には先生の見ているものが見えない。とても残念である。
「 図16は同じく全身裸の長岩ミニ人の男女二人である。相対して舞踏中のところらしい。共に骨盤が大きくよく腹部内臓の重さを支えている様が十分に見取れ、下肢はそれらを移動させるのに直立の姿勢で当っている。ここで注目すべきことは、こちら側の婦人が胸を強く締めつけていることであり、現代のコルセットによる整形に当り、おしゃれが当時すでに女性の心を占領していたと見てよかろう。それはまた、人類に始めから性徴が無かったことにもなる。また、このダンシング像からは当時すでに言語更に音楽が存在していたことが想像される」
全身裸の男女を見ていながら、舞踏中と表現するところが岡村先生の奥ゆかしさである。
「 図18はシルル紀の或日、突如として長岩地域を襲った大地震に当り、幼児を抱いて海中に転落し、安全地帯を求めて浅い処を徒渉中、追討の土砂に瞬時に埋没、そのまま死亡して後化石となったミニ父子である。父子ともに衣服を着ており、殊に父には太さの似合ったズボンが証明せられ、又靴も見える。親子の情愛には幾億年の差も、幾百倍の体長の差も無関係なのである」
岡村先生は、ここでもやはり200年前のキュヴィエと同じく天変地異説を採用しているとみえる。こうして化石となっているのは、天変地異で一瞬にして土砂に埋もれた人々なのである。
さて当時のミニ人類が、サイズ以外、今の人類とまったく同じ生活をしていたかというとそうではない。岡村先生によれば、当時の地球には人類を捕食する竜と呼ばれる生物がいたようなのである。
「話変って長岩石灰岩を鏡検中に私はしばしば図31に集めたような奇怪な状景に遭遇した。人体が竜によってぐるぐる巻にせられていることであって、中には竜と格闘していることもある(d)。その中にlのように人頭が竜の腹の中から出現したのをみて、竜が人を捕食することがあると判断したのである。（中略）竜は食人鬼だったのである。しかもiの竜に舐められている少女も将に風前の灯というさまである」
それでは、竜は単なる人類の天敵かというとそうではない。岡村先生は驚くべき事実を明らかにする。竜と人類は近縁の生物なのである！
「長岩標本を鏡検すると、我々はしばしば高頭で人類の顔を持ちながら身体はまだ竜形で手足の生えていない生物に遭遇する（図32）。これを人類の高頭竜身の時代と名づける。これから手足が出れば、高頭の人身である」
岡村先生によれば、原ミニ人は、水棲の卵嚢内で発生し、おたまじゃくしのような姿をした低頭、球頭、高頭の三竜身期を経て四肢が生えてきて陸棲の成体になっていたのだそうである。「原」とついているところをみると、いつしか今の人類と同じ胎生になったものらしい。「種は永久に不変」という最初の主張とは矛盾するような気もするのだが……。
かなり長くなってしまったのでこのへんで。しかしきわめて入手困難な岡村先生のこの幻の名著、どこかで復刊してくれないものでしょうか。
What would the Simpsons look like if they were real people ?
Keeping your feedback in mind from our original Homer study , along with the characteristics of the family members , the following presentation reveals how the entire family would look as real Simpsonoids .
Homer , in his mid-30 ’s is our favorite donut eating , bumbling buffoon .
As a real person , he has proven to be a funny ( and often scary ) sight .
Marge is the 34 year old mother who the Simpsons rely on to maintain their sanity .
She`s the wholesome , grounded yin to her husband`s unpredictable yang .
There have been many instances in which the 6′2 ″ tall Marge was insinuated as being a very attractive yummy mummy .
We chose to begin with a relatively attractive model .
Similar to the cartoon , this reality study loses much of her attractiveness as a Simpsonoid .
Bart is generally described as being between 9 and 11 years old .
For his sake , we should assume that his hair , not his head itself provides the spiked appearance .
Lisa is 8 years old , an environmental freak , and an apparent genius .
Having been mistaken for a college student , Lisa should have an appearance that conveys her exact age in a slightly visually ambiguous manner .
Like Bart ’s hair , Lisa ’s is also styled in a spiky fashion , contributing to her spiked appearance .
Maggie ’s decades long life as a Simpson has only spanned one ( eventful ) Simpson year .

Jones ' politics have become increasingly at odds with a Republican Party that he believes has lost its moorings .
GOP congressman pays price for opposing war
NEW BERN , N.C -- Rep. Walter B. Jones Jr. ( R - N.C. ) is a household name in this military - friendly district represented in Congress by his family -- first by his late father , a Democrat , and now by him -- for most of the past 40 years .
Jones ' folksy demeanor , commitment to constituent service and deeply Christian values made him virtually unbeatable since he won election to Congress in 1994 .
Until two years ago , Jones was probably best known nationally for championing " freedom fries " to replace " french fries " in the House cafeteria -- a hit with the GOP 's right - wing base .
Advertisement
But after co-sponsoring a measure with Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) in June 2005 calling for a time - certain troop withdrawal from Iraq , Jones began taking heat from many of those same supporters .
His U - turn on war policy attracted some unusual publicity for a press - shy conservative : an appearance on ABC News with Kucinich , long considered an anti-war bogeyman by the right , and a cover story in the liberal Mother Jones magazine .
Now , the consequences look more threatening .
For the first time in more than a decade , Jones faces a serious primary challenger in Onslow County Commissioner Joe McLaughlin , a former Army Ranger , and their race will test how opposition to the Iraq war plays out in conservative and pro-military America .
Jones is not the only Republican to have broken with Bush on Iraq .
Others , in more moderate , suburban districts , have also drawn primary challengers .
But in this eastern North Carolina district -- one which spans parts of the Outer Banks -- the conviction that patriotism means supporting even unpopular wars runs as deep as the Atlantic Ocean .
Jones ' politics have become increasingly at odds with a Republican Party that he believes has lost its moorings .
Although he voted to authorize the war in Iraq , he has since become one of its most vociferous opponents .
He was one of only two House Republicans to vote against expanding the scope of the administration 's anti-terrorist surveillance program .
And he thinks Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is downright incompetent , and believes vice presidential aide Scooter Libby should have served some jail time -- " at least for a day or two . "
Those are fighting words in an unabashedly pro-Bush district that gave the president 68 percent of the vote in 2004 .
Supporting the troops here means supporting their mission , regardless of national approval rates for the war 's handling .
In Jones ' district , Marines deploy to Iraq from Camp Lejeune , one of the largest military bases in the U.S. Cherry Point , the largest Marine Corps air station in the country , serves as the economic engine of Craven County .
At the New Bern Airport , soldiers reunite with their wives and girlfriends amid hugs and tears .
And along the fence outside Lejeune , a line of bedsheets welcomes returning troops with moving messages .
A visit to Cubbie 's , the diner that put " freedom fries " on the map , tells plenty about voter sentiment here -- and about Jones ' vulnerability .
Owner Neal Rowland , 30 , received international acclaim when , in the run-up to the Iraq war , he renamed french fries " freedom fries " to show support for the troops .
Jones picked up on the idea , and after taking it to the House cafeteria , he visited Cubbie 's and autographed a signed photo that Rowland had framed .
Four years later , the photo of Rowland and Jones is long gone , replaced with a " McLaughlin for Congress " bumper sticker .
Rowland said many of his patrons began to question the presence of Jones ' photo on a wall filled with tributes to the troops .
" Everybody 's turned anti-Walter , " Rowland said recently .
" At least a good once a week , somebody will always say , ' What happened to your man ? '
They want to know why he 's voting the way he is . "
Jones now describes his association with freedom fries as " an accident to begin with " and says he wishes he'd never gotten involved with it .
" It was a novel idea at the time , but if people want to call them freedom fries , potatoes -- there 's no symbolism .
There was initially .
It 's old news now , " said Jones .
Despite his opposition to the war , Jones says he 's been a steadfast supporter of the troops .
He has signed more than 6,700 letters to families throughout the country who lost loved ones in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Inside the entrance to his Hill office are photographs of fallen soldiers .
His staff closely attends to veterans ' issues , and he insists that his position of setting a time - certain date for withdrawal is winning support among constituents .
" There is becoming more of a belief there 's got to be a better definition of victory than we 're seeing , " said Jones .
" You can continue to dig and dig to make a hole bigger .
People want to see an endpoint . "
At a local barbecue restaurant last week , he delivered a passionate speech defending his position -- and slamming the administration 's foreign policy .
He approvingly read from Lt. Gen. Greg Newbold 's 2006
Time editorial attacking the Bush administration for using " 9/11 's tragedy to hijack our security policy . "
He accused the " neocons " -- he repeated the phrase twice -- of manipulating intelligence to sell the Iraq war to the public .
He said he was more concerned with terrorists coming from South America than from Iraq .
" Many people get their news from Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity , " Jones said after the speech , referring to the popular conservative radio talk show hosts .
" I get my news in classified briefings with military experts and CIA experts .
I have to make my decision based on what the experts say . "
His position on the war , however , appears to be alienating some longtime and influential supporters from the most populous counties in his district .
Onslow County GOP Chairman Ron Cherubini has refused to endorse Jones for reelection and is actively supporting his opponent , McLaughlin , even though party chairmen normally remain neutral in intraparty fights .
Craven County Republican Party Chairman Michael Speciale is still supporting Jones but admitted he might lose if the primary were held today .
" I 've talked to a lot of people and I have n't talked to anyone that 's still supporting him , " said Speciale .
" Everywhere I go , people get upset with me because I 'm still supporting him .
They think I 'm on the wrong side .
Here 's a man who served us well most of these years .
We disagree with him right now and we 're ready to kick him out to pasture . "
McLaughlin is capitalizing on that sentiment and offering a hawkish message to voters .
A retired Army Ranger , McLaughlin said he had been a longtime supporter of Jones but believes the congressman is now " standing shoulder to shoulder with [ House Speaker ] Nancy Pelosi and [ anti- war activist ] Cindy Sheehan " because he voted with Democrats on legislation to set a timetable for troop withdrawal from Iraq .
" I 've got something that Walter used to have but wo n't ever have again , and that 's the motivated base , the men and women who wore the country 's uniform , who know that weakness in the face of tyrants is fatal , " McLaughlin said .
At this point , McLaughlin has low name identification in the district -- the sentiment is more anti-Jones than pro-McLaughlin .
But McLaughlin 's campaign manager , Doug Raymond , a veteran of North Carolina politics , believes that in a low - turnout primary , enthusiasm will be higher for McLaughlin than for the longtime incumbent .
" Jones ' people are quiet and they are hesitant .
They 're not beating the drums for ' Jones for Congress . '
They say , ' I know he 's wrong on supporting the troops , and [ I ] know he 's been standing with Cindy Sheehan , but he 's still my guy , ' " said Raymond .
" On Election Day , we have the infrastructure advantage .
We 're going to have the boots on the ground .
We 're going to have the poll workers . "
Neither candidate has done much fundraising .
Jones raised only $ 53,000 in the second quarter -- one of the lowest totals for a targeted incumbent .
But McLaughlin raised only $ 31,000 , and Raymond acknowledged that they 'll need to pick up the pace to mount a well - organized challenge .
McLaughlin spent time in Washington with a handful of conservative groups earlier this month , including the anti-tax Club for Growth .
The group has had considerable success aiding first - time GOP candidates with fundraising , and successfully helped oust a GOP incumbent in a primary last year .
They recently endorsed an opponent to Rep. Wayne Gilchrest ( R - Md. ) , who , like Jones , opposes the Iraq war .
" We thought the interview went very well .
[ Jones ' ] record just generally is not very good on economic issues , " said Club for Growth Executive Director David Keating .
Jones is an outspoken opponent of free - trade agreements , arguing that " this country cannot continue to send manufacturing jobs around the world . "
That populist sentiment plays well at home , and when he brought up the subject at the forum , he was greeted with a chorus of amens .
McLaughlin also raises the economy as a talking point against Jones , accusing him of supporting several pork - barrel projects outside the district .
But the issue animating the pending primary campaign is , first and foremost , the Iraq war .
McLaughlin is staking his entire campaign on whether the Iraq war can be enough of a political asset in one of the most conservative districts in the country to unseat a longtime , well - respected congressman .
" Veterans of a certain age who wore the uniform in the Vietnam era , they remember very clearly how they were treated .
Now they 're having flashbacks of what their elected officials did for them back in the ' 60s , " McLaughlin said .
In 2005 , when George Stephanopoulos asked Jones on ABC's " This Week " how his opposition to the war would affect his political future , Jones brought up some advice from his father , who was first elected to Congress during the heated political debate over the Vietnam War .
" I 'm going to do what my heart tells me to do .
And if that means it jeopardizes my being reelected , I can always tell you that my daddy , who served for 26 years in the United States House of Representatives , always told me to vote my conscience first , my constituency second and my party third . "
" ... societies , as often as not , are n’t murdered .
They commit suicide : they slit their wrists and then , in the course of many decades , stand by passively and watch themselves bleed to death . "

The ban was very unpopular with young Swazis
The girls have had to wear large woollen tassels as a sign of their chastity since 2001 .
The sex ban was imposed to fight the spread of HIV / Aids .
About 40 % of the population are HIV positive .
In 2001 , the king fined himself a cow for breaking the ban by marrying again , but he could choose another wife at the annual reed dance this weekend .
In the two - day ceremony bare - breasted girls will dance before the monarch .
King Mswati transgressed the ban when he took a 17 - year - old girl as his ninth wife just two months after imposing the sex ban in September 2001 , sparking unprecedented protests by Swazi women outside the royal palace .
Meanwhile , the health ministry has released new figures which show that 29 % of Swazis aged 15 - 19 are HIV positive .
For pregnant women , the figures were 42 % .
Ban enforced
" We are happy that we are through with this and I am very proud that I have been faithful to this rite , " said Ntombi Dlamini , 19 , as she threw away her tassels .
No official reason has been given about why the sex ban was ended a year early .
The BBC's Thulani Mthethwa in Swaziland says the ban was very unpopular with young Swazis .
King Mswati has been criticised for his lavish lifestyle
If propositioned by a man , the girls were supposed to throw the tassels outside his house and his family would have to pay a fine of a cow .
But many Swazis were unhappy that King Mswati 's daughters were rarely seen wearing the tassels .
But our correspondent says that in rural areas , the tassels were common because the ban was enforced by local chiefs and some schools insisted that girls wore them to get a place .
King Mswati now has 12 wives and another fiancee .
His late father , King Sobhuza II , who led the country to independence in 1968 , had more than 70 wives when he died in 1982 .
