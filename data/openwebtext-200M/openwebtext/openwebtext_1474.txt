House liberals pressed President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaIt 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting ' MORE on healthcare reform Thursday and left the White House without making any commitments to vote for the final bill .
Rep. Barbara Lee ( D - Calif. ) , chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus , told The Hill that liberals challenged Obama on the lack of a public health insurance option and other provisions in the Senate bill the president has endorsed .

Lee said Obama said he still " strongly supports " a public option , but " the votes are n't there .
" But , she said , Obama said the current healthcare legislation is a " foundation , " adding he " would work with us on the next effort . "
" I am going to keep hop[ing ] for a public option , " Lee said .
" And he said he 's going to work with us .
" Lee did say , however , that the president was " noncommittal " about pushing for a public option in the future .
The meeting between the members and the president comes as the White House has begun a full - on push to get healthcare legislation passed in the coming weeks , with a stated goal of House passage of the Senate - passed bill by March 18 .
The Senate measure will go under some changes through the reconciliation process .
said Thursday that the president wants to see House passage before Obama leaves for a trip to Indonesia and Australia on March 18 .
Gibbs said the White House is " making one final push " to get that done .
But Lee said lawmakers present at the White House meetingsaid they have serious concerns about the Senate - passed measure .
Lee said the discussion was " candid " and the president listened to their concerns .
After the meeting , she said , " I do n't think there was consensus on anything .
" Most liberals are expected to vote for the final bill .
Even though many on the left complained about the House healthcare bill , only one liberal — ( D - Ohio ) — voted no last November .
Other House Democratic members who attended the 1:30 p.m. meeting with Obama included Reps. Kucinich , ( Ariz . ) , ( D - Ill . ) and ( D - Calif. ) , among others .
At 2:30 p.m. , Obama met with Democrats who lean more toward the middle , including Reps . ( Pa. ) , ( Ill. ) , ( Calif . ) , ( N.Y. ) , ( Wis . ) , ( Pa. ) and ( Wash . ) .
Of these lawmakers , only Altmire voted no against the House - passed bill .
Schwartz told The Hill on Thursday afternoon that the president spoke " very plainly , very directly " and not only urged the members to vote for the final bill , but to rally support for it .
Obama indicated lawmakers need to be pragmatic , noting that he did n't get everything he wanted in the measure , according to the Pennsylvania Democrat .
Obama is seeking to foster unity among congressional Democrats , knowing few , if any , Republicans will back his healthcare reform effort .

( Newser ) – California 's ballot initiative to be considered this November would legalize use and sale of marijuana — but exactly how much pot are we talking ?
If the initiative passes , adults over 21 will be allowed to possess up to an ounce for personal use , and each residence would be able to grow up to 25 square feet of it .
Cities and counties will also have the option of allowing and taxing marijuana cultivation , transportation , and sale .
Currently a slim majority of California voters is in favor of the measure .
Advocates hope to convince undecided voters — a group that consists largely of mothers — with arguments that legalization would undercut drug cartels , free up police to fight more serious crime , and make it harder for teenagers to buy marijuana , the Los Angeles Times reports .
Opponents say legalization would increase marijuana use , thus adding to social problems and putting more demands on law enforcement .

Seoul , South Korea ( CNN ) --
Police have arrested a South Korean couple whose toddler starved to death while they were raising a virtual child online , authorities said .
The couple fed their 3 - month - old daughter once a day between marathon stretches in a local Internet cafe , where they were raising a virtual child in the fantasy role - playing game Prius Online , police told local reporters Friday .
Prius Online is a 3 - D game in which players nurture an online companion , Anima , a young girl with mysterious powers who grows and increases her skills as the game progresses .
Police have not identified the 41 - year - old father and 25 - year - old mother , who lived in Suwon , a suburb south of Seoul .
But the father apologized , speaking to reporters .
" I wish that she had n't got sick and that she will live well in heaven forever .
And as the father , I am sorry , " he said .
The baby reportedly died five months ago .
South Korea has one of the world 's fastest broadband networks .
Seoul has won international awards for e-governance .
Online gaming teams are sponsored by major conglomerates and 24 - hour , high - speed Internet cafes , known as PC Bangs , dot every urban neighborhood .
Police said the couple had lost their jobs and used the game as an escape from reality , especially after the birth of their premature baby .
" They instead played an online game in which they raised a virtual character so as to escape from reality , which led to the death of their real baby , " Chung Jin-won , a police officer in Suwon , told Yonhap News Agency .
" South Korea remains a very conservative society so people who fall outside the norm can come under severe stress and pressure , " said Michael Breen , the Seoul - based author of " The Koreans . "
" The Internet has provided such people with a paradise to escape to and simply get lost in . "
Boy , 6 , has eye glued shut after nurse bungles treatment to cut head
A six - year - old boy was left blind in one eye for almost a week after a surgical glue applied by a nurse to close a head wound dripped into his eye .
Lewis Farrell screamed in agony as the glue closed his eye shut during treatment at a hospital casualty unit for a cut forehead sustained in a playground fall .
Today his mother , Becky Lewis , told how she fears the child may suffer permanent damage to his sight after the hospital blunder .
Lewis Farrell was left in agony after surgical glue applied to a head wound trickled into his eye , leaving him unable to see out of it for almost a week
She accused staff at Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham of being more interested in covering up for what they had done than apologising for the error .
Mrs Lewis said : ' The nurse asked Lewis to sit upright before squirting glue on to his head .
She made no effort to stop the glue dripping down .
' Then as she turned around , it dripped into his eye .
They should have realised something like this could have happened .
Since the incident , Lewis has woken up most nights suffering from nightmares .
' He is only six and it was terrifying for him and for me to see him like that .
' He was crying and shouting , " Mummy , I ca n't open my eyes " - he was hysterical .
' The nursing sister kept saying , " I 've never seen this before in my life " , but no one apologised for what they had done to Lewis .
' The staff were trying to make excuses and cover up their error for each other and that made me so angry . '
Medics spent almost six hours trying to drip fluid into the eye to ease it open before eventually discharging Lewis home to his mother and father , Martin Farrell , a 26 - year - old car parts engineer , with the patch and advice to keep bathing his right eye .
He has had to wear an eye patch since the incident last Tuesday and has been unable to return to school because the eye is still sore , with ' clumps ' of glue still in and around it .
Doctors called the glue 's manufacturer who assured them that the product was water - based and posed no risk of permanent eyesight damage .
Lewis was being treated at Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham when the accident happened
But the couple , from Northfield , Birmingham , who have three other children , are planning to get a second medical opinion .
Mrs Lewis , a housewife , added : ' My concern is that if they say this has n't happened before , how can they be sure about that ?
' I will be getting a second opinion .
There should be a standard practice in place to ensure that glue does n't trickle into someone 's eye .
' Lewis has been left mentally traumatised by the ordeal - he has n't slept properly because he is suffering nightmares about what happened and not being able to see . '
Hospitals are increasingly using medical adhesives to close wounds instead of butterfly strips or stitches to avoid the uncomfortable and painful process of sewing and later removing stitches , particularly when children are involved .
The glue is chemically similar to that used in factories but has been sterilised and modified for medical use .
Gareth Duggan , a spokesman for University Hospitals Birmingham Foundation Trust , which runs Selly Oak Hospital , said new procedures had been put in place to prevent it happening again .
He said : ' Due to issues of patient confidentiality , we cannot comment on this case .
' But the Trust has reviewed its procedure and upon advice from consultant staff , an eye patch will be applied prior to application of tissue glue in any future closure of this nature .
' The adhesive used poses no risk to health or vision and loses its adhesive power over a period of one or four days , after which the eye opens normally . '

“ I ’m tired of paying for everyone else ’s stupidity , ” is a comment I read on the Internet last week after the health care bill was passed .
It summed up the views of many Americans worried about shelling out higher premiums and taxes to cover the uninsured .
Why should we pick up the tab when so much disease in our country stems from unhealthy behavior like smoking and overeating ?
In fact , the majority of Americans say it is fair to ask people with unhealthy lifestyles to pay more for health insurance .
We believe in the concept of personal responsibility .
You hear it in doctors ’ lounges and in coffee shops , among the white collar and blue collar alike .
Even President Obama has said , “ We ’ve got to have the American people doing something about their own care . ”
But personal responsibility is a complex notion , especially when it comes to health .
Individual choices always take place within a broader , messy context .
When people advocate the need for personal accountability , they presuppose more control over health and sickness than really exists .
Unhealthy habits are one factor in disease , but so are social status , income , family dynamics , education and genetics .
Patient noncompliance with medical recommendations undoubtedly contributes to poor health , but it is as much a function of poor communication , medication costs and side effects , cultural barriers and inadequate resources as it is of willful disregard of a doctor ’s advice .

Recently by Gary North : Why Did Jim Wallis Viciously Attack Glenn Beck , When Beck Has All Those Video Clips of Him ?
Has n’t He Heard of YouTube ?
President Obama got his training with ACORN .
Where the ACORN falls , so grows the tree .
ACORN has fallen .
ACORN got caught by a pair of creative actors , both conservatives .
They went to ACORN posing as a pimp and his woman .
How could they get government aid ?
ACORN had suggestions .
They videotaped the exchange .
Then they took a modified video — yes , faked — to Andrew Breitbart , the Web site master .
The fake was this : in the video , the young man appears in a pimp ’s outfit .
In fact , he did not wear it in the room .
This is being made into a big deal by the liberal media .
“ Why , it ’s all a fake ! ” Look , the whole stunt was fake .
What was not fake was the response from ACORN ’s employees : the offer to help them get the money and break the law .
Breitbart tried to get the networks to run the video .
He was turned down .
So , he took it to Mr. Video Clip , Glenn Beck .
Beck ran it .
That was how ACORN got on the Web .
The story is here .
The publicity has ruined ACORN .
It lost a fortune in contracts from the Federal government .
It is close to bankruptcy , laments this Leftist site .
It has local chapters .
Its agenda will survive .
But the tree got knocked down .
THE GREAT IRONY
I am of course both amused and delighted .
Mostly amused .
This was the perfect response to ACORN .
That is because ACORN had long employed the tactics of a master organizer , Saul Alinsky .
He wrote a book on his tactics , Rules for Radicals .
It was published in 1971 , the year before he died .
Alinsky was a radical , not a revolutionary .
His strategy was to study an organization carefully .
Understand how it works , he said .
Then identify a weakness that is inherent in its rules or practices .
He was amazingly successful at challenging organizations and forcing them to change their policies .
The two actors may not have understood that they were using a tactic devised by Alinsky .
They spotted a weakness in ACORN ’s practices : its commitment to getting government money for small businesses .
They staged a charade .
ACORN ’s employees fell for it .
It did not seem remarkable to them that a white teenage hooker and her white pimp wanted money from the government to set up a prostitution house for teenage girls who were in the clutches of a “ bad ” pimp .
Government - subsidized entrepreneurship was right up ACORN ’s alley .
That was the end of ACORN .
The charade was legal .
There is no law against impersonating a hooker and her pimp .
Let me describe a classic Alinsky tactic .
I wrote about it in 1983 .
A Christian college ’s administration had allowed the students to invite Alinsky to speak .
This was stupid .
They soon learned just how stupid it was .
Students came up to him after the lecture .
They complained that nothing was allowed on campus .
“ What is allowed ? ” he asked .
“ We can chew gum . ” “ That ’s it , ” he said .
He told them to buy lots of gum .
“ Keep chewing it .
Spit it out the school sidewalks .
Keep doing it , day after day .
Tell the administration you will quit when it relaxes the other rules . ”
It took one week .
You can read my column on Alinsky here .
ACORN got gummed by a pair of actors .
Now it is Obama ’s turn to get gummed .
OBAMACARE AND THE HEALING STATE
National health care is the second most important of all government welfare programs .
The first is funding education and making it compulsory .
But this is generally enforced at the state level in the United States .
Why is government - funded medical care so important ?
Because it is the symbol of a state that has the power to extend life .
It is the supreme agency of healing .
Any government that does not pass laws funding and controlling the health care delivery system is seen by the apologists of state power as being inconsistent .
A state that cannot heal is not a true god .
The modern humanist state presents itself as the final court of appeal .
It supposedly possesses final sovereignty .
Four centuries ago , this was called the divine right of kings .
That meant that the king was the final court of appeal .
There was no one or nothing higher , other than God .
Today , the government ’s position is that there is no God .
Therefore , the state is the final sovereign .
It is God by default .
A final sovereign must possess the power of life and death .
So , we live under the jurisdiction of a welfare - warfare state .
The United States has had Medicare ever since 1965 .
The state has proclaimed itself as a healer of the old .
This expense will bankrupt the Federal government unless the law is modified to allow cost-cutting .
Politically , this is not yet possible .
The oldsters want the money : over to $ 11,000 a year in subsidies .
This was not enough , according to Democrats .
Another 30 million Americans need health insurance coverage .
Now they are going to get it .
Voters are going to pay .
Why is n’t this good politics ?
Because the Federal government waited too long .
It is now running annual deficits over $ 1.5 trillion .
This does not count the extra two trillion or so that accrue to the unfunded Medicare program each year .
That is part of the off - budget budget .
At some point , all those oldsters who are dependent on the off - budget budget will be placed on the off - life support system .
They will have their life support unplugged , at least figuratively and in some cases literally .
The motivation to get those 30 million people inside the health insurance system is a deeply religious motivation .
The Democrats were upset that the United States government was not doing enough .
What kind of healer is that ?
The total expenditure for health care in the United States is about 15 % of gross domestic product — higher than any other nation .
This was not enough .
There had to be more , the Democrats said .
So , there will be .
Costs will rise .
Politicians are now on the hook .
Who will pay these costs ?
It ’s a government program now .
There is no escape for the politicians .
They must make some voting bloc angry .
But which ?
What a dilemma !
The anger is enormous .
It will increase .
As of March 20 , 59 % of voters were opposed .
They see themselves as being ignored , which is in fact the case .
This has created an opportunity for Republicans .
They voted no unanimously .
This is pure politics .
How often does a party vote 100 % opposed ?
Almost never .
They smell blood , and they reacted as sharks do .
They voted for Bush ’s bankrupting prescription drug subsidy program .
Now they are all opposed .
It ’s politics .
Fifty years ago , I was talking with my liberal Democrat friend Joel Blain .
Both of us knew how the subsidy ratchet works .
It just keeps going up .
So , he said to me , knowing full well I understood the game , “ Just let us pass a health care bill .
We ’ll try it for a couple of years .
If it does n’t work , you can repeal it . ”
That was Eisenhower ’s last year in office .
There was no way that the Federal government would pass a socialized medicine program .
We both knew that .
But if it ever did , it would be forever .
It would create voting constituents .
Half a century later , the Democrats have gotten their way .
The leadership recognizes that it will not be repealed .
The leadership is serious about this law .
These people know that the fall elections will result in Democrat losses .
Harry Reid is way behind in Nevada .
Yet they voted for the bill .
They understand the religious implications of such sacrifice .
They did it for the cause .
The Federal government has extended its authority as a healer .
With this authority will come lots of additional power .
They have sent a message to voters :
“ We have sacrificed the principle of majority rule for the sake of a higher cause . ”
In principle , this is correct .
If the voters want something evil , politicians should not vote for it .
In early America , this was understood .
Democracy meant the right of a majority to vote out of office anyone who opposed its will .
It did not mean that a politician had a moral obligation to do what the majority wanted done every time .
He was allowed to commit political suicide .
The Democrats face this problem : this view of democracy has not been widely preached or believed since 1913 : the direct election of Senators .
The push toward mass democracy has been constant .
The older view has been abandoned .
But now the Democrats have reverted to the older view .
They will pay for this next November .
POLITICAL REVENGE
There is nothing morally wrong with the politics of revenge .
Getting back at a politician for voting the wrong way was basic to early American politics .
The Jeffersonians in 1800 got back at John Adams and the Federalists for the Alien and Sedition Acts .
That ended Federalism as a national force .
No one mourns their passing today .
Few did in1801 .
This time , there is enormous anger among hard - core Republicans and independents .
They will not forget .
Usually , voters do forget , but not this time .
The law back - loads the financing .
The burden will hit in full force in 2014 .
This is standard politics , but this time , it will backfire .
Why ?
Because of the size of the Federal deficit .
The welfare states of Western Europe swallowed the pill of socialized medicine after World War II .
The voters have gotten used to the cost .
It is part of the social background .
To single out medical costs as uniquely bankrupting is unthinkable , even though true .
Here , it is different .
The law will go into effect at a time when the deficit has become unthinkably high .
It finally is getting through to voters that it threatens their lifestyles in the future .
They are beginning to get afraid .
They should be afraid .
The Democrats waited too long .
The deficits are now Obama’s .
They must be dealt with on his watch .
He refuses to deal with them .
In this setting , the Democrats rammed through the bill .
The voters will be reminded , year by year , that this was done against their will .
The Democrats will not be able to blame Bush .
The burden will aggravate people , because they did not want the program .
Democrats assume that voters will forget .
Voters at the margin will not forget .
They will be reminded .
To get blamed , the Republicans must have the White House , the House , and 60 votes in the Senate .
Until this happens , they can play the role of helpless babes in the woods .
That means the Democrats will get blamed .
This issue will not go away , because costs will rise .
The tea party movement is at present amateurish .
Time will take care of that .
If Republicans do not deal with it , they will lose elections .
The revolt against waffling is real .
These people are dangerous to Republicans who waffle on spending .
They will not be able to be elected .
Usually , negative voting blocs get marginalized .
The beneficiaries of boondoggles are concentrated .
They want the subsidy .
The opponents are not well organized .
The costs of the boondoggle are shared by too many taxpayers .
Resistance is minimal compared to the promotion .
This time it will be different .
The politics of vengeance is now in play .
The voters will be reminded , year after year , that the program was shoved down their throats .
CONCLUSION
Alinsky always searched for the weak spot in the opposition ’s system .
Then he exploited it .
Obama now has a weak point : ObamaCare .
This time , the taxpayers and insurance premium payers and patients sitting endlessly in filled doctors ’ offices will be reminded about who did it to them .
It was Obama and the banshee with the huge Medicare gavel , Nancy Pelosi .
They pride themselves on having thwarted the voters .
They believe they will get away with it .
They think voters will forget .
But medical care costs are close to people ’s hearts .
They will pay attention to their bills , including their tax bills .
The tea party types will make it hot for Republicans who think they can keep spending .
The climate of opinion has changed .
The deficit has changed it .
The costs of this program will not be ignored .
This is not Europe .
This is a new program .
It was passed by a defiant majority in Congress .
That majority will be depleted .
The very phrase , “ ObamaCare , ” will become a liability .
It ought to be called PelosiCare , but it is n’t .
Obama has defined his administration by this one law .
He got it passed .
He owns it .
The tea parties have only just begun .
The Democrats are not afraid yet .
What will make a difference will be Republicans who lose because they refuse to give the tea party voters what they want .
The Christian Right got bought off easily in Reagan ’s first year .
All they demanded was rhetoric .
Reagan was good at this .
So , they were eased out by the Bush faction , which ran the White House under Reagan .
They were in the Bush family ’s hip pocked , so the Bushes sat on them .
The tea party will not get bought off so easily .
Their anger is too great .

The additional demand from abroad is contributing to rising property prices - with average median prices surging more than 10 per cent in capital cities last year - and fuelling the disappointment of would - be local buyers who are being out - bid .
'' We have lost three properties ( that we know of ) to overseas investors who pushed the prices well above the limits of the Australian residents in the room , '' said Nikki Symonds , from Sydney 's Lane Cove .
'' Three overseas online bidders pushed the price up from $ 880,000 to $ 950,000 . ''
'' Our search continues , but we are forced to look further and further outside of Sydney to have even the faintest hope of securing a house , '' she said .
'' Great Australian Dream ?
I do n't think so . ''
Others expressed doubt about Dr Keen 's view on Chinese investment .
‘‘ The ' bubble crew ' seem to keep missing the main story , ’’ said Macquarie interest rate strategist Rory Robertson .
‘‘ There ’s extraordinary and ongoing rapid growth in the number of actual people in Australia with money wanting to own or rent houses in which to live - as opposed to living in tents and shipping containers - while the underlying long - term trend in homebuilding remains flat near 150,000 per annum . ’’
That demand , against a structural shortage of supply , is what is keeping up home prices , said Mr Robertson .
( The banks ) have got us working as debt slaves and there 's an enormous transfer of wealth as a result While Dr Keen has made some contentious comments about the local real estate market , his view that China is facing a real estate bubble of its own - which is part of the reason for the overflow into the Australian market - is gaining wider currency .
Property prices in 70 Chinese cities jumped 9.5 per cent in January from a year ago , the fastest pace in 21 months , prompting the central government to direct its banks to slow lending .
China resorted to massive stimulus spending to prevent the economy sliding into recession , but much of the money has ended up in asset markets , including real estate .
Charter Keck Cramer senior economist George Bougias said Asian countries are playing a bigger role in the local property market and people are increasingly looking at Australia as an attractive investment destination .
" As economic relations between Australia and China deepen , we can expect more interest from Chinese nationals in the Australian property market , " he said .
Nevertheless , the lack of statistics measuring the pace of their investment makes it difficult to determine the final impact .
'' We want to ensure that housing remains affordable for the majority of the population whether they 've been here for 200 years or just got off the plane . ''
Dr Keen , who is Associate Professor School of Economics & Finance at the University of Western Sydney , says Australian politicians viewed the trigger of the global financial crisis to be falling house prices in the US , and worked hard to prevent the same wave sweeping Australia .
The relaxing of foreign investment rules on property took effect in April , exempting temporary residents from giving notice to buy residence for their own use .
The rules also relaxed the definition of a " new " home , giving buyers from overseas more choice .
But the move was only part of the government 's actions to put a floor under housing prices , with Dr Keen singling out the boost to its First Home Owner Buyer 's grant in late 2008 as another major factor stoking demand for real estate .
In terms of heading off a major price correction , the policies worked .
Home prices dipped just 5.5 per cent in the year to the March 2009 quarter , before posting a 13.6 per cent rise in the year to December quarter .
According to Dr Keen , though , the hangover from the latest real estate binge is going to be a heavy one .
'' The crisis is caused by too much debt and it's too late to stop too much debt , '' said Dr Keen .
The government stimulus , the investment rules change and low interest rates have combined to swell the country 's mortgage debt by $ 100 billion more than where it was headed when it began to dip in March 2008 , according to numbers Dr Keen delivered in a speech in Melbourne today .
( China 's lending rates are typically lower than Australia 's . )
Had no First Home Owners Buyers ' grant been enacted Dr Keen estimates there to have been a $ 20 billion reduction in debt .
Dr Keen said the ratio of mortgage debt to the size of the economy - as measured by gross domestic product - hit 81.29 per cent in March 2008 .
It then eased to 80.37 per cent by November 2008 , before rising to a new record high of 84.28 per cent '' from where it is still rising , '' he said .
Dr Keen , it must be said , has drawn a legion of critics for his earlier predictions of a house price slump , which were coupled with the sale of his own residence in late 2008 in anticipation of a market collapse .
Those predictions included these made earlier this month .
He also famously lost a wager with Mr Robertson that home prices would be lower one year after September 2008 , and so Dr Keen must now hike 224 kilometre from Canberra to Mount Kosciuszko , while wearing a T - shirt emblazoned with the words '' I was hopelessly wrong on house prices .
Ask me how . ''
The second part of the bet , that home prices will sink by 40 per cent within 15 years , remains live .
Dr Keen says he plans to begin the trek on April 15 , but is undeterred by his detractors .
'' I'm being criticised for being consistent with the rest of the world ' ' , he offers as a defence .
Now that Australian home prices are rising , the cycle is again under way : prices must continue to climb to prevent a vicious cycle of forced sell - downs and asset price falls , he said .
'' Normally , once ( home prices ) go flat , they go down for the simple reason that if they stabilised and people have got themselves geared on rising prices , they 've got servicing costs that can only be met by selling on a rising market . ''
Further , the overall economy is depending on households borrowing more since business credit remains in the doldrums , he said .
Whichever direction house prices go , their growth over time and the ease with which borrowers have been ushered into huge loans by banks have made Australia a ' ' less equitable society ' ' than it was twenty years ago , Dr Keen said .
Describing himself both as an optimist and a cynic , Dr Keen compared the banks ' role in people 's lives to the warders of Australia 's penal era .
The huge amount of money being paid for homes is a ' ' classic case of a huge inequality and injustice behind the veneer of the fair go . ''
Loading '' But the warders are still among us , '' he said .
'' The warders are working with banks , they got us working as debt slaves and there 's an enormous transfer of wealth as a result . ''
Quick Overview
GPU 's higher processing power compared to a standard CPU comes at the cost of reduced data caching and flow control logic as more transistors have to be devoted to data processing .
This imposes certain limitations in terms of how an application may access memory and implement flow control .
As a result , implementation of certain algorithms ( even trivial ones ) on the GPU may be difficult or may not be computationally justified .
Histogram has been traditionally difficult to compute efficiently on the GPU .
Lack of an efficient histogram method on the GPU , often requires the programmer to move the data back from the device ( GPU ) memory to the host ( CPU ) , resulting in costly data transfers and reduced efficiency .
A simple histogram computation can indeed become the bottleneck of an otherwise efficient application .

Mutual information of two random variables is the amount of information that each carries about the other and is defined as
where H( X|Y ) is the information content of random variable X if Y is known , H ( X , Y ) is the joint entropy of the two random variables and is a measure of combined information of the two random variables .
I ( X;Y ) can be thought of as the reduction in uncertainty of random variable X as a result of knowing Y .
The uncertainty is maximally reduced , when there is a one - to - one mapping between the two random variables and is not reduced at all if the two random variables are independent and do not provide any information about one another .
The concept of mutual information has its origins in information theory and is widely used in other disciplines .
In medical image analysis , mutual information is used as a similarity measure for multi-modal registration .

China sold $ 34bn ( £ 21.5 bn ) worth of US government bonds in December , raising fears that ­Beijing is using its financial ­muscle to signal that it has lost confidence in American economic policy .
US treasury figures for the period ending in December 2009 show that , following the sale , China is no longer the largest overseas holder of US treasury bonds .
Beijing ended the year sitting on $ 755.4bn worth of US government debt , compared to Japan 's $ 768.8bn .
Since the sub - prime crisis that began on Main Street USA grew to engulf the global economy , China 's leaders have repeatedly expressed concerns about US policy .
December 's $ 34bn sell - off made only a tiny dent in Beijing 's total holdings of US assets , which amount to well over $ 1tn when stakes in American companies , as well as treasury bills , are taken into account .
But the news intensified concerns about China 's appetite for bankrolling ever - widening American deficits .
Premier Wen Jiabao told reporters last year : " We have made a huge amount of loans to the United States .
Of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets .
To be honest , I 'm a little bit worried . "
When Timothy Geithner , the US treasury secretary , visited China last summer , he sought to reassure his hosts , using a speech to promise that " the United States is committed to a strong and stable international financial system .
The Obama administration fully recognises that the United States has a special responsibility to play in this regard , and we fully appreciate that exercising this special responsibility begins at home . "
But Allan Meltzer , an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University , said China 's bond sales should be a wake - up call for Washington .
" The Chinese are worried that we have unsustainable debt levels , and we do not have a policy for dealing with it , " he said .
China 's sales contributed to a record drop in foreign holdings of short - term treasury bills in December : in all , net overseas holdings of short - term bills fell by $ 53 bn .
The previous record was $ 44.5 bn in April last year .
However , there was little sign that world investors as a whole have lost their confidence in the dollar as the safe - haven currency of choice : overall , the US saw a net inflow of $ 60.9bn , as investors more than offset sales of short - term debt by buying longer - term securities and shares .
Japan , Britain , Luxembourg and Hong Kong made sizeable purchases , with the UK buying $ 24.9 bn of US government debt .
Some analysts warned that it would be a mistake to read too much into one month 's data , particularly since the current crisis in the eurozone makes investors ' main alternative to the dollar look particularly unattractive .
David Wyss , chief economist at Standard & Poor 's in New York , said : " China may not be too happy with us right now , but you have to ask : what else are they going to do with their money ? "
Ho-fung Hung , author of China and the Transformation of Global Capitalism , said it was hard to tell whether China had a long - term strategy for selling US debt .
" I think decision - makers know very well that any large - scale selling of US treasuries wo n't do any good to the ­Chinese economy , which still needs a sustained recovery of the US economy to pull up its export sector .
Such selling will also devalue China 's existing holdings of treasuries , " he said .
" Dumping treasuries will also entail the problem of what to buy in return – definitely not euro or yen assets at the moment . "
However , America must sell an unprecedented volume of treasuries in the coming years to finance its record deficit , and pay the cost of bailing out Wall Street and kick - starting the economy with a $ 900 bn stimulus package .
Any evidence that foreign investors are beginning to doubt Obama 's promises to bring the public finances under control will spread alarm in Washington .
When 70 Percent Support Marijuana Legalization , Starbucks Gets The Message
By Steve Elliott
A remarkable scenario played out in the American media recently , and beyond the import of the story itself is the quantum shift in public perception that it illustrates .
A pro-cannabis group based in Colorado called for a nationwide boycott of coffee giant Starbucks after activists spotted a Starbucks logo on the website of a virulently extremist anti-drug organization .
After intense negative publicity ensued , Starbucks actually felt moved to issue a denial .
Once Mason Tvert of Safer Alternative For Enjoyable Recation ( SAFER ) called for the boycott , it took only a couple days until Starbucks denied funding the Colorado Drug Investigators Association ( CDIA ) .
Starbucks further said they officially took no position on the marijuana issue , one way or the other .
That does n’t sound so remarkable until you realize that the very nonchalance , the need to be noncommital , is emblematic of the change , the bedrock reality in the politics of marijuana that has already occurred under our feet .
For those of us who can remember the zeitgeist of two or three decades ago — when anything anti-marijuana could expect a warm corporate embrace while anything pro-pot was anathema to any self - respecting company – this is an exhilarating change of atmosphere .
What has happened is that we are now so near the tipping point where the majority will favor legalizing marijuana , that change has begun to acquire a sweet whiff of inevitability .
In fact , some recent polls have already indicated majority support for legalization .
Even larger majorities – in the 70 to 80 percent range nationwide – favor the legalization of marijuana for medical use .
Granted , one reason the Starbucks drama played out the way it did is undoubtedly the clumsiness of the anti-marijuana messengers involved .
The CDIA website , which was taken off the net just about an hour before Tvert ’s news conference , was pretty ugly .
It featured the slogan “ Death On Drugs ” and a Grim Reaper rappelling from a helicopter .
The problem was it also featured several corporate logos , including the familiar Starbucks symbol — apparently being used without corporate permission .
Sure , it ’s pretty sad for an organization to claim corporate sponsorship where none exists .
But the fact that now it ’s anti-marijuana organizations doing this – and being brushed away by the corporations themselves – is part of the unfolding drama of marijuana ’s ascendancy in public perception .

Evgeni Malkin : “ We lost to Canada because we did n’t play like a team ” ( Photo © Shaun Best , Reuters )
Russian star Evgeni Malkin gave an interview to Vasili Osipov of Sport - Express after the game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the New York Rangers at the Madison Square Garden .
In this interview Evgeni talked about the reasons of Team Russia ‘s defeat to Canada at the latest Olympic Tournament , examined the differences between the management of the two national teams and tried to suggest some changes to get the revenge in Sochi .
RussianHockeyFans.com offers you a translation of the interview .
“ Believe me , I still ca n’t understand what ’s happened at the Olympics , it was a big disappointment .
In Vancouver there was an extraordinary atmosphere and the organization was top notch .
But everything fell in the background because of Russia ’s results .
Everyone was expecting good results from hockey , but then …
I think that we ca n’t afford losing time in our preparation for 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi , we have to start right now .
Look at Canada : they suffered from two painful loss in the two latest WCs and in Vancouver they went in full forces , they really wanted to show to the whole world that they can play hockey .
And it showed .
Now we really have to learn from them , in every area .
We should analyze the work of Canadian coaches , scouts and even managers .
It ’s not a shame to learn from the best .
They managed to take the best from us , now it ’s time for us to do the same .
Otherwise getting good results in the best - on - best competitions , like the Olympics , will be very hard .
In four years in Sochi we will have to prove that such a bad defeat against Canada was only a fluke .
Maybe we burnt out a bit , we were playing against an opponent who could count on a lot of support from the crowd . ”
– Olympic emotions have now rushed out .
Is it now possible with a clear head what were the reasons of the defeat against team Canada ?
Malkin : “ Nothing have rushed out , it ’s still hard for me to talk about that .
Before that game the coaches told us to play cautiously in the first 10 - 15 minutes .
But for some reasons we all run forward to attack , even if it was important to pay much attention to the defensive play .
Now I think : ‘ Maybe we should have call a time - out after the first couple of goals ?
Maybe we should have change the goalie ? ’
But it ’s easy to talk now …
Mostly we lost be cause of details , little things .
As we were losing , we could n’t keep our tempers , everyone was trying to beat out with the puck the opponent whole line .
We did n’t show combinational play .
Probably the coaches should have told us to concentrate more and relax .
But , once again , it ’s easy to talk now …
But overall this game was a great experience for us and we have to come to the right conclusions . ”
– In Russia many are talking about the “ Vancouver Lesson ” .
About the fact that , for example , two coaches are n’t enough as they could n’t physically cover all the aspect of such a hard tournament like the Olympics .
Malkin : “ They speak the truth .
I think that two coaches are n’t enough .
And I do n’t understand why we ca n’t raise this number .
It ’s the first time I work with such a truncated staff .
And there was n’t enough information .
Bykov and Zakharkin won two WCs back to back and thus they decided not to change anything .
But these Olympics proved that in that tournament the level is a bit higher than at the WC .
We surely have to widen the staff board .
And I ’m talking not about coaches on the bench but rather people watching the game from the stands .
Almost all of the teams at the Olympics did this .
The Canadians had a lot of people who watched the games from there , making notes and then showing them to the team .
– It ’s a known fact that in North American teams they pay much attention to the tactics and to the video analysis of the opponents .
How did team Russia work with this at the Olympics and before the unfortunate game against team Canada ?
Malkin : “ You know , these are two whole different schools .
Of course we saw videos , analysed the opponents ’ play .
But the way they do it in North America and in Russia is really different .
We are behind Canada in this .
There was n’t enough information , let ’s admit it , especially for defencemen and forwards .
But anyway I think we are doing steps forward .
After all Bykov is a young coach , he will want to take his vendetta at the next WC and in Sochi .
I think that he will come to the right conclusions .
But I ’d like to add a thing .
My personal opinion is that combine the work as club ’s and national team ’s head coach is a very hard job .
It ’s tough to follow both the KHL and what happens overseas at the same time , and there is a big difference between working with a national team and a club .
But you it would be better to ask this question to the Russian Hockey Federation .
Its people have to think about the changes needed to improve the situation . ”
– And what kind of experience did you get from the Olympics ?
Malkin : “ Only that you really have to play with drive , but you also have to play with calm and stay relaxed .
And also that you have to play like a team .
We started losing against Canada when we stopped playing like a team .
It ’s a pity that after the defeat they threw so much mud at us .
I ’ve even read that the national team ’s players had a walk before the match against Canada .
This is a nonsense !
My team mates only thought about how to win and fight till the end .
Maybe there were some injuries , some players were tired or we had some bad luck , but no one broke the work regime . ”
– In Russia they also talk about the difference from NHL to KHL players .
Perry and Getzlaf ’s line easily won over Zinoviev ’s one .
Malkin : “ You ca n’t blame singular players .
We all made childish mistakes and after them they scored .
For example I lost a puck on our blue line and they scored us one of the goals .
You ca n’t say that the KHL lines were worse than others .
The game against Canada was hard for everyone .
And both Zinoviev ’s and Fedorov ‘s line played well against Slovakia and Czech Republic . ”
– How hard it was to switch to NHL regular season after the defeat against team Canada ?
Malkin : “ On the one hand it was n’t easy , but it ’s nice when you get back to your team .
I think I ’m already set here again .
Now I try to think about how to win the Stanley Cup .
Otherwise it would be really hard .
You ca n’t forget such a defeat in one day , not even in one week . ”
– Were you tired after the Olympic tournament ?
Malkin : “ Psychologically tired .
Where were the medals , the national pride after this bad defeat ?
After such things there are always provocative questions and it ’s hard to reply them .
You know , I review in my mind a lot of times many moments of that game .
I tried to analyse where we made mistakes .
I ’m still young so I recover quickly after the games , but when you are psychologically hurt it ’s much harder . ”
– Especially when you are sit next to Sidney Crosby , who scored the Game Winner in the Olympic Finals .
Malkin : “ I respect Crosby a lot as an athlete .
He got back to the practice without ostentation .
He did n’t show any peacockery like ‘ I ’m an Olympic Champion , I scored the Game - Winning goal ’ .
I thank Sidney for his support , he did n’t rub salt into the wound . ”
– During the Finals , who were you cheering for ?
Malkin : “ I left the Olympics a couple of days after the quarterfinals , I spent some time with my parents and friends .
I followed a bit what was happening , but I could n’t watch the final match , I was on the plane .
I looked at the result and Sid ’s goal only when we landed in Denver . ”
– Were you glad for your team mates ?
Malkin : “ Honestly speaking I felt a lot of envy .
But the better team won , and we can only congratulate Team Canada .
For our latest mission , 30 people throw a birthday party for a random stranger in a bar .
The mission was filmed with cameras hidden behind two way mirrors , and the audio comes from hidden wireless microphones ( both on our agents and hidden around the bar . )
Watch the video first , and then check out our behind - the - scenes report .
This mission is a remake of the original Ted ’s Birthday mission from 2003 .
Back then we had no access to hidden video camera equipment , so we decided not to film the mission .
It just would n’t work with an exposed camera .
We figured as soon as “ Ted ” saw people filming , the moment would be ruined .
So for the original mission only a handful of photos exist to document it .
Years later when we were working on a television pilot , we had a budget to work with professional equipment and decided to give this idea another shot .
A newly installed two way mirror in a closet door
The morning before the mission , our crew made some serious modifications to the Gaslight Bar in Manhattan .
Another crew member installs mirrors up top
A video monitor is installed for the cameraman who will be hiding up high
The Gaslight bar had a second , private bar attached to it called G2 , and we were able to rent it out and set up our production there .
Explaining the mission to the agents
The mission plan was the same as the original Ted ’s Birthday .
I had emailed all of the agents a back story for a fictional guy named “ Ted ” that included basic information about where he worked , where he went to college , and what his hobbies were .
The agents were instructed to make their own personal choices about how they knew him .
Some chose to be his work friends , some chose to be his family members , and Agent Reeves chose to be his ex-girlfriend .
The mission begins , as Agent Carbone watches the monitors
Agent Rodgers and I chose to play the role of “ Ted ’s college buddies , ” and we had the task of starting the mission .
As the cast and crew looked on from the video monitors at G2 , we entered Gaslight and approached a random stranger who was sitting with a friend at the bar .
Agent Rodgers and I greeted “ Ted ” and apologized for being a little early to his party .
His friend informed us that we had the wrong guy , that “ Ted ” was actually Chris ( coincidentally the same name as the guy we picked from the first Ted ’s Birthday . )
We just laughed it off and acted like the friend was the one who was misinformed and left them to go get a drink .
Agent Barrison gives
Ted a gift
Other agents started entering the bar pretty quickly .
The first bunch to arrive were Ted ’s work friends , with Agent Fountain playing his boss .
Everyone had a card and a present for him .
Most folks gave him gift cards , but a few had more personalized gifts .
Agent Sklaren gave a gag gift , a DVD of Basic Instinct
Ted gave her a hug anyway
Though certainly confused as to what was going on , Ted very quickly decided to play along and have fun .
Why not ?
He was getting a new present every few minutes and Agent Good started a tab for him .
Agent Fairey poses with Ted
More and more party - goers started asking Ted about his ex-girlfriend Lauren , and if he knew if she was going to make it .
Everyone was shocked to see her name on the “ e- vite ” since he had recently broken up with her .
Agent Reeves and Ted
Lauren , played by Agent Reeves , finally arrived and Ted was very friendly to his ex .
She gave him a hat for his birthday and they chatted politely .
Agent Kaz and Ted
Agents Rose and Keech brought their 10 - month old son to the party .
They were excited for their friend Ted to get to hold him for the first time .
Kaz was a little scared of Ted at first .
Agent Lindquist presents
Ted ’s cake
A birthday toast for Ted
Agent Wimpy enjoys some cake
Agent Wimpy played Ted ’s grandfather .
He bought Ted an iPod Shuffle for his birthday .
Agents Purnell and Arnheiter say goodbye
After about an hour , agents started leaving the party one by one , saying goodbye to Ted on the way out .
Agent Nicholson snapped one last photo of Ted and Lauren before he left as well
Lauren was the last to leave the party , giving her some alone time with Ted .
Ted played along hilariously and the two ended up having a very tender scene together , even though they had obviously never met .
She then told him goodbye and left Ted alone to discuss what the hell had just happened with his ( real ) friend .
Over a year later I ended up running into Ted ( real name Chris Conway ) at the Upright Citizens Brigade
Theatre in the middle of the night during an improv marathon .
As it turns out , he ’s a comedian himself .
Small world .
Since this mission was for a TV pilot , we ended up doing it two more times on the same night .
( When you ’ve spent money on all that equipment , you have to make sure you get the footage you need ! )
The second two were both successful , but the footage was n’t quite as good as the first try .
Ted #
2
We staged the mission for the second guy about an hour later ( long after the first Ted had left the bar . )
The guy we picked had lots of fun , but we probably should n’t have picked someone 10 to 15 years older than most of us .
It made it a little too unbelievable .
Ted #
3
The third Ted was a guy named Mandar , who as it turned out was a regular at the Gaslight bar .
His party went incredibly well .
In fact , it went so well that the video footage seemed fake .
He was just too excited and agreeable about the whole thing .
Mandar was known around the bar as someone who often broke out into a dance ( even though the bar was definitely not a dance club . )
Midway through his birthday party he did just that .
Our agents joined him and the bar was temporarily converted into a dance party .
It was ridiculous .
It was a new experience for us doing the same mission three times in a row .
We were exhausted by the end , but it was a ton of fun .
Mission Accomplished
It was exciting to get another chance to do this mission , as the first one from 2003 was covered by This American Life in a very negative way .
While that mission itself was a total blast , and it seemed like the “ Ted ” that we picked had a great time ( hugging us goodbye and thanking us at the end of the party ) , he told This American Life a year later that the experience had upset him greatly .
In the end , I think we just got unlucky and picked the wrong person .
This American Life did not give me an opportunity to respond to the news that “ Ted ” did not enjoy the experience and instead edited in an earlier interview with me that made it seem like I was heartless and unapologetic .
For the record , of course I was upset to learn that he had a negative reaction to the mission .
You can read a little more about my thoughts on the TAL coverage on a Reddit Q&A I did here and here .
Admittedly , this mission was a little bit different than the first Ted ’s Birthday , so it ’s not entirely fair to compare them .
Since this was for television , we had to get all three Teds to sign a release form when it was over , which let them in on the joke .
I really did n’t like having to break character for an IE mission , but the fact is you need someone ’s permission to put them on primetime television .
So the Teds from this mission did n’t have quite the same experience as the original Ted , who was never told exactly who we were .

Even with modern Linux distributions , the inconsistency with onboard audio devices makes using headphones and microphones a hit - or - miss venture .
When things work , they work great , but when things do n’t work , it ’s generally tough to get them going .
Thankfully , there is an audio standard that seems to work pretty consistently across operating systems : USB .
Although the thought of purchasing additional hardware to get sound into or out of your Linux machine might seem a bit frustrating , USB audio devices tend to have better sound quality than the cheap onboard audio devices that come with most laptops and desktops .
Now , because I ’ve given you this tip , you ’ll probably never need to use it .
Still , it ’s good to know USB audio is very supported under Linux , and the devices are fairly standard .
Plus , it ’s easy to add multiple audio devices with USB audio , which makes things like podcasting much easier !
U.S. Rep. Ron Paul , R- Surfside , and his acolyte , erstwhile Republican gubernatorial candidate Debra Medina , are the best - known Texas politicians with libertarian leanings , but their notoriety has been a mixed blessing for the Libertarian Party , says Guy McLendon , Harris County Libertarian Party chair .
“ Her campaign and Dr. Paul 's campaign brought a lot of public awareness to the libertarian — small ‘ l ' libertarian — message , but the Texas Election Code puts constraints on what people could do , ” McLendon said .
Libertarian Party candidates are selected by convention , not in a primary election .
Local candidates were chosen at county conventions last Saturday , while the party 's gubernatorial candidate will be nominated at the state convention in Austin on June 12 .
By state law , only voters who have not voted in the March 2010 Republican and Democratic primaries are permitted to vote in the Libertarian conventions .
“ It sort of makes it difficult to get people to affiliate with us , ” McLendon said .
Helped by Tea Party
For Patrick Dixon , an engineering consultant in Travis County and the state chair of the Libertarian Party , the Tea Party movement , which has a libertarian flavor to it , represents a glass - half - full scenario .
“ It 's been beneficial , because we started it , ” he said .
“ By many measures , it 's the most successful thing we 've ever done .
The real truth will come in November .
If people vote their conscience , we should benefit . ”
Paul , a libertarian Republican , sometimes is credited with launching the Tea Party movement in 2007 when he raised $ 6 million in a one - day , Web - based fund - raising effort on the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party .
Dixon noted that the Libertarian Party has been growing ever since and that its statewide budget has tripled during the past year .
It 's now up to $ 370,000 .
It 's growing in Harris County , as well , although not as fast as in Travis County and the Dallas - Fort Worth area .
About 20 Harris County Libertarians met last Saturday at the Looscan Public Library in River Oaks to nominate 14 candidates for the November general election , including three candidates for Congress , one for the state Senate , nine for the state legislature and one justice of the peace .
In addition , local attorney Katherine Youngblood Glass is one of four Libertarian candidates running for governor , and David Smith is challenging U.S. Rep .
Ted Poe , R- Houston , for the 2nd Congressional District seat .
Smith , who opposes health care reform and cap - and - trade legislation and who believes in a smaller federal government , “ is a total animal , ” McLendon said .
“ He 's knocked on tens of thousands of doors . ”
The actual number is 55,000 , said Smith , a 48 - year - old computer programmer who got laid off in December .
“ I 'm getting a very good reception , ” he said .
“ I 've been chased out of three or four homes so far , but the other 54,996 have been receptive . ”
Smith and his fellow Libertarians hold their Houston - area district convention today , also at the Looscan Library .
Handicapped by label
Although no Libertarian currently holds office in Harris County , the party is beginning to focus on nonpartisan offices , McLendon said , mainly because the Libertarian label has been a handicap for candidates .
“ The demographics in Harris County are not as libertarian - leaning as they are around , say , Travis County , ” he said .
Libertarian officeholders across Texas include party chairman Dixon , a city council member in Lago Vista , as well as city council members in Anna , Springtown , Quintana and Jarrell ; a member of the San Antonio River Authority ; the presiding judge of the Brownsville Municipal Court ; and the chairman of the Carrollton Board of Adjustment .
Although Medina and Paul are libertarian Republicans , McLendon emphasized that Libertarians traditionally have no truck with either party .
“ We 're neither far right nor far left ” he said .
“ We basically align ourselves with Ben Franklin , who believed that government should neither spend all your money nor tell you how to live your life . ”

Everything changed when the lights came on .
The woman , who had earlier consumed several glasses of wine , was sleeping in her lover ’s darkened bedroom when a man joined her .
The two had sex , but something felt off to her .
His body did n’t feel right .
She flicked on the bedroom light and realized the man was n’t her lover but his identical twin .
“ Oh my God . Oh my God .
Oh my God , ” she said , grabbing her clothes .
“ I thought you were your brother , ” the man remembered her saying before she ran out of the apartment .
The man , who was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to six months in jail for the September 2006 incident , is now requesting a new trial before the Ontario Court of Appeal at Osgoode Hall in Toronto .
The man and woman ’s name , as well as various details , ca n’t be reported under a publication ban .
The unusual case hinges on consent :
Did the woman agree to have sex or was she duped into intercourse ?
The woman was visiting the brother of the accused at his apartment in a small town in southwestern Ontario .
The two were friends , and whenever she visited the area , she stayed at his flat and they had sex .
On the September evening , the brother was having a party .
After some mingling , the woman and the accused drove to a liquor store where they each bought a bottle of red wine .
At the apartment , they became intoxicated and the woman became flirty , the man testified at his 2008 trial .
She sat on his lap and , at one point , pecked him on cheek , he said .
The woman testified that she felt uncomfortable around the twin .
Around 11 p.m. , the woman felt tired and drifted to the brother ’s bedroom as the party moved to a local bar .
When they returned home 3 1/2 hours later , the accused felt sleepy .
He lay down on the couch , but the other partiers kept him awake .
His brother recommended he sleep in the bedroom .
He saw the woman sleeping in bed , wearing just a t - shirt and underwear .
He did n’t think it would be awkward if they shared the bed , he told the court in 2008 .
“ I thought we were all pretty good friends , ” he testified .
After five minutes , he said the woman started running her hand down his shoulder and neck .
Soon , the touching turned heavy and he was taking off his pants .
However , the woman , who was 48 at time of the trial , said she awoke to who she thought was her lover cuddling .
As the petting progressed , the accused , now 30 , said “ something clicked ” and he decided to make sure she knew who he was .
He moved his face into a shaft of light that came from under the bedroom door , and looked the woman in the face , he said .
His brother was more muscular , and he had had an accident recently and his face was noticeably disfigured .

“ She had an opportunity to view him and he asked , ‘ Are you sure ? ’ ” said the appellant ’s lawyer , Peter Copeland .
“ She , by her conduct not by her words , consented . ”
Copeland told the three - judge appeal panel that the man had honestly believed the woman knew who he was and he did not deceive her into having sex .
However , Crown attorney Kim Crosbie said the woman had all reasons to think it was her occasional lover in bed .
It was his apartment , and they had slept together in that room many times .
The woman testified that she repeatedly called him by his brother ’s name before they had sex .
“ His question to the complainant — ‘ Are you sure ? ’ — was simply not enough , ” Crosbie said .
“ Nothing short of an acknowledgement of who he was would be sufficient . ”
The judges will announce their decision at a later date .
Lets Link to the SharePoint List / Table
In all my time using Access , there is one thing that has always been valuable and that is linked tables .
Now you will be pleased to know that linked tables with read / write access to SharePoint lists are fully featured in Access 2007 .
This means that you can integrate your online SharePoint Lists into your own Access database forms , queries and reports .
So let ’s find out how to link to the Issue Tracking List we just setup in SharePoint .
Firstly , you need to choose the SharePoint List button on the External Data tab in the Ribbon as shown in Figure 5 .
This brings up a list of all of the SharePoint sites that you have been connected to in the past .
If the project is n't in the list , copy and paste the HyperlinkAddress in your browser Address bar for the SharePoint project that your List is stored in .
Figure 6 shows you a list of all of the Lists in the SharePoint project that you can link to .
At the end of the Linking Wizard , which will involve username and password and site location questions when you first run it , you will end up with a linked table as shown in Figure 7 .
This process , from start to finish , should take a few minutes once you understand where things are entered .
A different way of working , that you may find really handy with SharePoint , is exporting a table * that you would normally store in your database into a SharePoint project List .
You will find that as SharePoint grows to be more popular , this approach will become popular too because you can solicit data entry / management from anyone who has a browser and uses the SharePoint site .
This audience can be much bigger than the Access audience .
NOTE : It is my view that anyone running a large Access database will not want to put all of the database into SharePoint .
Rather I believe it will be far more prudent to put just a few tables into the SharePoint site .
To export a table to SharePoint , choose the External Data tab in the Ribbon and select the table that you want to export .
Now identify the SharePoint project that you want to export into and the table will be created in SharePoint .
Once you have checked that the table is OK in SharePoint , delete ** the table in Access and relink to SharePoint as per the previous instructions .
You can see a table that I have exported from Access in Figure 8 .

The first way that an Access specialist can work with SharePoint is to value add the many templates that come built into SharePoint .
If you look at Figure 1 , you will see some of the many templates that can be used .
Now to illustrate what happens when you select a template , let ’s choose the Issue Tracking template .
This creates a SharePoint list .
In Figure 2 , you can see that I have added the first record using a web browser a few minutes after creating the template .
To add a record , choose the New button ( shown in a green circle in Figure 2 ) and you will be presented with what looks like a standard Access form ( Figure 3 ) .
You also have the option , on computers running newer browsers , to enter the data using a DataSheet form ( Figure 4 ) .
It is important to note that both Figure 3 and Figure 4 are SharePoint forms that work straight out of the box .
It is also good to know that under the hood of the forms and lists are many properties that can be modified to come up with a better custom solution .
Access developers will feel right at home when they dig into the properties .
Washington ( CNN ) --
All U.S. military health facilities around the world will now carry the emergency contraception pill known as Plan B One - Step , according to a new Department of Defense policy .
The decision to carry the pill , often referred to as the morning - after pill , was based on a recommendation by the Pentagon 's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee , an advisory panel made up of medical professionals from the military services , Pentagon officials said Friday .
Many military hospitals already carry the pill , but the new action means it will become a standard part of every medical facility 's stock of drugs , including those on bases in Iraq and Afghanistan , the officials said .
The panel 's recommendation was approved by the Pentagon 's acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs , Allen Middleton , on Wednesday , the officials said .
The decision to make levonorgestrel , the generic name for Plan B One - Step , available to all Department of Defense health installations was based on a desire for uniformity , according to Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan .
In response to reporter queries , Lapan said the decision was not prompted by any direction from the administration or the secretary of defense .
The committee sees this as a clinical decision , and this drug is available at virtually all the hospitals and pharmacies already , he said .
According to the minutes of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee meeting in November , in which the panel members reviewed the request to approve Plan B One - Step , the committee had received a request to reconsider the addition of levonorgestrel -- renewing a request from May 2006 to add it as a core drug in Defense Department health facilities .
It was not clear where the request came from , Lapan said .
A similar recommendation was made by the panel in 2002 but the military did not create a policy at the time , according to the Washington Post .
The decision comes just two months after a commander in Iraq attempted to enforce a clause in his code of conduct that would have made getting pregnant while deployed there -- or being responsible for getting a servicewoman pregnant -- a punishable offense .
Currently policy is that any woman who learns she is pregnant while in the war zone is immediately removed and sent back to the United States .
The commander argued that when a woman gets pregnant and has to leave , she places a burden on the rest of the troops .
After much controversy regarding the policy , the rule was rescinded .
The pill has been controversial in the United States .
Critics consider its availability a promotion of sex without consequences .
Defense Department medical facilities are required to carry hundreds of drugs , known as " core formularies . "
Hospital commanders have the discretion to carry other drugs as needed but must carry all core formularies , according to Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman .
Levonorgestrel will be considered a core formulary and will be carried in all the department 's health facilities .
Levonorgestrel does not allow a fertilized egg to embed into the uterus and start a pregnancy .
It is available without prescription in the United States .
The Department of Defense also carries other contraception options such as condoms and birth control pills .
I wonder if they 'll listen to him .
House Minority Leader John Boehner told his conference to " behave like grown - ups " if the healthcare bill is passed by the House on Sunday .
The Ohio Republican made the warning at a quick closed - door meeting with fellow House GOP lawmakers at noon in the Capitol .
I wonder what these dogs eat that makes them so fat ?
How much do they eat a day ?
Why do their owners feed them so much ?
My dad taught me that when dogs are this fat , it is bad for their heart , their bones & joints and they can not be as active .

Normally only humans do this but this dog is watching his weight . 🙂
Boxer is a great name for this dog because most heavy - weight boxers are also kind of fat .

This bulldog looks sort of mean … it could use about 50 % of it ’s weight !
This Dalmatian looks kind of fake because the head does n’t fit well with the body .
But if it is real it needs to lose a ton of weight .

It ’s cool that this person took a before and after picture to show how different a dog can look when it gets so fat .
I like the before dog better .
This dog is cute but it needs to lose some weight !
This pooch should be really lucky to go into a restaurant .

Private sector continues to shed jobs
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Private - sector employers continued to cut jobs in March , highlighting the challenges still facing the nation 's job market , according to a report released Wednesday .
Automatic Data Processing , which processes paychecks for one in every six U.S. employees , said private - sector employers cut payrolls by 23,000 jobs in March , marking the smallest monthly decline since February 2008 .
The decline surprised many economists .
A consensus of economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast a gain of 40,000 jobs in the month .
The number of job cuts in February was revised to a loss of 24,000 jobs from the previously reported 20,000 .
" American businesses are on the cusp of recovery , yet this report shows that they remain hesitant to increase their payrolls , " Gary Butler , chief executive of ADP , said in a statement .
The service sector reported an increase of 28,000 jobs in March , marking the second consecutive monthly increase and the highest job growth since March of 2008 .
However , that growth was offset by a loss of 51,000 jobs in the goods - producing sector and a drop of 9,000 manufacturing jobs .
Large businesses , those with 500 or more workers , saw employment decline by 7,000 jobs , while small - size businesses with fewer than 50 workers had a drop of 12,000 workers .
Employment among medium - size businesses , defined as those with between 50 and 499 workers , declined by 4,000 .
Many economists view the ADP report as a proxy for the government 's monthly jobs report , which comes out Friday .
That report is expected to show a gain of 190,000 jobs in March , compared to a loss of 36,000 jobs in February .
The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 9.7 % .
Some economists may revise their estimates in light of Wednesday 's report .
However , the ADP report was not impacted in February by the effects of severe winter weather , while the government report was , according to Joel Prakken , chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers .
That means Wednesday 's report does not incorporate a weather - related rebound that could show up in Friday 's Bureau of Labor Statistics report , Prakken said .
At the same time , the ADP report does not include any federal hiring in March for the 2010 Census , which some economists believe could add over 1 million temporary jobs to the economy .
" For both these reasons , it is reasonable to expect that Friday 's employment figure from the BLS will be stronger than today 's estimate , " Prakken said .
Would you click on this Google ad ?
No ?
Sure ?
Because 409 persons did !
How do I know ?
Because I ’ve been running this Google Adwords campaign for 6 months now .
Last fall , my attention got caught by a small book on Google Adwords at our local library .
Turns out it ’s very easy to setup an ad and manage the budget .
You can start with a couple of euros per month .
And that gave me an idea : this can be used with malicious intend .
It ’s a way to get a drive - by download site on the first page of a search result ( FYI , I ’ve reported on other ways to achieve this ) .
So I started an experiment …
I bought the drive - by - download .info domain .
.info domains are notorious for malware hosting .
I setup a web server to display a simple page saying “ Thank you for your visit ! ” and to log each request .
That ’s all .
I want to be absolutely clear about this : no malware or other scripts / code were ever hosted on this server .
No PCs were harmed in this experiment .
I started a Google Adwords campaign with several combinations of the words “ drive by download ” and the aforementioned ad , linking to drive - by - download .
info
I was patient for 6 months
During this period , my ad was displayed 259,723 times and clicked on 409 times .
That ’s a click - through - rate of 0.16 % .
My Google Adwords campaign cost me only € 17 ( $ 23 ) .
That ’s € 0.04 ( $ 0.06 ) per click or per potentially compromised machine .
98 % of the machines ran Windows ( according to the User Agent string ) .
In a previous post on spamdexing , I reported 6,988 click - throughs to malicious websites over a 3 month period .
That ’s 2,329 click - throughs per month , compared to my 68 click - throughs per month .
The Spamdexing “ R ” Us operation was much more successful than my little experiment , but at a greater cost ( they ran a bunch of dedicated web servers ) .
I ’m sure I could get much more traffic with a higher Google Adwords budget and a better designed ad .
This is how my ad looks on a search result page :
I designed my ad to make it suspect , but even then it was accepted by Google without problem and I got no complaints to date .
And many users clicked on it .
Now you may think that they were all stupid Windows users , but there is no way to know what motivated them to click on my ad .
I did not submit them to an IQ - test 😉
Recently there have been several stories in the press pointing out that this technique is used “ in the wild ” .
That ’s why I ’m publishing my results now , but my experiment is still running .
Of course , the nature of the experiment has changed now that I have revealed it , but it could still turn out to be interesting .
You can find a video of Google showing my ad here hosted on YouTube , and you can find a hires version ( XviD ) here .
Not the best quality , but I wanted to show off my new Nokia N800 .
I want to thank all participants of my experiment .

( CNN ) --
The Obama administration has called for a freeze on government programs other than defense and entitlements , but why should the Pentagon be excluded ?
That 's the position of CNN iReporters Egberto Willies and Adriana Maxwell , both of whom see defense spending as a target of opportunity .
Willies argues that the U.S. defense budget is several times bigger than that of China , the world 's most populous nation , and urges that some of that money be turned to " rebuilding America . "
" We 're depleting our wealth to build things that are going to be destroyed , while other countries use their wealth to build infrastructure : to build new rails , to build new ports , " Willies said .
i Report : Military budget is " wasteful "
Maxwell , meanwhile , points specifically to the Navy 's plan to build a new class of aircraft carriers as something that should face the ax .
" Last I checked , the USS Enterprise was sound , and no one would dare take her on in conventional battle , " she said .
i Report : " Just because it's new does n't make it better "
Fact Check :
So you want to cut the Pentagon budget ?
• The United States has the largest military budget in the world .
Though the full extent of Chinese military spending is unclear , the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimated Beijing 's 2008 military budget at $ 84 billion after a decade of rapid growth .
A 2009 Pentagon report put the figure much higher , at a range of $ 105 billion to $ 150 billion , but still a fraction of the $ 708 billion the Obama administration has requested for the Defense Department for 2011 .
• By comparison , the Pentagon spent just over $ 300 billion in the 2001 budget year , which ended shortly after the September 11 attacks .
• Since then , the running tab for the wars launched by the United States has hit $ 944 billion through September , according to the Congressional Research Service .
Nearly three - quarters of that has gone to Iraq , with most of the rest for Afghanistan .
• The Obama administration has projected another $ 139 billion in war spending for the current budget year and has asked Congress for another $ 159 billion in 2011 .
• The base budget for the Defense Department -- everything other than direct war costs -- has nearly doubled since 2001 as well , from $ 297 billion to $ 531 billion in 2010 .
Its personnel costs are budgeted at $ 154 billion in 2011 , and medical costs are projected to be $ 51 billion , up from $ 19 billion in 2001 .
Another $ 145 billion is budgeted for buying weapons and gear for the active - duty and reserve forces , while $ 77 billion is budgeted for research and development .
• Regarding the carriers , the Navy is required by an act of Congress to maintain 11 carriers in its fleet .
Enterprise , the oldest , joined the fleet in 1961 and is scheduled to be retired in 2012 .
The next - youngest carrier , the USS Nimitz , went into service in 1975 .
• Like other recent programs , such as the F - 35 fighter and the San Antonio - class amphibious assault ship , the construction of the new Gerald Ford - class carriers has run into delays and is likely to end up over budget , according to the Congressional Research Service .
The Navy expects to spend about $ 30 billion on three ships , the research service found .
• Defense Secretary Robert Gates has tried to rein in some of the big - ticket contracts , shaking up the management of the F - 35 project and demanding that Congress stop spending money on C - 17 transport planes and an alternate F - 35 engine .
But with jobs at stake , Congress has ignored those requests for years and continued to appropriate funds for the C - 17 and a second F - 35 engine .
Bottom Line :
The defense budget would appear ripe for cuts if only for its sheer size .
But between the extent of U.S. commitments around the globe , including two wars , and the pull of steady jobs in a recession , cutting the Pentagon budget has proved difficult for even experienced Washington hands .

You know a company / country / continent is in trouble when authorities start cracking down on short bets against it .
That 's why it 's so disturbing how much heat European currency and sovereign debt speculators are getting these days .
Even the U.S. has climbed aboard the bandwagon now .
Reports of a U.S. Justice Department investigation into Soros Fund Management , SAC , and Greenlight Capital short positions against the euro broke last week .
Yet now the speculator clamp down is evolving into something completely terrifying .
Apparently , it could now be considered collusion if you simply share economic opinions over dinner :
WSJ :
The Journal article disclosed that the big euro bets were emerging amid gatherings including an " idea dinner " involving a number of hedge funds including SAC , Greenlight and Soros , where a trader argued that the euro is likely to fall to " parity , " or equal to , against the dollar on an exchange basis .
The euro currently trades at $ 1.3609 .
One of the questions investigators are likely to examine is whether such information - sharing constitutes collusion , the people say .
...
At one such gathering , a dinner on Feb. 8 at a Manhattan restaurant , an SAC portfolio manager said he believed the euro could fall to a level equal to that of the dollar and urged other traders to " short , " or bet against , the euro as his firm had , according to people at the dinner .
The size of the bets against the euro is unclear .
In a research note issued to hundreds of hedge - fund clients shortly after the dinner , the research boutique that hosted the event summed up the SAC manager 's argument without mentioning his name .
[ But attributing it to an unnamed third party source , ' a presenter ' , which is standard practice ]
One of the most dangerous misconceptions used to restrict economic freedoms is that opinions have more weight than fundamentals .
Should we arrest people for threatening ' economic stability ' if they argue against a particular stimulus bill or government and then collectively vote against it ?
Because that 's all euro - shorts are doing .
Whoever thinks that euro speculators are pushing the euro to unfairly low levels has an opportunity to vote against them any day of the week in the currency markets .
So let 's not forget that a truly viable currency can carry the weight of open criticism , just like a strong nation or value - system can .
Else traders better brush up on their Orwellian double speak .
Much of the city was shrouded under thick smog
Air pollution levels in Hong Kong have reached a record high , prompting government warnings to people to avoid going out .
The Environmental Protection Department said some Air Pollution Index readings were more than double the level at which people should stay indoors .
Some schools stopped children playing outside to safeguard their health .
The record levels follow severe sandstorms thousands of kilometres to the north around the Chinese capital .
Officials said the sandstorms had exacerbated Hong Kong 's worsening smog problems .
' Big alarm '
A spokeswoman for Hong Kong 's environmental agency said that the API - a ratio based on the concentration of pollutants in the air , including sulphur dioxide and lead - was at " record high levels " .
People with heart or respiratory problems are advised to stay indoors at an API reading of more than 100 ; the public is advised to stay indoors at more than 200 .
On Monday the API was 453 at one recording station with five other stations marking levels of above 400 , the government said .
" As the sandstorm from northern China is moving southward with the northeast monsoon and is now affecting Hong Kong , the Air Pollution Index is expected to reach the ' very high ' or ' severe ' level , " the government said in a statement .
" Hong Kong 's air pollution is bad already , but this shows we 're not dealing very well with the most severe weather situations .
It is a very big alarm , " Edwin Lau , director of Friends of the Earth Hong Kong , told AFP .
The government has warned the public to avoid prolonged exposure to heavy traffic areas and to reduce physical exertion and outdoor activities .
Schools were told to cancel sporting activities ; elderly people have sought emergency help for shortness of breath .
The Clean Air Network recently helped to launch a business lobby to urge more government action against pollution .
The BBC 's correspondent in Hong Kong , Annemarie Evans , says there are are tens of thousands of factories across the border in southern China which adversely affect Hong Kong 's air quality , but that roadside pollution remains a large part of the problem .
Angry U.S. warns there will be a price for Britain to pay after judges reveal MI5 DID collude in abuse of terror suspects
The U.S. has warned its relationship with Britain has been harmed by the court ruling that revealed Guantanamo Bay detainee Binyam Mohamed was tortured at the behest of American authorities .
The White House expressed dismay after the Government lost its bid to suppress the documents which showed MI5 knew about the treatment of Mohamed .
It declared that it was ' deeply disappointed ' by the ruling and warned it would make intelligence sharing with Britain more difficult .
Spokesman Ben LaBolt said : ' We shared this information in confidence and with certain expectations .
As we warned , the court 's judgment will complicate the confidentiality of our intelligence - sharing relationship with the UK , and it will have to factor into our decision - making going forward . '
' Torture files ' : Binyam Mohamed and Foreign Secretary David Miliband
In Washington , a statement by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , Dennis Blair , said the ruling was ' not helpful ' .
It said : ' The protection of confidential information is essential to strong , effective security and intelligence cooperation among allies .
' The decision by a United Kingdom court to release classified information provided by the US is not helpful , and we deeply regret it . '
On a day of high drama yesterday , it emerged the Government had tried to suppress a senior judge 's verdict that Britain colluded in torture .
The Master of the Rolls , Lord Neuberger , effectively accused MI5 of complicity in torture and having a culture of disregarding human rights .
The explosive disclosure was a serious blow to Foreign Secretary David Miliband on a day of high drama .
It began when the Foreign Office was yesterday forced to publish evidence which he had battled to suppress through the courts , showing that MI5 knew the British Guantanamo Bay detainee Binyam Mohamed had been tortured at the behest of the U.S. authorities .
MPs said that the revelations had left a ' stain ' on Britain 's reputation in the world .
The country 's three most senior judges rejected an attempt by Mr Miliband to stop publication of seven paragraphs of intelligence supplied to the British authorities by the CIA .
These detailed evidence of MI5's knowledge that Mohamed had been tortured after he was detained in Pakistan in 2002 .
Foreign Office lawyer Jonathan Sumption QC
T he Appeal Court judges flatly rejected Mr Miliband 's claim that releasing the material - which they said showed Mohamed had suffered ' cruel , inhuman and degrading ' treatment - would damage relations with the U.S .
But within hours of the bombshell verdict being delivered , it emerged that one of the judges , Lord Neuberger , had gone even further in his original draft of the judgment .
After being handed a copy earlier this week , the QC for Mr Miliband , Jonathan Sumption , wrote to the court demanding that the judge 's verdict should not be included as MI5 had not had the opportunity to respond to the allegations .
The paragraph - known as 168 - was duly removed .
But it leaked into the public domain yesterday afternoon when Mr Sumption 's letter to the judges was inadvertently made available to the court .
The letter detailed how Lord Neuberger had made observations about the previous ' form ' of MI5 .
Mr Sumption complained that these remarks would ' receive more public attention than any other parts of the judgment ' .
They included a finding that MI5 did not respect human rights or renounce ' coercive interrogation techniques ' .
The letter also shows that the judge originally ruled MI5 officers had ' deliberately misled ' a Parliamentary inquiry into the torture allegations which have dogged the security services and Government in recent years .
The security services were accused of having a ' culture of suppression ' , Mr Sumption 's letter said .
It was also revealed that the letter had been sent to Lord Neuberger at 6 pm on Monday , two hours after the deadline for submissions and corrections .
Lawyers for the other side did not receive a copy of the letter until 11 am the next morning , preventing them from challenging the proposed changes .
Refusal : Appeal Court judges Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge , right and Master of the Rolls Lord Neuberger , left
Mr Miliband has always insisted the UK does not condone or participate in torture .
This is despite a number of terror suspects , including Mohamed , claiming brutal treatment .
Former shadow home secretary David Davis said of Mr Miliband 's attempts to suppress the judge 's remarks : ' What this shows is that the Foreign Secretary is still trying to perpetrate a cover - up of improper behaviour by Government agencies in collusion with torture .
We need to know how it happened and how far up it went . '
The Foreign Secretary yesterday refused to answer questions about whether more cases of alleged British collusion in torture are being considered .
But government sources said that about 15 cases were under consideration .
One MI5 officer , known only as Witness B , who questioned Mohamed , is under investigation by Scotland Yard over alleged collusion .
Clive Stafford Smith , director of Reprieve , said : ' The paragraphs revealed are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to British complicity in torture - much more is to come .
' The judges have shown that our government 's attempts to hide shameful secrets behind " national security " arguments are misguided and doomed to fail . '
Amid demands for a full public inquiry , legal experts said it was astonishing that the Foreign Office had sought to water down the judge 's ruling .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty , said : ' I have never known the draft judgment process abused in this way .
It shows the kind of contempt for the law this case has always been about . '
Lord Neuberger said he might have been ' over - hasty ' in removing the findings and gave other parties involved in the case - including Mohamed 's lawyers - until tomorrow to argue why paragraph 168 should be reinstated .
Mr Miliband , forced to make a statement in the Commons after the verdict , defended the attempt to have the paragraph removed .
He said : ' What our counsel did was to express real concern that one paragraph set out conclusions that went beyond the evidence concluded and risked causing prejudice to a criminal investigation . '
Mr Miliband said he had spoken with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about the case , which was being ' followed carefully at the highest levels in the U.S. system with a great deal of concern ' .
Whitehall sources insisted it had been right to fight the case , not to cover up the information but to safeguard the principle that intelligence information shared between allied countries must be kept confidential at all costs .
Senior Labour backbencher David Winnick said the suggestion of complicity in torture left a ' stain ' on Britain 's reputation .
' While ministers - perhaps in all sincerity , we do not know - were saying that we do not condone torture in any way , torture was taking place and we as a country closed our eyes to it . '
Even without the revelation that he had tried to suppress part of the verdict , yesterday 's ruling was a hammer blow to Mr Miliband .
The Appeal judges upheld a High Court decision last year that the seven - paragraph summary of information held by the British security services about Mohamed 's treatment should be published .
They said the case raised issues of ' fundamental importance ' of ' democratic accountability and ultimately the rule of law itself ' .
Mr Miliband faces huge questions about whether the security services were happy to benefit from information obtained through torture or - crucially - informed ministers it was happening .
Ministers have refused to publish the rules governing MI5 at the time , or say what their obligations were to ensure suspects were not tortured .
Medieval barbarity of the torture squad
By any measure , the treatment meted out to Binyam Mohamed was medieval in its barbarity .
Shackled in total blackness in the CIA 's ' dark prison ' in Kabul , he was forced to listen to ear - splitting music 24 hours a day for a month .
In Morocco he was hung from walls and ceilings and repeatedly beaten , His penis and chest were sliced with a scalpel and hot , stinging liquid poured into the open wounds .
Binyam Mohamed seen arriving back in Britain in February 2009
' They cut all over my private parts , ' he wrote in his diary .
' One of them said it would be better just to cut it off , as I would only breed terrorists . '
Ethiopian - born Mohamed , now 31 , arrived in London in 1994 as a schoolboy seeking asylum .
He was refused refugee status but granted exceptional leave to remain in 2000 .
He studied electrical and electronic engineering and got a job as a caretaker .
He also converted to Islam and attended a mosque frequented by radical Muslims .
In 2001 he went to Afghanistan .
He said he had experimented with drugs , heroin and crack cocaine , and went there to get away from a ' bad crowd ' , kick the habit and see if the Taliban had produced a good Muslim country .
The U.S. alleged that he received paramilitary training at an Al Qaeda training camp , fought for the Taliban and plotted to detonate a radioactive ' dirty bomb ' in America .
It claimed he was cherry - picked by Al Qaeda because of his UK residency , and received firearms and explosives training alongside British shoe bomber Richard Reid .
Mohamed denies all the allegations and says that he confessed to anything his torturers wanted him to say .
In April 2002 he was arrested at Karachi as he tried to board a London - bound flight .
His photograph had been inserted into another man 's genuine British passport .
During his detention in Pakistan , he said , he was questioned by an MI5 officer who called himself John .
Mohamed said the officer knew he had already been tortured numerous times after his capture .
In July 2002 Mohamed was flown - trussed , gagged , blindfolded and wearing a giant nappy - from Islamabad to Rabat in Morocco .
For the next 18 months he suffered torture including the genital mutilation .
He says it was here that questions from MI5 were channelled by his Moroccan interrogators .
' It was obvious the British were feeding them questions about people in London . '
Mohamed says that under torture he told his interrogators that 9/11 planner Khalid Shaikh Mohammed had given him the false British passport and that he had met Osama Bin Laden 30 times .
' None of it was true . '
In January 2004 Mohamed was ' rendered ' by the CIA to Afghanistan and the infamous ' dark prison ' where he said he came closest to losing his mind . '
He arrived in September at Guantanamo , and the next year was charged with conspiracy to plan terror attacks but all charges were dropped in 2008 .
Mohamed was allowed to fly to Britain last February .
A leading Muslim advocacy group is pushing government officials to call the suicide plane crash in Texas “ an act of terror , ” saying that if a Muslim had been flying the plane there would be no hesitancy to call it terrorism .
On Thursday , Andrew Joseph Stack III flew a small plane into the IRS 's four - story office building in Austin , killing himself and at least one federal employee .
Before the incident , Stack allegedly left a series of messages on a website expressing his disgust with the IRS , saying at one point that “ violence not only is the answer , it is the only answer . ”

“ Whenever an individual or group attacks civilians in order to make a political statement , that is an act of terror , ” said Nihad Awad , the executive director of the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) .
“ Terrorism is terrorism , regardless of the faith , race or ethnicity of the perpetrator or the victims , ” said Awad , adding in a statement that “ if a Muslim had carried out the IRS attack , it would have surely been labeled an act of terrorism .
” In the hours after the crash , Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo told reporters that the incident looked to be “ a criminal act by a lone individual . ”
And while Acevedo refrained from calling it an act of terror , he said the FBI , which is heading the investigation , would make the judgment call on how to categorize the crash .
A spokesman with the FBI ’s San Antonio office on Friday said that the FBI was handling the case “ as a criminal matter of an assault on a federal officer ” and that it was not being considered as an act of terror at this time .
The White House had yet to make a public statement about how it viewed Thursday ’s incident , other than to say that both Presidentand Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano had been notified and had asked to be kept apprised of the situation .
But two lawmakers from the area were quick to call the plane crash , which resulted in two seriously injured people and 13 people with minor injuries , an act of terror .
“ Like the larger - scale tragedy in Oklahoma City , this was a cowardly act of domestic terrorism , ” said Rep. Lloyd Doggett ( D - Texas ) in a statement .
And Rep. Mike McCaul ( R - Texas ) , at a press conference following the crash , told a reporter that “ it sounds like it [ a terrorist attack ] to me . ”
McCaul , who is the ranking Republican on the Homeland Security subcommittee on Intelligence , Information Sharing and Terrorist Assessment , added that he would be pushing the committee to look at how federal buildings can be made safer from plane attacks .
“ This was obviously a deliberate , intentional attack on a federal building , ” said McCaul “ It ’s something that I ’ll be working with the police chief and the FBI to get to the bottom of this and to find out how we can better protect the American people . ”
But some members - like the ranking Republican of the Homeland Security Committee Rep. Peter King ( N.Y. ) - are still on the fence as to whether the attack should be labeled as a terrorist act .
" I am reserving judgment to see whether he had any link whatever to any questionable group or organization , " said King in a statement to The Hill on Friday .

RALEIGH , N.C. ( AP )  A North Carolina school board has voted to scrap a policy of assigning students by socio-economic background in favor of a system of neighborhood schools .
The 5 - to - 4 vote on Tuesday night approved a resolution to begin moving away from busing to achieve diversity .
It was an illustration of the Wake County Public School Board 's makeup .
Board members in favor of the change were swept into office by a group of vocal parents who complained that the current student assignment plan took their children too far from home .
Dozens of parents and students lined up to speak to the board as discussion began late Tuesday afternoon .
The Wake County plan , adopted in 2000 , kept school campuses integrated and quickly became a blueprint for other school systems .
But school systems across the South began to shift away from diversity .

The airline industry is still under pressure , but traffic volumes are surging and are just about to retake pre-recession levels of traffic in both passenger and freight .
IATA :
These are strong gains , but it must be noted that February 2009 marked the bottom of the cycle for passenger traffic during the global economic recession .
Passenger demand must recover by a further 1.4 % to return to pre-crisis levels .
Cargo hit bottom in December 2008 , with little improvement realized by February 2009 .
Cargo traffic , which plunged much further than passenger demand , has a further 3 % to recover in order to return to pre-crisis levels .
“ We are moving in the right direction .
In two to three months , the industry should be back to pre-recession traffic levels .
This is still not a full recovery .
The task ahead is to adjust to two years of lost growth , ” said Giovanni Bisignani , IATA ’s Director General and CEO .
Given that passenger traffic ( RPK below ) grew 7.9 % year over year so far this year , and that freight traffic ( FTK below ) jumped 28 % , the industry should be able to easily retake pre-recession levels of volume .
If you compare the February year over year data , vs. the year to date data , then it appears that the entire world , including North America and Europe , accelerated its traffic growth ( RPK and FTK ) .
A New Zealand Residents rugby league international banned for 10 years for a third anti-doping code breach has said he was unable to stop smoking cannabis despite two previous penalties .
Canterbury Bulls prop Vince Whare , 32 , escaped a potential lifetime ban after testing positive to cannabis after a national provincial premiership match against Taranaki last September .
Whare – a 101 - game veteran who was voted Canterbury 's players ' player of the year – was unavailable for comment last night .
But the Sports Tribunal , which imposed the penalty this week , stated in its decision he had told them he had been " unable to curb an addiction to cannabis despite my trying on many occasions without success " .
He said he was " deeply remorseful " that his rugby league achievements over the past 20 years had been " undermined by my off - field antics over the past five years " .
Whare , a former New Zealand Residents representative , gave evidence he had used cannabis recreationally , not to enhance his performance .
He said he had had " a few puffs " in a social setting about 10 days before he tested positive in Taranaki .
However , the tribunal noted the level of cannabis in his test sample seemed " consistent with a regular user " .
It also noted his assertion of addiction was not supported by any evidence , in fact his evidence was " to the contrary " .
It could not be regarded as demonstrating a " lesser degree of fault " .
The tribunal noted it had warned and fined Whare after he tested positive to cannabis in 2005 .
But he was back before the tribunal in 2006 for a similar offence and was suspended for two years .
That ban ended at the end of 2008 .
Whare helped Canterbury win the national final last year – a few weeks after his positive test in Taranaki .
He played on with a deep gash to a head wound and earned selection in the New Zealand Residents team .
The tribunal remarked Whare had " fine personal qualities " and it was " not surprising that we apprehend his regret and distress at what this means for his family , himself , his teams and his club . "
Bulls coach Brent Stuart said in a testimonial to the tribunal that Whare 's work etiquette on and off the field was " second to none " and he was " one of the first to visit children suffering from cancer in hospital " .
Whare 's Riccarton Knights club also produced a testimonial describing him as " an amiable individual who will do anything for anybody , especially for his peers " .
The club held a " very real concern for him if the suspension has the finality of a life ban " .
There was " strong support for his rehabilitation " .
Club officials said in a submission cannabis use was prevalent in society and sport but was not , in their view , a performance enhancing drug nor was it " risky or dangerous to those playing the game " .
It was harmful to health but so was alcohol and other non-performance enhancing drugs .
They said : " It does seem incongruous to us that somebody using cannabis can , even with a third offence such as Vince has committed , be facing a lifetime ban , putting him on a par with those drug cheats who use drugs that really do have performance enhancing properties . "
But the tribunal noted that at the time of his two earlier breaches Whare was warned " of the likely penalty if he offended again " .
It said it had assessed and taken into account all the circumstances including his " deliberate breaching of the rules despite previous warnings , his personal circumstances , including the effect of suspension and the nature of cannabis and its social use " .
It had decided on a penalty greater than the eight - year minimum but less than the maximum lifetime ban .
Whare told a Christchurch newspaper in September – just after his positive test in Taranaki – that his two - year ban was not harsh .
" No , I 've got two boys and I do n't want them growing up and doing the same things as me , " he said .
" There are rules and regulations and you 've got to abide by them .
I deserved it . "
Whare was the second Canterbury Bulls player in two years suspended by the Sports Tribunal .
Scrumhalf Duane Wineti received a two - year ban in December 2008 for anti-doping violations related to methamphetamine , amphetamine and cannabis .
He tested positive after the national premiership grand final on September 28 , 2008 .

The fight over medical marijuana in the state legislature is ramping up , with Republicans being perceived as the group most resistant to policies that allow the proliferation of dispensaries across the state .
An exception to that rule is the Independence Institute ’s Jessica Peck Corry , who looks at marijuana policy from a decidedly libertarian perspective .
In the Reason .
TV video above , recorded at the Washington Center for Journalism and Politics last November , Corry , wife of attorney / marijuana advocate Rob Corry , states , “ To my fellow Republican moms , I have this to say :
For too long , we have allowed the government to parent our children . ”
She adds that in the face of crumbling public schools and infrastructure , not to mention soldiers dying in Iraq for want of proper armor on their vehicles , “ We need to know that it ’s this failed marijuana prohibition experiment that is taking billions of dollars away from those other far more important priorities . ”

7 Ways to Wow on Your Anniversary
By Captain Pyke | February 21 , 2010 - 12:03 am
Wil Wheaton has been in the news quite a bit lately , from his fantastic " Memories of the Future " to his Star Trek XI voice over work .
Now , young Wesley is returning as an alter ego version of himself ( and Sheldon 's nemesis ) in the CBS hit comedy " The Big Bang Theory " .
According to Wil ; " I 've known this was a possibility for just over a week , ( coincidentally , I found out the day after I did my Big Bang Theory Q&A post ) but did n't get the official offer until this morning .
After my manager called casting back and confirmed , I called Bill to thank him for bringing me back .
He sort of chuckled , and asked me if I wanted to know what their plan for the episode was before I accepted the offer to come back .
I told him ,
You could have me do nothing more than eat Chapstick the entire episode , and I 'd come work for you again , because I had so much fun last time . "
The Big Bang Theory 's Executive Producer and Co Creator Bill Prady was gushing to TV Guide about Wil “ We were very excited when Wil Wheaton appeared as Sheldon ’s nemesis , and right now we ’re looking to see if he can come back to give Sheldon an opportunity to settle the score , ”
It 's a virtual lovefest .
Of course , Wil did rock out with his spock out the last time he played Big Bang .
The episode will tape March 2nd and we 'll keep you informed as to when the episode will air .
( quote sources Wil 's blog and TV Guide )
Oh , Valve : they ’re playing us like a harp this week , and frankly we do n’t mind a jot when it ’s this much fun .
While everyone ’s busy nattering about the Portal 2 ( OR IS IT ? ) ARG , they slip a little something extra into the RPS inbox .
That ’ll be the charmingly retro-sociopathic words and pictures above , then .
Which you ’ll want to click on right away , in order to admire it in its full bigness .
The instant response from all of us , aside from excited and grateful cooing noises , was “ guh ?
But what does it mean ? ”
We ’re not very clever sometimes .
Then we worked out exactly what it means : Steam is , as has been recently rumoured ( and supported by the recent move from hoary old IE to sprightly young , cross- platform webkit as a foundation for Steam ) , finally coming to the Apple Macintosh personal computer system .
At least … so it implies .
OR DOES IT ?
We wo n’t find out for sure until the “ upcoming announcement from Valve ” mentioned in this crypto-mail , but certainly the cheeky image closely apes olden Apple ads in both form and tone .
Compare this pic to something like this , or better yet , one of you industrious web - heroes could go and browse this vast archive of classic Mac ads and no doubt you ’ll find one they ’ve closely cribbed from to make this .
So : the obvious take - home message , given the Mac OS in the photo and the mention of “ different types of computers …
We ’ll figure that out later .
And , years later , they did ” is Steam is coming to Macs .
( Sorry , penguin people – no hint of Linux , unless you want to run with ‘ different types of computers ’ ) .
Hang on : Steam is coming to Macs .
Christ .
Alright , we ’re a PC blog , but whether or not you think OSX falls within our generally Windows - centric remit , that ’s huge .
Enormous .
Surprisingly for such a tightly - controlled platform , gaming on the Mac is still all over the bloody place – many of the biggest games make it over eventually , but often months after the event , while many never arrive at all .
No -one in their right mind buys a Mac for gaming , even though even the lowest - end currently - available desktops and laptops are more than capable of running most modern stuff .
It ’s ripe for a takeover , frankly .
Someone with Valve ’s status and clout coming up with a centralised distribution system for Mac games means they could theoretically corner this spotty market in the blink of a hummingbird ’s eye .
As in , this could be a games - only App Store for OSX .
The crucial question is exactly what they ’ve got up their sleeve , however .
Is it it just their own games ( Source titles have lacked official Mac version ) , is it the same tardy , mixed bag of games already available for OSX , or have they been quietly galvanising developers and publishers to port stuff in a more timely fashion ?
Given Macs ’ growing share of the computer market , it ’s way past time that the games industry took it more seriously , regardless of the fact that the more affordable Macs are n’t graphically toe - to - toe with equivalently - priced PCs .
Or , and I admit this is so unlikely that even writing it makes me sound like an insane fantasist , is Mac Steam going to include a wrapper / virtualisation tech that enables most Windows games to be played on OSX , a la Crossover or Parallels Desktop ?
Doubtful , but God only knows what this actually entails .
Whichever , my immediate concern , because I ’m a selfish little snot , is whether Win-Steam and Mac - Steam accounts will be twinned – I own a Mac as well as PC .
I want access to my stuff on both .
However , this might have nothing to do with OSX , at least not in its standard form .
Take a look at the bottom of this image – notice those dots .
They ’re awfully similar to the dots at the bottom of an iPhone ( and possibly iPad – I really need to take a closer shufti at one of those curious bastards ) , used to navigate between the world - eating portable device ’s screens full of icons .
Is that an implication the neo -Steam is related to the App Store instead ?
Given Apple ’s monstrously tight restrictions , it seems unlikely they ’d hand store rights over to a third party .
Perhaps the dots are simply intended to offset the vintage nature of the pseudo - ad with something more modern .
Or …
… or it ’s nothing whatsoever to do with Steam on Macs after all , and it ’s another bewildering part of the ongoing Portal ARG .
The choice of an ancient Mac OS in this ad seems a little obtuse in a way – it ’s possible they ’re just being playful , or it ’s possible it ’s along the lines of the GLADOS 3.11 mentions in the Portal ASCII art pulled off the Aperture Science BBS .
Those dots might mean this is part one of six , and we ’ll see related images cropping up on other sites , which require bonding together and somehow decoding .
I ’m bracing myself for the possibility I ’m going to look more ridiculous than a businessman on a skateboard once whatever this ad really means is revealed .
Valve are notorious teases , after all .
I wo n’t be at all surprised if I ’ve just been tricked into writing 700 words about something that is n’t happening .
Allow me to leave a prophetic “ you utter bastards ” here , just in case .
We ’ll find out , I do n’t doubt , at GDC , or close to it .
Perhaps it ’s going to be an omni-announcement , Portal 2 and Mac Steam , and an OSX - rejiggered the Source engine collection as the vanguard for it .
Either way , the veins on the internet ’s sweaty forehead are going to be pulsing even more than usual for the next week or so .
A note on the image , by the way .
We were sent a much larger version than the fullish - size one we ’ve got here , but our weeny servers could n’t possibly handle the strain of serving that to a squillion people .
It ’s possible , however , that there ’s some secret information hidden in the big’un .
There ’s nothing hidden in the EXIF data as far as I can tell , but if you see a hint that there might be something of note squirreled away in the original file , drop us a line ( with a brief explanation of what you think it might be ) and we ’ll see if we can share it with you .
Theorists : go theorise .
Update : the sign of six is now explained , at least .
Witness further Macified Valve imagery at Eurogamer , MacRumors , MacNN , ShackNews and MacWorld .
Each carry their own page dot .
So that ’s that for now – and pretty much proof positive that this is indeed Steam for OSX .
Additional update : our own Baron of Bargains LewieP has cunningly drawn up a list of which Steam games already have Mac ports , which potentially gives us a good picture of what iSteam ( ouch , let ’s never call it that again ) may launch with .
Excellent work , sir P .
Additional additional update : Portal just updated itself again , with the update notes listing simply “ added valuable asset retrieval . ”
Mystery hunters , go !

A flat - headed cat caught by a camera trap in Tangkulap Forest Reserve , Sabah , Malaysia in March 2009
One of the smallest and most enigmatic species of cat is now threatened with extinction .
According to a new study , habitat loss and deforestation are endangering the survival of Asia 's flat - headed cat , a diminutive and little studied species .
Over 70 % of the cat 's habitat has been converted to plantations , and just 16 % of its range is now protected .
The cat , which has webbed feet to help hunt crabs and fish , lives among wetland habitats in southeast Asia .
Details on the decline of the cat 's range are published in the journal PLoS ONE .
The flat - headed cat is among the least known of all wild cat species , having never been intensively studied in its natural habitat .
Weighing just 1.5 to 2kg , the cat is thought to be nocturnal , adapted to hunting small prey in shallow water and along muddy shores .
Now restricted to a handful of tropical rainforests within Thailand , Malaysia , Brunei and Indonesia , nothing is known about the size of each cat 's home range or the density of the remaining population .
So in an attempt to estimate how the species is faring , a team of scientists gathered together all known information about where the cat is thought to live , including sightings , pictures taken by camera traps and dead specimens .
The team , led by Mr Andreas Wilting of the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin , Germany gathered 107 records overall , which they then used to create a computer model that predicts the cat 's historical and current distribution .
That confirmed that flat - headed cats like to live near large bodies of water such as rivers and lakes .
They also prefer coastal and lowland areas .
Crucially for the species 's survival though , the researchers found that just 16 % of its historical range is fully protected according to criteria laid down by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature .
Other areas are also protected , but these are large national parks , which in southeast Asia tend to be located at higher elevations where the flat - headed cat is not thought to roam .
Around 70 % of its former range may already have been converted to plantations to grow crops such as palm oil .
Also , two - thirds of all the locations the cat has been recorded in are now surrounded by areas in which high densities of people live .
The cat 's scarcity is underlined by the fact that it has been photographed just 17 times by camera traps .
In comparison , other felids in the region , such as tigers , leopard cats , marbled cats and Asian golden cats are regularly photographed this way .
Perhaps concerned that his repeated suggestions that the Holocaust might not have happened have become less shocking over time , Iran ’s president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , upped the ante on Saturday , telling intelligence officials in Tehran that the destruction of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 , 2001 , was staged .
In remarks reported by IRNA , an official Iranian news agency , and translated by Reuters , Mr. Ahmadinejad said , “ The September 11 incident was a big fabrication as a pretext for the campaign against terrorism and a prelude for staging an invasion against Afghanistan . ”
Mr. Ahmadinejad also reportedly described the attacks in New York as a “ complicated intelligence scenario and act . ”
Conspiracy theorists in the Middle East have suggested that the attacks were not the work of Al Qaeda , but carried out by Israeli or American intelligence operatives .
In a speech during Iran ’s annual anti-Israel day in September , Mr. Ahmadinejad said of the Holocaust , “ The pretext for the creation of the Zionist regime is false . ”
He added : “ It is a lie based on an unprovable and mythical claim . ”
Mr. Ahamdinejad ’s claims come at the end of a week in which Radovan Karadzic , the former leader of Bosnia ’s Serbs , told a war crimes tribunal in the Hague that both the siege of Sarajevo and the massacre at Srebrenica were “ myths , ” and a mentally ill gunman from California , who had written that he was interested in “ establishing the truth of events such as the September 11 demolitions , ” opened fire at the Pentagon .
NASA today said it upgraded the software controlling its Mars Rover Opportunity to let it make its own decisions about what items like rocks and interesting red planet formations to focus its cameras on .
The new system , which NASA uploaded over the past few months , is called Autonomous Exploration for Gathering Increased Science , or AEGIS and it lets Opportunity 's computer examine images that the rover takes with its wide - angle navigation camera after a drive , and recognize rocks that meet specified criteria , such as rounded shape or light color .
It can then center its narrower - angle panoramic camera on the chosen target and take multiple images through color filters , NASA stated .
Hot space projects produce cool cosmic discoveries
AEGIS lets Opportunity look at rocks at stopping points along a single day 's drive or at the end of the day 's drive .
This lets it identify and examine targets of interest that might otherwise be missed , NASA said .
NASA said the first images taken by the Mars rover choosing its own target show a rock about the size of a football , tan in color and layered in texture .
It appears to be one of the rocks tossed outward onto the surface when an impact dug a nearby crater .
Opportunity pointed its panoramic camera at this unnamed rock after analyzing a wider - angle photo taken by the rover 's navigation camera at the end of a drive on March 4 .
Opportunity decided that this particular rock , out of more than 50 in the navigation camera photo , best met the criteria that researchers had set for a target of interest : large and dark , NASA stated .
Without AEGIS , follow - up observations depend on first transmitting the post - drive navigation camera images to Earth for ground operators to check for targets of interest to examine on a later day .
Because of time and data - volume constraints , the rover team may opt to drive the rover again before potential targets are identified or before examining targets that are n't highest priority , NASA stated .
The Opportunity rover is en route toward a large crater known as Endeavour .
NASA scientists expect to look inside a rocky bowl 22 kilometers ( 13.7 miles ) across .
The rover traveled 3.3 miles in 2009 , farther than in any other year on Mars , NASA stated .
Overall Opportunity has driven more than 11 miles and returned more than 133,000 images .
The rover has made numerous discoveries , including the first mineralogical evidence that Mars had liquid water , according to the space agency .
Opportunity most recently finished the driving around the " Concepción " crater .
The Concepción crater is of interest to NASA scientist because it seems to be what they call " geologically very young " with visible rays of ejecta radiating from the center of the crater .
Since landing on the red planet in January 2004 Spirit and Opportunity have explored Mars for five years , far surpassing their original 90 - day mission , NASA said .
Opportunity 's sister rover , Spirit you 'll recall is mired in a sandtrap on the opposite side of the red planet .
After weeks of trying to trying to get its Mars rover Spirit better positioned to handle the Martian winter , NASA said the spacecraft is now beginning full winter operations as best it can .
NASA said Spirit 's winter operations will consists of a single 7 - a single X - band uplink and a single Ultra - High Frequency ( UHF ) downlink .
The activity on each sol consists simply of a brief wakeup , an atmospheric opacity measurement , and then a shutdown for the rest of the day and night .
NASA said Spirit will eventually enter a low - power hibernation mode , shutting down almost all functions except keeping a master clock running and checking its power status periodically until it has enough power to reawaken .
It may go in and out of this mode a few times at the beginning and at the end of an extended hibernation period .
NASA recently said it would begin soliciting public photo shoot suggestions for the cutting edge camera onboard its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter satellite .
And it 's no ordinary camera .
NASA said the orbiter 's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera , or HiRISE , is the most powerful camera ever to orbit another planet .
It has taken thousands of black - and - white images , and hundreds of color images , since it began science operations in 2006 .
A single HiRISE image will often be a multigigabyte image that measures 20,000 pixels by 50,000 pixels , which includes a 4,000 - by - 50,000 pixel region in three colors .
It can take a computer up to three hours to process such an image .
Despite the thousands of pictures already taken , less than 1 % of the Martian surface has been imaged , NASA said .

SuperFreakonomics Book Club : Goldin and Katz on the Male - Female Wage Gap
In the SuperFreakonomics Virtual Book Club , we invite readers to ask questions of some of the researchers and other characters in our new book .
Last week we opened up the questioning for Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz , labor economists and experts on the male - female wage gap .
Their response is below .
Big thanks to them and to all of you for participating .
Many thanks for your insightful comments and questions .
If you are interested in more detail about gender differences in the labor market for MBAs you can read our paper ( with Marianne Bertrand ) entitled “ Dynamics of the Gender Gap for Young Professionals in the Corporate and Financial Sectors . ”
Gender differences in the labor market for a range of professions are examined in “ Transitions : Career and Family Life Cycles of the Educational Elite . ”
Q .
If you consider only women / men that have roughly equal work experience , education level , hours worked , GPA , marital status , and number of children , is there still a wage gap ? —
Andy
When you compare “ apples to apples ” ( i.e. , a childless , college - educated 29 - year - old female in an urban area to childless , college - educated 29 - year - old man in an urban area ) , what ’s the real wage discrepancy ?
— Lisa
A .
These questions are at the core of our analysis .
We actually do compare “ apples to apples . ”
Here ’s how :
To determine whether there is “ wage discrimination , ” we statistically construct individuals who are observationally identical , and then measure whether their earnings differ by sex .
Many data sets do not allow comparisons of approximately the same apples ( Macs to Macs , for example ) .
Some have such limited detail that the comparison is essentially “ apples to oranges . ”
But our University of Chicago MBA data ( for those graduating from 1990 to 2006 ) is extremely rich , allowing us to control for business school courses , GPA , job experience , demographics , hours , sector , occupational title , and so forth .
For male and female newly - minted MBAs , our comparison of “ apples to apples ” produces just a modest wage gap ( favoring men ) , and these observationally equivalent men and women work approximately the same number of hours per week .
Fast forward 10 to 15 years , and the earnings gap between our male and female MBApples is about 40 % for those who were observationally equivalent at graduation .
But almost all of that huge difference can be fully explained by the greater number of career interruptions and lower weekly hours experienced by the women ( mind you , they still work a large number of hours ) .
One of the reasons for the large gap in earnings between male and female MBAs is that the cost of career interruptions is very great in the corporate and financial sectors .
These costs are considerably lower in medicine , and somewhat lower in law and academia ( a finding from our related work ) .
Q .
Many of us – here ’s the surprise – got our MBAs precisely because we wanted to have children and work , and we knew we would n’t be able to recover from the economic hit nearly as well unless we had an MBA to accelerate us back up the speed ramp when we re-entered the workforce post child - raising !
In fact , one could argue that having an MBA helps on the pregnancy end too , with presumably higher skills and therefore occasionally higher leverage to negotiate a better childcare leave than we might have otherwise .
— Lisa
A .
The vast majority of MBA moms are just like Lisa – in the workforce , occasionally part - time , often self - employed , working for firms with generous family policies and making a lot of dough .
They may not be making as much as their male peers who are working full - time , but they are , just as Lisa notes , doing very well in securing their futures and keeping a toe - hold in the business .
In our sample , the fraction of MBA moms 10 to 16 years out who were working part - time was equivalent to the fraction who were no longer in the labor force .
And about half of the part - timers were self - employed .
Because we track our MBAs for at most 16 years , and because women are having kids much later in their lives , we do not know what happens to them over the long term , and whether those who leave the labor force will eventually return to the firm they left , other firms , new careers or self employment .
Q .
Are women being paid less because they take time off for kids , or are they being paid less because employers expect them to take time off for kids ?
If an employer puts you on the “ mommy track ” simply for being female , and pays you less or does n’t promote you as often , perhaps when you do have a child , the fact that you ’re already being paid less gives you less incentive to return to work .
— sasha
Is there a pay gap before time is taken off ?
How much of that is due to the possibility of future time not worked ?
— Dan Rosenberry
A .
As we just noted , at the start of their careers male and female MBAs in our sample earn approximately the same income , and almost all work long hours .
We do not find evidence that women are placed on a “ mommy track ” from the start , or that there is a major pay gap before job interruptions for whatever reason .
MBA women do very well in their jobs before they have children .
Even after their first birth , they tend to return to work soon and work fairly long hours .
But after a year or so the average MBA mom will shorten her hours of work ( they are still long compared with most non-MBAs ) , and some will leave the workforce , possibly for a while .
We also find that those who leave the workforce are disproportionately those with very high - earning husbands .
Women with husbands earning below the median husband ’s income in the sample exhibited no decrease in their employment .
It is only those with the higher - earning husbands that do .
Q .
Having worked in many of the top banks those who are in charge are the ones who can shout louder and intimidate others , and decision making ability and skill may not be the criteria for advancement .
— Harold Cline
Has anyone done a study on how women fare negotiating a salary ?
I also wonder if women have more difficulty negotiating a salary , because asking for a lot of money might seem aggressive or self - aggrandizing , or because an interviewer ( male or female ) might not believe that a woman is worth as much as a man . — vj
I had heard that when applying for jobs , men on average were much more likely to apply for a position that they did not meet 100 % of the qualifications for , where as women tend to want to meet all stated criteria .
I would assume this would also indicate women are less likely to sell themselves in interviews , salary negotiation ( or may even make them less likely to think to negotiate salary ) , or performance reviews .
Have you included this in your research ? — ktb
A .
Our work only indirectly confronts the important issues of competition and bargaining .
Important scholarship by others addresses these questions directly .
A great book on the topic of women ’s bargaining power on the job is Women Do n’t Ask ( Princeton 2003 ) by Linda Babcock and Sarah Laschever .
They find that new MBAs who negotiate rather than accept their offered salary raise their pay by around 7 % , and that MBA men negotiate eight times as often as MBA women .
Where does that show up in our work ?
We do find that even women without children and with no career interruptions earn about 12 % less than the observationally equivalent men ( the “ apples to apples ” comparison ) both at the beginning of their careers and 10 to 16 years after obtaining their MBA .
There is also excellent research on the subject of competitiveness among men and women by Muriel Niederle , and various co-authors , using laboratory experiments .
They find that women shy away from competitive situations , losing income in the process , whereas men over - compete , also losing some income by being overconfident .
Q .
Are there fields or areas you would recommend your daughters pursue ?
Avoid ? — Hillary
A .
First of all , your daughters ( and sons ) should follow their passions wherever that might take them ( law , medicine , art , poetry , lion taming ) .
But they should also be cognizant of the potential costs in each field from taking time off and reducing hours .
Each occupation has its own culture , and some are highly tolerant of individual needs and some are less tolerant .
It should also be recognized that these tradeoffs have changed enormously over time , and that it is difficult to predict what the future will hold .
Who would have guessed in 1970 that various MD specialties today would have a large fraction of part - time physicians ?
More than 35 % of all female pediatricians work part - time today , for example .
As women become a critical mass in various professions , more pressure will be placed on institutions to change their rules .
In some occupations , however , the rules wo n’t budge much .
A trial lawyer who is present at each deposition , hearing , and trial day is far more valuable to the client than one who shares the case with a partner .
But an obstetrician does not have to be present at every birth for each female client in his or her group practice .
Another in the group will be an ( almost ) perfect substitute .
Q .
What careers have the most equal pay for women , and which ones have the widest gaps in pay ?
— Mario
A .
Do n’t be misled by gender equality in pay .
Women should not necessarily want to choose the occupation for which the gender gap is the lowest .
In fact , the most equal occupations by pay are those in which there is low pay and little advancement .
Q .
So you ’re saying that men do n’t love kids ?
From the article – “ The big issue seems to be that many women , even those with MBAs , love kids . ” — Kathleen
A .
We never said that men do n’t love their kids ( or other people ’s kids ) .
In fact , we never said that MBA moms love their kids .
But we are fairly certain that they do .
( Beware literary license taken by Freakonomists . )
Q .
Perhaps one of the reasons more women take time off work for kids more often than men is because they ’re already making less in their job .
The lower pay might be the cause instead of the effect .
— KarenS
A .
For many women ( and men ) a lull in one ’s career is a good moment to take time off for additional training or to raise a family .
Since women often make less than men , are kids the cause of their lower earnings or the result ?
Our study is limited to MBA women and men .
The MBA women who had kids after receiving their MBA were not earning less than other women before they had their kids .
And these MBA women at the start of their careers were not doing that much differently than were MBA men .
We noted before that MBA women who never had kids and had no job interruptions made 12 % less than observationally equivalent men .
That difference , moreover , was mainly because they were employed by smaller firms , and disproportionately in the non-profit sector .
Even though we find little evidence to support the notion that lower earnings of MBA women cause them to have kids , the point is critical to understanding the division of labor in the household more generally .
Busybox for ARM on QEMU
Busybox is a solution for embedded Linux designs that need a compact filesystem : the trick is compiling and linking many system utilities into a single binary that behaves differently based on the name it was used to execute it .
A working Linux root filesystem then consists in a small directory tree ( / bin , / sbin , /usr / bin , … ) , a single executable binary in / bin / busybox , and many symbolic links to the Busybox binary ( / bin/ls , / bin/sh , / sbin / ifconfig , … ) , and using a typical configuration it can be as small as 2MB ( 1MB if compressed ) .
Last time I compiled a Linux kernel and a minimal root filesystem containing just a “ Hello World ” program .
Now we can build a reasonably working root filesystem and test it using QEMU .
Note that , in order to follow this example , you need :
The CodeSourcery Linux toolchain
A Linux kernel image compiled for the Versatile platform , with EABI support ( here is how I created mine )
QEMU ARM emulator ( the package to install is qemu on Debian or qemu- kvm - extras on Ubuntu )
on Debian or on Ubuntu ) Developer ’s libraries for ncurses ( the package to install is libncurses5 - dev ) to compile the menu configuration
I downloaded version 1.16.0 of the Busybox source and extracted it .
Inside the extracted directory I ran :
$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- defconfig
A default configuration file is created .
To change it to our needs :
$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- menuconfig
I checked the option to compile Busybox as a static executable , so that we do n’t have to copy the dynamic libraries inside the root filesystem .
The setting can be found in “ Busybox Settings --> Build Options “ .
Then , the following command builds Busybox and creates a directory called _install containing the root filesystem tree :
$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- install
We can now create a root filesystem image using the cpio tool , and in order to compact the filesystem even more , we can run gzip on it to create a compressed image :
$ cd _install $ find .
| cpio -o -- format=newc > ../ rootfs.img $ cd .. $ gzip -c rootfs.img > rootfs.img.gz
In my case , the compressed image size is about 1MB .
To test Busybox , we can emulate an ARM platform with QEMU using the following command , assuming we copy the Linux kernel zImage in the current directory :
$ qemu-system - arm - M versatilepb -m 128M - kernel zImage - initrd rootfs.img.gz - append " root=/dev/ram rdinit=/bin/sh "
The Linux kernel will boot , and the shell / bin / sh will be executed as specified by the boot parameter rdinit , showing the common “ # ” prompt .
The shell can be used normally , for example you can run ls to find the same directory structure of the Busybox _install directory , but using commands like ps and mount we can see that not everything is in place : both programs complain abount the / proc directory .
We can create and populate the / proc directory running these commands inside the QEMU emulated system prompt :
# mkdir / proc # mount -t proc none / proc
After that , the ps and mount programs work fine .
We can also note that the / dev directory is almost empty ( the only exception being the console device ) .
To populate it we need to mount also the /sys directory , so that we can use the mdev tool ; run inside QEMU :
# mkdir /sys # mount -t sysfs none /sys # mdev -s
The /sys and / dev directory are now populated .
To execute these steps every time , we can use / sbin / init functionality : this program is usually the first run by the Linux kernel , and its default behavior is to execute the initialization file with path /etc / init.d/rcS .
In the host computer this time , in the folder where we compiled Busybox , we create the missing directories :
$ cd _install $ mkdir proc sys dev etc etc / init.d $ cd ..
Now we create a new _install / etc/ init.d/rcS with the following content :
#!/bin/sh mount -t proc none / proc mount -t sysfs none /sys / sbin/ mdev -s
Then set it as an executable file :
$ chmod +x _install/etc/init.d/rcS
We can then recreate an updated root filesystem compressed image as before , and run :
$ qemu-system - arm - M versatilepb -m 128M - kernel zImage - initrd rootfs.img.gz - append " root=/dev/ram rdinit=/sbin/init "
The Linux kernel will boot again , but this time it is asking to press Enter , and when we do the usual console prompt will appear .
The system directories are fully populated , meaning that the script rcS has been executed ; other than that , / sbin / init also spawns shell terminals using getty .
In our example the Busybox filesystem is accessed using a ram disk , but it can also be read from a physical disk storage or loaded from the network using NFS protocol .
Maybe another time I will describe in details how to run Busybox with NFS inside QEMU .

Aside from a tiny photo of the back of a tiny , naked head , I have n't posted in like four months .
No doubt if you 're reading this blog , you care about .
And if both of those things are true , then you probably have some questions about the upcoming season , and just what the hell we think we 're doing over here at the AstroBase .
Questions such as ... According to some other blogs and apparently the adultswim website , we 're supposed to be premiering in August .
I say this because I have n't been told an official date by anyone yet .
But August sounds about right .
Yes it does , but do n't blame the network .
They could n't get it on much sooner than that if they tried .
Why ?
Becausesuck .
I know ... when we split the season into two halves last year we promised to have the second half on by spring or early summer of this year .
But we got a later start on these episodes than we originally intended .
Suffice to say neither half of Season 4 has been easy to produce ...
In the end , it 'll all be worth it .
We think you 're going to really dig these next eight episodes .
We seem to have re-embraced the show 's sci- fi / comic book / adventure roots , and as much as it was a struggle to write them , they 're a whole lot of fun .
Lots more development of Hank and Dean , lots of new characters , and lots of old faces returning both triumphantly and trivially .
Back in November , I wrote that we were working on our script for the season finale .
And that was true ... we ended up turning it in , just before Christmas , several weeks late .
But over the break , Doc and I took another look at it and we were n't 100 % happy with it .
Despite being a good script ( and well - received by the network ) , we just did n't feel right about ending a 16 episode season with a single half hour episode .
Especially not one that , despite cutting a bunch of stuff we loved , we 'd over - written to the point that it would have to suffer massive cuts in the editing process ... So we called the network and asked them if they 'd give us the time and money to take the script back and turn it into a one - hour special .
And they said yes .
Which brings us to ... After spending January re-writing the finale script -- and February and March designing and storyboarding it -- we are currently editing the animatic for what will be aWhich is another reason why we wo n't be premiering until August .
And why the finale probably wo n't air until December .
But hey -- that 's an extra half an hour of Venture -y goodness for your patience , right ?
What we take away with one hand , we give back with the other ...
Meanwhile , we 've received rough cuts of the first three episodes of Season 4.5 from our overseas studio so far .
The screen - grabbed evidence of which is strewn about this entry .
We get a new one every two weeks and then spend about 4 - 5 days reviewing every frame for mistakes , during which we yell at our monitors and each other and compile a list of retakes to send back .
So yeah , that 's where we 're at in production right now .
What else ?
It 's probably not news to anyone by now , but we have indeed struck a deal with Bif Bang Pow ! to produce a line ofaction figures ( and bobbleheads ) .
At Toy Fare in February , Bif Bang Pow unveiled several prototypes .
I say again ....
These are not the final figures .
Since those photos were released , we 've been working closely with Jason Lenzi to get the head sculpts , outfits and proportions just right .
We 're even contributing to the packaging ... Some of you -- most likely those of you born after 1978 - - will never be happy with our choice to go with a retro " Mego style " design , but Doc and I think it 's pretty fucking funny .
And what is this whole Venture Bros. business about if not a doomed attempt to re-live our childhoods ?
So there .
Anyway , I 'm told the first wave of figures will hit the streets right around the time of the San Diego Comic Con ... so start saving your pennies now .
And then , in July , go to the bank and get them changed to $ 20 bills ... because we hate pennies , and we will not accept them .
We were originally going to hold off on producing any DVDs of Season 4 until all 16 episodes were complete and we could release one massive boxed set , but given the massive amount of time between seasonal halves , that 's pretty unlikely now .
The current plan is to release a standard def DVD of the first 8 episodes sometime between July and October ( depending on how quickly we get our acts together to record commentary , dig up special features and design the packaging ) , and then release both a standard def DVD of the second 8 episodes and a Blu - Ray of the entire 16 episode season in March .
But that 's all I know right now , so do n't ask me any questions about it .
Convention season is many months away , but people are asking us to commit to appearances at both the San Diego Comic Con and Dragon Con .
And we 've done just that -- committed to appearing at both .
But again , that 's all I know right now , so ...

2011 Lexus CT 200h
Most debuts at auto shows are fairly simple affairs .
A little hip hop , a couple of smoke machines , a stray dancer or two , and voila -- a new ride is launched .
But Lexus is taking a different route for the Lexus CT 200h 's appearance at the 2010 New York Auto Show : to celebrate the hot , hybrid hatch , Lexus is sponsoring a debate .
On global warming .
Hosted by Sarah Silverman .
Lexus has drafted two reasonably well - respected personalities to sit on either side of the podium .
On the left : journalist Amanda Little , who penned the eco-friendly Power Trip .
On the right : Phelim McAleer , global warming denier and director / producer of the film Not Evil , Just Wrong .
And in the middle ( as you probably know ) : comedienne Sarah Silverman , whose most recent outrages include encouraging the pope sell the Vatican so he can upgrade his bachelor pad and end world hunger , adding that ... well , this is a family site , so we wo n't use Silverman 's exact words , but basically , she promised that he'd get laid .
The debate itself is being called " The Dark Side of Green " ( which does n't exactly set the stage for a fair fight , does it ? ) .
David Nordstrom , vice president of marketing for Lexus , issued a statement explaining the automaker 's rationale for hosting the face - off : " Lexus hybrid vehicles have been designed to appeal to both the eco-minded and those unwilling to compromise on luxury and style . "
Someone should point out to Mr. Nordstrom that , as nearly every other high - end automaker has demonstrated , " luxury " and " eco-friendly " are n't opposing positions -- though we 'd probably plotz from surprise if he cared .
Obviously , this is a major publicity stunt , and a pretty good one at that .
No matter who makes the better argument , the real winner will be Lexus -- though honestly , we 'll be watching just to see Silverman out - curse everyone in the room .
Note to commenters : let 's try to restrict any debate to Lexus and its marketing strategy .
This is so totally not the place to discuss climatological trends and events .
Besides : it 's Friday .

Madagascar is renowned for its biological richness .
Located off the eastern coast of southern Africa and slightly larger than California , the island has an eclectic collection of plants and animals .
But Madagascar ’s biological bounty has been under siege for nearly a year in the aftermath of a political crisis which saw its president chased into exile at gunpoint ; a collapse in its civil service , including its park management system ; and evaporation of donor funds which provide half the government ’s annual budget .
This is an update to Madagascar ’s Political Chaos Threatens Conservation Gains , which appeared on Yale e360 on January 4 , 2010 .
Madagascar is renowned for its biological richness .
Located off the eastern coast of southern Africa and slightly larger than California , the island has an eclectic collection of plants and animals , more than 80 percent of which are found nowhere else in the world .
Madagascar is home to such evolutionary oddities as the fossa , a carnivorous mammal that looks like a cross between a puma and a dog but is closely related to the mongoose ; the indri , a cat - sized lemur whose haunting song resembles that of the humpback whale ; the sifaka , a lemur that “ swears ” rudely but moves across open ground like a ballet dancer ; brilliantly colored chameleons and day geckos ; and cryptic leaf - tailed geckos , which are nearly impossible to distinguish from bark or moss .
It has baobab trees , which look like they ’ve been planted upside down ; the rosy periwinkle , a delicate flower used to cure pediatric leukemia and Hodgkin ’s disease ; and an entire desert ecosystem consisting of just spiny plants , none of which are cacti .
Accordingly , scientists have made the island — dubbed the Eighth Continent — a top conservation priority .

But Madagascar ’s biological bounty has been under siege for nearly a year in the aftermath of a political crisis which saw its president chased into exile at gunpoint ; a collapse in its civil service , including its park management system ; and evaporation of donor funds which provide half the government ’s annual budget .
In the absence of governance , organized gangs ransacked the island ’s biological treasures , including precious hardwoods and endangered lemurs from protected rainforests , and frightened away tourists , who provide a critical economic incentive for conservation .
Now , as the coup leaders take an increasingly active role in the plunder as a means to finance an upcoming election they hope will legitimize their power grab , the question becomes whether Madagascar ’s once highly regarded conservation system can be restored and maintained .

Madagascar has been separated from mainland Africa for 160 million years and isolated from other land masses for at least 80 million .
The result is an unusual mix of flora and fauna , most of which either predated separation or rafted to the island .
These animals radiated to fill Madagascar ’s many niches — ranging from dry deserts to mountain moorlands to tropical lowland rainforests — that result from its diverse topography and climate .
Humans were late arrivals to Madagascar , journeying across the Indian Ocean from what is now Indonesia ( not Africa , despite its proximity ) sometime in the past 2,000 years , making it one of the last major land masses to be colonized by man .
Mankind has had profound impacts on the island ’s flora and fauna .
Humans hunted the largest species — including giant ground lemurs , hippos , and massive elephant birds — to extinction and drove landscape changes through persistent burning and the introduction of non-native species .
Forests that once blanketed the eastern third of the island are today fragmented , degraded , and greatly reduced , while endemic spiny forests have been diminished by subsistence agriculture , cattle grazing , and charcoal production .
The central highlands have mostly been cleared for pasture , rice paddies , and eucalyptus and pine plantations .
Environmental degradation in Madagascar is so extensive that it is now even visible from space .
Astronauts have remarked that the red color of Madagascar ’s rivers suggest the country is bleeding to death .
In a sense , it is .
The rivers are hemorrhaging topsoil .
Poor as it may be , soil is the basis of agriculture and as one of the poorest nations on Earth , the people of Madagascar can ill afford this loss .
Each year as much as a third of the country burns , primarily the result of fires set by farmers and cattle herders clearing land for subsistence agriculture or promoting the growth of new vegetation for animal fodder .
Meanwhile industrial miners from developed countries are tearing away at some of Madagascar ’s last remaining forest tracts for ore and mineral deposits .

Nevertheless , despite the carnage , the fragments of habitat that remain still support an astounding array of biodiversity .
So rich in fact , that scientists are continuing to discover species .
The number of lemurs in the definitive guide to lemurs — authored by Russell Mittermeier , the current president of Conservation International — has risen from 50 in 1994 to more than 100 today , while scientists last year announced a near doubling of the number of frog species known to occur on the island .
But over the past decade Madagascar has undergone a remarkable transition from the pariah of conservation to a model .
While financial and technical support from foreign governments and international NGOs has been critical , local involvement and political commitment — in 2003 then President Marc Ravalomanana said he would set aside 10 percent of the country as parks — have been essential to slowing deforestation and protecting endangered wildlife on the ground .
Madagascar ’s park system mandates that half of park entrance fees flow back to local communities , ensuring that at least some benefits of ecotourism — two - thirds of visitors come to Madagascar for nature - related activities — reach people who may be otherwise disadvantaged by conservation initiatives .
Indeed the emergence of ecotourism has been credited by some for making local people partners — rather than adversaries — in conservation .

Two ships belonging to Delmas , the Consistence and the Lea , were last year reportedly shipping rosewood out of Madagascar .
The company now says it has quit the international rosewood shipping business but recent reports suggest it may be planning to ship rosewood between ports in Madagascar .
Photos taken in Vohémar port , Madagascar .
But these gains were all but erased by the political crisis in March 2009 .
Although the underlying drivers of the conflict remain in dispute , observers say the democratically elected Ravalomanana had become increasingly autocratic in his second term , shutting down opposition media outlets , using his political power to further his sprawling business interests , and signing controversial deals , including one that reportedly would have turned over half of Madagascar ’s arable land to Daewoo , a South Korean conglomerate , for export - only crop production .
After a series of demonstrations turned violent under questionable circumstances , a faction of army officers allied with Andry Rajoelina , the mayor of the capital city of Antananarivo , overthrew Ravalomanana , who fled to South Africa .
In the aftermath of the coup , Madagascar ’s reserves — especially in the northern part of the country — were ravaged by illegal loggers .
Armed bands , financed by foreign timber traders and at times in collusion with local officials , went into Marojejy and Masoala national parks , harvesting valuable hardwoods including rosewood and ebonies .
Without backing from the central government or support from international agencies that had been the source of nearly 90 percent of conservation funding , little could be done to stop the carnage .
Marojejy , a forested mountain that is among Madagascar ’s most biodiverse parks with a dozen species of lemurs including the critically endangered Silky Sifaka , was the first to fall .
Armed bands invaded the reserve , cutting trails , hunting wildlife , and extracting timber .
Those who attempted to stand in their way were threatened — local radio reported that a park ranger from ANGAP , Madagascar ’s protected areas agency , had both of his feet broken by representatives of timber barons in the northern town of Mananara .
The chaos forced authorities to close Marojejy to tourists — its lifeblood — for the first time , effectively blocking outsiders from bearing witness so the plunder .
Loggers soon moved into Masoala National Park , a UNESCO World Heritage site that is considered one of the jewels of Madagascar ’s protected areas .
Logging was so intense in Masoala that the supply of cargo boats in the neighboring town of Maroantsetra was fully employed to haul rosewood out of the forest — none were available for conventional shipping .
Other forest areas were also targeted .
All told , logging affected 27,000 - 40,000 acres of protected rainforest , according to estimates from Lucienne Wilmé , Porter P. Lowry , Peter H. Raven of the Missouri Botanical Garden , and Derek Schuurman of Rainbow Tours .
More than $ 200 million worth of timber was cut .
Much of it went to China to make wood products that will eventually be sold in Europe and the United States .
Rosewood logs .
Precious hardwood logs are tied together with lianas and floated down rivers on rafts made from lighter species as trees .
5 - 6 lighter logs are needed to float each rosewood log , exacerbating the impact of rosewood extraction .
What was particularly galling for conservationists about the episode was that logging was principally for commercial gain by well - connected traffickers , rather than subsistence harvesting by poor Malagasy .
Erik Patel , a researcher from Cornell University who focuses on the Silky Sifaka in Marojejy , says that traders , not the common Malagasy villager , benefitted most from the illicit harvesting .
“ Harvesting these extremely heavy and valuable hardwoods is a labor - intensive activity requiring coordination between local residents who manually cut the trees , but receive little profit , and a criminal network of exporters , domestic transporters , and corrupt officials who initiate the process and reap most of the enormous profits , ” Patel said .
“ Local people benefit very little from rosewood logging .
In most cases , rosewood logging is harmful to local people because of loss of tourism and violation of local taboos . ”
At the same time that the northern rainforests were being pillaged for their timber , a disturbing new trade emerged : commercial bushmeat hunting of lemurs .
In August , Conservation International ( CI ) , an NGO that has been particularly active in Madagascar , released photos showing piles of dead lemurs that had been confiscated from traders and restaurants in northern towns .
Loss of lemurs can have ecological effects in forests .
According to Patricia Wright , lemurs appear to be the most important seed dispersers in Madagascar .
Worryingly , Wright says that the “ tastiest ” lemur — as revealed by surveys of more than 2,000 individuals in local villages — is also one of the most important dispersers : the black - and - white - ruffed lemur .
These animals are the crowned lemur , Eulemur coronatus and the golden crowned sifaka , Propithecus tattersalli .

“ What is happening to the biodiversity of Madagascar is truly appalling , and the slaughter for these delightful , gentle , and unique animals is simply unacceptable , ” said CI ’s Russ Mittermeier in a statement released at the time .
“ And it is not for subsistence , but rather to serve what is certainly a ‘ luxury ’ market in restaurants of larger towns in the region .
More than anything else , these poachers are killing the goose that laid the golden egg , wiping out the very animals that people most want to see , and undercutting the country and especially local communities by robbing them of future ecotourism revenue . ”
Until the coup , ecotourism had been an economic bright spot for Madagascar .
Lured by its spectacular landscapes , unmatched biodiversity , and cultural richness , tourist arrivals had been growing , reaching $ 390 million in 2008 .
But the trend shifted abruptly with the political turmoil and violence , with rich - world governments advising their citizens to avoid Madagascar .
Tourist arrivals dropped sharply during the crisis — 50 to 60 percent island - wide for the year by some estimates .
International carriers cut flight service but workers employed directly in the tourism industry were particularly affected .
During a September visit to Perinet Special Reserve , the home of the famous singing Indri lemur , nature guides idled in front of lodges , waiting for tourists , and loitered along the road to a mining area , hoping to pick up work as day laborers .
The lucky ones had managed months ago to line up temporary work at a $ 3.8 billion nickel mine run by Sherritt , a Canadian mining firm .
The project will eventually send millions of tons of mining sluice to the coastal port of Tamatave via an 85 - mile - long pipeline that runs between to two protected areas .
At 400,000 ariary ( $ 200 ) per month , it is the best job in town .

The decline in tourism has been felt widely in Madagascar , but some have suffered more than others .
Some operators in the north said business is down by as much as 80 percent relative to last year .
In Ranomafana , arguably Madagascar ’s best - managed park , tourist arrivals are down by more than 40 percent , according to Patricia Wright , executive director of the Institute for the Conservation of Tropical Environments ( ICTE ) at Stony Brook University and a leading force in conservation in Madagascar over the past 20 years .
Wright has tracked tourism in Ranomafana over the past decade and says that during Madagascar ’s last political crisis in 2002 , tourist arrivals in Ranomafana fell from 16,000 to less than 3,000 , a drop of more than 80 percent .
Last year 24,000 tourists visited the park , generating $ 1.72 million in revenue .
Local officials in Ranomafana confirm the crisis has adversely affected the town and the park .
“ Tourism in Ranomafana National Park has decreased by 45 to 46 percent compared to last year and overall for Fianar province tourism has decreased by 70 percent , ” said Mamy Rakotoarijaona , manager of the Ranomafana National Park , via a translator .
“ Ranomafana National Park and Isalo National Park [ another popular park ] have been faring better then other national parks , but still hurting .
This makes a big impact on the economics of the villages as 50 percent of the park entrance fees are used for village conservation and development projects . ”
“ Tourist guides and local shopkeepers are suffering from the lack of tourists , ” added Leon Razanakoto , the mayor of Ranomafana .
“ We are hoping that tourism will come back again next year with the elections in place . ”
The standstill has also hit downstream businesses indirectly linked with tourism .
Farmers are selling less rice and zebu , shopkeepers are selling fewer bottles of Eau Vive , the ubiquitous drinking water most often consumed by tourists , and bundles of fresh vanilla beans , a popular souvenir .
The downturn has made some Malagasy aware of just how important visitors — two - thirds of whom come to Madagascar to see its wildlife — are to their well - being .
“ Many people did n’t believe that bringing vazaha [ the local term for foreigners ] to the forest helped them , ” said Claudio , a nature guide based in Maroantsetra , a town that is the jumping - off point for Masoala National Park .
“ But the crisis has shown them that tourism does bring benefits .
Everyone is feeling it now — the political crisis has become an economic crisis . ”

For conservation , the fall in tourist revenue has been exacerbated by the loss of donor support .
USAID , a major source of finance for conservation projects , and other organizations have frozen funding , while the Peace Corps has pulled its volunteers out of the country .
NGOs have been pleading to governments to restore aid .
Zurich Zoo , which backs a conservation project in Masoala , has gathered thousands of signatures in a petition drive , calling for restoration of law enforcement and resumption of aid .
There are worries that the suspension of projects has eroded confidence among local communities that conservationists are committed to Madagascar for the long haul .

Decree re-authorizing rosewood exports .
Click image to enlarge .
While the situation improved in the second half of 2009 with gendarmerie moving into some critical areas and a series of arrests of illegal loggers ( who were subsequently released ) , it has worsened since the end of the year .
In mid-December it became clear the shipments of illegally logged timber would resume after a temporary moratorium .
A major shipment — worth an estimated $ 20 - 80 million — was planned for December 21 until a global campaign led by Ecological Internet , an Internet - based activist group , forced the French shipping company , Delmas , to leave port without any timber .
A representative from Delmas said afterwards that transporting the timber was n’t worth the damage to its reputation .
But the reprieve did n’t last long .
On December 31 , Rajoelina ’s transitional authority authorized the export of rosewood , signaling to loggers that they could now cash in on their efforts .
Immediately following the decree , reports on the ground indicated an upswing in logging activity in Masoala and Makira National Parks .
In the midst of a cash - crunch , Rajoelina ’s government was apparently selling out Madagascar ’s forests to finance an election that it hoped would validate its seizure of power .
To ensure this outcome , Rajoelina ’s forces cracked down on the opposition , tear - gassing protesters , arresting journalists , and shelving scheduled parliamentary elections .
His actions , which have also included rejecting a series of power - sharing agreements , have provoked strong condemnation from the outside world .
The United States terminated trade preferences with the country and , together with other countries , is said to be weighing sanctions .
Donor governments have said that aid is unlikely to resume until democratic rule returns to Madagascar .
In the meantime , the pillage of the island ’s parks is expected to continue .
For 40 years , farmer Todd Leake and his family have battled bitter cold , hungry pests and a short growing season to coax soybeans out of their fields in eastern North Dakota .
The one thing they never had to fight for , though , was their seeds .
FOR THE RECORD :
Seed prices :
An article Friday in Section A about the federal government examining whether certain practices in agriculture were driving food prices higher said officials were seeking to determine whether there were antitrust practices that violated federal laws .
The practices should have been described as anti-competitive or monopolistic . —
A decade ago , salesmen from as many as 50 seed companies would compete for their dollars .
Each would promise healthier plants , richer yields or a better discount .
Today the Leakes have little choice :
There are four seed companies in their area , and all sell seeds that include genetic traits patented and licensed by Monsanto Co. , the world ’s largest seed firm .
“ There ’s basically nothing else available , ” said Leake , 48 .
“ You have to use their seeds and pay their prices . ”
The concerns of farmers such as Leake will take center stage in Ankeny , Iowa , on Friday as the Justice Department and U.S. Department of Agriculture kick off the first of a yearlong series of public meetings to examine whether antitrust practices in agriculture are driving food prices higher .
The meetings are intended to allow producers , competitors and activists to air their concerns about the grain , poultry , dairy and livestock industries .
The government is also trying to ferret out reasons for the sometimes vast gaps between what farmers are paid for producing food and the prices shoppers pay at the grocery store .
Justice Department officials , who spoke on background because they said it was too early to comment about concerns raised at the meetings , said the workshops were a chance for the government to examine the changes the food sector had undergone in recent years .
The push to hold such events , the officials said , was driven in part by President Obama ’s concerns over how consolidation has affected industry competition .
Many experts believe that rising food prices start with seeds .
In recent years , the companies that develop seeds for farmers to sow in their fields have consolidated .
Complaints about unfair competitive practices by the few giant firms left have soared .
As a result , critics say , the effects of more costly seeds have rippled out to the nation ’s dining tables .
The farm community -- which produces more than $ 80 billion annually in soybeans and corn -- has been pressuring lawmakers to investigate why it ’s costing them so much more to grow their crops .
U.S. farmers spent about $ 17 billion on seeds last year , up 56 % from 2006 , the USDA said .
Yet over the last decade , the number of independent seed companies in the U.S. has shrunk to fewer than 100 from more than 300 , said Bill Wenzel , national director of the nonprofit Farmer to Farmer Campaign on Genetic Engineering , a network of 34 farm groups .
Today , four companies account for 50 % of the world ’s proprietary seeds for major crops .
The leader is Monsanto Co. , whose marketing practices the Justice Department is investigating .
“ There ’s a growing sentiment in this White House administration that competition , and the lack of it , is getting to be a serious problem in the food sector , ” said Neil E. Harl , an Iowa farmer and a retired Iowa State University economics professor .
“ The question will be whether the government will , after these hearings , take a more active approach . ”
By anyone ’s standard , Monsanto is huge , as is its influence on consumers : Ninety - two percent of the U.S. soybean acres and 85 % of the fields planted with corn are grown with seeds that use Monsanto technology , according to a 2009 report issued by Farmer to Farmer .
Crops grown with Monsanto ’s patented genes probably contributed to the pancakes served at breakfast , the hamburger eaten at lunch and the fruit punch poured at dinner .
The federal government has company in its scrutiny of Monsanto .
At least three state attorneys general have begun probes into whether the St. Louis company has abused its market dominance to undermine rivals and raise prices .
The company also is embroiled in a sweeping legal fight with rival DuPont Co. and its subsidiary Pioneer Hi-Bred International , which has claimed that Monsanto violated antitrust laws by using its gene licenses to quash competition .
Monsanto insists that it has done nothing wrong .
“ Monsanto believes an objective review of the agricultural sector will reveal that competition is alive and flourishing , ” it said in a statement this week .
A Monsanto executive is expected to speak in Iowa on Friday .
About 75 % of processed food -- such as margarine and chicken soup -- on the country ’s grocery shelves contains engineered ingredients .
These include soybeans that have been genetically modified to be more resistant to pests and weeds .
It was the lowly soybean that was the first staple crop to be successfully engineered and widely planted , thanks to Monsanto .
In an effort to bolster sales of its herbicide glyphosate , or Roundup , Monsanto turned to its laboratories to create crops that would tolerate the weed - killer .
Instead of trying to alter soy ’s genes , they layered on new ones .
As a result , the Roundup Ready soybean seed and its patented traits were born and hit the market in 1996 .
Sales skyrocketed .
So did a new business model , in which farmers are n’t buying a 50 - pound bag of seeds but paying for a license of Monsanto ’s biotechnology patents and the right to use those patents for one production year .
The price tag can also include additional costs , such as a technology fee .
Now , with the patent on the Roundup Ready soybean expiring in 2014 , along with the company ’s ability to draw royalties , Monsanto is pushing farmers to switch to its second generation of Roundup Ready seeds .
Farmers such as Leake say they have little choice but to go along .
“ I ran out of conventional seeds in 2004 , ” Leake said .
“ I had to shift over to seeds with Monsanto ’s genes . ”
He said he ’s also paying more .
In 2000 , a bag with enough Roundup Ready soybean seeds to fill 1 acre of land would have cost him $ 17 .
Now , he said , he pays as much as $ 50 .
He and his neighbors tried to figure out why the cost of seeds has jumped when they visited a Monsanto demonstration field last summer .
“ Someone asked , ‘ Why are they priced so high ? ’ ” Leake recalled .
“ They told us , ‘ The price of soybeans has gone up and our company believes we are deserving of higher seed prices because of the extra traits we ’re giving the farmer . ’ ”
“ What can you do ? ” Leake asked .
“ There ’s really no alternative . ”

Update : Downthread GOTV says he talked to Carl Levin tonight and he says he will sign .
So on the basis of his demonstrated veracity I guess that 's 14 ...
He said it publicly , ( 0+ / 0 -)
at our Democratic town committee meeting .
I asked him point - blank , and he said , " Sure , I 'll sign it . "
He said more , too , but that 's for tomorrow 's diary .
Update : 16 !!!!!
Raw Story has just stated written that Barbara Boxer CA and Jack Reed RI are in .
By my count that 's now 16 " supporters " because I 'm taking GOTV 's assertion that Levin made a public statement last night that he is on board .

NASA Spots Surprising Shrimp Beneath Antarctic Ice
This critter is a three - inch long Lyssianasid amphipod found beneath the Ross Ice Shelf , about 12.5 miles away from open water .
NASA scientists were using a borehole camera to look back up towards the ice surface when they spotted this pinkish - orange creature swimming beneath the ice .

Bight is more than 12 miles from open water , even in the Antarctic summer – not exactly where one would expect to find sophisticated aquatic life - forms swimming beneath a layer of ice nearly 600 feet thick .

At a depth of 600 feet beneath the West Antarctic ice sheet , a small shrimp - like creature managed to brighten up an otherwise gray polar day in November 2009 .
Bob Bindschadler of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md. , remembers the day well .
He and his team were on a joint NASA - National Science Foundation expedition to examine the underside of the ice sheet when they found the pinkish - orange creature swimming beneath the ice .
" We were like little kids huddling around , just oohing and aahing at this little creature swimming around and giving us a little show , " said Bindschadler .
" It was the thrill of discovery that made us giddy ; just totally unexpected .
" The complex critter was identified as aamphipod , about three inches in length .
It was found beneath the 180 - meter ( 590 - foot ) thick Ross Ice Shelf in Windless Bight , 20 miles northeast of McMurdo Station .
Bindschadler and his team drilled an eight - inch diameter hole through the ice so that Alberto Behar of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , could submerge a small camera to obtain what are believed to be the first images of the underbelly of an ice shelf .
" This is the first time we 've had a camera able to look back up at the ice .
This probe is an upgrade to the original .
It has three cameras – down , side and back - looking .
The back - looking camera saw the shrimp - like animal , " said Behar .
The drilling in Windless Bight was part of the team 's preparation for upcoming field studies 1000 miles from McMurdo where the Pine Island ice shelf is rapidly thinning and Antarctic ice is swiftly sliding off the continent , raising sea level .
Bindschadler and his team want to find out why .
Behar designed the original NASA borehole camera apparatus in 1999 .
It 's now seen six deployments with British , Australian and American science teams in Antarctica , Greenland and Alaska .
He 'll take this new camera rig to Pine Island with Bindschadler and others , and hopes to eventually probe into Antarctica 's mysterious sub -glacial lakes .
There he 'll attach a fiber - optically tethered micro-submarine with high - resolution camera , " so we can swim within the lake .
"
The rig , originally developed by NASA , has proven to be invaluable to science teams around the world .
" We would n't be able to use it in the places we 've gone without collaboration with the National Science Foundation and our British and Australian partners , among many others , " said Behar .
" When we get to Pine Island we 'll be able to look at the sea floor .
We could n't do it this time because the cavity was deeper than we expected , but we 'll have a kilometer of cable at Pine Island .
"
It 's not unusual to find amphipods and other marine life in Antarctic waters .
The complex circulatory system of the surrounding ocean brings warm , salty , nutrient - rich water towards the Antarctic continent , helping to sustain life even in the cold , dark winter .
When the Larsen B ice shelf collapsed in 2002 , scientists discovered clams and bacterial mats , or large aggregations of bacteria , half a mile below the ocean surface .
Even within their average temperature range of - 1.8 to 1 degree Celsius ( 28.7 to 33.8 Fahrenheit ) , Antarctic waters are teeming with life .
" The ocean flows under ice sheets , and where there is exchange of water with the open ocean , there will be microbes and other food resources for larger animals such as jellyfish and amphipods , " according to Peter Wiebe , a biologist from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole , Mass. , who studies marine life in the waters around West Antarctica .
But for a group of glaciologists , a familiar face was the last thing they expected to see below the ice and so far from the open ocean .
" We thought we were just going into a deep , dark cold water hole and never anticipated we'd see any life , " Bindshadler added .
" The color was what caught our eyes .
" The science team -- with members from the University of Alaska , Fairbanks ; the Naval Postgraduate School , Monterey , Calif . ; and Moss Landing Marine Laboratories , Monterey -- is now analyzing temperature , salinity and current data from the sub - glacial watering hole to understand if the comfortable conditions for this shrimp - like creature are typical .
NASA - funded scientists have long studied life in extreme environments .
From astrobiology to extremeophiles and survivophiles , the search for life in harsh places has led to a smorgasbord of discoveries seemingly ripped from the pages of science fiction .
The Antarctic amphipod has gotten scientists talking again : if life - forms as complex as these can survive deep within sub - glacial waters could they survive in other unusual and unfriendly environments in space ?
Behar , also known for his work on robotic exploration of Mars , remarked , " The real benefit of these exploration programs is that you go in not knowing what you 're going to find and you get surprised .
It makes it worth all the trouble putting everything together when you find something new that you did n't expect .
" Preliminary findings and video footage will be presented today at the American Geophysical Union Chapman Conference on the Exploration and Study of Antarctic Subglacial Aquatic Environments in Baltimore , Md .

Every four years , exercise - induced asthma draws special attention among scientists and the media , in lock step with the Winter Olympics .
That ’s because when the world ’s premier cold - weather sports athletes convene in Vancouver for the 2010 Winter Olympics next month , they will share , as a group , not only exceptional fitness but also a disproportionate tendency to wheeze .
Exercise - induced asthma has been diagnosed in as many as half of all elite cross-country skiers and almost as many world - class ice skaters and hockey players .
It ’s far more common in winter athletes than in those who compete in the summer , although nearly 17 percent of Olympic - level distance runners have been given the same diagnosis .
Even among the unexalted ranks of recreational athletes , it ’s a condition that strikes far more often in the winter and also among the most committed .
“ In my experience , recreational athletes ” who have symptoms of exercise - induced asthma but no asthma symptoms otherwise , “ tend to be the ones who train ” for the most hours , says Dr. Christopher Randolph , a clinical professor at Yale University who sees patients at the Center for Allergy , Asthma and Immunology .
All of which raises the intriguing issue , especially pertinent with the Olympics so close , of whether training strenuously outside in the cold for hour after hour might somehow be bad for your respiratory system .
It ’s an area of “ active study , ” Dr. Randolph adds .
Exercise - induced asthma is not quite the same condition as asthma .
And in fact , these days , according to Dr. Randolph , the “ preferred term ” in the scientific community for exercise - induced asthma is exercise - induced bronchoconstriction , or E.I.B .
“ It ’s a reversible , obstructive airway disease ” that typically begins about five minutes after you stop exercising — particularly if your exercise was intense , “ at between 85 and 95 percent of maximum heart rate , ” Dr. Randolph says .
About 90 percent of people with asthma also suffer from E.I.B. and , in children , wheezing after exercise is often the first clue that they have asthma .
But people can also suffer from E.I.B. without underlying asthma .
Not so long ago , most researchers held that exposure to cold air was what triggered the bronchial narrowing , with blood vessels in the throat constricting to conserve warmth , just as they do in ungloved fingers ; when the vessels later reinflated , they were thought to ignite spasms in the bronchial tubes , like tingling in warming fingers .
“ And that probably does happen , ” Dr. Randolph says .
But most researchers no longer consider it to be the primary cause .
Instead , says Dr. Randolph , most experts think that the problem is not with the coldness of the air but with the “ dryness . ”
Lungs need water - saturated air .
If the air entering your bronchial tubes is dry , as it usually is in winter , the cells lining your airway release their own moisture to humidify it .
“ Think of a sponge being squeezed , ” Dr. Randolph says .
The squeezing and loss of moisture prompt certain cells within the bronchial tube to release allergic chemicals that initiate an inflammatory process , slowly closing your throat .
Thankfully , the process is “ self - limiting , ” Dr. Randolph says .
“ No one dies ” of exercise - induced bronchoconstriction .
( Although some athletes have died from uncontrolled asthma attacks , a different issue . )
A recent study of sweat rates in people with exercise - induced respiratory problems has bolstered this dehydrated - bronchial - tubes theory .
The work was inspired by genetic studies in mice whose genes for aquaporin had been turned off .
Aquaporin is a protein in cell membranes that moves water in and out of the cells .
Mice engineered without this cellular plumbing system developed a multitude of moisture - related problems .
They did n’t sweat .
They did n’t salivate much .
And they had the mouse equivalent of asthma after running on a wheel .
It was this last effect that interested Dr. Warren Lockette , a medical officer at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego .
He recruited 22 Marines with laboratory - confirmed exercise - induced asthma and 34 control subjects , then tested how much the various Marines sweated , salivated and grew teary ( which even Marines will do , with the right provocation ) .
What he found was that those who perspired , spit and cried the least were also the most prone to exercise - induced asthma .
“ There was obviously a common thread here , ” Dr. Lockette told me , “ and it involved moisture . ”
His expectation is that further studies will show that aquaporin genes play some role in people ’s vulnerability to E.I.B .
But pinpointing genetic susceptibilities to E.I.B. does n’t answer the question of why it strikes so disproportionately among the world ’s best athletes , especially those in winter sports .
“ That ’s one of those really intriguing questions , ” Dr. Randolph says , and it may , if a new theory gaining currency is borne out , change how some Olympians and even more - everyday athletes train .
This theory posits that E.I.B. is , in some fashion , a sports injury .
“ What we think is happening , ” Dr. Randolph says , is that elite endurance athletes , especially those training more than 20 hours a week , actually “ injure their airways ” by breathing so much and so hard .
“ They take in up to 200 liters of air per minute , ” he says , in comparison to perhaps five or six liters per minute at rest , all of which must be humidified .
The resulting inflammation within their bronchial tubes becomes chronic over time , and each subsequent workout more easily triggers a new E.I.B. episode .
Cross -country skiers , runners , cyclists and other athletes who train in the wintertime may not have been born with breathing problems , but their repeated episodes of hyperventilating in cold air induce the malady .
What can be done ?
At the moment , most asthmatic Olympians rely on a short list of allowable drugs to get them through their training and competitions .
But in the long term , “ we think they may need to back off from some training , ” Dr. Randolph says .
He instructs serious athletes who suffer from E.I.B. “ to drop below 20 hours a week of training in their primary sport and cross - train at a lower intensity the rest of the time , ” he says .
“ They do n’t want to hear that , though . ”
The few studies of retired elite athletes with E.I.B. suggest that their breathing problems lessen or disappear when their training slackens ; but so , of course , does any chance of competing .
“ We do n’t know yet how to balance the need to train to win ” with the need to reduce E.I.B. , Dr. Randolph says .
In the meantime , and especially for non-Olympians , if you wheeze after exercising outside in the winter , visit a doctor .
Gasping and tightness in your chest after exercise can be caused by other conditions besides E.I.B. , Dr. Lockette says , including cardiac disease .
A lung - function test is part of a formal diagnosis of E.I.B .
If you do have the condition , drug treatments are available , Dr. Randolph says .
But start with easier fixes .
“ Breathe through your nose , ” he says .
The mucus there is far moister than that in your mouth .
Wear a face mask , which recirculates the moisture you exhale into the air you draw in .
Drinking more water , while generally wise , has n’t been shown to combat E.I.B .
But warming up gradually before exercising in earnest does seem to help , Dr. Randolph says .
A warm - up of least 5 to 15 minutes , at an intensity of 60 percent or less of your maximum heart rate , seems to fool the inflammation - stimulating cells in your bronchial tube , leading to a “ refractory period ” of an hour or so , during which you can usually complete a workout without setting off bronchospasms .
And if none of that works , “ indoor gyms can be a good option , ” Dr. Randolph says , “ as long as they do n’t dehumidify the air . ”
“ We ’ve got a newborn , so we want to start worrying about her future , ” said Quan Ha , an IT manager for Kelley Bluebook .
Quan and Angelina thought they were doing something good for the environment .
The dispute began two years ago , when Quan and Angelina Ha tore out the grass in their frontyard .
In drought - plagued Southern California , the couple reasoned , the lush grass soaked up tens of thousands of gallons of water – and hundreds of dollars – each year .
But in Orange , city officials are locked in a legal battle with a couple accused of violating city ordinances for removing their lawn , which they did to save water .
Some Southern California cities fine residents for watering their lawns too much during drought conditions .
But city officials informed the Has that they were violating several city laws that require residents to cover significant ports of their front lawns with live ground cover .
On Tuesday , the two are scheduled to appear in Orange County Superior Court to challenge a lawsuit the city filed against them .
They are fighting City Hall , saying their yard looks fine .
Soon after the city complained about the yard , they covered the dirt with wood chips , with help from neighbor Dennis Cleek .
“ It ’s their yard , it ’s not overgrown with weeds , it ’s not an eyesore , ” said Cleek , whose own yard boasts fruit and avocado trees .
“ We should be able to have our yards look the way we want them to . ”
But city officials determined the fix was not acceptable , saying city codes require that 40 % of the yard be landscaped predominantly with live plants .
“ Compliance -- that ’s all we ’ve ever wanted , ” explained City Atty .
Wayne Winthers .
Last summer , the couple tried to appease the city by building a fence around the yard and planting drought - resistant greenery – lavender , rosemary , horsetail and pittosporum , among others .
They sent a photo to city officials in October but say they received no response .
A few months later , they heard from the city , which said their landscaping still did not comply with city standards .
“ They put up a nice fence but [ the photo ] did n’t show anything about how they had complied with code , as far as the frontyard goes , ” Winthers said , “ nor did it include a site plan . ”
At the end of January , the Has received a letter from the city informing them they had been charged with with misdemeanor code violations and must appear in court .
“ It ’s just funny that we pay our taxes to the city and the city is now prosecuting us with our own money , ” Quan Ha said .
“ Does n’t it waste funds to go back and fourth in court , rather than sending pictures , e-mails and having phone conversations ? ”
Winthers said he hoped the city could work out a compromise with the couple .
“ We know times are tough , but we ’re willing to work with them ; we ’d be more than happy to , ” he said .
Meanwhile , the couple said there had been one bright spot :
They reduced their water usage from from 299,221 gallons in 2007 to 58,348 gallons in 2009 .

Shanahan interested in Terrell Owens or Brandon Marshall ?
Before we get to the question and the non-answer , let 's first establish what we know :
(1) Kyle Shanahan had the league 's top - ranked passing attack last season .
(2) The Redskins were interested enough in upgrading the wide receiver position to bring in free agent Antonio Bryant for a visit .
He signed elsewhere , and the Redskins likely would consider others .
(3) Terrell Owens is in need of a new home , and Brandon Marshall appears to be headed out of Denver .
So would Shanahan have any interest in either of these controversial wide receivers ?
Spoiler alert :
He is n't tipping his hand .
Shanahan would n't rule out either receiver and indicated that as free agent prices fall , the Redskins could get involved in the bidding process with some players well after the draft .
Shanahan strongly considered signing Owens in 2006 , before the outspoken , headline - grabbing receiver joined the Dallas Cowboys .
Asked this week about Owens , an unrestricted free agent , Shanahan said :
" We do n't talk about who 's on our radar screen for obvious reasons , but we do have a plan .
And sometimes we 'll wait to see what the market value is relative to the price , how many guys might be out there .
But we 're going to constantly try to upgrade our football team , and sometimes it has to do with salary as much as has to do with just getting depth .
And maybe after our minicamps , maybe after the draft , some guy will be out there , and we 'll gobble him because we think he has a chance to improve our football team . "
Some reports indicate that Owens wants to match his $ 6.5 million salary from last season , though his agent has said the receiver will be more flexible .
Marshall is another intriguing name .
There are differing reports about the relationship he and Shanahan shared in Denver .
Marshall is a restricted free agent and carries a first - round tender .
The Redskins would n't part with fourth overall pick for Marshall , but the Broncos could always consider a trade .
Shanahan smiled when asked about Marshall this week .
" Just have to wait and see , " he said .
" Ca n't share that with you . "

Ho -Oh ( Japanese : ホウオウ Houou ) is a Legendary Pokémon that Ash has sighted at a few significant moments in his journey .
Legends say that Ho - Oh lived in the Tin Tower in ancient times .
However , war broke out , and when the Brass Tower was burned , Ho - Oh created Raikou , Entei , and Suicune and then left .
A new Tin Tower was created , but Ho - Oh never returned .

In the main series
History
Kanto
Ho-Oh completely colored and outlined in gold in its debut
Ho -Oh debuted in Pokémon - I Choose You ! , where Ash first saw it in a forest on his way to Viridian City during his first day as a Trainer .
He was lying on the ground with his injured Pikachu and saw it fly over the rainbow that appeared in the sky after a storm .
His Pokédex could not identify it and explained that many Pokémon were still unknown .
In Pokémon Emergency ! ,
Ash tried to explain to Professor Oak what he had seen , though the image he used to point it out appeared to be of an Articuno rather than Ho - Oh .
Either way , Professor Oak did not believe him and brushed it off as Ash being mistaken .
This gold - colored version of Ho- Oh was an early concept of Ho - Oh as a Pokémon , as it , like all other Generation II Pokémon at that time , had not been fully developed yet .
Johto
The topic was brought up again in A Ghost of a Chance .
While Ash was in Johto , he explained his encounter of Ho - Oh to Eusine , who also did not believe that Ash had seen this Legendary Pokémon .
In For Ho -Oh the Bells Toll ! , they heard the bells in the Tin Tower ringing , which would signal Ho - Oh 's approach .
In Pop Goes The Sneasel , it was seen using Sacred Fire in a flashback .
In Gotta Catch Ya Later ! , Ash saw Ho - Oh again after he parted ways with Brock and Misty .
In Battling the Enemy Within ! , May first saw Ho - Oh flying across the sky and pointed it out to the rest of the group .
This was after Ash lost an unofficial battle against Pyramid King Brandon and was released from possession by the King of Pokélantis 's spirit .
Ho-Oh appeared in a flashback in Dawn Of A New Era !.
After making amends with Dawn , Ash recalled seeing it on the day his journey began .
In Finding a Legend ! , Ho - Oh flew over Ecruteak City , but this time , it was only seen by Jaye .
Personality and characteristics
Ho -Oh 's personality is unknown as all of its appearances involve it flying around but it appeared to have chosen
Ash as one of the people for its visits as evidenced in A Ghost of a Chance .
Ho -Oh 's appearance is that it is a very large Pokémon , and there is one shot in A Ghost of a Chance in the Tin Tower that shows three humans on their knees while Ho - Oh is perched up on a stand .
Ho - Oh appears to be significantly larger than the humans .

Ho -Oh reappeared in I Choose You ! , which is based in a continuity different from the main series .
Like in the main series , Ash and Pikachu witnessed Ho- Oh flying in the sky shortly after setting off on their journey .
Unlike the main series , however , it dropped a Rainbow Wing as it passed by , with Ash picking it up .
Keeping the wing with him , Ash set out to eventually meet and battle Ho - Oh .
He eventually did , and it had a battle with Pikachu , the outcome of which was unknown .

After Ash managed to place the Rainbow Wing on top of the rock , Ho - Oh appeared and Ash , his friends , Cross , Bonji , and the Pokémon in the area got to see Ho - Oh .
Ash and Pikachu then battle Ho - Oh , but the battle was not shown .

After several years of generally MacGuyvering shit for his fellow inmates ( and sometimes even the guards ) , the superintendent allowed Williams access to the machine shop where he immediately began experimenting with new kinds of firearm components .
Rather than the thorough Taser colonic he would 've received if he tried that shit in modern times , Williams was allowed continue and went on to invent the short - stroke piston and the floating chamber .

" I am shocked and outraged by the actions of these teachers at Wadsworth Elementary School , " Villaraigosa said in a statement .
" These teachers undermined the school 's well - intentioned celebration , and they did so at the expense of elementary school students .
Their actions were not only cynical , but did a terrible disservice to the students , their families and all of the teachers who work hard on a daily basis to build trust and a productive learning environment . "
Los Angeles Unified School District spokeswoman Gayle Pollard - Terry said Supt. Ramon C. Cortines learned about the incident Tuesday and had the teachers , who are white , pulled from their classrooms for the duration of an investigation .
The suspension is without pay for the first three days .
" The superintendent believes there are better choices , " Pollard - Terry said .
Other students were carrying pictures of President Obama and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr .
The teachers have not been identified and could not be reached for comment .
District officials did not provide specific details about what the teachers did , saying the investigation was still ongoing .
Some community leaders are n't satisfied with the suspensions and are calling for the dismissal of the instructors , who teach first , second and fourth graders .
" I just can't fathom what these teachers were thinking of except to make a mockery of African American history , " said Leon Jenkins , president of the Los Angeles branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People .
L.C. " Chris " Strudwick - Turner of the Los Angeles Urban League likened the episode to a series of racially provocative incidents at UC San Diego , where a Feb. 15 off - campus party mocked Black History Month .
" These kinds of things build on each other , " she said .
" When something like that happens in [ San Diego ] and there is no immediate consequence , that emboldens others .
That 's why I was glad that LAUSD took them out of the classroom right away . "
[ Updated at 1:38 p.m. : Pollard - Terry said Simpson appeared on the approved list of Black History Month figures , which dates back to 1985 .
But the names of Rodman and RuPaul , among others , were added in pencil when teachers were selecting which prominent African Americans their classes would honor in the parade .
The school principal did not see the list , which Cortines called a lack of oversight , said Pollard - Terry . ]
She said the three teachers were believed to have suggested at least some of those names for the list .
The district dispatched a human relations and ethnic diversity team Wednesday to help the school prepare lessons that are " more appropriate for Black History Month , " she added .
Strudwick - Turner said the Los Angeles Urban League has been told by people who attended the parade Friday that the teachers had been asked to instruct their classes on a notable African American and that they had selected Simpson , Rodman and RuPaul .
The mayor said in his statement that he hopes the situation will be resolved .
" I urge the Los Angeles United School District to take swift and appropriate action with respect to the teachers involved .
We cannot stand for such myopic behavior by those whom we entrust to teach and inspire the next generation , " he said .

Fuelled by leftover chocolate and with components made from carrots , potato starch and flax , the world ’s first sustainable Formula 3 racing car has a top speed of 135 miles per hour and can go from zero to 60 in 2.5 seconds .

Sound nuts ?
Not yet -- brake pads made from cashews are still under development .
Meet Lola , the University of Warwick ’s blend of muscle and eco-friendliness and the world ’s first racing car retrofitted with renewable and sustainable materials .
Researchers from the university showed off their prize possession at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ’s ( MIT ) energy conference in Boston .
“ She ’s incredibly green , taking materials that would otherwise have ended up in a landfill .
It lets people engage with recycling without the finger - wagging , ” said Kerry Kirwan , one of the car ’s designers at the university .
“ The public has really taken the car to its heart , because she ’s fun , ” he said .
Many of the car ’s components would more usually be found at a farmer ’s market -- or in a rubbish bin , since most of the materials are actually industrial waste .
The 2.0 - litre BMW engine has been converted to diesel from gasoline and configured to run on fuel derived from waste from chocolate factories or other plant - based oils .
Among Lola ’s other unique features is a radiator that converts ozone back to oxygen .
“ It ’s a racing car that cleans up as it goes along , ” said Steve Maggs , another member of the design team .
The WorldFirst Formula 3 racing car took the university more than nine months to develop and cost around $ 200,000 ( 133,400 pounds ) .
Kirwan said that the thinking behind the project was to find a way to really put recycled materials to the test .
“ A lot of these technologies were a huge leap of application , something that shows the material under a really demanding application . ”
For whatever reason I never got the memo about worshiping at the altar of pork butt .
It seems that to a lot people when it comes to pulled pork , that pork butt is the only way to go .
I beg to differ .
There are other cuts which in my experience are just as good , or even better .
The one advantage I see with using pork butt is you can get a larger piece of meat in a single piece then you can with rib end pork loin .
If you 're a single person , or cooking for less then a crowd , and you tend to not freeze leftovers , then being a member of the cult of the pork butt is not an option .
At least not for me .
When I was growing up the majority of the roast meat we had was roast pork .
Occasionally it was a roast beef , and chicken , well it was chicken cutlets breaded and fried .
The Italian version of fried chicken .
The pork always ended up shredded .
We had no idea what pulled meant .
All we knew was that the pork would shred and it was delicious .
For those who do n't know , pork butt is the shoulder cut of pork .
According to ...
... the book How to Cook Meat , " It got its name because in colonial times this type of pork was packed into barrels called ' butts ' for shipping and storage .
The pulled comes from using two forks to pull apart the meat after it cooks so it has the texture of being shredded .
Traditionally pork butt is used for a preparation with bbq sauce so perhaps this is why I 'm not a member of the cult .
While I LOVE a good bbq , when it comes to having my pork and eating it too , I prefer this tasty preparation .
I hope that you will enjoy it also .
Roasted Pulled Pork
2 lbs. pork loin boneless or bone in rib end
2 14 oz cans chicken stock
1.5 tblsp .
pickling spice , either wrapped in cheesecloth , or in a tea ball if you have or use either
2 whole garlic cloves , peeled
Olive Oil
Salt , Pepper , Garlic Powder
Coat pork with salt , pepper , garlic powder and let it sit until it becomes room temperature * , approximately .
10 - 15 minutes .
Heat approximately 1/4 " olive oil in a 3 or 5 quart dutch oven .
Sear pork on all sides , remove and add chicken stock .
Stir the stock , scrapping up any bits that remained in the pan from the sear .
Put pork back in , add pickling spice and garlic cloves .
Cook on a low heat for 2 - 3 hours until pork pulls apart .
Or place in crock pot on low for 8 hours .
Keep the lid slightly cracked during cooking , and turn ever 45 minutes or so .
Add more stock if needed ,
Once the pork is done to remove the pickling spice , Use two forks to pull pork apart .
Place the strained sauce and the pork back into the dutch oven or the crock pot .
Serve as it , or as a sandwich with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe .
* Notes :
Meat at room temperature sears very well .
Pickling spice consists of cinnamon , allspice , mustard seed , coriander , bay leaves , ginger , chillies .
cloves , black pepper , mace , and cardamon .
If you do n't have pickling spice and have a combination of the above in your spice cabinet , try a custom blend .
I 've used s combination of ground mustard and ground coriander , a whole bay bay leaf , whole black pepper corns , and red pepper flakes with excellent results .
I never strain the spices out , or use a cheesecloth or tea ball to infuse the flavor .
Once the pork is refrigerated I like to keep the spices in there for added flavor .
If you choose to do this , you just have to be a little careful when serving with the pickling spice ,
Study Cited in Gladwell ’s Outliers has insight for NHL goalies today – and the trend is getting worse
[ Update : One reader noted that this is “ old news ” published by Malcolm Gladwell in Outliers – true , but guess where Gladwell got his information ?
This study .
And of course he does n’t look at whether it holds true with NHL goalies or how the trend is changing .
That ’s what is new in here .
So I added the sub - head above … because I know not everyone will read all of this ! ]
Several years ago I came across a research study out of the University of Saskatchewan .
PhD student Lauren Sherar studied 619 boys aged 14 and 15 who participated in the Saskatchewan provincial team selection camps in 2003 .
The study was to be published in the Journal of Sports Sciences .
At that age , some boys have already had their adolescent growth spurt and are significantly bigger than their peers .
An early bloomer could be perceived as being more talented at a selection camp , Sherar says , because their size gives them an advantage in strength , speed and endurance .

[ Update : One reader noted that this is “ old news ” published by Malcolm Gladwell in Outliers – true , but guess where Gladwell got his information ?
This study .
And of course he does n’t look at whether it holds true with NHL goalies or how the trend is changing .
That ’s what is new in here .
So I added the sub - head above … because I know not everyone will read all of this ! ]
The most significant finding was 31 of the 40 players who made the final cut were born in the first half of the year , January - June .
As we classify players by age , a player born in January could be a full year older than others competing against them for a spot on a team .
Thinking about this recently , I wanted to look at NHL goaltenders to see if the trend carries through .
I downloaded data on all goalies who had played at least one game in the NHL this year .
There were 79 of them .
The goalies studied in 2003 would be 21 or 22 by now .
Dustin Tokarski who has played two games in Tampa this year hails from Saskatchewan and was born in 1989 – he could well have been in this study .
Interestingly , he was born in September – if he made that team he would have been in the minority .
As an aside Saskatechewan seems to be a good place to grow up if you want to be an NHL goalie .
Six of the 79 players who had seen action this year in an NHL net are from Saskatchewan .
It ’s still a bonus to be from Quebec though as 12 NHLers are from Canada ’s goalie - factory , including of course all three Canadian Olympians .
So how do the birthday stats hold up in the NHL ?
The NHL Birthday Stats
Total CAN USA FIN SWE RUS SVK Jan-Jun 51 24 9 4 4 4 1 Jul - Dec 28 15 3 4 1 0 1
It is n’t quite the 75 % / 25 % split seen in the youth study , it ’s closer to 65 % of the NHL goalies who were born early in the year .
The trend holds in most countries , except Slovakia which has too few to really be significant , and Finland , which is interesting but a one goalie swing would make it 5:3 and quite a different picture .
What ’s the message ?
In the original study the author encouraged coaches to consider new ways to select teams .
The problem is a developmental one .
The late bloomers will fall further behind .
The best kids get selected for the best teams .
Those teams play more , get access to better coaching , better opportunities and so forth .
One thing going for a late born goalie today is the fact that there has never been more access to good coaching , good specialty goalie coaches .
It is possible that twenty years ago raw skill and size would have had a greater effect on a young goalie ’s success .
Still , it is concerning that not all kids will have the same chance to succeed at the highest levels simply as a result of when they were born .
Is it getting any better ?
I wondered if things might be getting better lately .
Perhaps we are now more open - minded and my idea about access to coaching might be apparent in the data .
I sorted the list by birth year and checked it again .
I grouped the only active goalie playing who was born in the 60s ( Guess who ? ) with the 70s and the only goalie to play in a game that was born in the 90s with the late 80s group .
70s 1980 - 85 1986-90 n pct n pct n pct < =6 15 56 % 23 68 % 13 72 % >6 12 44 % 11 32 % 5 28 %
The trend is actually the opposite of what I guessed .
In the 70s , age played far less of a role than for goalies born in the late 80s .
The situation is getting worse for late - born goalies .
It seems that the trend toward bigger and bigger goalies at the highest levels may be filtering down to youth levels and young goalies could be selected even more for size now .
The importance of birth month is only getting more significant .
Col Williams oversaw Canadian Forces Base Trenton
The commander of Canada 's largest air force base has been charged with the murder of two women and the sexual assault of two others , police said .
Col Russell Williams , 46 , appeared in court a day after his arrest .
He was held in custody and will appear again by video on 18 February .
One woman was found dead in her house in November and the other was reported missing 11 days ago .
Col Williams oversaw logistical support for missions to Haiti and Afghanistan .
He was appointed commander of Base Trenton in Ontario - Canada 's busiest air force hub - in July .
Det Insp Chris Nicholas , of Ontario Provincial Police , said Col Williams was arrested on Sunday .
We are certainly tracking the movements of where this man has been over the past several years
Det Insp Chris Nicholas
He was charged with the first - degree murder of Jessica Lloyd , 27 , a resident of Belleville , Ontario .
She was reported missing on 28 January and her body was found on Monday , police said .
He was also charged with the murder of Marie Comeau , a 38 - year - old corporal found dead in November at her home in Brighton , Ontario .
Authorities began investigating him after police canvassed motorists for information on 4 February .
They linked the two murders to one suspect on the basis of similarities between the cases , and did not expect to make any more arrests , police said .
Col Williams was also charged with forcible confinement , breaking and entering and sexual assault dating from September 2009 .
Police were continuing to investigate his past .
" We are certainly tracking the movements of where this man has been over the past several years and we 're continuing with our investigation , " Det Insp Nicholas said .
The Chief of the Air Staff , Lt Gen Andre Deschamps , said an interim commander would be appointed , pending the outcome of the trial .
A biography on the Canadian Air Force website said Col Williams had enrolled in the Canadian Air Force in 1987 and gained his wings in 1990 .

On March 17 , the following note appeared on the Promised Land blog :
And this also happened this week : the office of the minister of education forbade distributing a booklet for kids about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , because it didn�t like two articles in the declaration , as well as some of the illustration in the booklet .
The relevant link was to an article in Hebrew .
I asked Noam which two articles had been specified , and he replied that the nrg .
co.il article implied Article 14 and Article 18 .
These two articles are as follows :
" Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution . "
( Article 14 )
" Everyone has the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion ; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief , and freedom , either alone or in community with others and in public or private , to manifest his religion or belief in teaching , practice , worship and observance . "
( Article 18 )
But apart from that Hebrew language piece , there is also a translated version of the story available here .
Here is an extract :
The Ariel municipality decided to buy hundreds of copies of the book to distribute them as a gift to kindergarten children .
But after the Education Ministry�s intervention , the books were returned , even though they had already been bought with money and a message from the municipality pasted in them .
This is because the Education Ministry inspectors from the state religious department did not like two illustrations and two sections of the declaration , and decided to disqualify the book �
Mayor Ron Nahman said , " it is positive and good to hand out a book about children�s rights .
But our attention was drawn to two sentences that are not exactly what we teach the children .
The Education Ministry said this was wrong and we accepted its decision . "

OTTAWA–Junior cabinet minister Helena Guergis has issued an apology for her rude behaviour at the Charlottetown airport , where she allegedly threw a tantrum and screamed obscenities at staff who asked her to take her boots off for security screening .
" On Feb . 19 , I was rushing to catch a flight at the Charlottetown airport and spoke emotionally to some staff members , " Guergis , the minister of state for the status of women , said in an unusually abject mea culpa .
" Regardless of my workload and personal circumstances , it was not appropriate and I apologize to airport and Air Canada staff . "
It is just the latest setback for Guergis and her husband , former Conservative Edmonton MP Rahim Jaffer , once thought to be one of the capital 's golden couples .
Jaffer faces a March 9 court date in which he is expected to enter a plea bargain on drunk driving and cocaine possession charges .
Liberal MP
Wayne Easter circulated an anonymous but carefully detailed account of the incident believed to have been written by an airport employee who witnessed the events of last Friday .
Martin Paquet , a spokesman for Guergis , was read the account of the airport meltdown circulated by Easter .
He did not deny the account , but would not comment on the specifics of the incident .
He said the apology issued by Guergis speaks for itself .
According to the account , Guergis and aide Emily Goucher arrived a few minutes before the scheduled takeoff of an Air Canada flight from Charlottetown to Montreal .
In the pre-boarding area , Guergis refused to remove her boots despite being informed that they might set off the security alarm in the metal detector , according to the letter received by Easter .
When the alarm sounded , she was asked to sit down and remove her footwear .
Guergis " slammed her boots into the bin " provided by security personnel and then , according to the account , said to one of the airport staff : " Happy f--- ing birthday to me .
I guess I 'm stuck on this hellhole . "
Guergis , the MP for Simcoe - Grey , turned 41 on Feb. 19 .
After her boots cleared the X - ray conveyor , Guergis , according to the account , yelled at Goucher : " Get those for me .
I 'm not walking around here in sock feet . "
Guergis then allegedly tried to force open the locked door that separates the pre-board screening room from the area where the aircraft was waiting .
When a few moments later the minister was reminded that most passengers are asked to arrive at the airport two hours before boarding time , Guergis shouted back , according to the account : " I do n't need to be lectured about flight time by you .
I 've been down here working my ass off for you people . "
Guergis and her aide were ultimately allowed to board the flight .
A spokesperson for Air Canada Jazz said the airline would not comment on an anonymous letter .
" For privacy reasons , ( we ) will not provide information on a situation that occurred with one of our passengers , " Manon Stuart said in an email .
" Our employees have dealt with the situation directly with the passenger .
Our customer service agents are well - trained to manage various types of circumstances . "
Easter , who represents Malpeque in Prince Edward Island , said he has spoken to people who work at the airport and has absolutely no doubt that the account is accurate .
Word of the incident spread quickly in Charlottetown , he said .
Employees " were appalled at this performance , " he said of his talks with airport staff .
" They 're good security , but they 're typical islanders – they 're friendly , jolly .
To be berated the way they were was just an absolute shock , especially coming from somebody that had come in to the airport as a VIP . "
A spokesperson for Prime Minister Stephen Harper said of her apology : " That 's the end of the matter as far as we are concerned . "
Jaffer , 37 was arrested and charged on Sept. 14 , 2009 , at a village near Orangeville , Ont. , after being stopped for speeding .

Jaffer , who married Guergis in 2008 , represented the riding of Edmonton - Strathcona from 1997 until he was defeated in the 2008 election .
He was staying in Angus , Ont. , in Guergis ' riding when his vehicle was pulled over by the OPP .
In her apology issued Thursday , Guergis said : " It was certainly not my intention to create any additional stress for airport or Air Canada employees who already have a very difficult job .
" My father was born in Summerside ( P.E.I. ) and many of my relatives still live on the island , which I love and visit almost every year .
To me , it is a very special place that demonstrates the best Canada has to offer .
I wish to express my appreciation to all the hard - working people who make it so welcoming . "

THE OTHER NIGHT
I saw a commercial for a PBS program that breathlessly described how orcas “ dominate ” the oceans .
And the nature program I had the misfortune to see before that talked of different species of bears “ conquering ” each other ’s territories .
The program repeatedly emphasized the powerful bite of one particular type of bear — making sure we got the point by always playing scary music when these bears were depicted — and only late in the program did viewers learn that these bears were exclusively scavengers , with powerful jaws not so they could “ conquer ” and “ dominate , ” but so they could break the bones of those already dead .
This projection onto the natural world of this culture ’s urge to dominate is so ubiquitous as to be at this point almost invisible to us , like air .
And obviously , how we perceive the natural world affects how we behave toward it : if we perceive it as full of domination , we are more likely to attempt to dominate it .
Not infrequently , people will use the mass extinctions of the past to rationalize their efforts to dominate ( read : destroy ) the world at hand .
For example , I recently read an essay by the influential scientific philosopher Sam Harris titled “ Mother Nature Is Not Our Friend . ”
It begins , “ Like many people , I once trusted in the wisdom of Nature . . . .
I now believe that this romantic view of Nature is a stultifying and dangerous mythology .
Every 100 million years or so , an asteroid or comet the size of a mountain smashes into the earth , killing nearly everything that lives .
If ever we needed proof of Nature ’s indifference to the welfare of complex organisms such as ourselves , there it is . ”
Never mind that only one of the major mass extinctions was probably caused by an asteroid .
But the real point is that the moral I derive from mass extinctions is precisely the opposite of the moral Harris projects onto them .
I ’m lying on my stomach where meadow meets redwood forest .
The ground is wet from last night ’s misting rain .
My clothes quickly become soaked , my skin chilled .
I hear the soft sounds of songbirds —
I ’m grateful that some remain — carrying out their daily activities , and in the distance I hear a crow .
A frog chuckles in a nearby pond — I ’m grateful some frogs remain , too .
This is the year the worldwide amphibian die - off has come home ; the frogs in this pond are disappearing .
A fly buzzes overhead .
Looking down , at first I see a more or less undifferentiated mass of life and death .
But then , as I begin to get past my own discomfort at being cold and wet , and , more to the point , as I begin to grant even the few seconds it takes to stop paying attention to me and start paying attention to what ( or who ) is directly in front of my face , I begin to see .
A tiny mushroom , an inch tall , stalk as slender as a hair , button smaller than the butt on this pen .
A fir tree , two inches tall , already forked , tiny green needles already stiff and sharp .
Three - lobed plants whose names I do n’t know , and slender plants who stretch to their full height of less than the length of my finger .
Mosses grow beneath ; they are fragile , and I take care not to dislodge them .
I see first one spider web , wet with dew , and then another , then another .
I see huckleberry leaves , each its own shade of green .
Some leaves are complete , some have small bites taken out of them , by whom I do not know .
I look closely at one salal leaf .
The dew , barely beaded , looks slick across its surface , like delicate sweat on a lover ’s chest .
The leaf is a rich green , with a few dark spots where some fungus is feeding .
Another tiny plant , this with a single unopened flower , pale pink , at its tip .
An old piece of redwood , long fallen off the stump of a tree cut eighty years ago , slowly losing shape , covered with lichen ; tan roots of something — someone — sprouting out like hair .
I see another spider web , and then , beneath it , tiny greenish stalks of some fungus growing from a half - buried piece of that murdered tree .
A fruit fly lands on the pocked leaf of a native blackberry .
A gnat navigates this forest of six - inch - tall plants .
All of this life in one small area in only a few moments of noticing .
Elsewhere in life I have seen spiders who have lost three legs , yet still they live .
I ’ve seen a young bear who was shot in the back right knee by someone with more firepower than heart ; I saw her soon after she was shot ; and I saw her wound abscess grow to the size of a salad plate .
I saw my mother give this young bear antibiotics ; I saw this bear survive and grow and return to my mother ’s house to show my mother her first twin cubs ; I saw this hurt bear raise these cubs ; I saw her back right leg remain tiny , shriveled , no more useful than a peg , as she could not bend it , could not put weight on it ; I saw her survive .
I saw my mother moments after she broke her neck in a car wreck : C2 fracture , hangman ’s break , the damage so severe that doctors said the only person they ’d ever seen in the entire world with damage this severe never regained consciousness .
I have seen her twenty years later close her eyes tight against the pain from this accident ; and I have seen her stagger from the broken - neck - induced vertigo .
Yet still she lives on .
I should have died any number of times : at birth , at nine months , at twenty - three years , at forty - four years .
Yet I survived .
The point ?
Life is tenacious .
Just last night I was walking through the dark forest when I heard the distinct and sadly familiar sound of a snail shell imploding beneath my feet — two hundred pounds coming down on half an ounce .
I returned this morning and saw a beetle hauling away the body .
It is not hyperbole to say that I cannot imagine how many minute creatures I have killed simply by walking , scratching , wiping my forehead .
I do n’t want to imagine how many I have killed by running into or over them with a car .
The point ?
Life is fragile .
Life is tenacious .
Life is fragile .
Life relentlessly wants to live .
This is the real moral of the story of mass extinctions , but life wanting to live does not mean that no harm ever comes .
Life wanting to live does not mean that bad things do n’t happen .
We all know this .
Or should .
And when bad things happen , life still wants to live .
Relentlessly , desperately , lovingly , fully .
Even in Chernobyl .
Even in toxic waste sites .
Sam Harris seems to blame “ Nature ” for mass extinctions , and he implies that these mass extinctions have caused him to no longer trust “ Nature . ”
Do you see the unstated premise that binds him to fundamentalist Christianity ?
All he has done is changed the name “ God ” to the name “ Nature ” in presuming that “ Nature ” is omniscient and omnipotent .
How else can we explain his evident belief that “ Nature ” can stop an asteroid ?
His whole argument is nonsensical , much like saying that just because I did n’t prevent my mom ’s neck from breaking in a car wreck , I ’m not her friend , and that my wisdom , such as it may be , is not to be trusted .
That ’s absurd .
I would have done anything to prevent the accident , but I had heartbreaking constraints ( such as not being able to see around a broad corner ; such as not being able to see a black tarp against the backdrop of a black night ; such as not being able to anticipate that a semi loaded with plywood — the load covered with a black tarp — would have overturned moments before and blocked the entire road ; such as not being able to convert that semi load of lumber into feathers , foam , or Jell - O .
And who is to say that “ Nature ” does not also have constraints ?
How did life respond to an asteroid striking the Earth ?
Life responded as life does , by attempting to live .
How is life responding to the horrors of industrial capitalism ?
Life is responding as life does , by attempting to live .
Life wants to live .
Life so completely wants to live .
And to the degree that we ourselves are alive , and to the degree that we consider ourselves among and allied with the living , our task is clear : to help life live .
This is so brilliant , and so very wrong .

Let take a look at following ...
How do you answer the claim that there is no basis in Islam for hijab ?
Is there any possibility hijab was not commanded by Allah ?
A sister asked the following question , and we decided to share the answer for everyone ’s benefit .
Question :
I have a question concerning the hijab and I was wondering if you can provide some insight about this .
I was discussing with a colleague of mine , she ’s non-Muslim and we were talking about the hijab .
She does respect my beliefs and values and the fact that I wear the hijab , etc .
But what she is having trouble understanding is :
Why do Muslim women have to cover the hair ?
Why the hair especially ?
She is asking if there is a specific verse in the Quran that says that we need to cover the hair ?
She said : “ Who decided that hair was sexy ?
Why ca n’t you just dress modestly without covering the hair ? ”
I told her that covering the hair reminds a Muslim girl to dress modestly for other parts of her body and I also told her about the verse in the Quran that says Muslim women need to cover their bodies ( especially the bosom area ) and their ‘ awra .
Is the covering of the hair perhaps only in a hadeeth and not mentioned specifically in the Quran ?
She basically wants me to prove to her that it mentions in the Quran that our hair needs to be covered .
I am having trouble explaining to her why we need to cover the hair .
Every time I present an argument , she seems to refute it and thinks that the covering of the hair was just something we misinterpreted .
If you can please let me know what you think about this issue and how I can explain to her why we need to cover the hair , that would be great .
Jazakum Allah khair .
Answer :
Jazaki Allahu khayran for coming to us with your questions .
You should know that IGIC is a group of volunteering sisters , and our knowledge is limited .
I think the answer to your question falls under “ general knowledge , ” so I ’ll try my best to answer it , based on what I ’ve learned from people of knowledge , and based on evidence from the Qur’an and Sunnah .
I ’m answering your questions in a roundabout way because it ’s important .
First things first :
Focusing on Tawheed
Firstly , it is always the advice of scholars , shuyookh , and callers to Islam that if we engage in conversations about Islam with non-Muslims , we should focus on tawheed – calling to the Oneness of Allah .
This is based off the hadith in Sahih Muslim , when Mu’adh was going to Yemen as a delegate for Islam , and the Messenger salla Allahu alayhi wasallam instructed him to start by calling the people to “ La illaha illa Allah . ”
Basically , if you can convince someone of the truth of “ La illaha illa Allah , ” then you ’ve both won .
But if the person is not convinced of the shahadah , then why should they be convinced about the other rulings of Islam ?
And if a non-Muslim is suddenly convinced of the rulings , they ’re still not Muslim … so nothing changed .
So my advice to you , if possible , would be to steer the conversation away from hijab , and towards tawheed , towards the truthfulness of Islam , and the Oneness of Allah .
In other words , take it back to the root of everything .
Why We Wear Hijab
Honestly – and I ’d like you to reflect on this – the real reason we wear hijab or obey any of the commands of Allah is , first and foremost : because Allah told us to .
Why do we pray ?
Because Allah said so .
Why do we fast ?
Because Allah said so .
Why do we wear hijab ?
Because Allah said so .
Worshiping Allah and obeying
His commands is Allah ’s right , and it ’s the duty of everyone to fulfill that right as best as possible .
Later on , we can look for the wisdom of hijab – oh , it protects our modesty ; oh , it shelters us from men , etc .
But all those things are secondary .
This is so critical to remember , because even if we do n’t see a wisdom behind a ruling of Islam , we still have to follow it .
For example : A lot of people ask why Muslims do n’t eat pork .
The right answer is : “ Because Allah forbade it . ”
The wrong answer , which is too often given : “ Because there ’s a bacteria / worm / something that grows in the flesh , and eating it is harmful . ”
It turns out that if you cook the pork well , that no longer applies , and it ’s “ safe ” to eat ( according to scientists ) .
So does that mean – now that our “ reason ” for not eating pork is no longer there – we can eat pork so long as we cook it well ?
Of course not .
Why ?
Because the reason for not eating pork is still there : we do n’t eat pork because Allah told us not to !
The same applies to hijab :
We wear it because Allah told us to .
And we have to wear it in the way Allah told us to .
It ’s not for us to say , “ Oh , hijab is about modesty , therefore it ’s up to us to decide what modesty is . ”
This is not to say that there is no wisdom behind the rulings of Allah .
Undoubtedly , there is .
Sometimes we understand and know the reasons and wisdoms , and sometimes we do n’t .
Alhamdulillah , with hijab , some of the wisdoms behind it are clear – that it is about modesty and protection , and we know this because Allah told us so .
But in the end , wearing hijab is even more an issue of Muslim women obeying Allah .
That ’s why we do it .
How much does your co-worker know about Islam ?
Secondly , it ’s very interesting that your co-worker is , herself , interpreting Islam and the texts of Islam .
Indirectly she is arguing that as a non-Muslim , she has a better understanding of Islam than : 1 ) yourself as a Muslim ; 2 ) the majority of Muslims all over the world , and over the course of many centuries ; 3 ) the scholars of Islam who have much more knowledge of the texts and have dedicated their lives to studying Islam and its rulings .
How much knowledge does she actually have about Islam to say that covering the hair is something we misinterpreted ?
Maybe you can have her consider that question .
How much does she know about Islam that makes her confident we got it wrong ?
Incorrect Questions
Part of the reason you ’re having troubles answering is because the questions themselves are incorrect : “ Why do Muslim women have to cover the hair ?
Why the hair especially ?
Is there a specific verse in the Quran that says that we need to cover the hair ?
Who decided that hair was sexy ?
Why ca n’t you just dress modestly without covering the hair ? ”
There is a problem with all of these questions , and I ’d like to address two points in them them separately .
>>
It ’s Not Just the Hair !!!
Why do Muslim women have to cover the hair ?
Why the hair especially ?
Is there a specific verse in the Quran that says that we need to cover the hair ?
Who decided that hair was sexy ?
Why ca n’t you just dress modestly without covering the hair ?
Hijab is not just about covering the hair , or even “ hair especially . ”
Hijab is a code of conduct involving what a Muslim woman wears , and the way in which she behaves .
It includes covering everything of her body , except the hands and face ( some scholars even included the hands and the face – meaning , everything , everything – under what is necessary ) .
But it also includes lowering her gaze , not speaking to men in an enticing way , interacting with them modestly , etc . [ 1 ]
Even if we ’re only talking about the physical , clothing aspect of hijab , it includes so much more than just the hair .
I ’d like to refer you to this article listing the physical requirements of hijab .
So the question would be , “ Why do we also cover the hair , in addition to everything else ? ”
The same reason we cover everything else : Because Allah said so .
I know your co-worker is asking about the evidence , as well , and I ’m getting to that .
>> Qur’an and Hadith
The second incorrect question your co-worker is asking is this :
Is there a specific verse in the Quran that says that we need to cover the hair ? [… ]
She basically wants me to prove to her that it mentions in the Quran that our hair needs to be covered .
The reason this question is problematic is because your co-worker seems to only want evidence from the Qur’an , to the exclusion of the Sunnah .
This is a huge mistake , and I ’m hesitant , because she ’s insisting “ Qur ’an only ” to give evidence from the Qur’an only .
A Muslim cannot separate between the Qur’an and Sunnah .
Anyone who denies the importance of the Sunnah and the role of hadith in establishing the rulings of Islam is not a Muslim .
The Qur’an and Sunnah carry equal weight when it comes to legislation .
Certainly , the Qur’an is more sacred because it is the words of Allah ; nothing can compare to it , and it has its own virtues not shared with the Sunnah .
However , the words of the Messenger , salla Allahu alayhi wasallam , were also inspired .
It says in the Qur’an , speaking of the Messenger , “ Nor does he speak from [ his own ] inclination ” [ 53:3 ] .
In many verses of the Qur’an , the translation says , “ … obey Allah and obey the Messenger … ” [ 4:59 , 5:92 , 24:54 , 47:33 and 64:12 ] .
Elsewhere , we read , “ And whatever the Messenger has given you – take ; and what he has forbidden you – refrain from ” [ 59:7 ] .
So when somebody says “ show me in the Qur’an only , ” we should say with confidence , “ It does n’t have to be Qur’an only . ”
Something interesting to note about evidence in the Qur’an vs. evidence in the Sunnah is this .
Many times in the Qur’an , you ’ll see general rulings : establish prayer ; give zakat ; perform hajj .
But where in the Qur’an does it state that prayer should be five times a day ?
Where in the Qur’an are the movements and phrases for prayer ?
Where in the Qur’an are we told that zakat is 2.5 % of wealth above a certain amount that ’s accumulated for a year ?
Where is the complete description of Hajj ?
The fact is , all those things are in the Sunnah .
This is why many scholars say : the general rulings are in the Qur’an ; the details are in the Sunnah .
One of the scholars of Islam even said , “ The Qur’an is more in need of the Sunnah than the Sunnah is need of the Qur’an ” [ 2 ] .
This is because the Sunnah – as a body of evidence – can stand on its own , while the Qur’an is often interpreted by the Sunnah .
The Sunnah , in fact , is also revelation from Allah in a different form .
The Sunnah – the words and actions and life of the Messenger salla Allahu alayhi wasallam – are the best interpretation of the Qur ’an we have !
So if the general command for hijab is in the Qur’an , and the details are in the Sunnah , this should not present a problem to us in the least .
And the hadith that many scholars use as evidence is the hadith of Asma bint Abi Bakr :
Aisha radiya
Allahu anha reported that once her sister , Asma radiya Allahu anha visited her in finery while the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wasallam was at home .
He turned away from her and said , “ O Asma , when a woman reaches puberty it is not lawful for her to uncover any part of her body except this , ” and he then pointed , salla Allahu alayhi wasallam , to his face and hand palm .
[ Abu Dawud ]
Why do we need something more ?
The Consensus of Scholars
I also wanted to mention something – for your own benefit – about the consensus of Muslim scholars .
Consensus is a definitive proof in Islam , and some scholars say that the strongest form of evidence for an Islamic ruling is consensus [ 3 ] .
This is because scholars are n’t giving personal opinions when talking about rulings ; rather , they are looking at the Qur’an and the Sunnah as evidence before arriving at their conclusions .
In many situations , the scholars will differ – they look at the an ayah or hadith , and interpret it differently , or they study a body of evidence and arrive at different conclusions .
But if all the scholars can look at the evidence of what Allah and His Messenger said , and arrive at the same conclusion , this means the evidence is so clear , that it leaves no room for further interpretation .
And if the scholars of the earlier generations are in agreement about something , later generations cannot come later and break that consensus , or “ reinterpret ” the evidence .
And the fact is , there is solid consensus on the hijab of the Muslim woman .
The only thing scholars differed over was whether or not the hands and face had to be covered .
Some said it was a must to also cover the hands and face , some said it was recommended but not necessary – and they each have evidence and valid arguments , and the debate is well - known .
Only in recent times , however , have we seen people trying to claim that covering the hair is not part of Islam , and that dressing “ modestly ” is enough .
Even these people are few and far between , and they are generally people who have little knowledge of Islam .
Covering the Hair in the Qur’an
Finally , to comment on covering hair in the Qur’an .
Although there is the hadith mentioned above clarifying hijab ( covering everything except the hands and face ) , there are also details mentioned in the Qur’an .
Some ayahs to consider —
>> Ayah 1 :
“ And abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as [ was ] the display of the former times of ignorance . ” [ 33:33 ]
– Understanding this ayah requires some understanding of history .
In the “ times of ignorance , ” the women used to leave their homes dressed in a particular way .
They wore gowns that might reveal part of their lower legs and lower arms , as well as their necks and the area above the chest .
They also had a khimar ( which was very well known at the time ) draped over their heads , so part of their hair / head was covered , and part was showing [ 4 ] .
– By today ’s standards ( especially in the West ) , these women were dressed modestly !
However , Allah commands us not to display ourselves the way they were displayed .
This means the whole arm , the whole leg , the whole neck and the whole head should be covered .
It ’s not about what we think is modest – it ’s about what Allah said .
>> Ayah 2 :
“ O Prophet , tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves their jilbabs ( outer garments ) . ” [ 33:59 ]
– This ayah led many scholars to say that a woman should actually wear a jilbab / abaya which goes over her normal clothes .
>> Ayah 3 :
And tell the believing women to reduce [ some ] of their vision and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which [ necessarily ] appears thereof and to wrap [ a portion of ] their khumur ( headcovers ) over their juyoob ( chests ) and not expose their adornment except to their husbands , their fathers … ( the rest of the ayah ) … [ 24:31 ]
– This ayah contains several details of hijab , but I ’m concentrating on just the underlined part .
We can learn two things from it : 1 ) that the headcover should come down and cover the chest , as you mentioned , and 2 ) that there is a headcover !
– If you look at the ayah , it contains two different words people in our times might not be entirely familiar with : jayb ( chest area ) and khimar ( head covering ) .
Why are people ( especially those without any knowledge of Arabic ) willing to accept the translation for jayb as chest area while rejecting khimar as head cover ?
Understanding these words requires linguistic and historical knowledge .
And historically , as mentioned above , it was well known that women wore a head covering called a “ khimar , ” even before the Messenger salla Allahu alayhi wasallam was sent !
– Linguistically , as well ( even if someone does n’t have much historical knowledge ) the word “ khimar ” means head cover .
It ’s related to the word “ khamr ” in Arabic , which is wine / alcohol / any - intoxicant .
The name for alcohol is derived from the verb “ khamara , ” meaning “ he covered , hid , or concealed ” [ 5 ] .
So the intoxicant covers up the intellect , the mind , the head of its drinker , therefore it ’s called khamr .
Likewise , the khimar of a woman would logically cover her head !
I know this very last part alone would have answered your question .
However , I felt it was more a case of explaining certain principles about Islam and evidence in Islam than it was simply “ justifying ” to your co-worker why we cover our hair .
Wa Allahu a’lam .
May Allah show us the truth as truth and enable us to follow it , and may He show us falsehood as falsehood , and enable us to avoid it .
Ameen .

This is the statement of Imam al - Awza ’i , rahimahu Allah .

Evidence that consensus is a definitive proof in Islam can be found in the hadith of the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wasallam , where he said , “ My Ummah will not agree on falsehood ” [ Narrated by Ahmad , Abu Dawood and at - Tirmithi ] .
[ 4 ]
Ibn Kathir states in his tafsir , regarding ayah 33:33 , “ ‘ Tabarruj is when a woman puts a khimar on her head but does not tie it properly . ’
So her necklaces , earrings and neck , and all of that can be seen .
This is Tabarruj , and Allah addresses all the women of the believers with regard to Tabarruj . ”
[ 5 ]
The ayah in the Qur’an uses the word “ khumur , ” which is the plural of “ khimar . ”
The definition of “ khimar ” as something which covers the head can be found in Lisan al - Arab .
Steven Strogatz on math , from basic to baffling .
At this stage in the series it ’s time to shift gears , moving on from grade school arithmetic to high school math .
Over the next few weeks we ’ll be revisiting algebra , geometry and trig .
Do n’t worry if you ’ve forgotten them all — there wo n’t be any tests this time around , so instead of worrying about details , we have the luxury of concentrating on the most beautiful , important and far - reaching ideas .
Algebra , for example , may have once struck you as a dizzying mix of symbols , definitions and procedures , but in the end they all boil down to just two activities — solving for x and working with formulas .
Solving for x is detective work .
You ’re searching for an unknown number , x .
You ’ve been handed a few clues about it , either in the form of an equation like 2 x + 3 = 7 , or , less conveniently , in a convoluted verbal description of it ( as in those scary “ word problems ” ) .
In either case , the goal is to identify x from the information given .
Working with formulas , on the other hand , is a bit like art and science .
Instead of dwelling on a particular x , you ’re manipulating and massaging relationships that continue to hold , even as the numbers in them change .
These changing numbers are called “ variables , ” and they are what truly distinguishes algebra from arithmetic .
The formulas in question might express elegant patterns about numbers for their own sake .
This is where algebra meets art .
Or they might express relationships between numbers in the real world , as they do in the laws of nature for falling objects or planetary orbits or genetic frequencies in a population .
This is where algebra meets science .
This division of algebra into two grand activities is not standard ( in fact , I just made it up ) , but it seems to work pretty well .
In next week ’s column I ’ll have more to say about solving for x , so for now let ’s focus on formulas , starting with some easy examples to clarify the ideas .
One day last year , my daughter Jo realized something about her big sister Leah .
“ Dad , there ’s always a number between my age and Leah’s .
Right now I ’m 6 and Leah ’s 8 , and 7 is in the middle .
And even when we ’re old , like when I ’m 20 and she ’s 22 , there will still be a number in the middle ! ”
Jo ’s observation qualifies as algebra ( though no one but a proud father would see it that way ) because she was noticing a relationship between two ever - changing variables : her age x and Leah ’s age y .
No matter how old each of them would get , Leah would always be two years older : y = x + 2 .
Algebra is the language in which such patterns are most naturally phrased .
It takes some practice to become fluent in algebra , because it ’s loaded with what the French call “ faux amis ” — false friends that sound right in one language ( in this case , English ) but mean something horribly different when translated into another ( here , the symbols of algebra ) .
For example , suppose the length of a hallway is y when measured in yards , and f when measured in feet .
Write an equation that relates y to f .
My friend Grant Wiggins , an education consultant , has been posing this problem to students and faculty for years .
He says that in his experience , students get it wrong more than half the time , even if they have recently taken and passed an algebra course .
If you think the answer is y = 3f , welcome to the club .
It seems like such a straightforward translation of the sentence , “ One yard equals three feet . ”
But as soon as you try a few numbers , you ’ll see that this formula gets everything backwards .
Say the hallway is 10 yards long ; everyone knows that ’s 30 feet .
Yet when you plug in y = 10 and f = 30 , the formula does n’t work !
The correct formula is f = 3y .
Here 3 really means 3 feet / yard .
When you multiply it by y in yards , the units of yards cancel out and you ’re left with units of feet , as you should be .
Checking that the units cancel properly helps avoid this kind of blunder .
For example , it could have saved the Verizon customer service reps ( discussed in last week ’s column ) from confusing dollars and cents .
Another kind of formula is known as an “ identity . ”
Whenever you factored or multiplied polynomials in algebra class , you were working with identities .
You can use them now to impress your friends with numerical parlor tricks .
Here ’s one that impressed the physicist Richard Feynman , no slouch himself at mental math :
“ When I was at Los Alamos I found out that Hans Bethe was absolutely topnotch at calculating .
For example , one time we were putting some numbers into a formula , and got to 48 squared .
I reach for the Marchant calculator , and he says , ‘ That ’s 2300 . ’
I begin to push the buttons , and he says , ‘ If you want it exactly , it ’s 2304 . ’
The machine says 2304 .
‘ Gee !
That ’s pretty remarkable !’
I say .
‘ Do n’t you know how to square numbers near 50 ? ’ he says .
‘ You square 50 — that ’s 2500 — and subtract 100 times the difference of your number from 50 ( in this case it ’s 2 ) , so you have 2300 .
If you want the correction , square the difference and add it on .
That makes 2304 .’ ”
Bethe ’s trick is based on the identity
( 50 + x ) 2 = 2500 + 100x + x2 .
He had memorized that equation and was applying it for the case where x is – 2 , corresponding to the number 48 = 50 – 2 .
For an intuitive proof of this formula , imagine a square patch of carpet that measures 50 + x on each side .
Then its area is ( 50 + x ) squared , which is what we ’re looking for .
But the diagram above shows that this area is made of a 50 by 50 square ( this contributes the 2500 to the formula ) , two rectangles of dimensions 50 by x ( each contributes an area of 50x , for a combined total of 100x ) , and finally the little x by x square gives an area of x squared , the final term in Bethe ’s formula .
Relationships like these are not just for theoretical physicists .
An identity similar to Bethe ’s is relevant to anyone who has money invested in the stock market .
Suppose your portfolio drops catastrophically by 50 percent one year and then gains 50 percent the next .
Even after that dramatic recovery you ’d still be down 25 percent , because 0.5 times 1.5 equals 0.75 .
In fact , you never get back to even when you lose and gain by the same percentage in consecutive years .
With algebra we can understand why .
It follows from the identity
( 1 – x ) ( 1 + x ) = 1 – x2 .
In the down year the portfolio shrinks by a factor 1 – x ( where x = 0.5 in the example above ) , and then grows by a factor 1 + x the following year .
So the net change is a factor of
( 1 – x ) ( 1 + x )
and according to the formula above , this equals
1 – x2 .
The point is that this expression is always less than 1 , for any x other than 0 .
So you never get back to even .
Needless to say , not every relationship between variables is as straightforward as those above .
Yet the allure of algebra is seductive , and in gullible hands it spawns such silliness as a formula for the socially acceptable age difference in a romance .
According to some sites on the Internet , if your age is x , polite society will disapprove if you date someone younger than ( x / 2 ) +
7 .
In other words , it would be creepy for anyone over 82 to eye my 48 year - old wife , even if she were available .
But 81 ?
No problem .
Ick. Ick .
Ick …
NOTES :
For sticklers , Leah is actually 21 months older than Jo. Hence Jo ’s formula is only an approximation .
Obviously !
Feynman tells the story of Bethe ’s trick for squaring numbers close to 50 , in :
R. P. Feynman , “ Surely You ’re Joking , Mr. Feynman ! ” ( W.W. Norton and Company , 1985 ) , p. 193 .
The identity about the effect of equal up and down percentage swings in the stock market can be proven symbolically , by multiplying 1 + x by 1 – x , or geometrically , by drawing a diagram similar to that shown above .
If you ’re in the mood , try both approaches as an exercise .
The “ half your age plus seven ” rule about the acceptable age gap in a romantic relationship is discussed here .

Building a PDF Portfolio using Acrobat 9 ( part 2 )
Learn how to perform customizations and specialized tasks using PDF Portfolios .
By Donna Baker  July 8 , 2008 Donna Baker
Acrobat 9 takes the spirit of PDF Packages to a whole new level of visual interest and functionality — with the introduction of PDF Portfolio .
This article , Part 2 of a two - part series on Acrobat 9’s PDF Portfolio feature , looks at customizations and specialized tasks you can perform in Portfolio .
Part 1 of this series introduced you to the new PDF Portfolio , successor to PDF Packages .
In that article , I outlined several ways in which you could put PDF Portfolio to work for you , how to build the basic structure and how to make your way around the different viewing modes .
Putting together a basic PDF Portfolio is only the first step .
In this article , see how to :
Customize the appearance of the Portfolio
Work with the contents
Apply Portfolio- specific and general Acrobat commands to the contents
Designing a PDF Portfolio
The display features in PDF Portfolio are configurable , and allow you to comply with corporate or business branding requirements .
Here ’s a rundown of visual customizations available in PDF Portfolio .
In each case , click the appropriate title bar in the PDF Portfolio task pane ( Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 : Configure settings in the task pane .
Specifying layout
Acrobat Pro Extended includes four layouts that present the files using different displays .
In all cases , you can rename the files and add a description to the thumbnails ’ pages .
The default sets the content in a grid ( Figure 2 ) .
You can also use :
A background image , where you select an image and arrange the thumbnails for your component files on the image — consider using a corporate slide background or a visual from your marketing campaign as the background
Tip : Background images can be JPG , GIF or PNG files .
A revolving display , which brings one file ’s thumbnail into focus at a time — use this option for a visual display where the items are discrete , such as separate pieces of artwork
A sliding row display , where three files ’ thumbnails are shown simultaneously — use this option to display a set of sequential files , or when you want the user to have a context for individual files
Figure 2 : Specify the visual layout
Inserting display features
PDF Portfolio offers two ways to identify your company , brand or other message along with the portfolio contents .
You can insert a Welcome Page , which offers an introduction and instruction to the user .
Unfortunately , a Welcome Page is a constant element , and users may or may not view it more than once .
To use a persistent message , add a header that displays on each slide of the portfolio .
A Welcome Page allows you to use text , images and SWF files ; use combinations of text ( simple and structured ) , logos or background images to configure a Header .
Structured text options allow you to insert active email and web addresses .
Note : Although users can select an option to hide a Welcome Page for viewing , I advise you to insert some text at a minimum on the Welcome Page for ease of use .
If you are looking for a portfolio file , there ’s no way to distinguish one portfolio from another without customized content .
Otherwise , the thumbnail shows the default Acrobat icon .
Elements in the Header are configurable .
As shown in Figure 3 , each component is a separate object you can select , resize or delete .
Selecting an object displays the corresponding toolbar , such as the Email Address Text toolbar .
Figure 3 : Configure a slide header
Tip :
The text configuration options for the header options are limited to basic Sans , Serif and Typewriter fonts .
For a custom header using your specified fonts , create a header image and import it as an Image Only header .
Modifying the color scheme
Acrobat 9 Pro and Pro Extended offer multiple color schemes , as well as the opportunity to design your own palette , great for matching a corporate color scheme .
Click the Select a Color Scheme bar to display the 16 default Color Schemes and click Customize Color Scheme to open a list of the colors used in a scheme .
Click an item to open a color picker where you can choose a custom color ( Figure 4 ) .
Note :
You ca n’t import a color swatch file from a CS3 program , such as Photoshop or Illustrator , into Acrobat .
However , you can note the Hex color values and specify those values in the color picker .
Figure 4 : Specify color for Portfolio elements
Note : The Navigator — the structural framework for a PDF Portfolio — can be written and used as a corporate template .
Stay tuned to Acrobatusers.com for upcoming eSeminars and other information on coding custom Navigators .
Specialized PDF
Portfolios Acrobat 9 includes a PDF Portfolio structure for tasks like archiving e-mail .
Assemble form returns into a PDF Portfolio that includes a set of forms - specific commands .
Working with the contents
PDF Portfolio lets you customize the appearance of the project far more than was possible in the PDF Packages of old .
Even more impressive are the capabilities to display and examine the content .
Customizing the structure
Rather than using a flat sequence of portfolio files like a deck of slides , you can import folders or build them in the PDF Portfolio .
When you add content using the Add Existing Folder command , the folder and its nested content are copied into the PDF Portfolio .
If you want to incorporate multiple folders of files , either select the parent folder and import it , or add each folder individually .
Tip : Instead of working through the Portfolio window , open a Browse window , select the content you want to add and drag it to the Portfolio window .
Content is copied into the Portfolio , maintaining its hierarchy .
The folder hierarchy in a Portfolio is shown as a breadcrumb menu ( Figure 5 ) .
In the example , there are three nested folder levels within the Home view .
Examining and modifying files
Add , order and remove columns from the Details mode ( Figure 6 ) .
To add an additional column , type the name in the field in the Details pane , and select a format from the dropdown list ; the default is Text .
Figure 6 : Manipulate file data
You can use the columns in the Details mode to sort the documents in a PDF Portfolio .
The default Initial Sort is by Name in ascending order .
Sort by any of the default columns or your custom columns by choosing it from the Initial Sort list .
Decrease screen clutter by deselecting columns you do n’t need to view .
Searching PDF Portfolio documents
PDF Portfolio lets you search both PDF and non-PDF content in a Portfolio .
Search for specifics in the data included in the Details mode , as well as document contents .
Use the Search field at the upper right of the PDF Portfolio window .
You can specify some parameters from the dropdown list , but the Search Entire Portfolio option is chosen by default .
Click Search to run the command , and display the results .
The returns are highlighted according to the mode you are viewing .
For example , the file name is highlighted in Details mode ; the return is highlighted on the page in Preview mode .
Editing component files
Many types of files are editable directly from within your PDF Portfolio ( see sidebar ) .
Select the file from the Home or List views and click Preview on the Portfolio toolbar to display the file in the Preview Portfolio window .
Click Open to display a PDF file in a new Acrobat window where you have access to all the program tools and features .
Once you ’ve made changes , save the file and the new content integrates into the PDF Portfolio automatically .
If you preview a non-PDF file , you open it in its native program ; make and save changes , which integrates into the PDF Portfolio as well .
Supported file formats Files produced by OS applications , such as Notepad
Microsoft Office XP , 2003 , 2007 , 2008
Adobe CS2 and CS3 formats
Adobe formats generated by Adobe Flash , Adobe Premiere , Adobe Fireworks , and Adobe FrameMaker
AutoCAD 2007 , 2008
Applying program commands
Several commands in Acrobat are specific to PDF Portfolio , and do n’t display unless you ’re working in a Portfolio file .
You can access many program commands to apply to the Portfolio contents at large .
Any menu command active from a PDF Portfolio interface is usable with the Portfolio contents .
A Portfolio offers some specific commands , including :
Click Modify and choose Secure Portfolio with Password to specify restrictions and set a password .
Choose File > Export >
Export Multiple Files to extract the component files of your Portfolio in a specified file format and name structure .
Choose File > Portfolio Properties to open the Document Properties dialog , where you can add descriptions , specify security and so on .

United States military intelligence spied on Planned Parenthood and other domestic groups as part of US security preparations for the 2002 winter Olympics in Salt Lake City , according to a recently declassified military document obtained by a civil liberties group Thursday .
The document ( PDF – page 98 ) , drafted by a Pentagon Deputy Inspector General whose name is redacted , was included in more than 800 pages released to the Electronic Frontier Foundation as part of a Freedom of Information Act Request .
They include reports from the Pentagon ’s Intelligence Oversight Board that were submitted to the Defense Secretary from 2001 to 2007 .
ADVERTISEMENT
Referring to an incident where military intelligence personnel distributed information about FBI spying on the 2002 Olympics , the inspector general ’s office tersely remarked that an “ intelligence oversight violation occurred . ”
“ The document … contained US Persons data in referring to an reporting on organizations ( Planned Parenthood , the white supremacist group National Alliance ) and their involvement in protests and literature distribution , ” the inspector ’s office wrote .
“ Also noted was the report contained a large section labeled “ GENERAL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY . ”
Collection and dissemination of US Persons information by military intelligence assets is not allowed unless this information constitutes “ Foreign Intelligence . ”
“ The inclusion of these two sections in this intelligence product is clearly outside the purview of military intelligence assets and should be handled through law enforcement or Anti-Terrorism / Force Protection channels , ” the inspector ’s office added .
“ An inquiry into the circumstances of this violation was conducted and the result will be forwarded via separate correspondence . ”
Electronic Frontier Foundation also notes that military intelligence spied on the anti-war group Alaskans for Peace and Justice in 2005 ( pages 122-137 ) , and that NORAD had “ procedural problems ” relating to spying on “ US Persons ” ( pp. 257-258 ) .
ADVERTISEMENT
Despite a clear violation of military protocol and probable violation of US law , such reports are rarely made public .
These documents were only made public under the Freedom of Information Act and were not scheduled for release .
“ Intelligence oversight reporting is rarely disclosed to the public , ” EFF ’s Nate Cardozo noted in a posting about the documents on Thursday .
“ Much of the reported improper activity consisted of intelligence gathering on so - called “ U.S. Persons , ” including citizens , permanent residents and U.S. - based organizations , ” Cardozo added .
“ Although Defense agencies are generally prohibited from collecting such information ( except as part of foreign intelligence or counter - intelligence activity ) , it is apparent from the unredacted reports released to EFF that some DoD components have had chronic difficulty complying with that prohibition . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Wired ‘s Kim Zetter notes that the documents provide no context or background about how or why the Pentagon spied on Planned Parenthood and other groups .
“ The reports provide little context for the information that ’s disclosed , leaving the public to wonder about the nature and extent of the information and surveillance revealed in them , ” Zetter wrote .
“ Pertaining to the Planned Parenthood members , for example , the oversight report provides no explanation about how the information was collected .
Nor does it indicate why the information was collected . ”

In another possible legal violation , military officers listened into civilian cellphone calls in 2007 .
Zetter explains :
Another oversight document discusses an incident involving the interception of civilian cellphone conversations of U.S. persons in April 2007 .
During a field exercise at Fort Polk , Louisiana , a Signals Intelligence noncommissioned officer operating a SIGINT collection system intercepted the cell phone calls , though the document does n’t indicate if they were intercepted on U.S. soil or outside U.S. borders .
Initial reports indicated that the officer listened to the conversations for entertainment purposes , and the incident was reported to the National Security Agency .
But the inspector - general document indicates that the officer never admitted to this and indicates only that he may have listened to some conversations “ longer than necessary to do his job . ”
Electronic Frontier Foundation has more analysis and details of the newly released documents here .
The blockade of Gaza has not weakened Hamas , Mr Holmes said The UN's top humanitarian official , John Holmes , has criticised Israel for linking the 2006 capture of an Israeli soldier to the blockade of Gaza .
Mr Holmes also said Israeli actions in East Jerusalem and the West Bank , including expanding settlements , was counter to the peace process .
He urged a relaxation of the blockade , warning Gaza was " de - developing " .
It came as Israel ordered the army to seal off the West Bank for 48 hours until midnight on Saturday .
An army spokesman said the move had been made because of heightened tensions in Jerusalem .
Meanwhile , Israeli aircraft hit two targets in southern Gaza Strip early on Friday .
Witnesses reported seeing several injured people .
The developments follow a visit to Israel and the West Bank by US Vice - President Joe Biden , during which the US and Palestinians criticised Israel 's plans to build more Jewish homes in the Arab east of the city .
' Gangster economy '
The Israeli soldier , Gilad Shalit , was captured by Palestinian militants nearly four years ago near the border with Gaza .
Mr Holmes , of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs , was speaking at the UN after visiting Israel and the Palestinian territories earlier this month .
" Obviously we 've called for the release of Cpl Shalit , and that he should be treated in accordance to the Geneva conventions , " Mr Holmes said .
" But the link between that and the fate of 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza does not seem to us a reasonable one . "
He said the blockade of Gaza had not weakened Hamas , the militant Islamist movement which controls the territory .
Has US - Israel friendship soured ?
Can the US broker peace ?
An Israeli settlement in close - up Mr Holmes told journalists there had been some progress : the Israelis had allowed into Gaza goods such as glass to fix broken windows .
But , he said , in general Gaza was being pushed backwards , or " de - developing " , because it was not possible to repair war damage and revive the economy .
Mr Holmes said the situation in Gaza was so bad that even though smuggling tunnels to Egypt were fostering a " gangster economy " , the situation would become unsustainable if they were blocked .
The tunnels are a conduit for badly needed commercial goods , including food and medicine , but are also widely believed to be used for smuggling cash and weapons to Hamas .
Egypt , which helps maintain the blockade and opens its border with Gaza only occasionally , is reinforcing its Gaza border barrier with underground metal plates in an attempt to block the tunnels .
The UN and a number of international humanitarian groups warned in January that the blockade was putting residents ' health at risk , the UN and aid groups have warned .
Israel and Egypt deny entry to all but basic humanitarian supplies , in order to prevent Gaza 's Hamas rulers firing rockets at Israel , they say .
Mr Holmes spoke as Mr Biden was winding down his trip to the Middle East , the highest ranking Obama administration official yet to go to Israel and the West Bank .
' No better friend '
On Tuesday , the Israeli interior ministry said that the Jerusalem authorities had approved the expansion of Jewish homes in East Jerusalem .
Mr Biden said the decision " undermined the trust required for productive negotiations " and warranted his unequivocal condemnation .
But he also said the United States had " no better friend than Israel " and urged peace talks to resume without delay .
Close to 500,000
Jews live in more than 100 settlements built since Israel 's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
They are illegal under international law , although Israel disputes this .

Advertisement Nato - led forces say they are making good progress hours after launching the biggest offensive in Afghanistan since the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001 .
There were clashes as more than 15,000 US , UK and Afghan troops swept into the Helmand districts of Marjah and Nad Ali in a bid to secure government control .
An Afghan commander said 20 militants had been killed .
Two Nato soldiers , one of which was British , have also died .
A Taliban commander reportedly said his men were retreating to spare civilians .
Operation Moshtarak - which means " together " in the local Dari language - is being led by 4,000 US Marines , supported by 4,000 British troops , with Canadians , Danes and Estonians .
' Heavily booby - trapped '
The BBC's Frank Gardner , with Nato forces at Kandahar airbase , says the test of the operation 's success will not be on the battlefield .
AT THE SCENE Ian Pannell
BBC News , Nad Ali
It 's been a very successful day for British forces .
They were able to move into several key villages and establish a foothold .
Broadly speaking , they met little resistance .
There was sporadic gunfire .
One RPG was fired over the location where we are based .
It 's fair to say that the Taliban decided to move out of the district .
Many civilians have also left , and the challenge in the coming days and weeks is to persuade them to come back , to establish meaningful security and then allow meaningful governance to take place .
What will make a difference is if there is meaningful security established and if the local people feel confident enough to place their faith in local security forces .
This is an operation that has only just begun and it will take weeks and months before we know how successful it has been .
Operation Moshtarak : Diary
It all depends on whether the coalition can hold the ground and bring lasting security and good governance to the population of central Helmand .
A spokesman for Nato's Isaf force confirmed to the BBC that two soldiers had been killed in Operation Moshtarak .
British forces said a soldier from the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards had been killed by an explosion in Nad Ali .
A second Nato soldier was killed by small - arms fire .
Three US soldiers were also killed by an IED , Nato said , although it is not clear whether they were part of Operation Moshtarak .
Mohammad Zazai , commander of Afghan troops in the operation , said : " So far , we have killed 20 armed opposition fighters .
Eleven others have been detained . "
The casualties and captures were in separate incidents .
Troops have been advancing carefully , picking their way through poppy fields , trying not to set off Taliban bombs .
A canal bridge into Marjah was so rigged with explosives that US Marines had to erect temporary crossings to reach the town , reports the Associated Press .
Helmand Governor Gulab Mangal told a news conference the Taliban had " heavily booby - trapped the area " .
Marjah resident Abdul Wahaab told AFP by telephone as he and his family left the town : " We were sleeping when all of a sudden we heard this horrible noise - it was helicopters bringing in soldiers .
" As we were crossing the village we saw US and Afghan soldiers on the junctions .
There were lots of them . "
Afghan President Hamid Karzai , who approved Operation Moshtarak , warned troops to avoid civilian casualties , and called on Taliban fighters to lay down their weapons .
Nato says Marjah is home to the biggest community under insurgent control in the south .
' On the hop '
It was estimated there were between 400 and 1,000 militants based there before Operation Moshtarak was launched .
MARJAH : 'TALIBAN STRONGHOLD '
Town and district about 40 km ( 25 miles ) south - west of Lashkar Gah Lies in Helmand 's ' Green Zone ' - an irrigated area of lush vegetation and farmland Last remaining major Taliban stronghold in southern Helmand Area considered a centre for assembling roadside bombs
Key supply centre for opium poppies - lucrative revenue source for Taliban Estimates of Taliban numbers range up to 1,000 Population of Marjah town put at 80,000 while the whole of Marjah district is thought to have 125,000
Who are the Taliban ?
Conflict reaches critical juncture Details on Operation Moshtarak Marjah has also long been regarded as a linchpin of the lucrative network for smuggling opium - the raw ingredient used to make heroin - harvested from Helmand 's poppy fields .
Nato Commander Maj Gen Nick Carter told the BBC that " it would appear that we 've caught the insurgents on the hop " .
Later at a Ministry of Defence briefing in London , Maj Gen Gordon Messenger said the UK force of more than 1,000 troops in the initial Marjah operation had secured its " key objectives " at the start of Operation Moshtarak .
He said : " There 's no complacency - everyone understands this is the easy bit .
The hard bit is what comes next in reassuring the public .
" This is all about winning the allegiance of the population .
The allegiance is not won in a day , it must be won over time . "
The offensive began with waves of helicopters ferrying US Marines into Marjah in the early hours of Saturday .
British troops then flew into Nad Ali district , to the north , followed by tanks and combat units .
HAVE YOUR SAY
We have little choice .
We pull out , Pakistan falls .
This is the era of the new domino theory .
David Cheshire , Dorset , UK Send us your comments Jets and helicopters fired missiles at Taliban positions .
The BBC's Ian Pannell in Nad Ali says the vast majority of villagers seem to have left the area to avoid getting caught in crossfire between the Taliban and Nato troops .
Mullah Mohammed - a Taliban commander in Marjah - told ABC
News that his men were pulling back to spare any civilian casualties .
" We found civilians in massive danger so we decided to go backward just to save villagers ' lives , " he said .
His claim can not be verified .
Nato had distributed leaflets in the Marjah area warning of the planned offensive in a bid to limit civilian casualties .
It is the first major offensive since US President Barack Obama ordered a " surge " of 30,000 extra troops to Afghanistan in December .
More than 1,900 Afghan police will provide support after the initial military operations end , and a large team of Afghan administrators has been assembled .
The operation is part of an effort to secure a 320 - km ( 200 - mile ) horseshoe - shaped string of towns that runs along the Helmand River , through Kandahar and on to the Pakistani border .
The area holds 85 % of the population of Kandahar and Helmand .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - People leave more than fingerprints when they touch stuff -- they also deposit a tell - tale trail of germs that could help investigators solve crimes , U.S. researchers reported on Monday .

They were able to map a unique bacterial genetic signature left by nine different people , and said this germy DNA lasted though day - to - day temperature changes , humidity and sunlight .
“ Each one of us leaves a unique trail of bugs behind as we travel through our daily lives , ” Noah Fierer , a researcher at the University of Colorado at Boulder who led the study , said in a statement .
“ While this project is still in its preliminary stages , we think the technique could eventually become a valuable new item in the toolbox of forensic scientists , ” he said .
Researchers have been learning that people are colonized with billions of microbes , both inside and on the body .
And studies have shown that these colonies are unique to the individual and even to the place on the body .
Fierer ’s team wanted to see how much of a trail might be left by these mostly benign bacteria .
So they swabbed the computer keyboards of volunteers to show that indeed , each person left not only a trail of unique bacteria , but one that lasted .
In each case , they could show the DNA from the keyboards and computer mice more closely matched DNA from germs on the hands of the owners than they did anybody else ’s hands .
The technique was about 70 to 90 percent accurate , Fierer ’s team reported the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The University of Colorado team had previously found that a typical person carries about 150 bacterial species on the hands , and that any two given people only share about 13 percent of these different species .
“ The obvious question then was whether we could identify objects that have been touched by particular individuals , ” Fierer said .
They also left the bacteria out in the open for two weeks to see if they would break down , but they did not .
“ That finding was a real surprise to us , ” said Fierer .
“ We did n’t know just how hardy these creatures were . ”
The researchers were able to do the study because of rapid advances in techniques and equipment for sequencing DNA .
A larger project is under way to sequence all the DNA in the human “ microbiome ” -- the collection of bugs that live on the skin , in the nose , hair , ears and digestive tract .
These organisms help digest and metabolize food and may affect skin conditions .
And unlike non-native disease - causing germs , they are not dislodged by standard hygiene .
“ Palm surface bacterial communities recover within hours after hand washing , ” the researchers wrote .

An Overland Park church leader who has been trying to rally Johnson County pastors to get involved in political issues is getting help this week from the Rev. Jerry Falwell .
The Rev. Jerry Johnston will join Falwell in urging Christian leaders across the Kansas City area to mobilize their congregations ahead of the Nov. 2 general election .
Johnston , pastor of the 3,000 - member First Family Church , said he decided earlier this year to get more involved in state politics after the Kansas Legislature rejected an amendment to the state constitution banning same - sex marriage .
“ A pastor who really believes in being salt and light should be ministering to his representatives and senators , ” Johnston said .
“ He should know them . ”
Falwell plans to speak at Johnston ’s church tonight ; then the two pastors will conduct “ pastor policy briefings ” all day Thursday at three locations in the Kansas City area and one in Wichita .
“ I am going to try to motivate the pastors to do something , to not be silent and to become engaged in a long - term process , ” Johnston said .
“ The big deal is getting people informed , targeting the 50 percent of the evangelical vote that is not voting . ”
Organizers of the Falwell event will hand out DVDs containing information on where various candidates stand on issues important to “ people of faith , ” including abortion , same - sex marriage and home schooling .
The DVD will include the views of Democratic Rep. Dennis Moore , who is facing Republican Kris Kobach in Kansas ’ 3rd Congressional District .
Kobach , a law professor who will join Falwell and Johnston in their visits to area churches , taped his responses to questions a few weeks ago at a candidate forum at Johnston ’s church .
Moore could not attend that forum and is submitting written responses .
Johnston said Kobach ’s appearance with the two ministers was because of the candidate ’s expertise on constitutional issues and had nothing to do with the congressional race — even though Kobach has campaigned heavily against abortion and gay marriage .
“ I wish Dennis would come , ” Johnston said .
“ I ’d love to have him .
I ’d love to have him talk about his voting record and how it contrasts with Kris .
That would be awesome . ”
But Moore campaign manager Julie Merz said Moore disagreed with some of Falwell ’s political positions and probably would n’t have accepted an invitation to appear with him .
Johnston said comments also were being sought from Missouri gubernatorial candidates Matt Blunt , a Republican , and Democrat Claire McCaskill , as well as from candidates for the state ’s 5th Congressional District .
Groups across the country are raising questions about the legality of ministers such as Falwell and Johnston using their pulpits to support political candidates and causes .
At issue is whether the churches are violating their tax - exempt status by politicking .
by Brett Stevens on March 18 , 2009
First , you let the native population dumb themselves down with television , beer , moronic jobs , political lies and stupefactive small talk .
Next , you import random people because they work cheaply , and thus make the native population absolutely hate them :
Preliminary results show that people – especially in Oakland ’s ethnic neighborhoods – want bustling neighborhoods with services that remind them of their native land .
Residents in the heavily Latino Fruitvale district enjoy the pedestrian - friendly International Boulevard , where sidewalk vendors sell everything from tacos to toys .
In Chinatown , residents say they like the elbow - to - elbow crush of people on the sidewalks shopping at produce stores and other shops , and they like the cacophony of cars and bicycles because it reminds them of big -city life in China .
The bottom line , Lemon said , is that Oakland and other cities need to get beyond one - size - fits - all city planning and architecture and pay heed to individual neighborhood needs .
“ I wanted to find out if Hispanics , Chinese , African Americans or Caucasians prefer different types of space , ” Lemon said .
“ Would a city ’s resources be better used designing a picturesque park or put into a better streetscape or fields for soccer or football ?
It ’s more than an academic exercise . ”
SFG
Then , you make the native population feel guilty for reacting , and encourage reconciliation that always puts them in the wrong :
Bowman lacks academic credibility on race issues and media / games , yet many gamers have wholeheartedly embraced his uninformed opinion despite the existence of knowledgeable commentary from anti-racist gamers and people from within the industry who have been critical of Resident Evil 5 .
Why ?
Because Bowman tells them what they want to hear , and doesnâ€™t challenge their views .
Youâ€™d be hard - pressed to find mature , critical discussion about race and Resident Evil 5 taking place in mainstream gaming communities .
Racialicious
( They are complaining about a video game that opens with a sequence set in Africa where , not surprisingly , you kill Africans , before moving on to kill Caucasians , Asians and people of indeterminate heritage in other parts of the game .
They do n’t find it racist that for all these years we ’ve been killing white people in games . )
The result : the only culture in common is a lowest common denominator comprised of commerce and individualism .
That culture becomes egomaniac :
These days , “ narcissist ” gets tossed around as an all - purpose insult , a description of self - aggrandizing , obnoxious behavior .
Unfortunately , the same word is used to describe a quality that comes in three gradations : a characteristic that in the right amount is a normal component of healthy ego ; a troublesome trait when there is too much ; and a pathological state when it overwhelms a personality .
Narcissism fuels drive and ambition , a desire to be recognized for one ’s accomplishments , a sense that one ’s life has meaning and importance .
The problem occurs when narcissism becomes the primary principle of someone ’s personality .
Its most extreme form is narcissistic personality disorder , a psychological condition that impairs a person ’s ability to form normal relationships and wreaks havoc on those who have close encounters with it .
A recent study titled “ Leader Emergence : The Case of the Narcissistic Leader ” describes how narcissists have skills and qualitiesâ€ ” confidence , extraversion , a desire for powerâ€ ” that propel them into leadership roles but that when true narcissists are in charge , other aspects of their makeupâ€ ” a feeling the rules do n’t apply to them , a need for constant strokingâ€ ” can have “ disastrous consequences . ”
Yes , we ’re talking about you , former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich .
After Blagojevich was caught on tape trying to sell a Senate seat , he reveled in the opportunity to appear on talk shows , making the case that he himself was a victimâ € ” self - pity being a favorite narcissist refuge .
NPD is one of fewer than a dozen personality disorders described by the American Psychiatric Association .
These differ from the major mental illnesses , such as schizophrenia and manic - depression , which are believed to have a biological origin .
Personality disorders are seen as a failure of character development .
People with NPD act as if they are special beings who are exceptionally intelligent , accomplished , beautiful , or sexy ( or all of the above ) , to whom lesser people ( pretty much everyone else ) must bow .
Psychologists Jean Twenge and W. Keith Campbell , authors of The Narcissism Epidemic , who obviously have a stake in proving there is one , estimate around 10 percent of today ’s young people have clinical manifestations of NPD .
They believe narcissism is a cultural virus that has spread throughout the population over the past several decades .
Slate
As a result , it cannot hold itself to any standard .
People do not trust people .
They cannot follow through on any task not involving themselves wholly .
The family breaks down , and the nation plunges into a third world population ( that is also and coincidentally of uniformly mixed - race , or a generic population ) :
More babies were born in the United States in 2007 than any other year in the nation ’s history â€ ” and a wedding band made increasingly little difference in the matter .
While it shows the U.S. population is more than replacing itself , a healthy trend , the teen birth rate was up for a second year in a row .
The birth rate rose slightly for women of all ages , and births to unwed mothers reached an all - time high of about 40 percent , continuing a trend that started years ago .
More than three - quarters of these women were 20 or older .
The new numbers suggest the second year of a baby boomlet , with U.S. fertility rates higher in every racial group , the highest among Hispanic women .
On average , a U.S. woman has 2.1 babies in her lifetime .
That ’s the “ magic number ” required for a population to replace itself .
Seattle Times
It ’s a shame , but that ’s how nations fail .
No matter what political system you have , unless you have morally aware and smart people in it , it gets co-opted by the corrupt .
No matter how much power you have , unless there are people with brains and souls , you get corrupted .
This could easily be reversed by making social values prize a single consensus among our society , and by encouraging people to shun the morally defective or oblivious .
Maybe they ’d all move to one of the good times capitals of the third world , where such behavior is expected .

Among healthy fats , the " omegas " are probably the most studied .
These families of essential fatty acids include omega - 3 , omega - 6 and omega - 9 .
These EFA ’s provide support for numerous bodily functions , including the cardiovascular , reproductive , immune and nervous systems . .
The real deal : omegas
Both the omega - 3s ( in sources such as flaxseed oil , fatty fish , walnuts and pumpkin seeds ) and the “ good ” omega - 6 sources ( such as borage and evening primrose oil ) contain the essential fatty acids your body needs but ca n’t produce on its own .
For that reason , they must be taken through food or supplementation . .
Current research indicates that the omega 3s have therapeutic benefits in reducing high tryglicerides , lowering hypertension , regulating irregular heart beat as well as assisting in learning disorders , infant brain development and menopausal discomforts .
Certain of the omega 6s are outstanding for improving diabetic neuropathy , rheumatoid arthritis , PMS and skin disorders ( such as psoriasis and eczema ) as well as helping aid in cancer treatment .
In addition to the omega 3s and 6s , there are also omega 9s .
Although not considered essential , omega 9s provide substantial health benefits and should still be an intricate part of your dietary lifestyle because of their monounsaturated oleic acid content .
Monounsaturated oleic acid plays a protective role in lowering heart attack risk and protecting arterial cholesterol build - up .
It is also believed to assist in cancer prevention .
Olive oil , avocados and various nuts ( like peanuts , almonds and macadamias ) are rich omega - 9 sources .
Here ’s how the omegas work .
Alpha linolenic acid is the principal essential fatty acid in the omega - 3 family and linoleic acid takes the lead in the omega - 6 series .
In a healthy body with sound nutrition , various metabolic conversions take place transferring the raw dietary materials into usable , biologically potent EFAs .
The alpha linolenic acid is transformed into eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and later into docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) .
The omega - 6 linoleic acid converts to gamma linolenic acid ( GLA ) .
Both the EPA and the GLA synthesized from dietary sources undergo another conversion , resulting in hormone - like biochemical compounds know as eicosanoids .
These remarkable substances aid in virtually every body activity , from vital organ functioning down to intracellular processes .
Today , most popular literature suggests that “ we get too much omega - 6 ” and should therefore focus on the omega - 3s .
It is true that the typical North American diet already contains an excess of the omega - 6 linoleic acid obtained through many of the cooking oils and pre-packaged foods we eat on a regular basis .
However , as with many things in life , the process of converting linoleic acid into beneficial GLA does n’t always go as planned .
Several metabolic roadblocks often hinder the conversion process of creating GLA .
Environmental factors ( such as pollution ) along with aging , daily stress , smoking , viral infections and other illnesses ( like diabetes ) get in the way .
And , according to current research , diets rich in sugar , trans fats ( like those found in margarine and processed foods ) and alcohol can also block the critical process of creating GLA .
Since these impediments to healthy GLA production are so common in the North American population today , it is safe to say that most of us are deficient in GLA , even though we get lots of omega - 6 linoleic acid .
Eliminating these factors whenever possible helps your body reap the numerous benefits of the amazing omega oils .
The easiest place to start is in reducing or even omitting sugar , trans fats and alcohol .
You might also consider supplementing with rich sources of preformed GLA as well as EPA and DHA .
Stay tuned for part 3 next month !

For The Love Of Cake opened in January by Adam Finlay and Genevieve Griffin .
This Liberty Village newbie is a veritable shrine to the cupcake .
Baking up to a dozen varieties daily , there 's everything from classic Red Velvet to the more unexpected Japanese Ginger and Salted Caramel , yet my eye is immediately drawn to the mancakes display .
Large cupcakes with the bold mission statement " to make cupcakes less girly by using man- worthy ingredients like beer , whiskey and bacon " , they come in such chest beating flavors as Stout Spice , Guinness Chocolate ( above ) and patriotic Maple Bacon ( all cupcakes and mancakes $ 3.00 ) .
OK , fine .
But I 've seen fancy cupcakery before .
What makes these micro morsels any different ?
Griffin ( who holds the wonderful title Master of Confectionery Arts ) tries to assuage my fears .
She explains most cupcakes are either a chocolate or vanilla base that 's simply colored then topped with flavored frosting .
What makes her cupcakes different is that each cake is individually made , so her lemon cupcake is actually a lemon cake topped with lemon frosting .
Alright I admit , I 'm intrigued .
But Griffin 's just warming up .
In an effort to set her product apart from the gooey pack she 's created , wait for it , the Four Dimensional Cupcake (!)
No , cupcakes are n't expanding into alternate dimensions , they just now come with filling .
Griffin stuffs her cupcakes with homemade custards , preserves , creams and ganaches .
I 'm now officially peckish - I want to believe .
It 's an icy winter night and the Guinness Chocolate seems like a good place to renew my faith .
The mancake is a chocolate base flavored with the famous stout , filled with an Irish whiskey ganache and topped with cream cheese frosting .
Phew !
As I take my first bite into the fourth dimension I know this is no ordinary cupcake .
The base is moist and rich , almost like pudding .
It 's a mature , complex mouthful , more bitter than sweet .
Then I hit the ganache .
A rich goo with unmistakable whiskey tones that almost acts as a sauce , this mancake 's getting better with each bite , and I have n't even reached the frosting .
When I do by the third happy mouthful I see the light .
Like a triumphant third act tying everything together , the cream cheese is silky smooth with a subtle , refreshing tang that offsets the dense chocolate and rich ganache .
For a brief moment all the elements waltz over my tingling taste buds , and I 'm gob - smacked by how many flavors and textures have been worked into something so small .
Another moment and it's gone .
I 'm back from the fourth dimension , a little giddy and with a yearning for more .
For The Love of Cake has made a believer out of me , and with two dozen other flavors to try I 've got a lot of time to make up for .
The cupcake is not dead , long live the cupcake .
Interview with David Pearce by Nanoaging / Jonathan Despres
Tell us about yourself .
What is your background , and what current projects are you involved in ?
My main interest is the use of biotechnology to abolish suffering .
In a sense , the abolitionist project is an almost trivial consequence of Bentham plus biotech .
Alas the abolition of suffering in humans - let alone throughout the living world - strikes most people as utopian fantasy .
So in 1995 , I wrote a manifesto ( The Hedonistic Imperative ) outlining a blueprint of how it might happen .
I predict our descendants will enjoy genetically pre-programmed well - being that 's orders of magnitude richer than anything accessible today .
Background ?
British philosopher - though of course one need n't be a utilitarian ethicist to advocate a cruelty - free world .
I 'm also a third - generation vegetarian / vegan .
For as long as I can remember , I 've had a horror of suffering of any kind .
However , it 's frustrating that the tender - minded people who care most about suffering are often least prepared for the intellectual tough - mindedness needed to confront its biological roots .
My own interest in nanotechnology is slightly unusual .
It stems from the potential use of nanotech to extend the abolitionist project beyond narrow species self - interest .
In humans , at least , the impending reproductive revolution of " designer babies " should ensure that our nastier genes are weeded out of the genome .
Any predisposition to depression , anxiety disorders and malaise is likely to disappear through the quasi-rational choices of prospective parents .
Less intuitively , market economics if not moral compassion may lead to global veganism .
As we develop single - celled protein technologies , the advent of ultra-cheap , scalable , delicious designer vatfood should ensure the factory farming industry undergoes world - wide collapse - or at least converts to alternatives that do n't involve today 's animal holocaust .
Yet that 's not enough .
The abolition of suffering in all sentient life will entail a more far - reaching approach .
Completion of the abolitionist project on earth calls for genomic rewrites , depot contraception and comprehensive ecosystem redesign .
This kind of mega - project demands nanorobotics - and computational resources applied on a scale we probably wo n't witness in our lifetime .
Technofantasy ?
Quite possibly .
Perhaps we 'll opt to conserve the nasty side of life for ever .
But if you think minimising suffering is a good idea - and bioscience holds the answers - then web - based campaigning to win hearts and minds is a rational strategy .
The technical obstacles to a cruelty - free world are probably less formidable than bioconservative prejudice .
Thus for the past decade I 've run BLTC Research as a vehicle to promote an abolitionist agenda .
In 1998 , I co-founded - with Swedish - born philosopher Nick Bostrom - the World Transhumanist Association .
I 'm also a founder of the Abolitionist Society ; and a member of the Immortality Institute and the Life Extension Foundation .
Wearing my most sober hat , I serve on the editorial review board of Medical Hypotheses .
I also run a web hosting firm that aims to encourage compassionate technophobes - humanist , transhumanist and traditional animal welfarist - to develop a strong online presence .
But my main focus is exploring technologies to alleviate mental pain .
It 's not that I do n't find all sorts of stuff intellectually interesting - I 've written a lot on psychopharmacology , the philosophy of mind , intelligence - amplification and paradise - engineering .
I think the future of life in the universe is unimaginably wonderful .
Yet of all the revolutionary scenarios that futurists discuss , the abolition of suffering is perhaps the least conceptually exciting and ( I believe ) the most morally urgent .
What are your goals for the next decade ?
I 'd like to understand more about the molecular substrates of emotion - and in particular , the ( hypothetical ) final common pathway of pleasure in the brain .
Why does this matter ?
In this context , three reasons .
First , the most common objection one hears to the prospect of living indefinitely is that immortality would be boring .
This is surely a misconception .
Once we 've gained mastery of our emotions , each moment of our extended lives can be more exhilarating than is even physiologically possible at present .
This does n't mean that quasi-immortals will find everything indiscriminately interesting - any more than a genetic predisposition to lifelong bliss will ensure we 'll be uniformly happy .
Intellectual discernment can be retained because the functional analogues of boredom and dissatisfaction can be conserved in the form of informational sensitivity to gradients of interest .
So perhaps some aspects of quasi-immortal life will merely be fascinating .
But our future baseline of mental health can be higher than today 's peak experiences .
Second , a better understanding of the substrates of emotion will lead to more effective treatment of mood disorders .
Some of us may want unlimited life .
But we should n't forget that there are many millions of depressive people for whom time hangs heavy , and for whom life seems too long .
We 've a responsibility to help them flourish too .
Bioscience can create valuable experiences on a prodigious scale for everyone .
A third reason why decoding the molecular machinery of emotion is potentially so important is less obvious .
Indirectly , it should allow the study of consciousness to become an experimental discipline .
Today we normally divide our awareness into waking and dreaming consciousness .
It 's easy to assume these are the sole templates of existence .
Yet waking and dreaming consciousness are just two minor varieties in a vast taxonomy of sentience that we 've barely begun to explore .
Unfortunately - although I have immense respect for Dr Alexander Shulgin - I do n't think one can ethically advocate use of the pharmacological tools needed to investigate this alien state - space until we 've gained control over our core Darwinian emotions .
But once our palette of feelings can be modulated at will , the intellectual payoff will be epoch - making too .
Here 's just one illustration .
On certain mind - altering drugs , a few minutes can subjectively seem like an eternity .
Posterity 's control of the neurochemistry of time perception should allow our descendants to live subjectively as long as they choose every day of their lives .
Post - humans wo n't apprehend time in the manner of their primate ancestors .
When do you think we will achieve real life extension ?
In a modest way , it 's probably feasible now .
This is n't obvious because we 're currently seeing a “ rectangularisation ” of the morbidity and mortality curve .
No one 's got close to Jeanne Calment 's record 122 years - and she died in 1997 [ But see The Calment Case .
Note added Dec. 2018 ] .
In theory , practising a brutal 40 % caloric restriction - together with a healthy lifestyle and optimal nutrition - should increase maximum human lifespan by perhaps 20 - 30 % ( ? ) .
One might consider taking a selective MAO - b inhibitor as well - and mood - brighteners to combat the grouchiness that comes from feeling chronically hungry .
Also , drugs that mimic the effects of dietary restriction without the need for heroic self - denial are in the pipeline .
However , this is all lame , sticking - plaster stuff .
Serious gene therapies that radically extend lifespan are probably a couple of decades or more away .
And adequately controlled trials in humans obviously pose a problem .
More optimistically , visionary scientist Ray Kurzweil recently wrote a book with the title : How To Live Long Enough to Live Forever .
I hope he 's right .
Perhaps we really can bootstrap our way to immortality as fast as he anticipates .
Ray Kurzweil has certainly done as much as anyone to spell out the implications of exponential growth in computing power .
But I fear we 'll miss the boat by several decades at least , possibly centuries - unless we resort to cryonics .
Even if we do n't make it , anti-aging research is still worth pursuing energetically so that future ( post - ) humans do n't suffer the ravages of senescence and death in the way we do .
Talk of " healthy aging " etc. , is a contradiction in terms .
Recall the huge controversy a year ago after a deaf couple consulted a clinical geneticist with the intention of having a deaf child .
One understands their reasons , but most people were appalled : it 's no disrespect to anybody with hearing difficulties to say that sensory deficits are better cured than perpetuated .
Yet almost everyone thinks it 's morally acceptable to have children who'll be born with the lethal hereditary disorder called aging - not to mention a multitude of other " natural " pathologies .
Presumably this attitude will change as the relevant germline therapies mature .
Do you believe in Cryonics and if so when will it succeed ?
Yes , I think it 's feasible .
But there are many pitfalls .
Here are just two .
To have a realistic chance of being reanimated , it 's no good waiting for hours or more after conventional brain - death to be frozen / vitrified .
All sorts of horrendous cellular damage can in principle be repaired ; but not the [ effectively ] irreversible information loss that ensues from this sort of neural catastrophe .
It 's also extremely reckless to wait until your dotage before cryosuspension - for a similar reason .
But if at the age of a notionally " healthy " 60 years old , say , you could opt to be frozen / vitrified under ideal medical conditions , then you might be reanimated by your grandchildren later this century - or , if you want to live indefinitely , at a later date when true " negligible senescence " is feasible .
Unfortunately , the cryosuspension of unambiguously alive human beings is currently unlawful .
Anyone assisting the process would be charged with murder - a charge that might more appropriately be reversed .
So vigorous political lobbying is needed to change the present medico - legal framework .
Or alternatively , find a cryonics - friendly country .
One stable little island would be enough .
Another problem is that we 're social primates .
Our personal identity is intimately bound up with our social roles - teacher , mother , husband , daughter , etc .
Our self - identity is also more - or - less inseparable from our particular language , culture , traditional perceptual modules and medium of consciousness .
If we were resuscitated more than a few decades hence , then we might wake up effectively psychotic .
Yes , an advanced civilisation could presumably cure this psychosis .
But in order to adapt to the new era , you 'd have to turn into something fundamentally different - which arguably defeats the purpose of resurrection .
I guess I 'm curious enough to take the risk .
Why is n't the science of cryonics progressing at a rate commensurate to other sciences ?
Progress is slow because until recently cryonics has been stuck in Crank Alley .
Even now , most scientists and policymakers do n't take it seriously .
Cryonics needs to be promoted to a mainstream biomedical science - with institutional funding , educational curriculum and social support structures to match .
Which path should we take for immortalism , nanomedicine or biogerontology or ... ?
In the long run , I think our species will rewrite its own genetic code so that eternal youth is genetically preprogrammed .
Nanomedicine and biogerontology will be most relevant for sick oldsters on the eve of the great transition .
Perhaps nanomedicine will be needed indefinitely - I do n't know .
A methodological revolution will be essential , too , if we 're to overcome the difficulty of conducting controlled ( post - ) human clinical trials on any sensible timeframe .
Mature quantum computing should allow simulations to be run on a scale that strains the imagination ; but even utopian technology is n't magic .
What 's the best route to superlongevity for humans alive today ?
Well , if there 's any sense to the notion of enduring personal identity over time , then it clearly does n't reside in our particular physical constituents but rather in their patterns .
The half - life of a typical protein in the brain is perhaps 12 days .
So if you want your kind of pattern to be recreated and then sustained indefinitely , perhaps use a wearable videocam , write , talk and leave a large digital footprint and there 's a fair chance that an advanced civilisation will have the computational resources to re-create you - or something like you - on the basis of your cryopreserved brain .
Whether or not they would want to , or consider it ethical to do so , is another story .
And of course some futurists wonder why bother with a mouldy old brain at all when you could be digitised and implemented in silicon instead .
Maybe if we understood phenomenal consciousness , then this would n't be a problem - at least when scanning technology improves .
I confess I 'm more cautious - even neuroconservative !
Let 's say , for example , you 're the kind of micro-functionalist who thinks unitary consciousness depends on quantum coherence in the neural microtubules .
If so , then there are real difficulties in using an inorganic computer with a classical architecture for anything more ontologically ambitious than simulations , backups and prostheses .
Actually I 'm dodging all sorts of issues of personal ( non -) identity here as well .
In what sense does the here - and - now of a phenomenal self at one spatio - temporal location belong to the same entity as a discontinuous here - and - now with different coordinates ?
Maybe belief in an enduring metaphysical ego is just an adaptive delusion that has helped our species conquer the planet .
It helps our genes leave more copies of themselves .
But there 's no evidence it 's true - even if our conceptual scheme and linguistic practices assume it .
What first attracted you to the idea of physical immortality ?
The usual reason : fear of growing old and dying .
When I was still at primary school , I recall dreaming I was going to find a cure for the aging process - by the age of eighteen .
[ Somewhere I 'd picked up the factoid that we lose 2,000 neurons a day after turning eighteen - after which it was downhill all the way . ]
I hoped to rescue the rest of the higher vertebrates too - and agonised about the species cut - off point for a post - aging world .
As a teenager , I read Robert Ettinger 's classic The Prospect of Immortality and concluded cryonics was personally a more realistic option - with a twist .
The saddest day in my brother 's life was when his guinea - pig died shortly after giving birth .
I recall I wanted to preserve her in the freezer for future reanimation - an idea vetoed by my mother .
Yes , it sounds comical today ; but it 's easy to forget what heartache a pet 's death can cause .
Naturally , the ideas of my ancestral namesake were naive .
But I 'm still troubled by an obvious analogy .
I would n't now choose to recreate the disturbed and dysfunctional little six - year old who wanted to live for ever .
Will our post - human ( god- like ? ) successors want to resurrect small - minded primitives from a vanished era ?
How likely are we to transcend the horrors of our Darwinian past and then decide to recreate them ?
Over the next few centuries , we 're probably going to achieve physical , emotional and intellectual super - health .
I think suffering itself may be abolished .
Why resurrect an ugly chrysalis when you 've become a beautiful butterfly ?
So if you 're really intent on reanimation , I 'd put more faith in your grandchildren - their actions if not their judgement - than in our post - human descendants .
Either way , perhaps there 's an important sense in which you 're never going to disappear .
Delving into the realm of scientific metaphysics , theorists speculate that there are ( at the very least ) googols of type - identical copies of you in existence - some theoretical physicists say an " infinite " number .
Even if you 're this abundant , you may still regret the fact that there are ( very ) extensive parts of the multiverse where you do n't exist .
But this is a lament that one is n't God .
For what it 's worth , I suspect Reality has quite enough copies of me as it is .
What can a company do to become successful in the life extension business ?
Peddle snake - oil ?
The dead ca n't sue ...
How handy would be an indefinite lifespan ?
Potentially , indefinite lifespan will be wonderful .
But it 's only one strand of becoming truly post - human .
Recall how studies suggest that six months after winning the lottery or becoming paralysed in an accident , most people will have reverted to their previous average level of well - being or ill - being before their windfall / accident .
Their [ partially ] heritable " set- point " of everyday mood has n't shifted significantly .
Likewise , following a short - lived burst of euphoria at being granted eternal youth , something analogous might befall us too .
As our emotional thermostats kicked in , we might soon be almost as malaise - ridden as before .
Unless we recalibrate the mind 's hedonic tone , our quality of life as quasi- immortals wo n't be much higher than our quality of life as lived for three score years and ten .
On a brighter note , I think this worry is misplaced .
The combination of indefinite life - spans and radical mood - enrichment is a recipe for eternal bliss .
This may serve as a good definition - in a medico - scientific as well as popular sense - of paradise .
Supermodel : Simple ActiveModel - Powered In - Memory Models
By Peter Cooper
Supermodel is a new library by Alex Maccaw that uses the Rails 3.0 ActiveModel library to provide ActiveRecord - esque in - memory " database " storage in Ruby .
Supermodel is best demonstrated with a basic example :
require ' supermodel ' class Person < SuperModel :: Base ; end a = Person.new ( : name => " Jim " ) a.save Person.find_by_name( ' Jim ' ) # => #< Person > Person.all # => [ #< Person >]
This is just the start !
Out of the box , Supermodel supports validations , callbacks , observers , dirty change tracking , and serialization .
It also allows you , with only a little magic , to go beyond ephemeral memory - only structures and marshall your SuperModel - based objects to disk or even to a Redis store .
A more complex example that includes randomly generated IDs and validations :
require ' supermodel ' class Person < SuperModel :: Base include SuperModel :: RandomID attributes : name validates_presence_of : name end a = Person.new a.valid ?
# => false a.name = " Jim " a.valid ?
# => true a.save a.id # => " 6481a4fcd834e567836587c6da "
It 's early days for Supermodel , but I can see it becoming a big deal for Rubyists away from the Rails stack .
The gemified version does n't have support for relationships yet , but the edge version on GitHub has early support for belongs_to and has_many included .
Alex has written the code in a well structured way and creating modules or subclasses to add support for interacting with other backends ( such as , say , Tokyo Cabinet ) does n't look like it'd be too hard .
If you ’re reading this , you ’re no doubt asking yourself , “ Why did this have to happen ? ”
The simple truth is that it is complicated and has been coming for a long time .
The writing process , started many months ago , was intended to be therapy in the face of the looming realization that there is n’t enough therapy in the world that can fix what is really broken .
Needless to say , this rant could fill volumes with example after example if I would let it .
I find the process of writing it frustrating , tedious , and probably pointless … especially given my gross inability to gracefully articulate my thoughts in light of the storm raging in my head .
Exactly what is therapeutic about that I ’m not sure , but desperate times call for desperate measures .
We are all taught as children that without laws there would be no society , only anarchy .
Sadly , starting at early ages we in this country have been brainwashed to believe that , in return for our dedication and service , our government stands for justice for all .
We are further brainwashed to believe that there is freedom in this place , and that we should be ready to lay our lives down for the noble principals represented by its founding fathers .
Remember ?
One of these was “ no taxation without representation ” .
I have spent the total years of my adulthood unlearning that crap from only a few years of my childhood .
These days anyone who really stands up for that principal is promptly labeled a “ crackpot ” , traitor and worse .
While very few working people would say they have n’t had their fair share of taxes ( as can I ) , in my lifetime I can say with a great degree of certainty that there has never been a politician cast a vote on any matter with the likes of me or my interests in mind .
Nor , for that matter , are they the least bit interested in me or anything I have to say .
Why is it that a handful of thugs and plunderers can commit unthinkable atrocities ( and in the case of the GM executives , for scores of years ) and when it ’s time for their gravy train to crash under the weight of their gluttony and overwhelming stupidity , the force of the full federal government has no difficulty coming to their aid within days if not hours ?
Yet at the same time , the joke we call the American medical system , including the drug and insurance companies , are murdering tens of thousands of people a year and stealing from the corpses and victims they cripple , and this country ’s leaders do n’t see this as important as bailing out a few of their vile , rich cronies .
Yet , the political “ representatives ” ( thieves , liars , and self - serving scumbags is far more accurate ) have endless time to sit around for year after year and debate the state of the “ terrible health care problem ” .
It ’s clear they see no crisis as long as the dead people do n’t get in the way of their corporate profits rolling in .
And justice ?
You ’ve got to be kidding !
How can any rational individual explain that white elephant conundrum in the middle of our tax system and , indeed , our entire legal system ?
Here we have a system that is , by far , too complicated for the brightest of the master scholars to understand .
Yet , it mercilessly “ holds accountable ” its victims , claiming that they ’re responsible for fully complying with laws not even the experts understand .
The law “ requires ” a signature on the bottom of a tax filing ; yet no one can say truthfully that they understand what they are signing ; if that ’s not “ duress ” than what is .
If this is not the measure of a totalitarian regime , nothing is .
How did I get here ?
My introduction to the real American nightmare starts back in the early ‘ 80s .
Unfortunately after more than 16 years of school , somewhere along the line I picked up the absurd , pompous notion that I could read and understand plain English .
Some friends introduced me to a group of people who were having ‘ tax code ’ readings and discussions .
In particular , zeroed in on a section relating to the wonderful “ exemptions ” that make institutions like the vulgar , corrupt Catholic Church so incredibly wealthy .
We carefully studied the law ( with the help of some of the “ best ” , high - paid , experienced tax lawyers in the business ) , and then began to do exactly what the “ big boys ” were doing ( except that we were n’t steeling from our congregation or lying to the government about our massive profits in the name of God ) .
We took a great deal of care to make it all visible , following all of the rules , exactly the way the law said it was to be done .
The intent of this exercise and our efforts was to bring about a much - needed re-evaluation of the laws that allow the monsters of organized religion to make such a mockery of people who earn an honest living .
However , this is where I learned that there are two “ interpretations ” for every law ; one for the very rich , and one for the rest of us …
Oh , and the monsters are the very ones making and enforcing the laws ; the inquisition is still alive and well today in this country .
That little lesson in patriotism cost me $ 40,000 + , 10 years of my life , and set my retirement plans back to 0 .
It made me realize for the first time that I live in a country with an ideology that is based on a total and complete lie .
It also made me realize , not only how naive I had been , but also the incredible stupidity of the American public ; that they buy , hook , line , and sinker , the crap about their “ freedom ” … and that they continue to do so with eyes closed in the face of overwhelming evidence and all that keeps happening in front of them .
Before even having to make a shaky recovery from the sting of the first lesson on what justice really means in this country ( around 1984 after making my way through engineering school and still another five years of “ paying my dues ” ) , I felt I finally had to take a chance of launching my dream of becoming an independent engineer .
On the subjects of engineers and dreams of independence , I should digress somewhat to say that I ’m sure that I inherited the fascination for creative problem solving from my father .
I realized this at a very young age .
The significance of independence , however , came much later during my early years of college ; at the age of 18 or 19 when I was living on my own as student in an apartment in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania .
My neighbor was an elderly retired woman ( 80 + seemed ancient to me at that age ) who was the widowed wife of a retired steel worker .
Her husband had worked all his life in the steel mills of central Pennsylvania with promises from big business and the union that , for his 30 years of service , he would have a pension and medical care to look forward to in his retirement .
Instead he was one of the thousands who got nothing because the incompetent mill management and corrupt union ( not to mention the government ) raided their pension funds and stole their retirement .
All she had was social security to live on .
In retrospect , the situation was laughable because here I was living on peanut butter and bread ( or Ritz crackers when I could afford to splurge ) for months at a time .
When I got to know this poor figure and heard her story I felt worse for her plight than for my own ( I , after all , I thought I had everything to in front of me ) .
I was genuinely appalled at one point , as we exchanged stories and commiserated with each other over our situations , when she in her grandmotherly fashion tried to convince me that I would be “ healthier ” eating cat food ( like her ) rather than trying to get all my substance from peanut butter and bread .
I could n’t quite go there , but the impression was made .
I decided that I did n’t trust big business to take care of me , and that I would take responsibility for my own future and myself .
Return to the early ‘ 80s , and here I was off to a terrifying start as a ‘ wet - behind - the - ears ’ contract software engineer ... and two years later , thanks to the fine backroom , midnight effort by the sleazy executives of Arthur Andersen ( the very same folks who later brought us Enron and other such calamities ) and an equally sleazy New York Senator ( Patrick Moynihan ) , we saw the passage of 1986 tax reform act with its section 1706 .
For you who are unfamiliar , here is the core text of the IRS Section 1706 , defining the treatment of workers ( such as contract engineers ) for tax purposes .
Visit this link for aconference committee report ( http://www.synergistech.com/1706.shtml#ConferenceCommitteeReport) regarding the intended interpretation of Section 1706 and the relevant parts of Section 530 , as amended .
For information on how these laws affect technical services workers and their clients , read our discussion here ( http://www.synergistech.com/ic-taxlaw.shtml).
SEC .
1706 .
TREATMENT OF CERTAIN TECHNICAL PERSONNEL .
(a) IN GENERAL - Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new subsection :
(d) EXCEPTION . -
This section shall not apply in the case of an individual who pursuant to an arrangement between the taxpayer and another person , provides services for such other person as an engineer , designer , drafter , computer programmer , systems analyst , or other similarly skilled worker engaged in a similar line of work .
( b) EFFECTIVE DATE . -
The amendment made by this section shall apply to remuneration paid and services rendered after December 31 , 1986 .
Note :
· " another person " is the client in the traditional job - shop relationship .
· " taxpayer " is the recruiter , broker , agency , or job shop .
· " individual " , " employee " , or " worker " is you .
Admittedly , you need to read the treatment to understand what it is saying but it ’s not very complicated .
The bottom line is that they may as well have put my name right in the text of section ( d ) .
Moreover , they could only have been more blunt if they would have came out and directly declared me a criminal and non-citizen slave .
Twenty years later , I still ca n’t believe my eyes .
During 1987 , I spent close to $ 5000 of my ‘ pocket change ’ , and at least 1000 hours of my time writing , printing , and mailing to any senator , congressman , governor , or slug that might listen ; none did , and they universally treated me as if I was wasting their time .
I spent countless hours on the L.A. freeways driving to meetings and any and all of the disorganized professional groups who were attempting to mount a campaign against this atrocity .
This , only to discover that our efforts were being easily derailed by a few moles from the brokers who were just beginning to enjoy the windfall from the new declaration of their “ freedom ” .
Oh , and do n’t forget , for all of the time I was spending on this , I was loosing income that I could n’t bill clients .
After months of struggling it had clearly gotten to be a futile exercise .
The best we could get for all of our trouble is a pronouncement from an IRS mouthpiece that they were n’t going to enforce that provision ( read harass engineers and scientists ) .
This immediately proved to be a lie , and the mere existence of the regulation began to have its impact on my bottom line ; this , of course , was the intended effect .
Again , rewind my retirement plans back to 0 and shift them into idle .
If I had any sense , I clearly should have left abandoned engineering and never looked back .
Instead I got busy working 100 - hour workweeks .
Then came the L.A. depression of the early 1990s .
Our leaders decided that they did n’t need the all of those extra Air Force bases they had in Southern California , so they were closed ; just like that .
The result was economic devastation in the region that rivaled the widely publicized Texas S&L fiasco .
However , because the government caused it , no one gave a shit about all of the young families who lost their homes or street after street of boarded up houses abandoned to the wealthy loan companies who received government funds to “ shore up ” their windfall .
Again , I lost my retirement .
Years later , after weathering a divorce and the constant struggle trying to build some momentum with my business , I find myself once again beginning to finally pick up some speed .
Then came the .COM bust and the 911 nightmare .
Our leaders decided that all aircraft were grounded for what seemed like an eternity ; and long after that , ‘ special ’ facilities like San Francisco were on security alert for months .
This made access to my customers prohibitively expensive .
Ironically , after what they had done the Government came to the aid of the airlines with billions of our tax dollars … as usual they left me to rot and die while they bailed out their rich , incompetent cronies WITH MY MONEY !
After these events , there went my business but not quite yet all of my retirement and savings .
By this time , I ’m thinking that it might be good for a change .
Bye to California , I ’ll try Austin for a while .
So I moved , only to find out that this is a place with a highly inflated sense of self - importance and where damn little real engineering work is done .
I ’ve never experienced such a hard time finding work .
The rates are 1/3 of what I was earning before the crash , because pay rates here are fixed by the three or four large companies in the area who are in collusion to drive down prices and wages … and this happens because the justice department is all on the take and does n’t give a fuck about serving anyone or anything but themselves and their rich buddies .
To survive , I was forced to cannibalize my savings and retirement , the last of which was a small IRA .
This came in a year with mammoth expenses and not a single dollar of income .
I filed no return that year thinking that because I did n’t have any income there was no need .
The sleazy government decided that they disagreed .
But they did n’t notify me in time for me to launch a legal objection so when I attempted to get a protest filed with the court I was told I was no longer entitled to due process because the time to file ran out .
Bend over for another $ 10,000 helping of justice .
So now we come to the present .
After my experience with the CPA world , following the business crash I swore that I ’d never enter another accountant ’s office again .
But here I am with a new marriage and a boatload of undocumented income , not to mention an expensive new business asset , a piano , which I had no idea how to handle .
After considerable thought I decided that it would be irresponsible NOT to get professional help ; a very big mistake .
When we received the forms back I was very optimistic that they were in order .
I had taken all of the years information to Bill Ross , and he came back with results very similar to what I was expecting .
Except that he had neglected to include the contents of Sheryl ’s unreported income ; $ 12,700 worth of it .
To make matters worse , Ross knew all along this was missing and I did n’t have a clue until he pointed it out in the middle of the audit .
By that time it had become brutally evident that he was representing himself and not me .
This left me stuck in the middle of this disaster trying to defend transactions that have no relationship to anything tax - related ( at least the tax - related transactions were poorly documented ) .
Things I never knew anything about and things my wife had no clue would ever matter to anyone .
The end result is … well , just look around .
I remember reading about the stock market crash before the “ great ” depression and how there were wealthy bankers and businessmen jumping out of windows when they realized they screwed up and lost everything .
Is n’t it ironic how far we ’ve come in 60 years in this country that they now know how to fix that little economic problem ; they just steal from the middle class ( who does n’t have any say in it , elections are a joke ) to cover their asses and it ’s “ business - as- usual ” .
Now when the wealthy fuck up , the poor get to die for the mistakes … is n’t that a clever , tidy solution .
As government agencies go , the FAA is often justifiably referred to as a tombstone agency , though they are hardly alone .
The recent presidential puppet GW Bush and his cronies in their eight years certainly reinforced for all of us that this criticism rings equally true for all of the government .
Nothing changes unless there is a body count ( unless it is in the interest of the wealthy sows at the government trough ) .
In a government full of hypocrites from top to bottom , life is as cheap as their lies and their self - serving laws .
I know I ’m hardly the first one to decide I have had all I can stand .
It has always been a myth that people have stopped dying for their freedom in this country , and it is n’t limited to the blacks , and poor immigrants .
I know there have been countless before me and there are sure to be as many after .
But I also know that by not adding my body to the count , I insure nothing will change .
I choose to not keep looking over my shoulder at “ big brother ” while he strips my carcass , I choose not to ignore what is going on all around me , I choose not to pretend that business as usual wo n’t continue ; I have just had enough .
I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be white washed and ignored that the American zombies wake up and revolt ; it will take nothing less .
I would only hope that by striking a nerve that stimulates the inevitable double standard , knee - jerk government reaction that results in more stupid draconian restrictions people wake up and begin to see the pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what they are .
Sadly , though I spent my entire life trying to believe it was n’t so , but violence not only is the answer , it is the only answer .
The cruel joke is that the really big chunks of shit at the top have known this all along and have been laughing , at and using this awareness against , fools like me all along .
I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different .
I am finally ready to stop this insanity .
Well , Mr. Big Brother IRS man , let ’s try something different ; take my pound of flesh and sleep well .

The capitalist creed : From each according to his gullibility , to each according to his greed .
Joe Stack ( 1956-2010 )
02/18/2010
The Taliban not only has the " momentum " after the most successful year in its campaign against the United States and the Kabul government .
" The Afghan insurgency can sustain itself indefinitely , " according to a briefing from Major General Michael Flynn , the top U.S. intelligence officer in the country .
" The Taliban retains [ the ] required partnerships to sustain support , fuel legitimacy and bolster capacity . "
And if that is n't enough , Flynn also warns that " time is running out " for the American - led International Security Assistance Force .
" Regional instability is rapidly increasing and getting worse , " the report says .
Since General Stanley McChrystal took over as top commander in Afghanistan , there have been a series of dark appraisals about the state of the war .
In August , McChrystal warned of an " urgent need for a significant change to our strategy and the way that we think and operate . "
A report recently obtained by NBC News said Afghanistan 's security forces wo n't be ready to fight the Taliban for years – if ever .
Earlier this week , Flynn issued a white paper complaining that " eight years into the war in Afghanistan , the U.S. intelligence community is only marginally relevant to the overall strategy . "
But Flynn 's December 23rd presentation on the " State of the Insurgency : Trends , Intentions and Objectives " may be the gloomiest public assessment of the war yet .
The " loosely organized " Taliban is " growing more cohesive " and " increasingly effective . "
The insurgents now have their own " governors " installed in 33 of Afghanistan 's 34 provinces .
And the " strength and ability of [ that ] shadow governance increasing , " according to the presentation .
The Taliban 's " organizational capabilities and operational reach are qualitatively and geographically expanding . "
Improvised bomb " events " have nearly tripled since 2007 – 7228 this year , compared to 2718 two years ago .
The bombs have grown bigger – the majority are now 25 pounds or more .
" 80 to 90 percent " of them are made with homemade fertilizer , rather than military ordnance .
That makes it much harder to track and block the distribution of the bomb - making material .
Add to that steady supply of cash , thanks to the drug trade and the corrupt Kabul government , and a glut of weapons and ammunition , " and it becomes clear why , in Flynn 's words , " the insurgency is confident ... looking toward post - ISAF Afghanistan . "
The presentation also cast doubt on some of the war 's stated central aims .
The Obama administration has repeatedly said that additional troops are necessary to prevent a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan – which would then allow Al Qaeda the re-establigh its safe haven there .
According to interviews with detainees , however , the insurgents " view Al Qaeda as a handicap – a view that is increasingly prevalent . "
The Taliban feel they have to " manage [ the ] relationship with AQ to avoid alienating Afghan population , but encourage support from [ the ] global jihad network . "
Flynn 's presentation also , indirectly , warns that one of the central U.S. tactics in Pakistan – drone strikes against suspected militants – could backfire .
" violations of Pakistan sovereignty may contribute to radicalizing the population and diminishes credibility of the GoP [ Government of Pakistan ] . "
Such violations " demonstrat[e ] an inability of the government ; perception they cannot protect their own ; exacerbates anti-western sentiment . "
Within military circles , there 's a sense that Flynn may be underplaying recent American successes in Helmand province and elsewhere .
And Flynn does note that there 's still hope for the American effort in the region .
" We have a key advantage – [ the ] Taliban is not a popular movement ( yet ) , " the report says .
What 's more , there are " persistent fissures among insurgent leadership at local levels " and an " over - reliance on external support . "
Exploiting those fissures – and beating the Taliban – will " requir[e ] operating / thinking in a fundamentally new way . "
It could have been worse .
We could have had identity cards , forcing a citizen to prove his or her right to be here , or to admit who he or she is , despite having committed no offence .
We could have had a national DNA database .
We could have had a law that prevented comedians telling jokes about religion .
We could have had the restriction of jury trials .
We could have had people locked up without trial for 90 days because the police are incapable of finding any evidence upon which to convict them of something .
We could have criminalised people for being nutters , for that is one of the best words to describe those poisonous idiots who claim Auschwitz was just a film set and the genocide of the Jews did n't happen .
All these things have been discussed or proposed by Labour in varying degrees of seriousness , but – so far – have not been inflicted on our people .
However , they show a certain , and unpleasant , cast of mind .

Ten questions for Lisa Miller on
Heaven : Our Enduring Fascination
with the Afterlife ( HarperCollins , 2010 )
What inspired you to write Heaven ?
About a year after 9/11 , I wrote a Newsweek cover story on heaven .
It was triggered by this idea :
In a suicide bombing , everyone thinks they ’re going to heaven .
The bombers are martyrs , according to their beliefs , and are going to straight to heaven to receive the rewards promised there .
The victims are martyrs , according to their beliefs , and are also going straight to heaven .
So : which is it ?
Is everyone going to heaven ?
Is there a different heaven for terrorists and for the people killed by terrorists ?
This led to a very basic exploration of ideas of heaven :
Heaven as a real place , heaven as an idea of something beautiful and perfect but unattainable , heaven as a location somewhere , heaven as a process , heaven as a galvanizing or corrupting influence or an incentive for good ( what the Bible calls “ righteous ” ) behavior .
As I dug deeper , I began to see that people have been asking the same questions about heaven since they started to talk about it .
While they ’re unanswerable , they ’re also worth asking .
First , what does heaven look like ?
In Islam , it looks like a garden .
In Christianity , it looks like a city — and a garden , too .
The orthodox often see these descriptions as literal : Randy Alcorn , an evangelical Christian who has written a popular book on heaven for the conservative Christian audience , talks about heaven as a place like Boston , with museums , libraries , parks , and no litter or crime .
It ’s a busy place , he says .
Progressives tend to see the scriptural descriptions — the pearl gates in the Book of Revelation , for example — as metaphorical .
Thus , the Qur’an promises that in Paradise , there will be gardens , running water , and ripe fruits .
The righteous will be clad in silk and recline on couches , ready to be waited on and to receive the attention of houris , dark - eyed women .
We all know that Mohammad Atta , who flew American Airlines flight 11 into the Twin Towers on 9/11 , was inspired by this promise .
But among progressives , the sex promised to the righteous in the Qur’an is n’t sex as we know it , but something mysterious and sublime for which sex is a poetic stand - in .
Second , what happens to our bodies in heaven ?
This is my favorite part of the heaven conversation .
For if you believe in heaven as a real place , a physical place ( and most people do ) , then you need a body or something like a body with which to enjoy it .
The critical verse here is 1 Corinthians 15 , in which Paul explains to those who doubt the truth of the resurrection that the body is like a seed — and when it rises in the resurrection is both has the properties of a seed and of something else altogether .
“ What is sown is perishable , what is raised is imperishable …
It is sown a physical body , it is raised a spiritual body . ”
Generations of Christians have tried to figure out what that “ spiritual body ” means .
I am reminded of a conversation with Owen Gingerich , a Christian believer who is also an astrophysicist at Harvard .
He puts the conundrum this way : Human bodies are characterized by change , and heaven , by tradition , is characterized by changelessness .
How does that work ?
How does the human , who changes minutely every second , exist in a changeless eternity ?
The church father Augustine solves this by saying that in heaven time has no meaning , but that declaration does n’t satisfy rational - minded people like me .
More to the point :
With bodies in heaven , we can do all the things that bodies do .
We can eat , drink , make love .
We can hug our parents and walk our dogs .
We can have all the pleasure that the Christian tradition promises us in heaven .
Without bodies ( which is how more and more Americans are inclined to imagine heaven these days ) it ’s hard to imagine having anything like consciousness or selfhood ; or pleasure or friendship .
Plato taught that the body was a curse , a drag ; it carried all the baser human impulses and desires .
After death , the soul was set free to ascend to God and attain wisdom .
This vision may work better in a world defined by science and rationality , but it fails to trigger passion and imagination in the same way that a physical vision would .
Third , who ’s up there and what do we do ?
Our most commonly held notion of heaven is that when we die , we ’ll see our beloved parents , grandparents , spouses , friends .
Our songs and our dearest hopes are built around this notion .
But as Colleen McDannell and Bernhard Lang point out in their wonderful book , Heaven : A History , this idea of a social , or domesticated heaven , is a relatively recent invention — an idea that really took root around the time of the Civil War .
From the beginning , heaven was a place where people went to be with God .
In Dante ’s Paradiso , the blessed reside in different levels , but every person in each level is focused on one thing , God , and is thus perfectly content with her hierarchical place .
Even if the ancients understood that they would see their relatives in heaven , they had no idea of hanging out with them , or doing any of the things that Susie Salmon does in the novel The Lovely Bones .
There was no idea of chatting , eating ice cream , playing sports .
There is a movement among conservative believers in every tradition to reemphasize this idea of God in heaven ; something they say has been totally , culturally lost .
If God is at the center of heaven , and what you “ do ” is sing his praises all day , then — these believers convincingly argue — that is a blessed eternity indeed .
What ’s the most important take - home message for readers ?
Almost everyone says they believe in Heaven :
When asked , “ Do you believe in heaven ? ” 80 % of Americans answer yes .
But almost no one has a clear idea of what it is they believe .
I hope my book gives people a sense of what Western religious traditions and regular people say heaven is ( and is n’t ) and how those ideas have changed through history .
I hope that my book will provoke readers to develop for themselves a clearer and more thought - out idea of heaven , whatever that is .
Personally , I am in an awkward place .
I am a progressive in my heart and I do n’t like conservative visions of heaven that exclude ; I do n’t like notions of earthly “ righteousness ” that separate people based on accidents of birth or arbitrary rules .
I do n’t believe , for example , that only people “ with a personal relationship with Jesus Christ ” will get to heaven .
( I ’m not alone here , by the way ; a growing number of evangelical Christians agree with me . )
At the same time , the most moving and culturally important visions of heaven are those created by the conservative believers .
These are the visions that move people to action : to be faithful to One God , for example , or to martyr themselves .
I would like to believe in heaven as a concrete reality in the future , a place that really exists , as the medieval monks imagined , somewhere on a map if you could only get there .
Instead , I have to be content with heaven as an ephemeral hope , as Emily Dickinson described it : “ Heaven — is what I cannot reach ! , ” an apple just out of grabbing distance .
Is there anything you had to leave out ?
One of the wonderful things about writing this book was that it allowed me to explore cultural references to heaven as well as history and theology .
I spoke to the head of The New Yorker ’s cartoon department about cloud - and - angel cartoons ; to David Byrne , formerly of Talking Heads , who wrote that great song “ Heaven ” ( “ a place where nothing ever happens ” ) ; to Albert Brooks , who wrote and directed Defending Your Life .
I included references to Marc Chagall , The Simpsons , folk songs , slave spirituals , Monty Python , Michelangelo , Hamlet , Homer , popular jokes , my grandparents , Giotto , Billy Graham , Botticelli , Don Piper , and Maria Shriver .
At the same time , I keep on seeing and reading things I wish I ’d included : A Tintoretto sketch of heaven I recently saw in the Louvre ; passages from Annie Dillard ’s Pilgrim at Tinker Creek ; the Winans ’ amazing gospel song “ Heaven . ”
Heaven is such a potent and pervasive force in our culture , it ’s just impossible to include everything .
What are some of the biggest misconceptions about your topic ?
First , that Jews do n’t believe in heaven .
They do .
Jews basically invented the basic idea of heaven as we understand it today : a place , in the sky , with the angels — a reward after death for righteous behavior on Earth .
Orthodox Jews continue to be committed to the idea of physical resurrection after death ( that is , the restoration of one ’s body at the end of time ) , though Reform Jews have essentially abandoned that belief .
Second , that “ when you die you go to heaven . ”
It ’s not that simple .
All the monotheisms teach that “ going to heaven ” is a two - part ( or even three - part ) process :
You die .
You go … somewhere ( some say purgatory , some say the in - between phase is something like sleep , some say it ’s something like heaven ) .
At the end of the world you rejoin your body and live with God on a renewed Earth , which Muslims call “ Paradise ” and Jews call “ The world to come . ”
But in the modern , post - enlightenment West , this multi-phase process has become too intellectually cumbersome , and we ’ve abandoned it — especially in progressive circles .
Third , that “ heaven is what you want it to be . ”
For most of Western history , heaven has not been a realization of personal desires .
The fact that in America we are picking and choosing from among the most personally satisfying visions and leaving aside the rest is testament to our freedom , democracy , and relative affluence .
In the West , life is good and we have things in abundance .
Heaven , then , is an extension of the best of this life .
When ideas of heaven were first cohering , life for believers was not at all good .
The Jews who first conceived of heaven as we know it today were under assault , literally , from their Greek rulers .
Christians , at the beginning , were a marginal band , derided by the pagan majority .
Islam was established in a uniquely inhospitable part of the world by people who hoped to rectify the social order : to turn the “ have nots ” into “ haves . ”
For all these groups , heaven — a very specific heaven — was a reward for staying faithful despite oppression and even the risk of death .
It was like membership in a special club .
The message underlying the original visions of heaven was this :
Everything is terrible now , but if you stay faithful you will get x : to live among the stars like angels , pearl gates and crystal streets , a verdant garden with constantly running water .
This is why visions of heaven remain so powerful to fundamentalists .
They imagine themselves rightly or wrongly to be an oppressed minority in possession of a True view of things , given to them by God .
When moderates and progressives fail to articulate a coherent or appealing view of heaven for themselves , they risk ceding the heaven conversation to the other side .
Did you have a specific audience in mind ?
Yes .
My mother .
I wrote this book for all the people , like my mother , who think they believe in something , but are not quite sure what they do believe — or how to tease out their personal visions from what their tradition teaches them .
Are you hoping to just inform readers ?
Give them pleasure ?
Piss them off ?
I do n’t like that “ just ” in there .
Informing readers matters a lot , especially in religion .
I recently wrote a piece for Newsweek about a debate at Harvard about how much religion to require undergraduates to learn .
I passionately believe that if we knew more about each other ’s religions , we would be less fearful of each other .
I hope also to give readers pleasure — especially by showing them ideas of heaven that work for me , personally .
What alternative title would you give the book ?
I love the title .
“ Heaven ” is such a delicious , powerful and mysterious word .
You ca n’t do better .
How do you feel about the cover ?
I love the cover .
I was curious about how the publisher , HarperCollins , would get around the sky - clouds - angels clichés .
When I saw this cover , which is adapted from a medieval drawing , I was instantly delighted .
What book do you wish you ’d written ?
I fell in love with my profession after reading a collection called The Literary Journalists , edited by Norman Sims , with pieces by Tracy Kidder , John McPhee , Joan Didion , Tom Wolfe , and so on .
It opened my eyes to the idea that you could write about things and people in the world with the fluency and drama of fiction .
That ’s what I aspire to , and those are the writers I most admire , or emulate .
Today , the best in the business is Adam Gopnik ; I always read pieces by Peter Boyer , John Cassidy , John Seabrook ( and I wish , by the way , that there were more women on this list ) .
If I were a different person , with a more patient temperament I would write fiction .
Marilynne Robinson ( Gilead ) knocks my socks off .
What ’s your next book ?
It took me six years to finish this one .
Ask me in a couple months .

Just check the local time and location :
Its time for the 30th Perfect PieÂ Feast and Festival in Warkworth Ontario .

And as can be seen there are plenty of Pie-goers ready to Feast :
Lots to chat about and chomp on at the the Pie Feastings .
And the service is gracious :

The LORD was with the men of Judah .
They took possession of the hill country , but they were unable to drive the people from the plains , because they had chariots fitted with iron .
The LORD was with the people of Judah , and they took possession of the hill country .
But they failed to drive out the people living in the plains , who had iron chariots .
And the LORD was with Judah , and he took possession of the hill country , but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain because they had chariots of iron .
The LORD was with Judah , and they took possession of the hill country ; but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the plains because they had chariots of iron .
Now the LORD was with Judah , and they took possession of the hill country ; but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had iron chariots .
So the LORD was with Judah .
And they drove out the mountaineers , but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the lowland , because they had chariots of iron .
And the LORD was with Judah ; and he drave outthe mountain ; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
The LORD was with Judah and enabled them to take possession of the hill country , but they could not drive out the people who were living in the valley because those people had iron chariots .
The LORD was with Judah and enabled them to take possession of the hill country , but they could not drive out the people who were living in the valley because those people had iron chariots .
The LORD was with the army of Judah , and they captured the hill country , but did not expel the inhabitants of the valley because they were equipped with iron chariots .
The LORD was with the men of Judah .
They conquered the hill country , but they could not conquer the people living in the coastal plain , because they had chariots with iron - rimmed wheels .
The LORD was with Judah ; and drove out the inhabitants of the hill country ; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
And the LORD was with Judah .
And he took possession of the mountain , but he could not drive out those who lived in the valley because they had chariots of iron .
The LORD was with the men of Judah so that they were able to take possession of the mountains .
But they could not force out the people living in the valley who had chariots made of iron .
And the LORD was with Judah ; and he drove out the inhabitants of the hill - country ; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
Now the LORD was with Judah , and they took possession of the hill country ; but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had iron chariots .
And the LORD was with Judah ; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain ; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
And the LORD was with Judah ; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain ; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
And Jehovah was with Judah ; and drove out the inhabitants of the hill - country ; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
And the Lord was with Judas , and he inherited the mountain ; for they were not able to destroy the inhabitants of the valley , for Rechab prevented them .
And the Lord was with Juda , and he possessed the hill country : but was not able to destroy the inhabitants of the valley , because they had many chariots armed with scythes .
And Jehovah was with Judah ; and he took possession of the hill - country , for he did not dispossess the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
And the LORD was with Judah ; and he drave out the inhabitants of the hill country ; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
And the LORD was with Judah ; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain ; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
Yahweh was with Judah ; and drove out [ the inhabitants of ] the hill country ; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
and Jehovah is with Judah , and he occupieth the hill - country , but not to dispossess the inhabitants of the valley , for they have chariots of iron .

LATHROP , Calif . —
Drive along foreclosure alley , through new planned communities that look like tile - roofed versions of a 21st century ghost town , and you see what happens when people gamble with houses instead of casino chips .
Dirty flags advertise rock - bottom discounts on empty starter mansions .
On the ground , foreclosure signs are tagged with gang graffiti .
Empty lots are untended , cratered with mud puddles from the winter storms that have hammered California ’s San Joaquin Valley .
Nobody is home in the cities of the future .
In a decade , they saw real property defy reality in real time in these insta-neighborhoods that sprouted in what had been some of the world ’s most productive farmland .
In places like Lathrop , Manteca and Tracy , population nearly doubled in 10 years , and home prices tripled .
After inhaling all this real estate helium , some developers and their apologists in urban planning circles hailed the boom as the new America at the far exurban fringe .
Every citizen a homeowner !
Half - acre lots for all !
No credit , no problem !
Others saw it as the residential embodiment of the Edward Abbey line that “ growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell . ”
Now median home prices have fallen from $ 500,000 to $ 150,000 — among the most precipitous drops in the nation — and still the houses sit empty , spooky and see - through , waiting on demography and psychology to catch up .
In strip malls where tenants seem to last no longer than the life cycle of a gold fish , the bottom - feeders have moved in .
“ Coming soon : Cigarette City , ” reads one sign here in Lathrop , near a “ Cash Advance ” outlet .
Take a pulse :
How can a community possibly be healthy when one in eight houses are in some stage of foreclosure ?
How can a town attract new people when the crime rate has spiked well above the national average ?
How can a family dream , or even save , when unemployment hovers around 16 percent ?
Yet if these staggered exurbs , about two hours inland from San Francisco , were an illness , they would not quite be Abbey ’s cancer .
Though sick , foreclosure alley is not terminal .
This is not Detroit with sunshine .
It will be reborn , remade , inhabited .
The question is : as what ?
Nationwide , a record 2.8 million homes received foreclosure notices last year — up 119 percent from two years ago .
Just under 5 million homeowners — 1 in 10 mortgages — owe more than their houses are worth .
The impulse is to walk away .
Surrender .
And many have .
What they leave behind , along with the gang presence , the vandalism and the absence of vested owners , is a slum .
A new slum .
In an influential article in the Atlantic in 2008 , the writer Christopher B. Leinberger predicted that the catastrophic collapse of the new home market could turn many of today ’s McMansions into tenements .
I ’m not sure of that .
After several days in foreclosure alley , this broad swath of the Central Valley that has been rated by some economists as the most stressed region during the Great Recession , I ca n’t see such apocalyptic forecasts coming true .
Yes , huge developments are empty , with rising crime at the edges , and thousands of homes owned by banks that ca n’t unload them even at fire - sale prices .
But through it all , the country churns and expands , unlike most other Western democracies .
That great American natural resource — tomorrow — will have to save the suburban slums .
Through immigration and high birth rates , the United States is expected to add another 100 million people by 2050 .
If you do n’t believe me , consider that we ’ve added 105 million people since 1970 .
This is more than the population of France .
More than Italy .
More than Germany .
Currently , we have a net gain of one person every 13 seconds .
At some point , the market will settle on proper pricing levels .
At its peak , only 11 percent of the people in this valley could afford the median home price .
In the meantime , during these low , ragged years , a few lessons about urban planning can be picked from the stucco pile .
One is that , at least here in California , the outlying cities themselves encouraged the boom , spurred by the state ’s broken tax system .
Hemmed in by property tax limitations , cities were compelled to increase revenue by the easiest route : expanding urban boundaries .
They let developers plow up walnut groves and vineyards and places that were supposed to be strawberry fields forever to pay for services demanded by new school parents and park users .
Second , look at the cities with stable and recovering home markets .
On this coast , San Francisco , Portland , Seattle and San Diego come to mind .
All of these cities have fairly strict development codes , trying to hem in their excess sprawl .
Developers , many of them , hate these restrictions .
They said the coastal cities would eventually price the middle class out , and start to empty .
It has n’t happened .
Just the opposite .
The developers ’ favorite role models , the laissez faire free - for - alls — Las Vegas , the Phoenix metro area , South Florida , this valley — are the most troubled , the suburban slums .
Come see : this is what happens when money and market , alone , guide the way we live .
In most all of the climate models , the warming effect from feedback is actually much larger than the warming effect from CO2 alone .
That is why I have said for years that it is a waste of time to debate “ greenhouse gas theory ” as the real theory that matters to the proposition that climate sensitivity to CO2 is high is the theory that Earth ’s temperature system is dominated by strong positive feedback .
And the largest feedback in climate models tends to be water vapor feedback , despite the fact that even the IPCC admits that such feedback is poorly understood .
To this end :
In a third paper , accepted for publication by the Journal of Theoretical and Applied Climatology , three scientists – two Australians and one American , revisit data on upper - atmospheric humidity .
The three are Garth Paltridge , Albert Arking and Michael Pook , and they have found that , contrary to climate model predictions , water vapour in the upper atmosphere is acting as a brake on global warming .
Established climate models assume constant humidity at all levels in the atmosphere as the temperature rises .
But , using data from weather balloons accumulated over 35 years , these researchers find this is not so .
At the lower levels , it is higher than expected , dropping below normal at the higher altitudes .
This , they say , implies that “ long - term water vapour feedback is negative – that it would reduce rather than amplify the response of the climate system to external forcing such as that from increasing atmospheric CO2 . ”
This , in one fell swoop , challenges the central premise of the warmists that , once CO2 reaches a certain level , we experience runaway global warming .

In an effort to end the foreclosure crisis , the Obama administration has been trying to keep defaulting owners in their homes .
Now it will take a new approach : paying some of them to leave .
This latest program , which will allow owners to sell for less than they owe and will give them a little cash to speed them on their way , is one of the administration ’s most aggressive attempts to grapple with a problem that has defied solutions .
More than five million households are behind on their mortgages and risk foreclosure .
The government ’s $ 75 billion mortgage modification plan has helped only a small slice of them .
Consumer advocates , economists and even some banking industry representatives say much more needs to be done .
For the administration , there is also the concern that millions of foreclosures could delay or even reverse the economy ’s tentative recovery — the last thing it wants in an election year .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez Wednesday demanded on Wednesday Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero respect Venezuela 's sovereignty .
During a national TV and radio broadcast , Chavez rejected the accusations of Spanish National Audience 's judge , Eloy Velasco , that " there are links between the Venezuelan government and Spanish separatist groups and Colombian guerillas . "
The Spanish National Audience is the country 's top criminal court .
Chavez said those accusations were irresponsible and he does not have anything to explain to Spain .
He also suggested Rodriguez Zapatero to observe the Spanish justice .
Chavez said that Velasco 's accusations " do not have proofs " and they are part of an international campaign against Venezuela .
Chavez stressed that he had talked with Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos on telephone , who affirmed that the government of Spain does not have anything to do with Velasco 's accusations .
However , according to Chavez , Rodriguez Zapatero has told the media that he would ask the Venezuelan government for explanations about the accusations made by Velasco .
" I hope Rodriguez Zapatero sends an official letter , instead of requesting explanations when talking with the media , " Chavez said , adding that " the ties ( between both countries ) depend on Rodriguez Zapatero 's attitude . "
Chavez said that his country is the victim of an intense attack of the extreme right - wing which try to sabotage his country 's initiative of creating the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States .

ENGLISH -SPEAKING
parishioners have been forced out of a church in Sydney 's north with its service now to be heard solely in Korean .
Denistone East Uniting Church will hold its final English service this Sunday .
The community that has replaced bygone eras in Denistone is " delightfully Asianised " , Reverend Les Pearson said , with at least 120 keen Korean Christians packing each sermon .
" At a time when church - going for Caucasian people seems to be diminishing , it is a healthy thing for our church to become more ethnic , " Rev Pearson said on the weekend .
" This is society dictating to the church and the church responding to that .
It would have been easy to say ' This is an Aussie church ' but it would have been unreasonable and wrong .
" We live in a land enriched by migrants . "
Sixty years ago founder Rod Field painted a promise of things to come : " This is the site of the Denistone East Methodist Church . "
It was a simple sign on a cow paddock surrounded by orchards which were being carved up into suburban Sydney .
After 57 years of Sundays , this final English service would be sad , Mr Field said , but it was better that a Korean congregation use the church than none at all .
" I could not have put up a new sign saying it was to be closed .
It would have been too emotional , " the 86 - year - old said .
" Putting up a sign saying it was going Korean ... I could do that . "
Long - time parishioner Ron Hoffmann , 77 , will miss his tiny church of 49 years that he will be leaving for its big sister at Eastwood .
But he understands the change .
" It 's a very caring church , everyone knows everybody .
I will always remember its heyday where the Sunday school had 300 children , our youth group had 70 teenagers and at Christmas you could n't fit everybody into this hall , " Mr Hoffmann said .
Korean Pastor Jim Ho Cho said there was huge demand for more Korean services and with English cancelled , he could run two morning services on Sunday as well as evening services during the week .

If you are , like me , confused about the answer to this question , please raise your hand .... or better yet .... ask your Congressperson , Senator and the President :
Why is a pedophilia - ridden , pedophilia - hiding , child - abusing Church allowed to write laws controlling women 's rights ?
If you are , like me , confused about the answer to this question , please raise your hand …. or better yet ….ask your Congressperson and Senator .
And ask the President .
Why is a pedophilia - ridden , pedophilia - hiding , child - abusing Church allowed to write laws controlling women ’s rights ?
I am talking , of course , about the Catholic Church and specifically about the hierarchy …. not the good people of the Catholic faith .
The Church whose leadership , in case we did n’t already know this , has now been proven to have purposefully hidden an epidemic of pedophilia and –to protect priests , not born children –reassigned serial sex offenders to other parishes to offend again .
The kind of people who , if they were not priests protected by the hierarchy of the Church would not be allowed by US law to come anywhere near children or schools ?

Abortion .
Parenthood .

According to the newest revelations reported in the New York Times :
Top Vatican officials — including the future Pope Benedict XVI — did not defrock a priest who molested as many as 200 deaf boys , even though several American bishops repeatedly warned them that failure to act on the matter could embarrass the church , according to church files newly unearthed as part of a lawsuit .
[ emphasis mine ] .
The internal correspondence from bishops in Wisconsin directly to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , the future pope , shows that while church officials tussled over whether the priest should be dismissed , their highest priority was protecting the church from scandal .
The documents emerge as Pope Benedict is facing other accusations that he and direct subordinates often did not alert civilian authorities or discipline priests involved in sexual abuse when he served as an archbishop in Germany and as the Vatican ’s chief doctrinal enforcer .
As many as 200 deaf children molested .
The Pope himself as Cardinal–and as the Church ’s chief doctrinal enforcer–more worried about the possible scandal to the Church than the abuse of born children .
As a mother , I am so sickened I can barely type .
You know that doctrine that they enforce ?
The one that makes women lower on the totem pole than a fertilized egg ?
The one that in Nicaragua has a woman whose life is threatened with cancer , hospitalized at 8 weeks pregnant , refused either an abortion or cancer treatment because the egg , embryo , fetus is so much more important than that woman ’s life ( or the future of her 10 - year - old daughter ) ?
You know the doctrine that says they will excommunicate the mother of a 9 - year - old girl in Brazil because she insisted that her daughter , pregnant with twins as a result of rape by her step - father ( rape of a then - 8 - year - old girl ) be allowed an abortion ?
The one that talks incessantly about the “ sanctity of life ” ( until after you are born ) ?
The Church that supports organizations that threaten to remove the social services they provide to all poor people in the District of Columbia because they find offering insurance benefits to married same sex couples so offensive ?
The Church that refuses to provide even preventive reproductive health care to women while using federal dollars because it “ offends their morals ? ”
The Church of “ abstinence - only ” programs that have resulted in countless teens across this country obtaining sexually - transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies ?
I ask again :
Why is that Congress allows a pedophilia - ridden , pedophilia - hiding , child - abusing Church allowed to write laws about women ’s rights ?
And I am talking about deals cut over the past several years with the consent of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , and other leading Democrats including :
The 11th hour vote on the Stupak Amendment last fall in the health reform debate allowed by Speaker Pelosi after closed door meetings with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops .
The statement by Senator Ben Nelson , author of the limitations in the health care bill that will eliminate women ’s existing coverage of abortion care , that he had to confer with the USSCB on the language he proposed to govern women ’s health and rights ?
The midnight - rewriting in 2008 – the night before a vote –of the original reauthorization bill of the President ’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) in which the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops–aided in this case by Congressman Chris Smith ( R - NJ ) , Congressman Joe Pitts ( R - PA ) , and Congressman Mike Pence ( R - IN ) –worked long into the night with Congressman Howard Berman ( D - CA ) and his staff –with the blessing of the Speaker–to :
deny HIV - positive women access to contraceptive supplies to avoid unwanted pregnancies ( because these women knew already they would not live to raise any child born ) ; r
restrict integration of HIV prevention and family planning services , even though both unintended pregnancies and HIV infection are catastrophic public health problems in Africa and both result from unprotected sexual intercourse ;
re -insert into that bill abstinence - only - until marriage policies despite the fact that the Government Accoutability Office , the Institutes of Medicine and countless other analysts had proven these programs only served to leave people vulnerable to HIV infection .
I am talking about an HIV epidemic in which women now make up the majority of those infected and in which women and girls face the highest rates of new infections .
I am talking about policies that consigned untold numbers of women to death and continue to do so .
I am talking about the Church that is invited into decision - making bodies on teen pregnancy , HIV prevention , comprehensive sex ed , by this Administration , in which the needs of “ faith - based ” organizations continue to take precedence over the health and rights of women , over pro-choice and women ’s rights groups representing the majority of women in the United States , and over public health evidence and human rights in shaping public health policy .
I am talking about a Church which the male - dominated media goes out of its way to protect .
And I am offering here but a few examples of things about which I could easily write a book .
When will this stop ?
When will we actually –not just rhetorically –care more about science than ideology ?
About women ’s rights over a misogynistic male organization that can not even keep its hands off of children .?
Only President Obama and the Democratic Leadership in both the House and Senate can provide those answers and only you can make them do so .
Cyber - security is a growing concern around the world The UK is " reasonably well placed " to cope with a large - scale cyber attack , a report by a group of peers has said .
The Lords EU Home Affairs sub -committee said the internet was under constant threat of disruption from the actions of cyber - criminals and hostile states .
But they said Britain was leading the way in cyber -security within the EU .
And they warned that a plan to simulate the shutdown of the entire EU phone network this year was " over ambitious " as many member states were not ready .
The committe heard from experts , including cyber - security minister Lord West who said measures put in place by the surveillance service GCHQ had improved the UK 's readiness to prevent cyber-attack .
We believe that the government and the EU should be giving greater attention to how cyber - security could be developed on a global basis
Lords EU committee report Last year the UK government staged a simulation of a catastrophic nationwide failure of the phone network , codenamed operation White Noise .
Those taking part were asked to deal with a scenario in which all fixed line and mobile operators in the UK " lost the ability to connect calls both within their own networks and between each other 's systems " because of an unspecified technical fault by a foreign operator , the committee said .
Among the lessons learned from the exercise was that Britain 's privatised phone market " makes establishing priorities for reconnection and co-ordination between the telecoms operators and government following a major incident complex " .
Nato co-operation
The government also found that it needed to work with the telecoms industry " to avoid the obvious problem of not being able to manage a communications failure through lack of communications " , business minister Stephen Timms said in a letter to the committee .
The committee said an EU - wide version of operation White Noise might prove useful , but it said European Commission plans to hold one by the end of 2010 were " unrealistic " .
" Instead , as a first step they should encourage the majority of member states to have carried out national resilience exercises by the end of the year , " it said .
It also urged greater co-operation between the EU and Nato , suggesting a simulation exercise could also be carried out with the US .
" We believe that the government and the EU should be giving greater attention to how cyber - security could be developed on a global basis , " it said .

Folks , this is n't rocket science and the " wow 's " I 'm seeing here are pretty baffling .
The diabetes epidemic in our Native communities is deeply personal to me : all of my siblings , one of whom died in part of complications from it ; an aunt , dead long before I was born , of complications ; the love of my life , who I help battle this disease every day ; his beloved mother , dead of kidney failure and other complications because it went too long undiagnosed .
( Lack of access to adequate medical care exacerbates the problem , and I will be devoting an upcoming diary to the Indian Health Service and its problems . )
It is an epidemic whose seeds were planted 500 years ago , at first contact ; we are now reaping the deadly harvest of its toxic fruit .
WHAT IS DIABETES ?
Diabetes is a disorder that causes an imbalance in the body 's blood glucose and insulin levels .
Glucose powers the body 's most basic functions , and provides fuel for energy .
Insulin is a hormone , produced in the pancreas 's islets of Langerhans , that regulates the uptake and processing of glucose , so that it can function as fuel , rather than simply being stored in fat cells .
Without proper treatment and management , diabetes can lead to stroke , heart disease / failure , kidney disease / failure , renal disease / failure , blindness , limb amputation , and other disabling and often fatal conditions .
Type I diabetes ( formerly , and mistakenly , called " juvenile diabetes " because it was then thought to occur only in children and teenagers ) is generally an autoimmune disorder , in which one 's own body turns on itself , effectively shutting down the pancreas 's ability to produce insulin .
Today , experts know that Type I is not limited to children , and it has been split into two sub- types : Type Ia , in which auto- antibodies are present ( indicating an autoimmune cause ) , and Type Ib , in which auto - antibodies are not present , but the pancreas is completely unable to manufacture insulin ( which may not be autoimmune ) .
Type I patients are dependent on insulin , usually through standard injections or an insulin punp .
Type I formerly was uncommon in communities of color , including Native communities ; it appeared mostly in populations of ethnic European descent .
However , with intermarriage and other factors , Type I is also increasing in Native and other communities of color .
Type II diabetes , on the other hand , is " acquired , " in the sense that it results from a number of external factors , rather than a misfiring of the body 's own immune system .
Poor diet , lack of exercise , alcohol abuse , and , yes , genetics - all can play a role .
With Type II , the pancreas produces insulin , but either 1 ) not enough , or 2 ) it produces enough , but the body is unable to process it effectively .
Type II is rampant in Native communities ( as well as African American communities ) , and the numbers are growing every day .
Worse , it is now appearing at epidemic rates in our children and teenagers - age groups that not long ago were thought to be unable to develop Type II .
Type II diabetics may be treated with oral medications , insulin injections , or both .
The American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) estimates that 95 % of all diabetic American Indians and Alaska Natives have Type II diabetes , which will be the primary focus of this diary .
The ADA also estimates that another 30 % of all non-diabetic American Indians and Alaska Natives have a pre-diabetic condition , such as metabolic syndrome .
" Hybrid diabetes " contains characteristics of both Type Ia and Type II .
There are also other less common forms : " untyped diabetes , " that does not fall precisely into the Type I or II categories ; " gestational diabetes , " which occurs during pregnancy ; and diabetes that occurs as a result of illness , trauma , medication , pancreatic disease , etc .
These are beyond the scope of this diary .
ETHNIC INDICATORS
Only in recent years has the federal government become interested in funding research into ethnic disparities in the incidence of diabetes .
Data are further limited by many of the same factors that skew research into any issue that affects underserved communities : poverty , lack of access to medical , lack of access to studies and clinical trials , language and cultural barriers , distrust of governmental and / or dominant - culture endeavors , and lack of effective outreach to such communities .
However , the issue is now on the radar of the national Institutes of Health and the Department of Health and Human Services , which publishes the following 2006 statistics :
* American Indian / Alaska Native adults were 2.7 times as likely as white adults to be diagnosed with diabetes .
* American Indians / Alaska Natives were almost twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to die from diabetes in 2006 .
* American Indian / Alaska Native adults were 1.6 times as likely as White adults to be obese .
* American Indian / Alaska Native adults were 1.3 times as likely as White adults to have high blood pressure .
And an analysis of the 2005 patient population of the Indian Health Service produced the following statistics :
* Data from the 2005 IHS user population database indicate that 14.2 percent of the American Indians and Alaska Natives ages 20 years or older who received care from IHS had diagnosed diabetes .
After adjusting for population age differences , 16.5 percent of the total adult population served by IHS had diagnosed diabetes , with rates varying by region from 6 percent among Alaska Native adults to 29.3 percent among American Indian adults in southern Arizona .
* After adjusting for population age differences , 2004 to 2006 national survey data for people ages 20 years or older indicate that 6.6 percent of non-Hispanic whites , 7.5 percent of Asian Americans , 10.4 percent of Hispanics , and 11.8 percent of non-Hispanic blacks had diagnosed diabetes .
Among Hispanics , rates were 8.2 percent for Cubans , 11.9 percent for Mexican Americans , and 12.6 percent for Puerto Ricans .
Got that ?
American Indian / Alaska Native adults had a diabetes diagnosis rate of 16.5 % .
compared to 6.6 % for non-Hispanic whites .
The Pima in southern Arizona led the rate of diagnosis , at a staggering 29.3 % .
In practical terms , what these numbers mean is that Native Americans have the highest age - adjusted incidence of diabetes of any ethnic group .
And these are just those who have been diagnosed .
Thousands more go undiagnosed for years - often until they die from complications resulting from undiagnosed diabetes .
In 2006 , diabetes was the seventh - leading cause of death in the United States .
However , Native Americans constitute a disproportionately high percentage of members of that particular demographic : Diabetes - related mortality rates are substantially higher in Native populations : 39.6 per 100,000 , compared to 1.9 per 100,000 for non-Hispanic whites .
Keep in mind , however , that these number are almost certainly much lower than the reality : A study of 1986 data found that , on death certificates , Native American ancestry was underreported at a rate of 65 % .
The same analysis concluded that diabetes was 4.3 times more likely to be the underlying cause of death for those listed on their death certificates as Native American than for whites .
And the rates are getting worse , not better .
Part of this may be attributable to higher rates of diagnosis , but the largest part is undoubtedly higher actual incidence .
CHILD AND TEEN GROWTH RATES
The American Diabetes Association reports that the decade between 1994 and 2004 saw a 68 % increase in Type II diabetes among self - identified American Indians and Alaska Natives between the ages of 15 and 19 .
Read that again for a moment : nearly a 70 % jump in diabetes among older teenagers - in one decade .
According to the Indian Health Service :
American Indian and Alaska Native children have obesity rates of 40 % , four times the rate for the general population .
Obesity is one of the greatest risk factors for developing Type II diabetes - and obesity among children and teenagers is rampant among American society generally , as well as in Native communities particularly .
WHY NATIVE POPULATIONS ARE AT GREATER RISK
We are a mere 100 years removed from living as hunter / gatherers , our ancestral methods of sustaining our peoples .
Indeed , experts often describe us as coming from " hunter - gatherer societies " , and as having a " thrifty " genetic type , biologically engineered to store food as fat during times of plenty , to provide fuel and sustenance during extended periods when food was scarce , such as winter , drought , or migration .
In other words , our bodies had adapted perfectly to our physical environment .
But with contact came the reservation .
With the reservation came deprivation : of our traditional hunting grounds , including the wanton destruction of the buffalo herds ; of the environments where we harvested food , herbs , and medicine ; of our ancestral lands when many of our tribes engaged in sophisticated farming and crop rotation practices ; of access to many of our cultural and spiritual traditions and methods of healing .
And with the reservation came new dangers : of previously - unknown infectious agents and disease ; of tobacco ( not the old asemaa of our medicine persons , consisting of herbs such as red willow bark , bearberry , and mullein , but the modern asemaa of tar and nicotine ) ; of alcohol ( not the fermented medicine and ceremonial drinks of our ancestors , but whiskey , rum , and moonshine ) ; of a diet restricted to non-indigenous foods , that would eventually become a diet consisting almost entirely of refined , processed foods low in protein and complex carbohydrates but high in simple carbs and trans fats .
And residents of modern reservations , with median household incomes well below the federal poverty line ( often well below $ 10,000 per year ) and with staggering rates of unemployment ( as much as 85 % ) , often must rely almost wholly on government welfare programs , including refined and processed commodity foods .
Whole grains , fresh produce , and other healthy foods are far too expensive , and on many reservations , there are no grocery stores or markets that carry such items anyway .
And over the years , refined ingredients have infiltrated the recipes for our traditional foods , so that here in the Southwest , for example , people have for decades used bleached , refined white flour in their tortillas - because it is both available and affordable .
And thus is a staple of the traditional diet converted into an instrument of disease .
ACTION : WHAT YOU CAN DO
On the personal level :
* If you 're of Native ancestry , get tested .
It only takes a pinprick on the end of a finger .
*
If you have loved ones of Native ancestry , encourage them to do the same .
*
If you or a loved one gets a diagnosis of diabetes , enroll in a diabetes management program .
* Eat right .
Exercise .
Do n't smoke ; do n't drink .
Monitor your glucose levels , and take charge of your own health .
On the local level :
* If you live on or near a reservation , encourage the development of tribal diabetes education and management programs .
* Support related culturally - appropriate non-profit efforts and local businesses that serve such populations .
* Encourage cultural education and sensitivity .
On the national level :
* Contact your members of Congress ; demand that they fulfill the nation 's statutory obligation to fund the Indian Health Service ( IHS ) fully .
* Lobby for additional funding for culturally - appropriate diabetes research and prevention programs through IHS .
* Lobby for federal funding for tribal initiatives to maintain diabetes management and traditional treatment programs , including tobacco and alcohol cessation programs .
* Lobby for federal funding for investment and development dollars to bring healthy food initiatives and businesses to reservations .
* Demand that federal assistance programs distribute healthy foods , such as whole grains , and provide access to fresh fruits and vegetables .
* Lobby for funding for research and development , through the National Institutes of Health , the Indian Health Service , and the Association of American Indian Physicians , dedicated to prevention , treatment , and education programs in Native populations .

Cancer patient and former employee of the year Joseph Casias says he was unfairly fired from WalMart after he tested positive for a controlled substance .
He ’s a registered Michigan medical marijuana patient , reports Smita Kalokhe of FOX 17 News .
​ Casias says he ’s battled sinus cancer and an inoperable brain tumor for 11 years .
Most of the time , he ’s treated his pain with a concoction of pharmaceutical pain killers .
But when Michigan legalized marijuana for medical purposes , he signed up .
Casias is one of the state ’s 10,022 registered patients .
In the remote past – and to be more precise , in 1955 – the people of the Soviet Union had many victories , discoveries and inventions pickaback .
But still , there were also many things that they were deprived of ; and the main thing that they lacked for above all was not money , welfare or something material .
It was the thing that each of them was gazing at all night round and dreaming that someday this mysterious and unexplored world would enter their lives .
In the middle of 50’s authorities of the USSR decided to take their chances and try to dip into the future and make a slide film describing spaceflight of the first Soviet spacecraft that was supposed to be launched in 1975 .
Did they miss ?
Yeah , they did .
But , anyways , let ’s dream a bit and imagine ourselves the world two decades later …
Enjoy the film !
One moody November morning we get a newspaper and see the article which says that on the 25 - th of November , 10 am , first interplanetary vehicle will be launched for the Moon .
Here we can see a crew of the first spaceship Luna - 1 .
The interplanetary station is located at the foot of Kazbek mountain .
The spacecraft will be launched from a summit of the mountain which will help to cut the necessary fuel supply .
And eventually the day has come , and it is November 25 , morning .
It is winter in the mountains and there are lots of scientists , workers , journalists and friends along with relatives of the crew gathered at the station to see their heroes off and wish them good luck .
At 10 o’clock prompt the spaceship is supposed to be launched off .
Take - off runway engines drag a platform with the spacecraft on it for 25 seconds to reach the start point and after that the spaceship is already flying with the speed of 600 meters per second .
During the flight , engines will be engaged only for something about ten minutes .
At 10:07 Luna - 1 reached the necessary speed and all engines were shut off .
By 12 pm Luna - 1 passed 39,000 kilometers what was equal to 1/10 part of their whole way .
Travelers admiring their dear planet ; it is night in the Western Hemisphere while the Asian sun literally burns .
But nothing can be so easy .
Soon after an air stone suddenly popped out of nowhere .
Thanks
God that the Earth ’s scientists have already had care of everything .
All the engines of Luna - 1 received a special wireless signal and switched the direction .
Day second .
Everything ’s okay on board and the crew do n’t feel themselves bored as TV and radio are set on .
There is a doctor on board who systematically inspects his patients and keeps their health steady .
November 27 , 11:12 am one of the crew members sent a message to the Earth saying in it that a bit later they would set the main engine on and would be slowing down little by little .
All the crew are petrified standing near the illuminators and gazing at the alien planet which grows bigger with every single second .
It is 12:55 pm and just a few instanced before landing .
Quite a strong but rather pillowy jolt pushed the cosmonauts down .
The engines got quiet , Luna - 1 landed on the Moon .
The travelers embrace each other and one of them says : “ Get ready !
Coming out now ! ” .
And they walked out into the immortal silence of a dormant planet .
They were n’t walking ; they were leaping over the ground .
They were so light , but regardless of it their footprints were for ever left in the centuries - old dust of the Moon .

Elmore Leonard insists he does n't get offended when Hollywood screws up the adaptation of one of his books .
" I do n’t take ‘ em too seriously , " says the legendary author of crime novels and Westerns like " Out of Sight , " " Get Shorty " and " 3:10 to Yuma . "
" I think you get too many people working on a movie .
They all throw in their ideas , and then if you ’re important enough , they ’re going to use your idea .
There ’s nothing you can do about that . "
But if you start asking the 84 - year - old Leonard , whose U.S. Marshal character Raylan Givens is at the center of FX 's exciting new crime series " Justified , " what he thought of specific adaptations ( more than two dozen of his novels and short stories have been made into movies or TV shows ) , you can see that his memory is very long , as are the durations of his grudges .
Take , for instance , the 1997 TV - movie adaptation of " Pronto , " one of several Leonard books to feature Givens , played there by James LeGros .
" Oh , " he says , responding to the sound of LeGros ' name as if he just ate a bad melon .
" Ohhhh .
James LeGros , is he still acting ? "
He is , I tell him ( on NBC ’s " Mercy " ) .
Leonard does not look pleased to hear this , though the only specific complaint he ’ll make about " Pronto " and LeGros is , " They got the wrong hat for him . "
We talk about director Barry Sonnenfeld ’s 1995 version of " Get Shorty , " the first truly successful ( in both creative and commercial terms ) Leonard adaptation after a long fallow period .
The conversation quickly turns to how the creative team on the sequel , " Be Cool , " got wrong so much of what Sonnenfeld and writer Scott Frank got right .
" I told Barry Sonnenfeld , ‘ When somebody delivers a funny line , do n’t cut to someone else laughing or nudging or grinning , because they ’re all serious , ’ " he recalls .
" And he knew that .
But then when they shot the sequel , they forgot all about that , and everybody ’s laughing all the way through .
There ’s a guy named Cedric the Entertainer ( in the cast ) .
Well , I ca n’t have a guy named Cedric the Entertainer in one of my stories ! "
" Justified , " adapted by Graham Yost ( " Boomtown " ) and starring Timothy Olyphant ( " Deadwood " ) , so far has the Leonard seal of approval .
" I think it ’s great , " Leonard says , in the same succinct manner of speaking that he gives to most of his characters .
Though even with this version , he ’s not entirely in love with the hat — a large , crisp Stetson that sets Givens apart from the modern - day Marshals he works alongside .
" I think he ought to just chuck it , " Leonard says .
" What ’s he need it for ?
He ’s not in the West ; he ’s from Kentucky .
I think it ’s got out of hand .
It ’s not the hat that he wears in the book — which is the small , little businessman ’s Stetson , but well - worn , and crushed and disfigured . "
Yost acknowledges that he and Leonard had a difference of opinion on the hat —
" We got very specific photographs , about , ‘ This is the hat , ’ " he says , " but you have to find a hat that fits Tim . " — but overall found that the wisest way to do an Elmore Leonard adaptation is to follow a mantra that he eventually had made into a bracelet he gave to all of his writers : " WWED , " or " What Would Elmore Do ? "
" In terms of adapting ( him ) , I ’d always felt that the best jobs had been done by Scott Frank in ‘ Get Shorty ’ and ‘ Out of Sight , ’ " he says , " and I always felt that one reason his work was so strong in adapting Elmore was that it seemed to me he used a lot of Elmore ’s dialogue in the scripts .
And there were points when I was writing the pilot where , literally , I would be thinking , ‘ What ’s Raylan going to say next ? ’
And I would go , ‘ Well , what does Elmore have him saying next ?
And let ’s try that , because that will be good . ’ "
The pilot episode is adapted from Leonard ’s short story " Fire in the Hole " ( from the collection " When the Women Come Out to Dance " ) .
Later episodes did n’t have specific Leonard dialogue to borrow , so Yost has tried to capture the lean , tense and funny spirit of Leonard ’s books even without the specific language — an approach he feels too many of the previous Leonard adapters ignored .
" The problem with anything is when people think they can improve upon it , " he says .
" I think that ’s pretty dangerous with Elmore .
He ’s pretty great as it is .
You get Peter Jackson to do ‘ Lord of the Rings ’ because he loves ‘ Lord of the Rings . ’
You get someone to do Elmore Leonard because they love Elmore Leonard , not because they want to make a cop movie . "
Though Leonard was pleased with the earliest movie adaptations of his Western stories , like 1957 ’s " The Tall T " and the original " 3:10 to Yuma " ( he calls the recent Russell Crowe remake " overdone " ) , there was a long period from the late ‘ 60s through " Get Shorty " where one director after another struggled to get it right — even when Leonard wrote the screenplays himself .
" I never got the opportunity , when I was writing screenplays , to work with a good director , so he and I could steer it to exactly where we wanted it , " he says .
" So I decided in 1993 that ‘ I ’m not writing anymore screenplays . ’
That was just a lot of work . "
One of those directors was Burt Reynolds , who was coming to the end of his run as the world ’s biggest movie star when he directed and acted in a 1985 version of Leonard ’s " Stick , " where Leonard feels Reynolds ’ vanity got in the way of the movie .
" Burt said , ‘ Do you think I should leave my rug off for this picture ? ’ " he remembers .
" I said , ‘ Yeah , you do n’t need your rug . ’
But he was talking about his little rug - that he would leave on his little one . "
Then came the mid-late ‘ 90s trifecta of " Get Shorty , " Quentin Tarantino ’s " Jackie Brown " ( based on Leonard ’s " Rum Punch " ) and Steven Soderbergh ’s " Out of Sight . " " Get Shorty " was the only one to be a big hit at the time , but all three proved that it was possible to capture the spirit of the books even if certain big changes were made .
" Jackie Brown " — which Leonard cited as the movie that most closely evokes his writing — changed the main character ’s race , while " Out of Sight " bank robber Jack Foley went from looking like Harry Dean Stanton in the book to George Clooney in the movie .
( Leonard liked the casting choice so much that Foley became much younger and handsomer in the sequel " Road Dogs , " as part of Leonard ’s so - far - unsuccessful attempt to get Clooney to play the character again . )
Not every adaptation in the years since has worked .
Sonnenfeld himself produced a short - lived TV version of " Maximum Bob " that Leonard hated ( " I asked , ‘ What are you gonna call it ?
Hee - Haw : The Movie ? ’ " ) , and Leonard felt " Karen Sisco " ( a TV spin - off of " Out of Sight " with Carla Gugino in the Jennifer Lopez role ) failed because the writers could n’t settle on one take on the character .
And , as always , some adaptations just never got made .
In the ‘ 80s , Dustin Hoffman wanted to do " LaBrava , " but the experience infamously became such a headache that Leonard turned it into fodder for " Get Shorty . "
More recently , he says the Coen brothers wrote a few drafts of a screenplay based on " Cuba Libre , " " but they did n’t quite get it .
They were n’t with it as far as Westerns were concerned . "
So far , Leonard is on board with " Justified , " but if it ultimately does n’t work , he ’ll shrug and move on .
" I ’ve always felt that it ’s up in the air , " he says .
" What they do to it might be good or bad .
They might make it better , they might not .
So it ’s up to them .
It becomes something else . "

Groupon users , choose sides .
Earlier this week , law firm Edelson McGuire filed a class action lawsuit against Groupon , a Chicago - based company that offers daily discounts online to local businesses .
The lawsuit accuses Groupon of violating gift certificate laws by including expiration dates on the discounts .
Groupon CEO and founder Andrew Mason responded to the lawsuit on his blog , saying he would fight fire with fire .
" In fact , we 've decided that the best way to respond is by organizing our own class action , ” he wrote .
“ If there actually are customers out there that feel like we 've let them down , we want to get them their money as quickly as possible .
Join our class action here . "
Groupon , which launched in October 2008 , has 2.6 million subscribers in 38 cities .
The company ’s rapid growth has spawned a slew of rivals .
Last month , Groupon filed a lawsuit in Florida accusing another company of trademark infringement .
The class - action suit filed by Edelson McGuire on Tuesday states , " Groupon employs a business model where consumers are enticed to purchase a gift certificate , and after the consumer agrees to purchase the certificate , Groupon imposes post - contractual terms on the consumer containing illegal expiration dates . ”
The suit says Groupon “ expressly advertises itself as a company that does not impose , in its own words , ' gotchas , ' on the consumer .
In clear violation of the law , Groupon imposes illegal terms or ' gotchas , ' post - agreement , on the very consumers it prides itself on helping . ”
( Read the full lawsuit against Groupon here ) .
Groupon ’s Mason responded to the lawsuit on the company 's blog , GrouBlogpon.com .
" As a company with one of the most irrationally liberal customer satisfaction policies on the planet ( we refund anyone that feels like Groupon let them down for any reason ) we 're baffled by this whole thing , " Mason wrote .
( To read Groupon 's " irrationally liberal customer satisfaction " policy , check out Mason 's Feb. 2 , 2010 blog post , which explains " The Groupon promise . " )
In his blog , Mason took shots at the Edelson McGuire lawsuit .
" We can think of two possible explanations for this lawsuit , ” Mason wrote .
“ 1 . The law firm sees an opportunity to exploit our success and make a bunch of money .
“ 2 . We are indeed systematically deceiving our customers , but instead of taking advantage of our 100 percent open refund policy or telling us about their problems or sharing them in a public forum , our customers are secretly gossiping about them to each other and Edelson McGuire , kind of like Emily Johnson did against me in 9th grade ( Emily if you are reading this I want my cabbage patch doll back ) .
" So Groupon users , you have options .
Which class - action will you join ?

Aliou Niane was born in Guinea West Africa , but due to decisions he had no control over , he found himself in North Korea from 1982 - 87 .
He is currently writing his memoir in French about the years he spent there and generously agreed to an email interview .
Niane ’s story is interesting , if not for the insider ’s look he can give into what life was like for a foreigner living in North Korea during the 1980s , but also for the information he can provide about the historical ties between Guinea West Africa and the DPRK , a relationship that has not been sufficiently documented in English .
Niane ’s years north of the DMZ were the result of an agreement between his country ’s first president , Ahmed Sekou Toure , and Kim Il Sung .
For those unfamiliar with Ahmed Sekou Toure , he was a hardline communist who reigned with an iron fist using fear , hunger and a strong police state where trust did not even exist between friends , family members , students or the military .
According to Niane , everybody feared for their lives during his reign as president .
Niane told me that in 1982 , Toure attended Kim Il Sung ’s 70th birthday celebration in Pyongyang .
It was there that Kim offered Toure the opportunity to send 10 Guinean students to be educated in agricultural technologies at Wonsan Agricultural College .
There , the students would learn juche ideology on shared community agricultural methods .
Guinea had already adopted government controlled farming practices and food distribution in the 1970s but this would be the first time Guinean students would be instructed according to North Korea ’s particular system based on juche .
Upon his return to Guinea , Toure asked his Minister of High Education to provide him with a list of his 10 best students from the country ’s agriculture universities and faculties .
These chosen 10 would be sent to North Korea .
Niane told me that at that time in Guinea , all scholarships were signed by the Ministry of High Education , thus making the scholarships for the 10 chosen students , which included himself , documents signed by a presidential decree .
“ To be honest , I was excited as many of my age would have been back then , ” Â he wrote to me via email .
“ Many Guineans were ignorant about the reality of North Korea as there was propaganda about North Korean diplomacy within my country .
Â Niane said that despite his efforts of learning as much as he could about his future host country , all he could find on North Korea in French were magazines and a few propaganda books on Korean socialism or “ successes ” Â achieved under Kim Il Sung .
“ Does that mean I would not have gone had I known the reality of North Korean life ?
No .
Did I have the choice not to go ?
No .
Could my family have interceded on my behalf with the request that I study in another country ?
No .
So what could I do ?
Nothing but go study for my country , for the socialist system that nurtured me for 20 plus years .
That is what we called “ Ëcommunism democracy , ’ or the right of the establishment over the right of an individual , ” Â he said .
“ It is also known as the power of the politburo over the citizen .
Having no choice , the only thing that remained was to go and study and get the best out of it .Â
Toward the end of the 1982 , Niane and nine other Guinean students found themselves at Wonsan Nongop Daihak ( Wonsan Agricultural College ) .
“ I spent months and even years crying whenever I was alone during my time there , ” Â he wrote .
“ But despite the difficulties I endured , I am very grateful for the level of education offered to me by my great Korean professors .
When Westerners show a bias toward North Korea ’s education system , I always tell them how North Korea has one of the highest literacy rates in the world .
Almost everyone can read and write hangul .
I think one of the reasons I am still interested in North Korea is that I wish to see my former professors and North Korean citizens live in a free world like the one I am enjoying today .Â
After five years , which included one year of Korean language study and four years in agricultural management economics , Niane graduated with excellence from the college and was decorated as one of the best graduating students .
He was even offered the opportunity to teach juche idealism in his home country of Guinea , but he declined .
He had a better idea .
“ My goal was to escape to Japan , which I did when the DPRK Education Ministry officially released me to the Guinean embassy authorities in Beijing where it was expected that I ’d return to Guinea .Â
Niane said that from Beijing , he went to Hong Kong and from there to Tokyo where he lived for 13 years .
“ When talking about North Korea , I have to let people know that I have a passion for the country , but I feel pain for the wonderful professors I left there .
“ If it was not for North Korea ’s totalitarian regime , I believe the people there would have the creativity to really develop their country , ” Â he wrote .
“ But that would first mean the collapse of Kim ’s Communist dynasty and the ultimate reunification of the country .
“ I have no shame today in telling people that North Korea gave me the last part of my college education .
But I also tell people how my time there shaped my conviction that all people should live free from any form of dictatorship .Â
Niane added that his time in the DPRK made him realize that the North Korean regime operated similar to Toure ’s regime in his country Guinea .
Both governments ruled by fear and public executions .
“ I do not want it to appear that I am supporting North Korea over the South or the South over the North , ” Â he said .
“ I just want to see a unified Korea like the one under the banner of Kokuryo . Â 
What follows is our lengthy interview about Niane ’s years in North Korea .
Due to the sensitivity of some of my questions , he did not answer everything I asked , but he did answer most , providing very interesting details about life as a foreign student in North Korea during the 1980s .
What was life like for you in North Korea ?
Could you describe a typical day ?
I arrived in Pyongyang as one among 10 Guinean students on Monday morning , December 1982 .
I left in September 1987 .
After a week in Pyongyang where we underwent screening and procedural paperwork by the [ North ] Korean Ministry of Education , we were sent to Wonsan Agricultural University in January 1983 .
There , we lived in a newly constructed four - story building which was on the campus reserved for foreign students .
By the time we arrived , students from Madagascar , Mali , Tanzania , Equatorial Guinea , Cambodia , Ethiopia , the Kingdom of Lesotho , and civilian and military scholarship students from Zambia were already studying the Korean language .
In total , we were about 80 students from mainly African countries , however the Cambodians were later transferred to another university unknown to me .
In North Korea , the school year starts in September , but we Guinean students did n’t arrive until late December that year .
All ten of us studied the Korean language for seven months ( January “ “ July 1983 ) and were in the same class from September 1983 .
Our Korean language teacher was a wonderful person , a very dedicated professional , however he was not a linguist and could barely speak French .
The Korean - French dictionary available to us was old and not suitable for academia .
We had to rely on Korean grammar books written for Korean students , not ones designed for foreigners .
After seven months of intensive course study we were able to handle basic conversations .
So during the first year , we studied Korean language from 8:00 AM “ “ 1:00 PM .
In the afternoon , most students played soccer but I played basketball and also did some track & field .
We had a very boring routine : School in the morning , sports in the afternoon and homework at night .
We certainly did close to 1,000 hours of book reading , homework , research , etc. Every Saturday night we played cards ( French belote ) .
Our card group consisted mostly of Guineans ( including myself ) , one Malian and one Malagasy ( Madagascan ) student .
However , we were n’t happy in our new surroundings .
In the summer of 1983 , following a North Korean plane crash in Guinea , a high level Guinean delegation was sent to Pyongyang to present official government condolences to Kim Il Sung .
We students took this opportunity to meet the four visiting members of the Guinean government which included Mr. Mamady Keita , Minister of Higher Education and a member of the Politburo and the Party ’s Central Committee ; Mr. Louis Senainon Behanzin , Minister of Information and Ideology and also a member of the Party ’s Central Committee ; Mr. Habib Diallo , Ambassador of Guinea with residence in Beijing ; and Mr. Mamoudou Toure , First Secretary at the Embassy of Guinea and also in residence in Beijing .
( Even though Guinea had a diplomatic relationship with North Korea , it had no consulate in Pyongyang , so the ambassador and his staff all lived in Beijing . )
We students went to our meeting with the visiting delegation with one goal in mind : to get out of the DPRK .
We thought the meeting would be our chance for transfer to another country , hopefully somewhere in Eastern Europe , or to return to Guinea .
We were just innocent kids who did not know the meaning of la raison d’Ã Â©tat , the right of the State over the individual citizen .
The day of our meeting with the Guinean authorities , we boarded our old Hino bus as usual ( it was a bus reserved only for foreign students by the North Korean Ministry of Education ) , expecting it would take us to the meeting .
But that day , North Korean officials told us that for security reasons the bus was not allowed in the vicinity of the foreign guest palace .
After hours of fruitless discussions and arguments , we agreed to take the vehicles the Communist Party had sent to pick us up in — Mercedes Benzes — which were waiting for us in front of the Kumgansan Hotel in Pyongyang .
The five German luxury cars took two students each to the palace of the delegation .
Judging by the name of the compound , it looked to be a government restricted area with well - trimmed lawns and the flag of the guest country in the front yard .
It also seemed kind of like a working retreat for the Communist party leaders .
The Guinean government members were informed of our arrival and went on to witness “ how well ” Â Guinean students were being treated in North Korea .
These ministers , along with the ambassador and his first secretary , looked through the windows and saw us getting out of luxurious Mercedes Benz cars .
At our meeting , we looked around and quickly realized that the highest ranked person in the room was Mamady Keita , the Minister of Education who at that time , was a member of the Politburo and Central Committee of the Guinean Unique Party .
He had supreme responsibility of the Guinean education system .
After only five minutes , ( the time it took us to read the manifesto we prepared against North Korea ’s political system , the provision of rudimentary equipment and the juche - based education system ) , our list of complaints was long enough for our ministers to let a bunch of crazy kids lament on their difficult conditions without a slap on the face .
We were interrupted by Senainon Behanzin , the Minister of Information and Ideology who said , quote : “ You are extremely dangerous to the Socialist system you are supposed to defend .
Â Turning his head toward the Minister of Education and the ambassador , he said that we were the lost kids of the Guinean education system .
“ This is worrying , ” Â he had said .
“ What if their manifesto is leaked to the enemies ?
” Â ( South Korea , Japan , the U.S. or Western Europe ) .
We would be an embarrassment to the Guinean government and its people .
The Minister of Education , Mamady Keita , then stated that Guinea had lost many of its children in the past and losing a few more would not change a damn thing in the course of the Socialist agenda .
Then he turned to us and said that he was offering us two choices : Stay in North Korea and study for the country and the Guinean revolution , or take the flight with them back to Guinea .
But he quickly warned us .
Quote : “ I have enough seats for 10 students , but mind you , if you get onto my aircraft your fathers and mothers will never hear about you again .
Â
He once again asked : “ Who wants to study and who wants to get onto the airplane ? ” Â 
We all responded that we would go back to school and study .
I guess we were immature in thinking that we would be immune from government anger with our request .
But before we were dismissed from the meeting , the Minister of Education instructed Ambassador Habib Diallo and the first secretary of the embassy to give us a blank sheet of paper and have each student write a motion of fidelity to the Guinean government , the country and the Socialist regime which was erroneously called the Guinean Revolution in comparison to the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 .
We were also to fill out a separate document with the names of our parents and their professions .
I did the paperwork and completed it with the sentence , “ PrÃ  Âªt Pour La Revolution , ” Â or “ Ready for the revolution , ” Â a popular slogan that was required to be on any official document .
I was 23 years old and knew that my chance of getting out of North Korea was over .
I believed my fellow students also felt the same way .
It was then that I vowed to study hard and get out of the country .
For the record , Mamady Keita was known by most Guinean politicians and military insiders for his taste for blood .
He was a cold - blooded killer .
He once said he shot a former female minister until smoke came out her nose .
Just to emphasize how lucky we were , Keita had the power to terminate our scholarships right there and have us executed for treason .
He could have easily sent 10 new students to Wonsan just to maintain a good diplomatic relationship with Pyongyang .
But luckily , history decided otherwise .
In less than a year after that meeting , on April 4 , 1984 , the first Guinean president , Ahmed Sekou Toure , died from a heart attack while on the operating table in Cleveland , Ohio where he had been urgently transported due to serious heart problems .
One week later , his bodyguard took over power through a military coup .
In September of that same year , Mamady Keita , along with many of his fellow ministers , was executed by firing squad without accusation or any judicial procedure , just the way he used to do to others .
As the French proverb says , “ He who uses the sword will perish by the sword .Â
A few years later I read a memoir called “ La verite du ministre .
Â
In English , “ The Truth of the Minister , ” Â written by Abdoulaye Portos Diallo , a former Guinean Minister of Sport , Art and Culture , who spent 10 years of his valuable life in the Guinean concentration camp where he was tortured by his fellow ministers — again Mamady Keita ’s name was among the interrogators .
According to many accounts and memoirs , Mamady Keita enjoyed killing .
This was the dark side of my country .
I am grateful I survived it .
Could you move about freely within North Korea ?
No , movement between cities was restricted .
This law applied to both North Koreans and foreign students .
We were not to leave campus alone without prior authorization .
Needless to say we did n’t always obey that rule .
But we were not allowed to go to the next village for snacks or to meet the people who lived there .
The university was 6 - 8 kilometers away from the city so a Hino bus owned by the DPRK Ministry of Education used solely by the foreign students traveled twice a week between the university and Wonsan city .
The bus was made in Japan — a red and white striped Hino .
However the Hino sign was removed and replaced by a rectangular metal piece with the inscription : Ã­Ââ°Ã¬ââ  Ã«Â²â Ã¬Å Â¤ ÃªÂ³ÂµÃ¬Å¾Â¥ ( Pyongyang Bus Factory ) .
We knew Hino buses , we had a few of them in Guinea .
In the city off campus , we were permitted to go to only three places in the summer and one in winter :
An old hotel in Wonsan City called Songdowon Hotel , Wonsan Beach , and a national park called Songdowon Park .
( You may recall the strategic location of Wonsan Beach during the Korean War . )
We were under supervision all the time by a party member , as well as a person who was deemed responsible for our daily activities .
Sometimes a university administrative clerk accompanied us .
Basically , we were followed all the time by two or three Koreans from different institutions .
But I really did love Wonsan Agricultural College ( Ã¬âºÂ Ã¬â Â°Ã«â ÂÃ¬– … Ã« Åâ ¬Ã­â¢â¢ ) which was an old German church converted into a school following the World War in 1948 .
There is a mountain at the back of the foreign students ’ campus very close to the building and separated by a large rice farm meticulously managed in the valley .
However , one thing I noticed off campus is that there were no pictures in most places except ones of Kim Il Sung , or monuments and bronze statues of his figure , and these were inside hotels or other authorized places .
Also , we were not to be served in any restaurant – only the student campus cafeteria or a designated hotel restaurant and no one was to be allowed in the cafeteria at the same time as the foreign students — not even professors or members of the Communist Party or higher authorities from Pyongyang ’s Education Ministry .
We were not to mingle with other Korean students during our first year , but from the second year onward , we had Korean classmates sent to live with us in our dormitories with the pretext of helping us improve our Korean language skills and help us study .
We complained that we were only one year from graduating from Guinea agricultural engineering , and therefore we did not need help with math and science .
In fact we were far more advanced than the young Koreans in some subjects because we had the equivalent of a Master ’s degree in our country prior to receiving the scholarship to study at Wonsan .
( Because the Guinean government wanted to promote a good image by sending only its best students to study abroad , we were often 2 - 3 years older than our classmates and were in some cases learning in Korean what we already knew in French . )
We could not dissuade the Communist Party representative from putting Korean students among us in our dormitories .
These students were carefully selected and kept a daily log on every good or “ bad ” Â thing we did .
I finally understood that such actions were not limited to the foreign students ; teachers were put under the same scrutiny as well as anyone who had access to the campus or classrooms .
Except the Korean students permitted to live and study with us , all other students avoided us .
No doubt they avoided us out of fear of punishment .
Of course , we made a few friends off campus in the neighboring villages and city , but those open - minded , nice people were always in danger of being arrested by the police or of being denounced .
For North Koreans , meeting foreign students without prior authorization was considered treason , meaning that it was viewed as an act of passing sensitive information on to a foreign organization and therefore punishable by hard labor for the “ offending ” Â Korean and expulsion for the accused foreign student .
However , no students were ever expelled during my five years in North Korea .
How did North Koreans treat people who were not Asian ?
Officially we were all respected , we were all called Comrade _____ ( Comrade and last name ) as in Soviet style .
Only Korean teachers and doctors were called ( Ã¬â Ã¬Æ ÂÃ«â ¹Ë ) “ mister , ” Â “ professor ” Â or “ doctor . Â 
North Korean people were generally respectful to foreigners but that did not mean we were treated like residents .
We understood they were curious to know more about us , but in a totalitarian state like the DPRK , we ultimately were not trusted .
We were ( secretly ) under observation by civilians , the police and the military .
And we knew it because we were told during the first meeting with the Ministry of Education of North Korea that we would have to adapt to our new life and environment which might be different from Africa .
In the city , a lone student would not have a quiet walk .
For one reason or another someone ( generally authorized people only ) would come to us and offer to help guide us get back to campus with the pretext that we were lost , even if we said we were not .
During that time ( 1982 - 1987 ) , there was no public transportation between the university and Wonsan that could take us to or from the campus .
Therefore , the only way to get back to the university was to walk 6 “ “ 8 kilometers .
As for the Hino bus we used , it only traveled twice a week to the three specific areas which we were allowed to visit .
Did you ever feel you were in danger ?
Not once .
I never felt I was in danger in the sense of the Western world .
But we all knew we were valuable propaganda assets to the Communist Party in North Korea and to the Guinean government which was expecting aid from the North .
To show people how wonderful North Korea was , the propaganda media would tell North Korean citizens that they had very good lives .
As proof , they were told to just look at how many African students were living and studying in their country .
The main problem for North Koreans was that they could never admit that we could not be brainwashed at age 22 with a degree in college from Guinea .
I would argue with most Koreans about Karl Marx and Lenin , but they would be surprised or offended that I did not mention Kim Il Sung because according to them , he developed the best philosophical theory ever thought by the greatest thinkers in the world .
( When it came to class work , I soon realized that if I were to get a good grade , it ’d be best to know when to argue and when to give people the answer they expected . )
How you would assess education in North Korea , back then at least , for agriculture students ?
As I was in the faculty of agricultural management economics , I certainly had more juche courses than other students .
I also had more hours of Korean history , mainly on the history of the Korean Labor Party ( ie. Kim Il Sung ) , WWII and the Korean war , which was censored .
For my classes , North Korean history books all started in 1945 – anything before that date was available only at the library and not accessible to all students .
Only authorized people would have access to books considered sensitive .
Most history books were classified and not part of the curriculum .
I got the chance to read a few of those books , but I was often admonished for reading such old ideas ( Ã« Å â ¢Ã ¬ Ââ¬ Ã¬â  Â¬Ã¬ÆÂ ) .
We had excellent professors who were well educated but limited by the Korean Labor Party on what they were allowed to teach and the way to teach it .
As we studied with other young Korean students , the professors had to be careful what not to say and how to handle questions from foreign students .
At the Department of Agricultural Management Economics , we had ( Ã« Â°â¢Ã¬â Â¬ ) PhD or Ã«Â¶â¬ Ã«Â°â ¢Ã¬â Â¬ ( PhD Aspirants ) lecturing .
Most of the professors were in their 50s or early 60s and educated in Japan ( Chongryong ) ; they were called by the Japanese Zainichi Chosen Jin .
Other professors were educated in one of the several Eastern Communist blocs of the Soviet Union .
Korea has a long history of education .
I have no doubt I acquired quality education from those professors who were under tremendous pressure and doing the best they could .
I know there are stereotypes about North Korean education , but it is a mistake to think their education is not as good as the rest of the world’s .
How did you access outside information about what was happening in the rest of the world ?
My roommate bought a radio cassette on which we listened to Radio France International .
Radio signals from foreign channels ( SW ) were scrambled and difficult to hear .
Only North Korean channels were easily available but we soon learned what times to listen to foreign news .
We often shared what we heard on the radio with one another over lunch or dinner .
Once I become fluent in Korean , I purchased a Sanyo music stereo which allowed me to listen to FM Chung cheun banson ( Ch’unch eun radio FM ) in South Korea .
I got into trouble several times because the Korean student who lived with me opposed it .
He would come and pull the plug out and would not listen to South Korean pop music or news .
We were told that any news or music from South Korea was banned , but I guess French radio may have had little impact on Korean psychology .
Honestly , I never blamed my Korean roommate for his actions and the frequent conflicts I had with him , because I understood that in North Korea , there was no rationale , only emotions .
The North Korean authorities could only admonish me for listening to foreign radio , but that was not the case for Korean nationals .
If caught , my roommate could have been sentenced to years in prison or a concentration camp or hard labor in the coal mines for willingly listening to South Korean radio .
Needless to say , they never succeeded in stopping us ( foreign students ) from listening to South Korean radio , RFI ( Radio France International ) and BBC World News ( for the English speaking students ) .
Did you ever meet any other foreigners while in North Korea besides your classmates ?
What were they doing there and how were they living ?
I saw Charles Robert Jenkins once at the Foreign Diplomatic Shop in Pyongyang .
He is the GI who deserted to North Korea .
When I saw him , I did not speak English at the time so I had no chance to speak with him .
He spoke with some Zambian students who told us he was an American .
Jenkins ’ story is well - known in Japan ( where I later lived ) because he married a Japanese woman who was kidnapped by the North Koreans in Niigata .
He is now leaving on Sado Island in Japan .
We also met students from Togo ( Africa ) and at the University of Hamhun there were students from China , as well .
I also met the sons of living or dead African presidents who unfortunately I cannot disclose the names of for security reasons .
How did North Koreans your age live ?
What was life like for them ?
Military service was mandatory in North Korea , so most Koreans my age were either students or serving in the military .
What was the biggest lesson you learned during your time there ?
The human being is resilient , and if we put our mind to overcoming any obstacle in life , one day , we can certainly speak of that time in the past tense .
I therefore made it my mission to find the purpose of my life on earth during my five years in North Korea ; I understood my tears would not solve my misery .
My goal was to make my way to the free world and let everyone know what happened .
London 's Metropolitan Police said they were acting on a warrant from Spain , where General Pinochet is being investigated over the deaths of Spanish citizens during his years of power in Chile between 1973 and 1990 .
The Chilean Foreign Ministry has lodged a protest with the UK government over the arrest .
Pressure for detention
The UK Foreign Secretary , Robin Cook , had been under growing pressure to prevent the former dictator from leaving the UK until he is questioned concerning alleged human rights abuses .
Juan Garces , a lawyer involved in the Chile investigation , said the request had been sent to Scotland Yard via Interpol .
He said it was based on the European Convention on Terrorism .
Amnesty International also asked the Spanish government to call on the British authorities to make General Pinochet answer questions .
And the chairman of the UK's all - party Parliamentary Human Rights Group , Ann Clwyd , wrote to the foreign secretary saying action should be taken .
General Pinochet had surgery for a herniated disc at the London Bridge Hospital on Friday .
He was said to have arrived in Britain with his wife and two bodyguards .
Chile 's ' dirty war '
Judge Garzon and his colleague , Judge Manuel Garcia Castellon , are investigating allegations of murder , torture and disappearances of Spanish nationals in Chile between 1973 and 1990 .
The judges also want to question General Pinochet about his alleged involvement in Operation Condor , in which several South American military regimes co-ordinated anti-leftist campaigns .
General Pinochet ousted the socialist President Salvador Allende in a 1973 coup and remained commander - in - chief of the Chilean army until March this year .
Senatorial immunity
He finally handed over the role after accepting a life senator post which was created for him by the constitution drafted by his own regime .
Under the terms of the constitution he became immune from prosecution in Chile .
Human rights campaigners accuse General Pinochet of being behind the murder of thousands of leftists who were killed in a Santiago football stadium shortly after the coup and in the months and years following the military takeover .
General Pinochet 's regime is also accused of assassinating at least one political dissident in the US .
Looking to the future , the airport wants to revamp Terminal F , where nearly 400 commuter and regional jet flights depart daily .
That $ 100 million project would link Terminal F to E so passengers would be able to walk from A to F - the full length of the airport - after going through security only once .
The students have spoken , and they want Stephen Colbert .
Penn State 's Eberly College of Science has been holding a contest in which students suggest a new name for the student center in the Ritenour Building .
The name in the lead -- a very , very big lead -- is S. COLBERT , reportedly an acronym for " Science Center Of Learning : Bringing Educational Resources Together . "
The group 's worst - kept secret is that the name is not an acronym at all ; it 's a way to name part of a university building after one of college students ' favorite celebrities without him handing out wads of cash for the honor .
Colbert , the fictional , ultra - conservative host of the painfully amusing " Colbert Report " on Comedy Central , has a bit of history when it comes to having things named after him .
POLL : S.COLBERT
Would you want S.COLBERT as the new name for Ritenour ?
Yes --
It won the contest .
85 % No --
It 's quite ridiculous .
15 %
According to this L.A. Times article , Colbert is the namesake of a new species of water beetle , a portion of a math problem , a Michigan junior hockey team , a Ben and Jerry 's flavor and a Virgin American jet .
It 's not remotely serious .
It 's just seriously funny .
On his show , Colbert conducts a segment called " Who 's honoring me now ? " and sometimes replaces it with " Who 's not honoring me now ? "
During the latter , he asks ( more like demands ) that the " Colbert Nation " stand up for what 's right by voting , petitioning and protesting for the Colbert name to be slapped onto everything .
And in a true show of popularity turned into power , the followers listen .
Combine the large size of " Colbert Nation " with a fierce loyalty to a fictional character , and we 're just a few seasons away from living in Colbertania in the United States of Colbert .
The group even pushed around NASA once before ... in a way .
In a contest similar to that of Riteour 's re-naming , Colbert was selected by a large margin to be the namesake of a new NASA space module .
When the space program refused to honor the contest results , Colbert blasted it on his show , sending his Colbertians into a frenzy .
It was only a short while later that NASA had a representative on the show to announce the naming of a treadmill on the space module after Colbert .
He loved it ( he was going into space , after all ) , and so the fans loved it .
Though S.COLBERT has 85 percent of the votes right now , the naming cannot take place without university approval .
As much of a shock as it would be for the name to pass ( no donations = no name on a building ) , it might get Penn State a 15 to 30 - second segment on the Comedy Central show .
There is a way for Nittany Nation and the Colbert Nation to see eye - to - eye on this .
Penn State can accept what the students want by temporarily naming the center S.COLBERT .
The action is bound to get some mention on the show .
Then , university President Graham Spanier can use that opportunity to challenge Colbert ( something he 's never turned down on his show ) to donate the money needed to re-name the center .
Colbert will ask his supporters for pennies each , and S. COLBERT becomes a permanent fixture .
Penn State gets a new name for a center and a mention on " Who 's honoring me now ? " while Colbert is honored once again .
How can this opportunity be ignored ?
After all , the No. 2 vote - getter ( with 5 percent of the votes ) is PULSE .

UPDATE : A policeman struck a Brighton G20 protester twice with a metal baton after mistaking a carton of orange juice in her hand for a weapon , a court heard today .
Metropolitan Police Sergeant Delroy Smellie , 47 , said he lashed out in a " pre-emptive strike " during a confrontation outside the Bank of England on April 2 last year .
City of Westminster Magistrates '
Court heard he told independent investigators he hit Nicola Fisher , 36 , because he believed she posed a threat to himself and colleagues .
The officer , a top - level trained member of the force 's territorial support group , went on trial today accused of common assault by beating against the animal rights activist .
Prosecutor Nick Paul said Smellie had been on duty for about 28 hours with only a three - hour break when he received an urgent call to join colleagues in the City .
Opening the case , he said video footage of the clash revealed Smellie pushed Ms Fisher and struck her with the back of his hand , knocking off her sunglasses , after she shouted at him .
Mr Paul said when she remonstrated with him , shouting that he had hit a woman , he pulled out his baton , known as an asp , and hit her twice on the leg .
The prosecutor said it was these final two blows that were at the centre of the case as prosecutors accepted his earlier actions were reasonable and therefore lawful .
The prosecutor said Ms Fisher may have been irritating , vocal and provocative , but Smellie 's actions could not be justified .
He said : " Even if her behaviour was irritating and provocative when she was standing in front of Sergeant Smellie , it is plain from the footage and photographs that there were a large number of people watching , not in any way seeking to get involved in an attack .
" It may be that her demeanour provoked Sergeant Smellie to lose his self - control and rather than responding in a way which would have involved ignoring her , warding her off or racking his asp with a view to presenting it to her , he went , if you like , from level one to level five without considering intervening steps .
" As a result of which his actions were excessive and , we say , unjustified . "
The court heard Smellie arrived outside the Bank of England shortly after 2 pm to replace a line of City of London Police officers who complained of being hit by missiles .
They were holding a vocal group of demonstrators inside a cordon , sometimes known as a kettle , amid fears by senior officers that disorder could break out .
The protesters had gathered around an impromptu shrine to Ian Tomlinson , a bystander who died after clashing with an officer the previous evening .
Smellie , who was dressed in a fluorescent vest and body armour , was responsible for a team of up to 10 officers trained to the highest standard for public order incidents .
Mr Paul showed District Judge Daphne Wickham , who is trying the case without a jury , CCTV of the police operation and amateur footage of the clash between Smellie and Ms Fisher .
Extracts of two interviews between Smellie and officials from the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) were also read out to the court .
Mr Paul said Smellie told investigators he reached for his baton after noticing Ms Fisher was holding an object in either hand after pushing her from the police line .
The prosecutor said : " She had weapons in her hand and he perceived her as a threat .
" The level of force used was a pre-emptive strike and was used to protect himself and his officers .
It was under common law and proportionate . "
The court heard Ms Fisher was in fact carrying an open carton of orange juice , which sprayed over Smellie when he hit her , and a camera .
Ms Fisher later went to a minor injuries clinic where a nurse examined a five - inch bruise on her left thigh and recommended she put ice on it and take painkillers .
Mr Paul added : " This case is not about the general policing methods adopted during the weekend of the G20 protests .
" This case is clearly about what Sergeant Smellie did in that moment when , he says , he was concerned with what he considered to be an immediate threat . "
The court heard Smellie worked from 10 am on April 1 until 2 am the next day and then went back on duty at 5 am , when he was originally posted to the Excel centre in Docklands .
Earlier today , the judge heard Ms Fisher was depressed and " unwilling " to attend proceedings over fears the defence would focus on her lifestyle and background .
The court head Ms Fisher , of Brighton , has been represented by Max Clifford , sold her story to a national newspaper for £ 26,000 and gave evidence to the Home Affairs Committee .
Ms Wickham ruled her statement to independent investigators could not be admitted in evidence but turned down an application to throw out the case by the defence .
Ms Fisher 's former boyfriend Gavin Shepherd , who was also due to be a witness , also failed to attend court .
Smellie gave his address in court as Larkhall Lane , Clapham , one of the Metropolitan Police 's territorial support group bases .
The trial , which is expected to last up to four days , was adjourned until tomorrow .
Merida , March 17th , 2010 ( Venezuelanalysis.com ) – After Venezuela president Hugo Chavez publically criticised website Noticiero Digital for falsely reporting the assassination of a government official , national and international mass media alleged that the Venezuelan government wanted to censor the Internet .
Various government officials have responded that internet media is not exempt from already existing laws .
Chavez said on Saturday that Noticiero Digital had falsely reported the assassination of minister Diosdado Cabello , and said , “ We have to act ... this is a crime . ”
As a result , on Saturday Reuters headlined with “ Venezuela ’s Chavez calls for internet controls ” while Associated Press headlined with “ Venezuela ’s Chavez : Internet should be regulated ” and said that Chavez had called for internet regulation and demanded that authorities “ crack down on a critical news Web site that he accused of spreading false information ” .
The BBC reported that , “ the possibility that Venezuela will introduce internet regulations seems to be closer than ever . ” and most mainstream media used the issue to refer again to the supposed “ repression ” by the Venezuelan government when it refused to re-new the license of pro 2002 coup TV channel , RCTV .
Other Venezuelan and Spanish news headlines included , “ Chavez : the Internet must n’t be uncontrolled ” , “ Chavez on the verge of censuring the internet ” , “ ... attacks freedom of expression ” , “ Attorney general asks that internet be regulated ” .
The site in question , Noticierodigital , yesterday had an article quoting opposition youth leader Yon Goicoechea saying , “ The president is scared because he ca n’t invade the Internet ”
Venezuelan Attorney General Luisa Ortega responded on Monday that , “ the internet ca n’t be a space free from the law , all activities that occur in this national territory must be subject to legal regulation , ” and she said the national assembly should legislate around the issue .
She also announced that the attorney general ’s office would open an investigation on the false information published by Noticiero Digital .
After a few days the news website removed the article that had falsely reported the assassination by armed groups , but did not correct , retract , or apologise for the error .
United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) leader Aristobulo Isturiz clarified that media on the internet is subject to the Law of Social Responsibility , in the same way that television , radio , and newspapers are .
He told press on Monday that , “ Chavez did n’t demand that the internet be regulated , rather the president said that there are laws and that it ’s necessary to act in accordance with the law . ”
Isturiz said that all media ca n’t say “ what ever it feels like ” and that those who provide information are responsible for what they say .
Isturiz rejected that the government wants to “ muzzle the media , as opposition sectors have been saying ” and argued that such messages are part of an “ international campaign that claims Venezuela is shutting down the media ” .
He clarified that there currently is no document or project in the national assembly to regulate internet use .
National Assembly legislator Manuel Villalba also told press yesterday , “ The penal code , article 285 ... says that anyone using mass medias of communication to incite hate , vilification , to stain the honour and dignity of people or institutions , to attempt against the stability of the state ... has to be the object of sanctions , ” he added .
Further , he said the Venezuelan government has made a strong effort to ensure internet access and information technology is more widely available to the majority of Venezuelans .
“ In our schools , thanks to the national government , the kids have access to internet , something that did n’t exist before , ” he said , adding that the spread of internet to remote areas and to the “ popular sectors ” is evidence of full freedom of expression .
Opposition media also reported that the Venezuelan government wants to use a single access point to control the internet .
Villalba disputed this and explained that , “ When there is n’t this single access point , generally the communication companies have to connect to outside technologies , and the communication goes first to the United States then returns to Venezuela , because there is n’t a single place that allows for their communication . ”
The single access point would also , “ benefit the companies because they wo n’t have to invest dollars towards obtaining this technology ” he said .
Franco Silva , president of Venezuela ’s national communication company , CANTV , said the single access point , rather than trying to censor the internet , would provide for a more efficient service and that a similar method has already been successfully implemented in countries like Mexico and Brazil .
ST FRANCIS , Milwaukee — A US man claiming he was abused by a predator priest accused of molesting scores of deaf boys said Thursday Pope Benedict XVI knew about the latest sex scandal to rock the church and should be held accountable for it .
“ The pope knew about this .
He should be held accountable , ” Arthur Budzinski said outside the Archdiocese of Milwaukee after a New York Times report said Vatican officials , including the future pope , failed to act on warnings that Father Lawrence Murphy was abusing boys at a school for the deaf here .
ADVERTISEMENT
Murphy is believed to have molested as many as 200 boys at St John ’s School for the Deaf in Wisconsin between 1950 and 1974 .
The New York Times published documents Thursday which show that top Vatican officials , including then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger — who was elected pope in 2005 — never took action against Murphy , despite many warnings from US bishops .
Budzinski , who is deaf and attended St John ’s , said in sign language , which was spoken to reporters by his daughter , that Murphy would come into the boys ’ dorm at night , take them into a closet and sexually molest them .
Budzinski , who is now 62 , said he told then archbishop of Milwaukee William Cousins and other officials about the abuse in 1974 .
The archbishop shouted at him and Budzinski “ left the meeting crying , ” he said .

According to the documents published in the New York Times , in the 1990s — years after the alleged offenses occurred — then Archbishop of Milwaukee Rembert Weakland and another Wisconsin bishop wrote “ directly to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , the future pope , ” about Murphy .
Ratzinger failed to respond to the letter , and a canonical trial authorized by his deputy was halted after Murphy wrote to Ratzinger begging that the proceedings be stopped , the Times said .
“ While church officials tussled over whether the priest should be dismissed , their highest priority was protecting the church from scandal , ” the newspaper said .

Murphy died in 1998 , having never been defrocked .
The allegations that the Vatican turned a blind eye to Murphy ’s abuse follow months of other child sex scandals coming to light in Brazil , Ireland , Austria , The Netherlands , Spain and Switzerland , as well as the pope ’s native Germany .

Two revelations in Germany concerned the pope and his brother Georg , the first having authorized lodging for a known abuser and the second having headed a boys ’ choir whose members had earlier suffered abuse .

Canonical , the company behind the Ubuntu Linux distribution , is undergoing significant changes in management .
Founder Mark Shuttleworth has stepped down from his role as the CEO so that he can increase his involvement in the software design and development process .
Jane Silber , who has long served as the company 's chief operating officer , will be taking over as CEO .
To fill the COO vacancy left by Silber 's ascension , Canonical has recruited Matt Asay , the former vice president of business development at open source content management software company Alfresco .
Asay seems like a good choice for Canonical in some key ways .
He accumulated knowledge of the enterprise Linux ecosystem during his time at Novell and he brings a wealth of real - world expertise in monetizing open source software from his experiences at Alfresco .
Despite these strong points in his favor , there are also some reasons why he is a surprising choice for Canonical .
In particular , Asay has always been an extremely vocal skeptic of Linux 's viability on the desktop .
During the month that he has been working for Canonical , his views on the matter seem to have evolved considerably .
Asay 's opinions about Linux and open source software are well known because he writes a blog at CNET .
He has consistently been supportive of Ubuntu 's vision and identified it in 2007 as Linux 's best chance for desktop success .
Despite his enthusiasm about Ubuntu 's commitment to usability , he doubted its potential to make a real impact .
" I will admit to being a Linux desktop nonbeliever .
It feels a bit like yesterday 's battle fought with the wrong weapons : geekiness rather than ease of use .
There 's a chance — still a slim one , but a chance nonetheless — that Ubuntu will change that , " he wrote in 2007 .
In a more strongly - worded piece a year later , he declared that Linux on the desktop was a lost cause .
He thought that Ubuntu might have a chance on netbooks , but argued that the real opportunities for open source are in the cloud .
" I am an ardent open - source advocate , but I admit to perplexity as to why the Linux community so desperately wants its year on local systems .
Who cares ? " he wrote in 2008 .
" It 's time to move on .
Next year wo n't be the year of the Linux desktop anymore than 2010 will be .
Why ?
Because we do n't need a Linux desktop .
We need to accelerate efforts toward the cloud , which is open source 's game to lose . "
A short time after he joined Canonical , he had a revelation .
In a complete reversal of his previous position , he boldly declared that the year of the Linux desktop is n't just imminent , but has already arrived .
He came to this new conclusion about desktop Linux after spending a few days running Ubuntu .
Yes , all it took to convince Asay of Ubuntu 's viability was actual hands - on experience with the software .
A dedicated Mac user since 2002 , he apparently never bothered to seriously test a Linux desktop distro until after he joined Canonical .
" In my new role at Canonical , I 've switched to using Ubuntu on my Lenovo ThinkPad X200s and have found Linux comfortably routine .
Like my Mac , it just works — no drama with day - to - day Internet activities like e-mail , Web browsing , IM , Twitter .
It lets me do all the things I used to do , and still largely with the same applications I used on my Mac , " he wrote recently .
" The desktop battle is largely over for Linux .
There 's really no reason not to use it , other than habit . "
In an interview with the Linux Foundation that was published yesterday , he elaborated on some of his new opinions .
Pointing to the strength of Linux in the mobile and embedded markets and Ubuntu 's improvements to Linux usability , Asay said in the interview that Linux has an opportunity to surpass rival Apple .
" Apple leads in some areas , but I think if we were to tally up its total record against Linux , and not simply in the narrow categories it chooses to target , we 'd see the balance weigh heavily in Linux ' favor , " he said .
The mixed messages and conveniently sudden transformation into a true believer could raise some serious questions about his credibility .
I happen to think that his reversal of opinion is genuine ( he would n't have joined Canonical if he thought it was doomed ) , but he seems to be overcompensating a bit in his newfound enthusiasm for desktop Linux .
It could be problematic because he risks making his endorsement of the platform sound insincere .
It 's going to take him a while to earn the trust of the Ubuntu community .
Practically all of Canonical 's previous and ongoing efforts to monetize the distro have been met with a certain degree of concern by some users and contributors .
The volunteers who have helped to make Ubuntu a success are wary of being exploited and are slow to accept Canonical 's monetization strategies .
As the COO , Asay will play an important role in making Ubuntu become commercially successful .
If the community is distrustful of Asay 's motivations and agenda , it could exacerbate the friction that arises when Canonical seeks new revenue streams to make Ubuntu sustainable .
He needs to prove to the Ubuntu community that he truly cares about Linux on the desktop and is not just out to make a quick buck .
His previously dismissive attitude about the relevance of desktop Linux is obviously not particularly conducive to that .
It 's not an insurmountable obstacle , however .
Although Asay 's views about the Linux desktop have a clear continuity problem , it 's important to acknowledge that his position about open source business opportunities has largely been consistent .
He has always been a strong proponent of seeking success in the cloud .
This is a strategy that Canonical is already starting to embrace : over the past year , we have seen the company place an increasingly strong emphasis on the cloud in its commercial offerings .
The Ubuntu One service is emblematic of that shift .
He does n't know much about the Linux desktop , but Asay is well - equipped to help guide Canonical 's cloud strategy and turn it into a successful business that will sustain the company as it pursues its desktop ambitions .
Update : Matt Asay has posted a response in the discussion thread .

I take pride in who I am .
Always have , always will .
I 've worked hard my whole life and have never taken anyone 's charity , and I 'm not about to start now , no matter what .
I 'm telling you , there 's no way I 'm going to sit back and let some black president of the United States try to devise a structure to help me pay for the dialysis treatment I so desperately need to survive .
Advertisement
Not over my dead body .
Just who does this Afro-American occupant of the highest office in the land think he is , anyway ?
Look , I 've got nothing against black people , but some of them act like the whole world owes them something .
For example , important government subsidies on my dialysis .
Advertisement
You know , I do n't recall asking for some black commander in chief to embrace protections that would prohibit insurance companies from dropping my coverage on a whim and operating as if my continued existence on earth were nothing more than a strategic liability .
Plus , if I go along with this progressive health - benefits scheme , he 'll probably hold it over my head every time I receive vital care with the aid of the government to which I already pay taxes .
Sorry .
I 've got too much self - respect for that .
Obama needs to know that there 's still one American willing to watch his body drown in its own deadly internal toxins rather than have long - overdue reform crammed down his throat .

Fact is , nobody wants some too - big - for - his - britches black president butting in to suggest that everyone , including me , needs to be treated with dignity .
Yet this Obama thinks he can just waltz in and and tinker with a health care system that destroys people like myself every single day .
Can you imagine what 'd it be like if he were n't just half black ?
Seriously , when Obama 's done drumming up support for legislation that might allow me to see my daughter graduate from college and prevent me from dying before my 50th birthday , what 's next on the agenda ?
Will he try to keep my life 's savings from evaporating in a stock market that operates free of serious governmental oversight ?
Is there any aspect of capitalism run amok that this guy wo n't tamper with ?
Really , Obama , thanks but no thanks .
The last person I need help from is some black leader of the federal government in a position to perhaps improve my quality of life .

The worst part is that I 'll have to put up with this guy being a black president for at least three more years .
I guess all I can do is try to hold out for the 2012 election .
Maybe then we 'll get a white president back in office .
Maybe he 'll have the common decency to let me suffer in peace .
STRONGSVILLE , Ohio —
Speaking to a boisterous crowd of 800 in suburban Cleveland here , President Barack Obama made an impassioned appeal for health care reform .
Even before he entered the gym at the Ehrnfelt Recreation Center in Strongsville , the audience was chanting repeatedly “ What do we want ?
– Health Care !
When do we want it ?
– Now ! ” and “ Yes , we can ! ”
The crowd erupted enthusiastically when Obama was announced and continuously interrupted his 30 minute speech with applause and supportive comments .
The speech had a special significance since Strongsville is in the district of Rep. Dennis Kucinich , who has threatened to vote against Obama ’s plan on grounds that it does not go far enough to reduce costs to consumers .
Kucinich and Obama sat next to each other on Air Force One from Washington and the two reportedly spent the entire trip discussing health care reform .
The speech also had special meaning because of a letter Obama had received from Natoma Canfield of nearby Medina which he had read to a recent meeting he had with insurance company executives .
Obama had hoped Canfield , a self - employed cleaning woman , would be at his side but two weeks ago she collapsed and had to be hospitalized where she received two blood transfusions and was diagnosed with leukemia .
Canfield lost her insurance in January after paying premiums for 16 years .
Her insurance company kept hiking the premiums because she had been diagnosed with a treatable form of cancer .
Last year she paid $ 6,000 in premiums plus $ 4,000 out of pocket for co-pays and prescriptions .
Since she did n’t reach her deductible , her policy only paid $ 900 .
Then the company hiked her premium 40 % and she would not have been able to make the mortgage payment on her home , so she cancelled her insurance and wrote the President .
“ Natoma is in the hospital and that ’s why I ’m here , ” Obama said .
With anger rising in his voice and the crowd continually cheering , Obama went on :
“ I ’m here because I remember my own mother , in the last six months of her life , on the phone in her hospital room arguing with insurance companies when she should have been spending time with her family .
“ I ’m here because of the millions denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions – or dropped from coverage when they get sick .
“ I ’m here because of the small businesses forced to choose between health care and hiring .
“ I ’m here because of the seniors unable to afford the prescriptions they need .
“ I ’m here because of the folks seeing premiums going up by thirty , forty , fifty percent in a year .
“ I am here because this is not the America I believe in – and it ’s not the America you believe in .
“ And so when you hear people say ‘ start over ’ – I want you to think of Natoma .
When you hear people saying that this is n’t the ‘ right time ’ – think of what she ’s going through .
When you hear people talk about who ’s up and who ’s down in the polls – instead of what ’s right or what ’s wrong for the country – think of her and the millions of responsible people – working people – being hurt by today ’s system of health insurance .
And I want you to remember :
There but for the grace of God go I . ”
The status quo is unsustainable , Obama said .
“ We ca n’t have a system that works better for insurance companies than it does for the American people . ”
As the audience shouted , “ No , No , No , ” Obama blasted “ those who believe the answer is to simply unleash the insurance industry , by providing less oversight and fewer rules .
I call this the ‘ putting the foxes in charge of the hen house ’ approach .
It would only give insurance companies more leeway to raise premiums and deny care . ”
Obama said his plan would “ end the worst practices of insurance companies ” would guarantee everyone coverage regardless of pre-existing conditions or length of illness .
It would provide free preventive care and let young adults stay on the parents plans until they are 26 .
It would provide tax credits for middle income people and pay for it by cutting the subsidies to insurance companies which are draining Medicare .
The plan would also close the “ donut hole ” in prescription drug coverage for seniors .
Obama blasted his Republican opponents who claim his plan is “ a government takeover of health care , ” that it sets up “ death panels ” deciding if someone lives or dies and harms Medicare .
The plan in fact “ adds almost a decade of solvency to Medicare , ” he said .
“ I believe Congress owes the American people a final up or down vote , ” he said and someone in the crowd shouted , “ we need courage . ”
“ Yes , ” Obama said , “ we need courage , ” as the crowd erupted in cheers .
“ Because in the end , this debate is about far more than the politics .
It ’s about what kind of country we want to be .
It ’s about the millions of lives that would be touched and , in some cases , saved by making private health insurance more secure and more affordable .
It ’s about a woman , lying in a hospital bed , who wants nothing more than to be able to pay for the care she needs .
“ And the truth is , what is at stake in this debate is not just our ability to solve this problem , but our ability to solve any problem .
The American people want to know if it ’s still possible for Washington to look out for their interests and their future .
They are waiting for us to act .
They are waiting for us to lead .
And as long as I hold this office , I intend to provide that leadership .
I do n’t know about the politics .
But I know what ’s right .
So I am calling on Congress to pass these reforms – and I look forward to signing them into law . ”
There have been some reports of a possible meteorite in Mexico -- here is one news report translated into English .
[ UPDATE ( 16:00 Mountain Time ) : A new article is saying this may be a piece of space junk , specifically the remains of a Russian Cosmos 2421 satellite , re-entering .
The reports of a crater may be wrong ; I heard from someone who knows a reporter in the area ( I know , this is uncredited and FOAF so take it with a grain of salt ) that no crater has been found .
Bear in mind the early report of a crater was totally without any citations at all ; no picture , no witnesses , no names , nothing .
So it 's looking now that it was a bright fireball from space junk , but no actual impact -- but we do n't have definitive answers yet .
Again , I 'll report more as I find it out . ]
Reports are a bit sketchy right now , but apparently a bright flaming object was seen coming down about 100 miles northeast of Mexico City on Wednesday around 18:30 local time .
There was a roar that was loud enough to shake buildings .
Another news article is reporting a crater 30 meters in diameter was found .
At the moment this is all I know .
It 's not clear if this was actually an impact event from a meteorite or some terrestrial event .
In 2007 a small meteorite struck in Peru , causing a lot of confusion ( with me at least ! ) over the source of the event ; there was a lot of speculation before an actual meteorite impact was confirmed .
Before that impact , it was not considered likely that a small meteorite could actually hit the ground fast enough to make a crater in the ten - meter size range ( they slow down or break up high in the atmosphere ) , so the Peru event was a surprise .
It 's still not completely understood how the meteoroid survived to hit the ground .
So it 's possible this Mexico event is a meteorite , but we do n't know yet .
I 'll post more information as I find it .
Matching Russian rides to the International Space Station after the space shuttle retires will be difficult without “ extraordinary ” US government help , a senior NASA insider said on Thursday .
But the private space firm SpaceX of Hawthorne , California , says it is ready to step into the breach by undercutting the current $ 50 million - per - astronaut round - trip ticket for travelling to the ISS aboard the Russian Soyuz craft .
“ We can guarantee crew flights to the ISS for less than $ 50 million a seat , ” SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell told a hearing held by the US Senate committee on commerce , science and transportation .
If the shuttle retires as planned later this year , Russia ’s three - person Soyuz capsules will be the only way to reach the ISS .
The White House hopes that private companies will eventually offer rides to the space station and aims to spend $ 6 billion over the next five years to help them do so .
But on Thursday the senators heard doubts about whether suitable vehicles will be commercially viable and whether they could compete with the price of Soyuz seats , which are currently offered for about $ 50 million – the price that SpaceX promised to beat .

“ How much it is subsidised we can’t tell , but it will be very difficult to match their price , ” retired astronaut Thomas Stafford said on Thursday at the hearing .
Fair price
“ [ It is ] a difficult case to make that this will be a commercially successful vehicle without extraordinary participation from the US government , ” said Malcolm Peterson , a former NASA comptroller .
“ Our fair price is going to have to be an amalgam of our national interest in the venture and however we want to parse the value of being able to create a commercially viable vehicle . ”
Peterson said he would be surprised if a private US version of Soyuz would cost less than $ 400 million per launch .
For a three - seater , that would be more than twice as expensive as the Russian modules .
Although SpaceX says it can undercut the Russians , Frank Culbertson from Orbital Sciences Corporation of Dulles , Virginia , which has a contract with NASA to develop vehicles to carry cargo to the ISS , suggested the cost of a Soyuz - like mission would probably be $ 300 or $ 400 million .
With NASA ’s Constellation programme axed and the US private sector not yet ready to get the nation ’s astronauts into space , Shotwell said that the US should worry about its reliance on Soyuz : “ After the shuttle is retired , it is not apparent what price Russia may demand for rides to the American - built portion of the ISS , ” she said .
Deutsche Telekom , Europe ’s largest telecommunications company , said Monday that it would more than double the number of women who are managers within five years , becoming the first member of the DAX 30 index of blue - chip German companies to introduce gender quotas .
Political pressure has grown on companies across Europe to increase women ’s representation among their leadership ranks and to address persistent gender gaps in areas like pay and professional opportunity .
Deutsche Telekom said it planned to raise the number of women in senior and middle management to 30 percent by the end of 2015 , from 12 percent today .
The company said it had roughly 15,000 management positions worldwide .
“ Taking on more women in management positions is not about the enforcement of misconstrued egalitarianism , ” the company ’s chief executive , René Obermann , said in a statement .
“ Having a greater number of women at the top will quite simply enable us to operate better . ”
Virginia will file suit against the federal government if the Democrats ’ health care reform bill is approved , said a spokesman for Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II ( R ) this afternoon .
Cuccinelli ( right ) has suggested previously he would likely file suit , but spokesman Brian Gottstein said that Virginia ’s lawsuit over government health care is now certain .
Although Gottstein gave no details of the legal basis for this kind of lawsuit , he indicated that the process is “ still being worked out . ”

In a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , Cuccinelli warns Democrats of using the “ deem and pass ” approach , which would not permit a freestanding vote on the Senate - passed health care reform bill .
“ Based upon media interviews and statements which I have seen , you are considering this approach because it might somehow shield members of Congress from taking a recorded vote on an overwhelmingly unpopular Senate bill , ” Cucinelli wrote in the letter .
Cuccinelli has already been the source of political controversy this year for removing sexual orientation from the state ’s non-discrimination policies .
But Virginia is n’t the only Republican state that is considering lawsuits to combat Democrats ’ strategies that “ raise grave constitutional questions , ” as Cuccinelli put it .
Prominent Republican lawyers have said legal arguments are already being drafted to throw Washington into a legal battle if health care reform passes Congress .
And the “ deem and pass ” rule is front and center of the debate .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ There is a lot of discussion among various lawyers and we ’ve had some conference calls , ” said Cleta Mitchell , a Washington attorney long active in GOP circles .
“ People are just distraught that the Democrats are even contemplating doing something like this .
It ’s utter lawlessness to deem a bill passed without voting for it .
It ’s horrific . ”
Legally , the rule is somewhat of a gray area in politics .
But Tim Jost , a law professor at Washington & Lee University , believes the health care bill would be perfectly legitimate even if Democrats are forced to use “ deem and pass . ”
“ The Constitution says that each house can write its own rules .
Those rules are up to Congress to adopt and they ’re not going to be second - guessed by the courts , ” said Tim Jost , a law professor at Washington & Lee University .
“ As long as there is a vote on the language of the Senate bill , however they go about doing this , then the Senate bill is adopted by the house and they ’ve met the requirements of the Constitution . ”
In many ways , God is quite important to some people nowadays .
Surveys show that not only are over 99.8 per cent of human beings believers in an ultimate divine being , but also that over 70 per cent of people list the destination of their immortal soul and the avoidance of a lifetime of unbearable torment in their " top five immediate concerns " .
Concern with the immortal soul compared favourably with issues such as wrinkles and mildew , ranking about equal with public transport bottlenecks , and not all that far behind impersonal telephone menus and red-carpet fashion .
Even our politicians find God interesting !
Opposition Leader Tony Abbott is known for his piety and devout commitment to both his Lord and intact hymens ; Family First Senator Steve Fielding is a fervent believer in the power of prayer to fill in the gaps when his prescription runs out ; and the Prime Minister himself is known to regularly talk to God , although God is reported to find the conversations awkward and overlong .
So God , I think it can be said , has a reasonably significant place in today ’s society .
This is not only thanks to his regular role as creator and sustainer of all living and non-living things in the universe : he is also the subject of much furious and noisy debate among the intelligentsia of two vehemently opposed camps .
On the one hand , the religious believers , a category which includes Christians , Muslims , Jews , and probably some of those people with turbans ; and on the other , the atheists , who count child molesters and Stalin in their flock .
That ’s right : on the question of God , there is by no means a consensus .
Surprising , I know , given the completeness and perfection of the Bible as a source of truth — but there you go .
I found myself musing on God after this weekend just past .
I had , you see , rather a frightening experience , following which , to be honest , I am still a bit on the shaky side .
I attended the Rise of Atheism conference in Melbourne .
Finding myself in an enormous room with thousands of atheists , I began to feel a creeping sense of unease as I realised that these " atheists " not only did n’t believe in God , they did n’t even seem to be ashamed of it .
They were almost proud .
Now , if I were an atheist — either through neglectful upbringing or a basic lack of manners —
I would be quite keen to hide the fact , not to advertise it .
Not that atheism is anything to be ashamed of , per se .
Syphilis is nothing to be ashamed of either — but you do n’t rent out convention centres to tell everyone you ’ve got it .
At least I hope you do n’t , as to do so would be both indelicate and recklessly extravagant .
As , indeed , is going about crowing about your atheism .
I mean , look at your Bible .
If you do n’t have one , borrow one from your neighbour or a passing policeman .
Have a look inside .
Note what it says about heaven , and in particular , about how you get in there .
I ’m not looking to throw spoilers at you , but I ’ll drop some hints .
Nowhere does it say , " The only way to enter the kingdom of heaven is through not believing in god " .
Nowhere does it say , " Blessed are the smarmy little speccy know - it - alls banging on and on about DNA " .
Nowhere , you will find , does it say , " God loves those most who hate his holy guts " .
In short , if you flip through your Bible , you will discover that being an atheist is a very very bad idea .
Atheists , it is strongly implied , go to hell .
And hell , according to latest research , is not an enjoyable place .
It ’s like going to prison , except instead of cells , you sleep in dark pits full of hot coals ; and instead of internet access , you get your flesh torn off by savage birds ; and instead of being raped in the shower , you get raped everywhere .
It ’s like what prison would be like if it was designed by Piers Akerman .
So , given this , why are atheists so intent on going to hell ?
Why do they turn their backs on god ?
Why do they ignore the impeccable logic of Pascal ’s Wager , which goes as follows :
1 . If you believe in god , and he does n’t exist , you ’ve lost nothing .
2 . If you do not believe , and he does exist , you go to hell .
3 . Therefore , gays ca n’t get married .
He was a wise man , Pascal , and a fine confectioner to boot .
But his watertight arguments have made little impression on atheists , who prefer what is known as the Atheist ’s Wager :
1. I like to have perverted sex and abortions .
2. I hate my parents .
3 . Therefore , I will buy the latest book by Christopher Hitchens .
Is there a reason for all this reckless godlessness ?
A big , suave , silver - haired element of the reason , of course , is named Richard Dawkins .
Before Dawkins came along , there were hardly any atheists at all .
Those who had adopted the title back then at least had the decency to conceal themselves in dark places , usually around the docks , keeping their dreadful business away from the public gaze .
But then along comes angry , bitter , needlessly abusive Dawkins , with his " selfish gene " and his " evolutionary theory " and his " there is no god " and his " please show me the evidence for your proposition " , and all of a sudden atheists are everywhere , strutting through the streets with their chests thrust out , giggling at church signs and talking trash to the Pope .
Have they no shame ?
Of course not : to have shame , you have to believe in god , from whom all good things , including shame , derive .
The baffling thing is why Dawkins has had this effect .
Yes , we all know how knowledgeable he is about evolution , but we also know that evolution is only a theory , which is a fancy way of saying " wild , random , drunken guess " .
It just seems insane to think some jumped - up little ponce can scribble down some indecipherable gibberish about how everyone on earth is the granddaughter of the same tadpole , and millions fall over themselves in a mad rush to grind their boots into the face of western civilisation .
Of course , they will say it ’s all because of the " evidence " .
" Oh , we just follow the evidence , " they ’ll chatter .
Well , the day when a dusty old collection of possibly fake bones are considered better evidence than a book of impossible majesty written by the creator of the universe ; when an assemblage of half - baked theories about fish - monkeys carries more weight than the resurrection of the perfect man-god , as documented in over 60,000 historically verified contemporary documents ; when a nerdy little microscope jockey spouting geological fairytales from the comfort of a publicly funded academic opium den is seen as conclusive proof more compelling than the many , many cases of cancers cured by Catholic ghosts ; well , that is the day I hang up my laptop and buy a one - way ticket to the crazy - shack .
Because that is the day all human decency departs this world , to be replaced with an unfulfilling tissue of pointless truth - seeking and petty humanism .
I do n’t know , though , whether Dawkins is the only reason for this atheist boom .
There must be something else causing this rash of moral lemmingism , this craze which is sending so many of god ’s children hurtling over the cliff of disbelief to be dashed upon the jagged rocks of biological determinism , their bodies floating bleakly away on the dark tides of hedonism and edgy sketch comedy .
Is it that the church has failed to reach out to the community ?
Has it failed to keep up with modern times ?
Has it failed to make the Good News relevant to young hip trendsetters ?
Has it failed to make Christian rock funky and " radical " enough ?
Has it failed to sufficiently not have sex with prepubescent boys ?
Has it failed , as Jesus so eloquently put it shortly before being brutally temporarily murdered , to be a fisher of men ?
Not likely !
So it ’s probably just the evolution thing after all .
Damn those fossils .
Damn them to hell .
Crucial data on the American climate , part of the basis for proposed trillion - dollar global warming legislation , is churned out by a 120 - year - old weather system that has remained mostly unchanged since Benjamin Harrison was in the White House .
The network measures surface temperature by tallying paper reports sent in by snail mail from volunteers whose data , according to critics , often resembles a hodgepodge of guesswork , mathematical interpolation and simple human error .
" It 's rather archaic , " said Anthony Watts , a meteorologist who since 2007 has been cataloging problems in the 1,218 weather stations that make up the Historical Climatology Network .
" When the network was put together in 1892 , it was mercury thermometers and paper forms .
Today it 's still much the same , " he said .
The network relies on volunteers in the 48 contiguous states to take daily readings of high and low temperatures and precipitation measured by sensors they keep by their homes and offices .
They deliver that information to the National Climatic Data Center ( NCDC ) , which uses it to track changes in the climate .
Requirements are n't very strict for volunteers :
They need a modicum of training and decent vision in at least one eye to qualify .
And they 're expected to take measurements seven days a week , 365 days a year .
That 's a recipe for trouble , says Watts , who told FoxNews.com that less scrupulous members of the network often fail to collect the data when they go on vacation or are sick .
He said one volunteer filled in missing data with local weather reports from the newspapers that stacked up while he was out of town .
Click here to see a well - filled form | Click here to see a form missing data
And that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
Volunteers take their readings at different times of day , then round the temperatures to the nearest whole number and mark down their measurements on paper forms they mail in monthly to the NCDC headquarters in Ashville , N.C .
" You 've got this kind of a ragtag network that 's reporting the numbers for our official climate readings , " said Watts , who found that 90 percent of the stations violated the government 's guidelines for where they may be located .
Watts believes that poor placement of temperature sensors has compromised the system 's data .
Though they are supposed to be situated in empty clearings , many of the stations are potentially corrupted by their proximity to heat sources , including exhaust pipes , trash - burning barrels , chimneys , barbecue grills , seas of asphalt — and even a grave .
Once the data reaches the NCDC , climate scientists in Ashville digitize the numbers and check to make sure there are no large anomalies .
The introduction of electronic weather gauges into the system in the 1980s was a much - needed update , but the new and improved gauges measure temperatures slightly differently and must be corrected to sync up with the overall historic data .
If numbers appear faulty or if more than nine days are missing from a single month 's tally , the whole month is thrown out , according to NCDC documents , and the Center uses a computer program to determine average temperatures at dozens of nearby stations to guess what the temperature would have been for the month at the unknown station .
The overall land temperature record produced by the NCDC is used by a number of top climate research centers , including the U.N. 's International Panel on Climate Change , NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies , and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia , headed until recently by Phil Jones , who stepped down in the wake of the Climate - gate scandal .
What it boils down to , Watts says , is that some of the world 's top climate scientists have been crunching numbers that were altered by their immediate surroundings , rounded by volunteers , guessed at by the NCDC if there was insufficient data , then further adjusted to correct for " biases , " including the uneven times of day when measurements were taken -- all ending up with a number that is 0.6 degrees warmer than the raw data , which Watts believes is itself suspect .
But scientists at the NCDC say the system is an indispensable tool for measuring local temperatures , and that its readings are buttressed by the consensus drawn from the 8,000 surface stations that make up the Cooperative Observer Program , the overall national system of which the 1,218 stations in the Historical Climatology Network are just a part .
" We use the rest of the COOP network to help calibrate , " said Jay Lawrimore , chief of the climate monitoring branch at NCDC .
" It 's used to do quality control . "
NCDC climatologists carefully track temperature trends at local levels to ensure that the data submitted by volunteers is reliable , adjusting for the biases caused by the time of day when measurements are taken , for differences between old and new equipment , and to account for flukes that might be caused by poor siting .
The NCDC insists its adjusted numbers are an accurate representation of climatic reality , backed up by worldwide trends in air temperature , water temperature , glacier melt , plant flowering and other indicators of climate change .
" The signal appears to be robust , a reliable temperature signal , " said Lawrimore .
But Watts says that even a single step — the rounding of the daily temperature — creates a margin of error about as large as the entire global warming trend scientists are hoping to confirm .
It all could become moot within a decade , as the climate center 's outmoded Pony Express is currently being replaced with a screaming bullet train .
Lawrimore told FoxNews.com that about 5 percent of the historical network has already been automated , but a far more important development has been the launching of the digitally run Climate Reference Network ( CRN ) , a system of 114 stations that went fully online in 2008 .
The CRN was carefully sited in fields around the country and automatically records daily climate data and transmits it at midnight local time , sending it by satellite and eliminating the snail - mail delay , the rounding of numbers and any elements of human error .
But that does n't mean the Historical Climate Network is going away , say NCDC scientists , who will continue to rely on its volunteers ' readings to gather climate data on the local level .
So do n't stable those ponies just yet .

I want to cover everybody .
Now , the truth is that , unless you have a single - payer system , in which everybody is automatically covered , then you ’re probably not going to reach every single individual .
~ President Barack Obama , July 22 , 2009
As future physicians , ensuring that every single one of our patients has unrestricted access to health care is a core tenet of our professionalism .
President Obama has affirmed what many of us know to be true – a single - payer system is the only responsible solution to our health care crisis .
The vast majority of our seniors are satisfied with Medicare ; in fact , many patients anxiously await Medicare eligibility because of the security and stability provided by the program ’s guarantee of coverage and access .
Labor unions and advocacy organizations across the United States support a single payer system as do the majority of health care providers .
These groups – these constituencies – recognize that single payer is the best system in which to guarantee quality , affordable , health care for all .
On July 31 , 2009 , Representative Anthony Weiner ( D - NY ) introduced an amendment in the House Energy & Commerce Committee to replace key provisions in the House health reform bill with language modeled after HR 676 , the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) guaranteed a floor vote on single payer if Rep .
Weiner withdrew his amendment .
Under good faith , Rep. Weiner assented .
Now , Speaker Pelosi is reneging on her promise not only to Rep .
Weiner , but to the American people , many of whom believe that we need to have a true debate on the merits of a single - payer health care system .
We write today calling for an end to these games .
Our legislators must stop politicking with the most valuable resource available to them – the lives of our patients , their constituents .
In the long history of single payer advocacy , there has never been such a momentous time – never have Americans had the opportunity to hold their representatives accountable to the people on this issue – rather than to the powerful lobbies that pervade the beltway .
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation , nearly one in two Americans support a system of publicly funded , privately delivered , Medicare for all – will the floor vote reflect this statistic ?
We will only know if Speaker Pelosi upholds her promise .
The American people should be able to trust members of Congress to stand by their promises – both to them and to each other .
In the health care debate , the needs of average Americans must come before special interests and politics .
Our friends , family , and patients deserve to a true , honest debate .
Denying that chance through lies and broken promises is an anti-democratic betrayal of trust that will not easily be forgotten – now or at the polls in November .
The Weiner amendment presents a historic opportunity for members of Congress to document their support for single - payer national health insurance as the best way to solve the U.S. healthcare crisis and provide a vote that Members can proudly stand by when approached by constituents .
We see everyday how budget shortfalls result in staff reductions that ultimately threaten the quality and availability of care .
Single payer would provide universal and comprehensive coverage for all medically necessary services .
Unamended , HR 3962 ( formerly HR3200 ) would leave millions uninsured or with skimpy coverage .
Single payer would allow patients free choice of doctor and hospital .
Under HR 3962 , insurance companies would continue to deny care and restrict access to providers .
Single payer would pay for itself by eliminating $ 400 billion in insurance company administrative waste and redirecting these savings to patient care .
HR 3962 would require $ 1 trillion in new revenue over the next decade .
Single payer would establish proven and effective cost - containing mechanisms to ensure that benefits are sustainable over the long run .
HR 3962 lacks effective cost control measures by maintaining the primacy of the private insurers .
The private insurance industry has had eight decades to lead change , to shift from a world predicated upon a race to the bottom - line to a culture of innovation and care .
But their time has passed .
Speaker Pelosi must offer the leadership necessary to truly reform our system and to address one of our greatest moral failures of the last fifty years .
Only a single payer system can provide the change President Obama has championed , the change we need – simplifying payment , eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy , and investing the subsequent savings into a solitary goal , providing care to all .
The math is simple , the morality pure , and the passion of single payer advocates indefatigable .
As future physicians , this is the type of system in which we aspire to practice medicine .

Report for UK government refutes persistent claims that recycling is a waste of time , calls for better facilities and an increase in incineration
Recycling is almost always the best way to get rid of waste , even when it is exported abroad , according to the biggest ever report on the industry for the UK government .
The report , which addresses persistent claims that householders are often wasting their time recycling , calls for better recycling facilities but also an increase in incineration of waste , an option that is opposed by many environment groups .
It also backed up last week 's controversial report published by the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs warning that biopolymer plastics made from crops should be recycled rather than put into compost , despite being widely marketed as " biodegradable " .
Wrap , the government 's waste and packaging agency , said it had analysed 200 reports covering seven different materials : paper and cardboard , plastics , biopolymers , food , garden cuttings , wood and textiles .
The experts then looked at the evidence for seven methods of disposal , including recycling , composting , incineration and landfill , measured by four different criteria : energy use , water use , other resource use , and greenhouse gas emissions .
In more than four out of five cases , recycling was the clear winner , said Keith James , Wrap 's environmental policy manager .
But there were " different messages " for different materials , said James .
" For biopolymers , I think the preferable option is recycling , which is n't what people have commonly thought , " he said .
" For textiles , there 's not very many statistics , but what there is shows reuse is clearly optimal , followed by recycling and then energy recovery [ incineration ] .
" For food and garden waste , anaerobic digestion looks preferable ; then composting and incineration with energy recovery come out very similar .
" For plastics , we have got strong evidence this time that recycling is the better option , because recycling has improved .
" For wood , recycling looks preferable .
" For paper and cardboard , what the statistics throw out is the importance of quality : the higher the quality [ paper and cardboard ] , the better it is to recycle , but as you go down to the lower end , energy recovery [ incineration ] may be preferable . "
The good showing for incineration – preferred for a small number of items and often the next best option after recycling – will be controversial with some environmental campaigners who worry about the pollution from recycling plants , and that incineration becomes an easy option that deters investment in proper recycling .
However , the option of incineration was only preferred when it was using the best technology and generating energy , preferably energy that was directly replacing fossil fuel use , which is blamed for the greenhouse gas emissions that help cause global warming , said James .
" Energy recovery has a role to play , and if we 're trying to divert more waste from landfill , we need to increase recycling and increase some energy recovery .
But we need to make sure we get the right technologies , " he said .
As well as analysing recycling in the UK , the study also considered the impact of transporting waste to other countries – often China – for recycling .
It found that overseas transport was still better than sending it to landfill .
" The important thing is , because we 're in an international economy ... [ that if ] we 're sending metal back to China for recycling , it 's coming back around the circle again , " said James .
According to Defra , in 2008 - 9 the total waste collected from the UK's 25 m households dropped slightly to 24.3 m tonnes , or 473 kg per person .
Of this , 9.1 m tonnes – 178 kg per person – was recycled , a bit more than a third .
Almost all of the remainder went to landfill .
Defra has a policy of encouraging more incineration , but no formal targets , said a spokesman .
" We can't keep on sending waste to landfill , " said the spokesman .
" People are already reducing the amount of waste they produce , and are reusing and recycling more , and we are working hard to increase this .
Some waste will always be produced , but it can be valuable in generating renewable energy through anaerobic digestion or incineration . "
In 2006 , Wrap published a preliminary analysis of a different set of materials .
But it used a much smaller collection of evidence .
And it did not examine the newer energy - from - waste options of gasification and pyrolysis , both of which involve not burning but heating materials until a chemical reaction changes them into gases and residue .

From previous PopWatch commenters , I know I ’m not alone in my love for David Tennant in Doctor Who .
Well , now BBC Video has a special treat for Tennant fans – this video celebrating his best moments in the role .
The video is tied to the release of Doctor Who : The Complete Specials , out on DVD and Blu-ray on Tuesday , which provides a fitting goodbye to Tennant .
The set includes five discs of Tennant - rific specials : The Next Doctor , Planet of the Dead , The Waters of Mars , and The End of Time , Parts One and Two .
Even if you ’ve seen all the specials , the package is also notable for its extras , such as a new Doctor Who Confidential for The Next Doctor ; Tennant ’s video diary from his final days of shooting ; a look at Tennant ’s and creator Russell T Davies ’ first visit to Comic Con ; and Davies ’ introduction of The End of Time deleted scenes .
This post is the fourth post in a series of coverage from the Midwest Bisexual Lesbian Gay Transgender Ally College Conference 2010 , that took place Feb. 19 to Feb. 21 , 2010 , at the University of Wisconsin – Madison .

“ Like alternative medicine , some people think porn is crazy and others think it is the best thing ever , ” said Allison Lancaster , leader of the session “ More Than Meets The Eye : Sexual Minorities in Porn . ”
Often times , in girl - on - girl and guy - on - guy porn , the actors are straight people simply acting gay , not usually enjoy the sexual acts and are performing their job of showing pleasure .
These films are made for a male audience , catering to stereotypical portrayals of these groups ( like always showing two feminine women together ) .
But in porn made specifically for lesbians and gays , the actors usually identify as the sexual orientation they are portraying and seem to be enjoying themselves .
Porn is a business and wants to produce what will sell .
Straight men are the primary consumers of porn , so it makes sense that it caters to them .
But that consumer standard is changing .
For sexual minorities , porn is sometimes an art and means of expression , and companies are starting to realize there is a demand for this sort of porn .
Companies producing porn for queers and by queers are starting to crop up in the market .
This workshop did not discuss transgender people in porn .
The Great Tax Dodge is under way already .
The how and which of tax increases are still unclear .
But there is no question about the if :
Higher taxes are coming .
Fearing that tax - code changes could slam fortunes large and small , investors are n't sitting still .
In the first ...
In 1984 , the Hobet mine in West Virginia is small .
By 2009 it covers more than 10,000 acres .
The mining waste has been deposited into valleys .
Below the densely forested slopes of southern West Virginia 's Appalachian Mountains is a layer cake of thin coal seams .
To uncover this coal profitably , mining companies engineer large , sometimes very large , surface mines .
A new pair of images from NASA shows the growth of one of the largest surface mines in West Virginia during the past 25 years .
Based on data from NASA¹s Landsat 5 satellite , these natural - color ( photo - like ) images document the growth of the Hobet mine in Boone County , West Virginia , as it expands from ridge to ridge between 1984 to 2009 .
The natural landscape of the area is dark green , forested mountains , creased by streams and indented by hollows .
The active mining areas appear off - white , while areas being reclaimed with vegetation appear light green .
A pipeline roughly bisects the images from north to south .
In 1984 , the mining operation is limited to a relatively small area west of the Coal River .
By 2009 , it is has expanded across more than 10,000 acres ( 15.6 square miles ) to the south and west , according to a statement from NASA .
Most of the mine lies within the upper watershed of the Mud River , which flows northwest through the area .
Coal companies dispose of mining waste rock by building rock and earth dams called valley fills in hollows , gullies , and streams .
The longest valley fill at this mine appears to have been the near - complete filling of Connelly Branch from its source to its mouth at the Mud River .
According to a 1998 report from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , nearly 40 percent of the year - round and seasonal streams in the Mud River watershed upstream of and including Connelly Branch had been filled or approved for filling .
Some scientists think that regulation and mitigation strategies for these mines are inadequate , and that regulators should not issue more permits for them until better mitigation and restoration strategies can be developed .
In 2009 , the Environmental Protection Agency intervened in the approval of a permit to further expand the Hobet mine into the Berry Branch area ( white outline in the image ) and worked with mine operators to minimize the disturbance and to reduce the number and size of valley fills .
A man who is charged with having sex with a 14 - year - old girl when he was 15 , has lost his high court challenge to the law under which he is charged .
The man , who is now 18 , had claimed that the section 2006 law - that allows him to be prosecuted , while no charges can be brought against the girl - was old fashioned gender - based discrimination for which the State had no justification .
He is charged under the so - called ' Romeo and Juliet ' law - Criminal Law Offences
Act 2006 and faces a maximum of five years in jail if convicted .
Under the same act , a girl under 17 cannot be charged with the same offence .
The case was heard last December , and in her ruling today Ms Justice Dunne said it was clear from studies that the adverse affect of underage sex - such as pregnancy , early parenthood and resulting lower educational and occupational attainment - fall to a greater extent on girls than boys .
Far from being an example of good old fashioned discrimination or a form of rough equalisation , as contented by lawyers for the young man , the law provided a limited immunity to girls in the one area of sexual activity that can result in pregnancy , she said .
She said the law was there to protect children from sexual abuse .
Girls and boys were equally liable to prosecution in respect of sexual activity , falling short of sexual intercourse .
Section 5 only applies to sexual intercourse - thus the immunity only applied to the one area of sexual activity that can result in pregnancy .
It is the one consequence of sexual activity that carries no risk for boys or men , she said .
Justice Dunne said society was entitled to deter such activity and to place the burden of criminal sanction on those who bear the least adverse consequences of such activity .
She said the act goes no further than was necessary to achieve this object .
Last December Senior Counsel for the young man , Gerard Hogan , told the court that he legislation under which he is charged proceeded on the basis that the boy was the ' guilty party ' and the girl was the ' comely maiden ' whose virtue must be protected .
He said if convicted , the boy would face a conviction for a sexual offence with all the ignominy and distress associated with that .
He said he faces the prospect of having his life destroyed and added that five years in prison and a conviction for a sexual offence for a boy of 15 who engaged in consensual sexual activity was a ' savage penalty ' .
He said it was gender - based legislation and while no one would suggest that pregnancy in a young girl was something to be countenanced , there was no comparison between pregnancy and the prosecution for a sexual offence which would destroy a young life .
The legislation was enacted in the aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling that found that the laws governing statutory rape were unconstitutional because they did not allow for a defence of reasonable mistake about a girl 's age .
The State had argued that the law was there to protect young people both male and female and was not paternalistic .
Lawyers for the state said the 2006 law was just one piece of legislation where gender discrimination was made as it had never been considered that females could perform the same sexual acts as males .
Similar gender specific laws applied in other jurisdictions and reflected a pattern repeated throughout out law making and dating back as far as AD 760 , the court was told .
Ms Justice Dunne said the act as a whole was to protect children from sexual abuse .
She said it deals with a wide range of sexual activities , circumstances and levels of culpability .
Careful consideration had been given to the sentencing regime for offenders .
This was framework in which one must view the limited immunity conferred by Section 5 .
Girls and boys were equally liable to prosecution in respect of sexual activity , falling short of sexual intercourse .
Section 5 only applies to sexual intercourse - thus the immunity only applied to the one area of sexual activity that can result in pregnancy .
It is the one consequence of sexual activity that carries no risk for boys or men .

Yesterday , William Shatner casually tweeted that he ’s created his own social network .
Now , before we discuss the questionable logic behind naming a new social network service by using a pun on an old social network service that itself feels like an aging dinosaur from 2005 , let me give you the basic rundown on what the Shat ’s new internet venture is all about :
1 . It ’s a “ Sci-Fi Social Network for those with a passion for the arts ” :
So no , this is n’t just another Trekkie fan forum .
2 . It ’s a network geared toward people who seek a career in the creation / production of science fiction , horror , and fantasy .
3 . The network is divided into 12 categories–six “ planets ” and six “ starships ” .
Each planet represents a subcategory in the entertainment arts ( Designers / Animators , Writers / Directors , Musicians / Composers , Gamers / Game Developers , Film / TV Producers , and Actors / Actresses / Comedians ) .
4 . Each starship represents a larger creative project that , if you ’re deemed worthy , you can be assigned to by a ship ’s captain .
The site seems to suggest that these six main projects will ultimately be curated by Shatner himself .
5 . Yes , the metaphor of starships / planets as entertainment industry carries through everything –to the point of confusion .
If you ’re selected to work on a project / starship , you become a “ crew member . ”
Admins of the site form the interplanetary “ Counsel . ”
6. MyOuterSpace.com is hiring , er , I mean recruiting : “ The Counsel is now interviewing Industry Credited Producers for Starship Captain Positions . ”
Unfortunately , the only way to see what types of projects these starship captains might be commanding is to register for an account , and in order for that to happen , the site needs to stop breaking ( lots of error messages keep cropping up ) .
Even if you have no interest in the sci - fi arts or in joining yet another social network , you have to watch Shatner ’s video explaining what his new site is all about .
Classic Shatner mixed with unbelievable special effects and one crazy - looking Red Chevrolet space ship .
Trust me , it ’s good .

BBC News , Berlin
Only 227 of Greece 's 6,000 islands are inhabited Greece should consider selling some of its uninhabited islands to cut its debt , according to political allies of German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Josef Schlarmann and Frank Schaeffler told Germany 's Bild daily that the Greek state should sell stakes in all its assets to raise more cash .
Greek PM
George Papandreou is due to meet Mrs Merkel in Berlin later this week for talks about the crisis .
Mr Papandreou has already announced a strict austerity programme .
' Affordable ' islands " Sell your islands , you bankrupt Greeks - and the Acropolis too ! " says the headline in the Bild newspaper .
It sounds like the sort of daydream induced by too much ouzo , but the idea comes from two senior politicians in Europe 's biggest economy .
Mr Schlarmann is a senior member of Mrs Merkel 's Christian Democrats and Mr Schaeffler is an MP for the Free Democrats - the junior partner in the centre - right coalition .
Both confirmed to the BBC that they wanted to start a debate about what Greece could do to help itself and bolster the battered euro .
Those who face insolvency , Mr Schlarmann said , must sell everything they have to pay their creditors .
He advised Mrs Merkel not to promise any financial aid when she met Mr Papandreou in Berlin .
According to a poll published on Thursday , 84 % of Germans think that the EU should not help Greece out of its debt crisis .
It is true that dotted in the blue waters of the Aegean are some of the country 's most valuable assets - about 6,000 islands , of which only 227 are inhabited .
Many of them are privately owned by the world 's super - rich .
According to a specialised real - estate website , Greek islands evoke images of sunglass - sporting shipping magnates sipping champagne on enormous yachts , but cost as little as $ 2 m ( £ 1.3 m ) .
Relatively affordable , the website says - unless , of course , you 're a Greek .

‘ Avatar is real ’ , say tribal people
January 25 , 2010
Avatars story is being played out in real life .
© 20th Century Fox
Following the film ‘ Avatar ’ ’s win at the Golden Globes , tribal people have claimed that the film tells the real story of their lives today .
A Penan man from Sarawak , in the Malaysian part of Borneo , told Survival , ‘ The Penan people cannot live without the rainforest .
The forest looks after us , and we look after it .
We understand the plants and the animals because we have lived here for many , many years , since the time of our ancestors .
‘ The Na’vi people in ‘ Avatar ’ cry because their forest is destroyed .
It ’s the same with the Penan .
Logging companies are chopping down our big trees and polluting our rivers , and the animals we hunt are dying . ’
Kalahari Bushman Jumanda Gakelebone said , ‘ We the Bushmen are the first inhabitants in southern Africa .
We are being denied rights to our land and appeal to the world to help us .
‘ Avatar ’ makes me happy as it shows the world about what it is to be a Bushman , and what our land is to us .
Land and Bushmen are the same . ’
Davi Kopenawa Yanomami , known as the Dalai Lama of the Rainforest , said , ‘ My Yanomami people have always lived in peace with the forest .
Our ancestors taught us to understand our land and animals .
We have used this knowledge carefully , for our existence depends on it .
My Yanomami land was invaded by miners .
A fifth of our people died from diseases we had never known . ’
Director James Cameron received his Golden Globes awards for ‘ Avatar ’ last week , and revealed one of the central ideas of the film .
‘ Avatar asks us to see that everything is connected , ’ he said in his acceptance speech , ‘ All human beings to each other , and us to the earth .
Cameron was inspired by the Maori language of New Zealand when devising the language spoken by the Na’vi .
Survival ’s director Stephen Corry says , ‘ Just as the Na’vi describe the forest of Pandora as ‘ their everything ’ , for most tribal peoples , life and land have always been deeply connected .
‘ The fundamental story of Avatar – if you take away the multi- coloured lemurs , the long - trunked horses and warring androids – is being played out time and time again , on our planet .
‘ Like the Na’vi of ‘ Avatar ’ , the world ’s last - remaining tribal peoples – from the Amazon to Siberia – are also at risk of extinction , as their lands are appropriated by powerful forces for profit - making reasons such as colonization , logging and mining . ’
‘ One of the best ways of protecting the our world ’s natural heritage is surprisingly simple ; it is to secure the land rights of tribal peoples . ’

TheDoorPost used to be
The Doorpost Film Project was originally launched in 2009 as a film contest .
It was hugely successful and well - received as you can read in this article from VARIETY magazine .
In its an inaugural year , The Doorpost Film Project ’s website received over 250,000 unique visits from over 122 countries and gave away over $ 260,000 to 15 filmmakers who produced short films on the topic of HOPE .
Today , we are still operating around the central theme of HOPE .
However , we are now known only as THE DOORPOST PROJECT .
Though we still reach people from numerous continents , backgrounds , and careers within filmmaking communities , we have been relaunched under new ownership with a new vision .
No longer are we just a film contest , The Doorpost Project is now an ever - growing community of entertainment industry people of all disciplines .
We are dedicated to helping move content creators beyond creating mere entertainment into the realm of INFLUENCE .

Curve Watchers
Anonymous is once again taking a look at the yield curve looking for economic clues .
Here are a few charts to consider .
Yield Curve Timeline from 2000 - 2010
click on any chart for sharper image
Green : $ TYX - 30 Year Treasuries
Orange : $ TNX - 10 Year Treasuries
Blue : $ FVX - 5 Year Treasuries
Brown : $ IRX - 3 Month Treasuries
Area 1 : Inverted Yield Curve Signals Pending DotCom Bubble Burst
Area 2 : Fed Reflates Holding Interest Rates at 1 % for 18 Months Fueling Mother of All Credit / Housing Bubbles
Area 3 . Yield Curve Tight for Two Full Years , Inverted on and off for 18 Months .
This was the Mother of All Warning Signals .
Few Paid Attention .
Bernanke Said " No Recession Coming .
No Housing Bubble to Bust "
Area 4 . Fed Reflates , Cutting Rates to Zero .

Credit Not Expanding
Under normal circumstances with a steep yield curve , banks would be willing to borrow from the Fed at close to zero and lend at prime or higher .
Yet we know that banks are reluctant to lend ( more accurately businesses are reluctant to borrow ) as mentioned many times , most recently in As Credit Contracts , Keynesian and Monetarist Clowns Snipe at Bernanke .
Total Bank Credit Drops At Record Pace
What has everyone excited is the dramatic turn down in bank credit at commercial banks .
From the Telegraph article ... David Rosenberg from Gluskin Sheff said lending has fallen by over $ 100 bn ( £ 63.8 bn ) since January , plummeting at an annual rate of 16 pc .
" Since the credit crisis began , $ 740 bn of bank credit has evaporated .
This is a record 10 pc decline , " he said .
Total Bank Credit Of Commercial Banks
In contrast to Keynesian and Monetarist clowns , I am not horrified by that drop .
I am horrified by the parabolic rise that preceded it .
That credit is plunging is a good thing , not a bad thing .
A much needed deleveraging is in progress .
The question now is : Will Bernanke have the courage to see this [ policy normalization ] through or not ?
This Is Not 2003 - 2006
Hello Mish
After our phone conversation last week , I thought of one more important banking tidbit you might want to share with your readers .
If you ’re a bank with a relatively healthy balance sheet with adequate capital , ( like us ) you want to maintain surplus capital in order to stay on the FDIC ’s list of banks they can transfer the loans and deposits from a failed institution into .
This is a home run for the acquiring bank and far more of an instant benefit than any new lending .
Is It Different This Time ?
Disclaimer : I work at Best Buy , in the Home Theater department .
That said , it seems there 's a bunch of misinformation going around , or at least a general misunderstanding of what 's offered here .
Compared to a normal Geek Squad TV and Video setup ( $ 100 ) and an add - on network setup for home theater devices ( $ 50 ) , you are not paying any extra money for us to " sync " the 3D glasses .
Now , for nearly 100 % of Giz readers , none of this stuff is necessary ( though you are essentially getting it for free in the package ) as most of us here have some degree of technical knowledge .
But since working at Best Buy , I 've come to the conclusion that about 85 % of the TV buying populace can't tell a USB cable from an HDMI cable ( in fact , I have on multiple occasions been asked why when they hooked their TV up to their computer with a USB cable nothing happened ... ) , and for them , some of the Geek Squad services make sense to them .
Of course , I personally feel the services are a bit on the expensive side , and will usually see if they have friends or family able to help them out before offering the services to them .
Lance Armstrong spoke to US radio talkshow host Tony Kornheiser live on his morning show today .
He accepted an apology for Kornheiser ’s anti-cyclist tirade and tried to spread some love and understanding between motorists and cyclists .

Kornheiser opened the ‘ apology ’ section of his ESPN show with The Beatles ’
All you need is love playing in the background , and said : “ I went on one of my rants the other day about bicyclists in Rock Creek Park and in new dedicated bicycle lanes in Washington DC … and got way over the top .
“ The bicycle people who heard it were properly offended and it worked its way all the way to the most famous cyclist in the history of the United States , the multiple Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong , who lit me up on Twitter , which many of you have read about . ”
Kornheiser said he got in touch with Armstrong through his friendship with Lance ’s biographer Sally Jenkins .
“ Lance called all the way from France when he was done working out in preparation for the Tour de France and we talked about a lot of things , ” he said .
“ I certainly apologised for any inference that I made , which was not an inference , the direct thing about , you know , going after bicyclists . ”
During their on - air conversation , the two spoke about the aggressive attitude many motorists have towards cyclists .
Armstrong said : “ Well , first of all let me just say that … for myself and all the people that get on bikes , we appreciate your apology and I think we take that as a sincere apology .
“ If it ’s you or me , or anybody else out there that has this podium … whatever we say … it might be funny , we may think it ’s a joke but people actually take it seriously sometimes .
“ And so , to your point of this interaction and this relationship between people on bikes and people in cars .
I think that ’s a relationship that has to co-exist now and forever because … we ’re both gonna be around forever .
It ’s one that ’s going to require mutual respect .
“ Cyclists ca n’t go down the road five abreast in RockCreekPark .
I understand .
I go on rides all the time when people start lining up beside me wanting to chat and I say , ‘ Hey , you know we gotta single up here , we got some cars back ’ .
“ But at the same time there ’s no need for a car to come by and brush a cyclist , especially considering they ’re human beings on bikes …
Not everybody ’s used to riding with cars .
It could be a a 40 - year - old lady – it ’s her first bike ride and she ’s out on the street and some guy comes and brushes her and taps her with a mirror .
Trust me , she never gets on a bike ever again because she ’s so scared , and that ’s a shame .
I know it ’s a volatile situation sometimes but both sides have to understand each other …
“ The other thing I think I should say … [ is that ] cycling lost a guy yesterday who was well regarded and loved by many people , and got hit by a car and killed in the Carolinas – a guy by the name of Adam Little .
I think it touched this nerve for a lot of people in the cycling community for both of those things to come out on the same day …
Look , we ’ve got to all get along here , and sometimes it ’s heated . ”

We now know what would happen if No. 2 Kentucky found itself in a deep hole .
We also know Tennessee is a legitimate NCAA Tournament team , as if it were really in doubt .
J.P. Prince had 20 points , Scotty Hopson added 15 and No. 19 Tennessee , which led by as many as 19 points , beat No. 2 Kentucky 74-65 at Thompson - Boling Arena in Knoxville , Tenn .
College basketball fans have oft - wondered what would happen if the three Wildcat freshman starters found themselves down big .
Could they stage a comeback or would their inexperience show ?
Kentucky last trailed at halftime against Georgia in early January 35 - 34 .
Tennessee led 49 - 20 at the half .
Kentucky ( 27 - 2 , 12 -2 Southeastern Conference ) tied the game at 65 with less than three minutes left but the Volunteers ( 21 - 7 , 9 - 5 SEC ) refused to let the Wildcats take the lead .
Tennessee finished the game on a 9 - 0 run to seal its second win over a top - 2 opponent at home this season .
The Vols handed No. 1 Kansas its first defeat of the season earlier in the year .
John
Wall was limited to eight points in the first half , but turned up dribble penetration in the second half , scoring nine points during a key seven - minute Wildcat run that nearly negated the 18 - 0 run that Tennessee used to go up big in the first half .
Wall finished with 19 points , six assists and five rebounds .
On a day when the Wildcats left its jump shot in Lexington , sophomore Darius Miller scored with jumpers on three possessions with less than eight minutes left in the second half .
He finished with seven points and UK shot 2 - for - 22 from 3 - point range .
DeMarcus Cousins , who eclipsed the all - time Kentucky freshman scoring record held by Rex Chapman , was a near - sharpshooter from the free throw line , connecting on 7 - of - 9 .
Cousins took an outlet pass with just under three minutes to cut the Volunteers lead to 65 - 63 .
Cousins finished with 15 points and 14 boards .
After an empty possession by the Vols , Wall found Cousins for another dunk to tie the game 65 - 65 .
UK would not score again .
Tennessee had not beaten Kentucky since March 2008 .
Tennessee coach Bruce Pearl has won 90 percent of his home games since taking over in Knoxville .
A suburban Philadelphia school district is deactivating a webcam , theft - tracking program secretly lodged on 2,300 student laptops following allegations the device was used by administrators to spy on a boy at home .
" I think given the concerns of parents and community members , I think we have a responsibility to at least take a pause and review the policy , " Lower Merion School District spokesman Doug Young said in a telephone interview Thursday evening .
The move came a day after the 6,900 - pupil district , which provides students from its two high schools free Macbooks , was sued in federal court on allegations it was undertaking a dragnet surveillance program targeting its students – an allegation the district denied .
Young said the computer - tracking program was activated a " handful " of times solely to track a missing laptop .
The suit was based on a student 's claim , acknowledged by the district , that the webcam was used by school officials to chronicle " improper behavior " based on a photo the computer secretly took of the boy at home .
( . pdf ) in November .
The assistant principal at Harriton High informed the student " that the school district was of the belief that minor plaintiff was engaged in improper behavior in his home , and cited as evidence a photograph from the webcam embedded in minor plaintiff 's personal laptop issued by the school district , " according to the lawsuit .
Young declined to directly say whether the program was activated in this instance to locate a missing laptop .
He said the district only activates it when there is a reported missing laptop , and urged Threat Level to draw its own " inferences . "
" The only situation where the feature would have been activated is in the case of a stolen , missing or lost laptop , " Young said .
" There 's never been any scenario used for any purpose other than that . "
Lawyers for the student did not return phone calls and e-mails for comment .
The Associated Press reported late Friday the FBI was probing the allegations .
The lawsuit seeks class - action status to represent all the district 's 2,300 high school students .
" Unbeknownst to plaintiffs and members of the class , and without their authorization , defendants have been spying on the activities of plaintiffs and class members by defendants ' indiscriminate use of and ability to remotely activate the webcams incorporated into each laptop issued to students by the school district , " according to the complaint .
When the district began issuing laptops to all its students two years ago , it never informed them of the tracking feature , said Young , the district spokesman .
He conceded that district officials went too far .
The program was not intended to bring to light the private behaviors of adolescent boys , he conceded .
" It did not seek specifically to do that , " Young said .
The name and maker of the program , Young said , was not immediately available .
He described the program as one that " basically enables the district to capture an image of the desktop and whatever is in front of the screen for law enforcement to help track down a missing computer . "

More than three million years ago , the ancestors of modern humans were still spending a considerable amount of their lives in trees , but something new was happening .
David Raichlen , an assistant professor in the University of Arizona School of Anthropology , and his colleagues at the University at Albany and City University of New York 's Lehman College have developed new experimental evidence indicating that these early hominins were walking with a human - like striding gait as long as 3.6 million years ago .
The results of their research appears in PLoS ONE , a journal from the Public Library of Science .
A trackway of fossil footprints preserved in volcanic ash deposited 3.6 million years ago was uncovered in Laetoli , Tanzania , more than 30 years ago .
The significance of those prints for human evolution has been debated ever since .
The most likely individuals to have produced these footprints , which show clear evidence of bipedalism , or walking on two legs , would have been members of the only bipedal species alive in the area at that time , Australopithecus afarensis .
That species includes " Lucy , " whose skeletal remains are the most complete of any individual A. afarensis found to date .
A number of features in the hips , legs , and back of this group indicate that they would have walked on two legs while on the ground .
But the curved fingers and toes as well as an upward - oriented shoulder blade provide solid evidence that Lucy and other members of her species also would have spent significant time climbing in trees .
This morphology differs distinctly from our own genus , Homo , who abandoned arboreal life around 2 million years ago and irrevocably committed to human - like bipedalism .
Since the Laetoli tracks were discovered , scientists have debated whether they indicate a modern human - like mode of striding bipedalism , or a less - efficient type of crouched bipedalism more characteristic of chimpanzees whose knees and hips are bent when walking on two legs .
advertisement
To resolve this , Raichlen and his colleagues devised the first biomechanical experiment explicitly designed to address this question .
The team built a sand trackway in Raichlen 's motion capture lab at the UA and filmed human subjects walking across the sand .
The subjects walked both with normal , erect human gaits and then with crouched , chimpanzee - like gaits .
Three - dimensional models of the footprints were collected by biological anthropologist Adam Gordon using equipment brought from his Primate Evolutionary Morphology Laboratory at the University at Albany .
The researchers examined the relative depth of footprints at the heel and toe , and found that depths are about equal when made by a person walking with an erect gait .
In contrast , the toe print is much deeper than the heel print when produced by a crouched gait , a product of the timing of weight transfer over the length of the foot .
" Based on previous analyses of the skeletons of Australopithecus afarensis , we expected that the Laetoli footprints would resemble those of someone walking with a bent knee , bent hip gait typical of chimpanzees , and not the striding gait normally used by modern humans , " Raichlen said .
" But to our surprise , the Laetoli footprints fall completely within the range of normal human footprints . "
The fossil footprints at Laetoli preserve a remarkably even depth at the toe and heel , just like those of modern humans .
" This more human - like form of walking is incredibly energetically efficient , suggesting that reduced energy costs were very important in the evolution of bipedalism prior to the origins of our own genus , Homo , " Raichlen said .
If the Laetoli footprints were made by Lucy 's species , as most scientists agree to be the case , these experimental results have interesting implications for the timing of evolutionary events .
" What is fascinating about this study is that it suggests that , at a time when our ancestors had an anatomy well - suited to spending a significant amount of time in the trees , they had already developed a highly efficient , modern human - like mode of bipedalism , " said Adam Gordon .
" The fossil record indicates that our ancestors did not make a full - time commitment to leaving the trees and walking on the ground until well over a million years after these ( Laetoli ) prints were made .
The fact that partially tree - dwelling animals , like Lucy , had such a remarkably modern gait is a testament to the importance of energetic efficiency in moving around on two legs , " Gordon said .
A few years ago a friend of mine taught me how to make potato chips in a microwave .
I thought she was kidding because I could n’t imagine a microwave producing crispy chips .
After cooking them for 5 minutes they were done , crispy , and wonderful !
Ideally , a mandoline works best to cut the potatoes paper thin .
If you do n’t have one you can use a vegetable peeler or slice the potato very thinly with a knife .
Cooking one batch does n’t yield that many chips , but its a great snack - sized amount for 1 person .
If you ’re up for a fun project and have a potato lying around , why not make some homemade potato chips ?
Or if you ’re like me and need to pack a snack for your kids lunch , voila ! <–
You ’re the hero of the day !
Enjoy !
5.0 from 1 reviews Print How To Make Potato Chips In The Microwave Author : Savory Sweet Life / Alice Currah Prep time : 5 mins Cook time : 5 mins Total time : 10 mins Serves : 1 Easy to make potato chips in the microwave .
Ingredients 1 russet potato
Non stick spray
Parchment paper or glass plate
Salt and Pepper Instructions
Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit the inside of your microwave .
Carefully slice1/ 3 of a potato into paper thin slices using a mandoline , vegetable peeler , or sharp knife .
You do n't want to cut any more than this because any extra slices laying around waiting to be cooked will turn pink in color .
Completely coat the parchment paper with non-stick spray and place the potato slices in a single layer .
Spray the potato slices with non stick spray and lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper .
Turn off the rotating option on your microwave and cook for 4 - 5 minutes .
Cooking times will vary based on the strength and power of your microwave .
Some chips may turn very dark brown .
Ideally you want them light and golden .
Also in my microwave some of the chips on the outside layer did n't cook as quick as the ones towards the middle , so you may need to remove the ones in the middle and cook the outer ones for an additional minute .
Repeat the process until you 've used your entire potato .
Enjoy !

** WARNING **
Some people have had their microwaves short cut , plates shatter , and potatoes go up in flames .
I ’ve never had this experience before , however , please use caution and make sure you use microwavable plates .
** UPDATE ** I ’ve made several batches of this over the weekend .
If you do n’t have parchment paper you can easily use a glass plate .
If you do n’t have non -stick spray you can brush the parchment paper or glass plate with vegetable oil .. lay the potatoes down , and give the potatoes a light brush over again with oil .
Also , the less crowded your plate and parchment paper is , the less problem you will have with the outside chips not cooking as quick as the ones in the middle .
The JREF is proud to have begun a fellowship and learning program with the Center for Inquiry , the first of which is recounted below by Christina Stephens , the first participant in the program .
Additional arrangements with other organizations are being explored , as well .
Check back at randi.org in the months ahead for more opportunities for similar week - long study in paranormal investigation and skeptical inquiry .
A few weeks ago , I had the opportunity to spend a week getting to know all of the amazing and talented people at the Center for Inquiry in Buffalo , New York .
I spent most of my time with Joe Nickell , working on various skeptical investigation projects and picking his brain for information on the ethics and process of skeptical investigations .
I would like to thank Joe Nickell , the James Randi Educational Foundation and the Center For Inquiry for an enlightening and educational experience .
I consider myself an academic researcher .
When I do research , it takes this form :
Ask a question .
Do an extensive literature review .
Ask more questions .
Make a hypothesis .
Write an experimental protocol .
Conduct an experiment with many subjects .
Report on the results .
This type of research is somewhat different from that of Joe Nickell , who , in common with James Randi , is a full time professional paranormal investigator .
Rather than attempting to find a mystery , Joe ’s detective work is geared toward solving mysteries .
Joe solves individual case - studies , and I solve cases with many subjects and controlled variables .
Both of us do work that is essential and fundamental to better understand reality .
As the Chair of the Fringe Science Investigation Committee of the Skeptical Society of St. Louis , the sort of academic research that I do professionally is simply too narrow in scope for the kind of investigations that I think our committee is capable of .
Hence , education beyond research academics is essential .
Joe and I covered many topics .
We conversed at length about how to properly conduct investigations .
Joe basically invented paranormal detective work as an outcropping of his work as an undercover investigator .
He advocates investigating on site rather than from your skeptical armchair , checking details of an account so that you ’re not trying to explain something that never happened , and assessing a claim with a controlled test or experiment among other techniques .
Each of these techniques was developed to uncover what ’s really going on .
One of the more important aspects of skeptical investigations is to avoid being a “ debunker . ”
Most skeptics can wax at length about how one must not be a debunker – a dismissive , arrogant sort of intellectual who assumes that a given paranormal or pseudoscience phenomena does not work or is not true , and then sets out to collect reams of evidence to back up her disbelief .
Doing so is what one might call being an a - priori skeptic .
An a - priori skeptic is one who dismisses claims as fervently as a true believer might hold on to them .
We should celebrate “ I doubt ” while questioning , “ I know . ”
One of the more helpful things I learned from Joe is this : the best thing that we can do to get people to understand our position as skeptics is not to be hard - nosed and dismissive , but to be empathetic .
People are n’t born skeptical , with the tools to understand the scientific method and to apply critical thinking to all situations .
They have to be given or give themselves those tools .
Some people do not become skeptics until late in their lives .
As such , we were all there once .
Most of us can remember believing in some form of pseudoscience and we do ourselves a disservice by acting as though we ’ve always had the answers .
Then , rather than our skepticism turning into an “ us vs. them ” situation when confronted with pseudoscience , we can explain the process by which we moved from believers to skeptics .
Through the course of thinking critically and applying the tools of science , we changed our minds .
It is this gentle empathy that has the power to persuade more so than mockery and arrogance .
This is especially true with regard to victims of pseudoscience .
When someone has been taken in by the claims of the anti-vaccination movement , been fleeced of their money by a charlatan psychic , or fervently believes that quantum physics hold the key to explaining ESP powers , they are a victim .
By portraying these victims as ignorant credulous masses we are further victimizing them .
I ’m one of these people who celebrates being wrong .
What I mean by that is that if someone can show me that my thinking has gone astray , that I have the wrong information , or that I was mistaken – I will happily shake the hand of the person who set me straight .
I love being wrong because it gives me humility and the capacity to change .
This is understandably abnormal .
In a world where most people abhor being wrong , it is better – for the sake of changing minds - to share a story about when we were wrong , rather than trying to show everyone how right we are .
I also must let readers in on a little secret : tucked away in and around Joe ’s office at CFI is the most impressive collection of paranormal and pseudoscience artifacts I have ever seen .
During his travels , Joe has collected everything from green bobbly alien heads to spirit paintings to antique homeopathy sets .
Part of this collection is viewable online at http://www.skeptiseum.org.
My week at CFI filled my brain to capacity with information .
I look forward to putting said information to good use .
The family of John Steinbeck has reversed its decision to oppose Google 's controversial plans to digitise millions of books , but a growing chorus of authors led by acclaimed science fiction writer Ursula K Le Guin have registered their resistance to the scheme .
As the deadline of 28 January for writers to opt out of the Google book settlement approaches , Le Guin has launched a petition , signed by almost 300 authors , asking that the US " be exempted from the settlement " , and that " the principle of copyright , which is directly threatened by the settlement , be honoured and upheld in the United States " .
Signatories to the petition include Kamila Shamsie , author of the Orange prize - shortlisted Burnt Shadows , respected science fiction writer Kim Stanley Robinson and Nick Harkaway , author of the hit debut novel The Gone - Away World .
" The free and open dissemination of information and of literature , as it exists in our public libraries , can and should exist in the electronic media .
All authors hope for that , " wrote Le Guin in her petition , having previously resigned from the Authors Guild over its support of the Google settlement , calling it a " deal with the devil " .
" But we cannot have free and open dissemination of information and literature unless the use of written material continues to be controlled by those who write it or own legitimate right in it , " her petition continued .
" We urge our government and our courts to allow no corporation to circumvent copyright law or dictate the terms of that control . "
The Google book settlement followed legal action by US authors and publishers against Google over its digitisation of works without consent .
The search giant reached a deal with the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers in 2008 , but following objections from groups including the US Department of Justice it amended the $ 125 m ( £ 77.5 m ) deal , presenting a revised version of the settlement to a New York federal court in November .
A final hearing is scheduled for 18 February , but authors have until 28 January to decide whether to opt out of the settlement or to raise objections to it .
Harkaway and Shamsie , both signatories to Le Guin 's petition , have taken different approaches , Harkaway opting out and Shamsie deciding to opt in despite her opposition , as she believes it will give her greater control over what happens to her books .
" It comes down to this : are you willing to legitimise the Google book settlement by opting in in order to exercise greater control over your work , while recognising there 's no absolute guarantee of control , or would you prefer to opt out , have no part in the Google book settlement , and hold on to your rights to sue , even if this means your control over what happens with your books is vastly diminished ? " she said .
She " very reluctantly " decided to opt in and instruct Google that she does n't want her books used if they 've already digitised them , and does n't want them to be digitised if they have n't already done so .
" I think like a lot of authors I woke up to the situation fairly late .
I was always dimly aware of it but I was n't paying it enough attention , " she said .
" When the deadline started approaching I realised I would have to look more closely [ and realised ] there were too many grey areas , too much which can go horribly wrong for writers . "
The Steinbeck family , however , has reversed the opposition to the deal it aired last year , and decided to opt in .
" While we continue in our belief that what Google did was an imperious act of copyright infringement , it is time to step off the battlefield and evaluate our losses and our gains .
When we look at the new conditions of the revised settlement , it meets our standards of control over the intellectual properties that would otherwise remain at risk were we to stay out of the settlement , " wrote Gail Steinbeck , wife of Thomas Steinbeck , the author 's son , in a statement yesterday .
Le Guin said she would be sending her petition , for which she is still gathering support , to the judge overseeing the case by 28 January .

A worried accounting executive at Lehman Brothers , who raised the alarm about what he saw as dubious number - crunching at the doomed Wall Street bank , lost his job barely a month after alerting the auditor Ernst & Young , his lawyer claimed yesterday , in a case prompting calls for tighter protection for corporate whistleblowers .
Matthew Lee , a senior vice - president in Lehman 's finance division , outlined six allegations of unethical accounting in a memo sent on 16 May 2008 to Lehman 's senior managers , who asked Ernst & Young to investigate .
In discussions with partners at Ernst & Young , he highlighted controversial " repo 105 " transactions that artificially boosted Lehman 's balance sheet by $ 50 bn ( £ 33bn ) .
But the London - based accounting firm took " virtually no action " , according to an official report into Lehman 's demise and Lee 's lawyer , Erwin Shustak , said his client lost his job in late June 2008 , officially as part of a broader downsizing .
Shustak told the Wall Street Journal : " It was just easier to shut him up and let him go . "
Lee , 56 , has emerged as a crucial figure in Lehman 's downfall and in controversy over the conduct of Ernst & Young .
A court - appointed examiner , Anton Valukas , found gaping discrepancies in the accounts of E&Y partners who met Lee and concluded there are grounds for legal claims against the auditing firm for failing to meet professional standards .
The six allegations made by Lee included claims that Lehman 's monthly balance sheet listed $ 5bn of assets above reality , that the bank failed to value its inventory of financial products in a " fully realistic or reasonable " way , that audit - level personnel were inadequately qualified , that systems were ineffective and that there were " tens of billions of dollars " of possibly toxic liabilities .
Ernst & YoungE&Y 's senior partner responsible for auditing Lehman , William Schlich , and a colleague , Hillary Hansen , interviewed Lee .
But reporting back to Lehman 's independent directors , they did not mention Lee 's key concern about repo 105 , an issue which one Lehman director , the former Vodafone boss Sir Christopher Gent , later said ought to have been passed on .
Lehman 's alleged handling of Lee was criticised by Stephen Kohn , director of the Washington - based National Whistleblowers Center , who said it was a common tactic for corporations to get rid of whistleblowers under the guise of broader redundancy programmes .
" If you 're a company and want to get rid of a whistleblower , it 's common to stick them in a round of layoffs , " said Kohn .
" It looks like this person has all the attributes of a major whistleblower retaliation case . "
Kohn said the 2002 Sarbanes - Oxley Act , which reformed US accounting , had been ineffective .
He said : " Publicly traded companies are required to have an audit committee that will look at employee concerns and companies are not allowed to retaliate .
People are supposed to be protected but those protections have n't worked . "
The detailsed circumstances of Lee 's dismissal have not been disclosed .
One industry insider suggested that he could have written his memo after learning that he was on a list for imminent redundancy .
Larry McDonald , a former Lehman banker and author of a book on the bank 's collapse entitled A Colossal Failure of Common Sense , said Lee was one of many middle - ranking employees who had come forward to aid investigators into Lehman 's demise .
He said : " He 's a hero , and I agree with everything he said , but there are other whistleblowers too , and people helping out investigators . "
An expert in whistleblower cases , John Phillips of the law firm Phillips & Cohen , said Ernst & Young faced " difficult questions " about its treatment of Lee and its relationship with Lehman 's top brass : " Auditors are supposed to be independent and responsible to shareholders .
When they get too close to management , it 's always a problem – it can be too cosy a relationship . "
In a statement , Ernst & Young said its last completed audit of Lehman was for the year to November 2007 .
The accountancy firm said Lehman itself had investigated Lee 's memo but concluded : " The allegations were unfounded and there were no material issues identified . "
Ernst said : " We never concluded our review of this matter , because Lehman went into bankruptcy before we completed our audit . "
Dysmorphia : Male Anorexia
Page 1 of 2
Many women suffer from anorexia , and now men have a similar disorder .
It 's called muscle dysmorphia , and if you body build , you may know what I 'm talking about .
The worst thing about this disorder is that some guys might have it and be completely unaware .
what is muscle dysmorphia ?
Muscle dysmorphia is the opposite of anorexia .
Unlike anorexia , which makes one believe that they 're overweight , muscle dysmorphia bequeaths the illusion that one does not have big enough muscles .
People with both anorexia and muscle dysmorphia share a condition called body dysmorphia , an illness that leads them to constantly imagine that their body needs to change even though it is fine by normal standards .
Muscle dysmorphia is still a relatively new psychological disorder ; doctors at Brown and Keele University in England discovered this disorder not too long ago , but it is definitely real .
Dysmorphia is an obsessive - compulsive disorder that affects a person 's perception of their body image .
Most men who have this psychological illness are rather muscular when compared to the rest of the population , but they nonetheless wear baggy clothes and refuse to take their shirts off in public out of fear of being ridiculed because of their ( anticipated ) small size .
It can be quite serious and needs to be treated .
Muscular dysmorphia might not have as direct an impact on a man 's health as anorexia , but its repercussions can still have grave effects on a person 's life .
Some of the symptoms can cause irreparable damage to the body and the negative impact it can have on one 's social life can take years to fix .
do you have dysmorphia ?
Men who have this illness will spend countless hours at the gym every day , lifting weights obsessively .
They will always check to see if they gained mass , and constantly complain that they are too thin or too small and need to bulk up .
They will be fixated on eating the right things and adjust their entire life around gaining mass .
It might sound like virtually every guy at the gym , but dysmorphia is an extreme case of bodybuilding on the brain .
Men with this condition exaggerate every aspect of bodybuilding to the point of delusion .
Eating the right food will not simply be a conviction ; it 's going to be a phobia .
Time spent away from the gym will cause anxiety and stress , and life outside the gym will suffer .
Social life , job opportunities , work , dates , and anything else that can interfere with time spent at the gym will take a backseat .
In extreme cases of dysmorphia , men will over - workout until they damage their muscles , sometimes permanently .
And then , they turn to steroids ...

The National Republican Congressional Committee has launched what it 's called its " Code Red " initiative -- a plan to pressure vulnerable House Democrats on health care reform -- Hotline OnCall 's Reid Wilson reports .
What this entails is a round of robocalls aimed at 25 Democrats who voted for the House health reform bill and 10 who voted against it .
See the full list in Wilson 's post .
The House will need to pass the Senate 's bill in order for the Democrats ' reform plans to work ( the Senate will then proceed to modify it through reconciliation . ) , and , as of several weeks ago , it appeared House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did n't have the votes to do it .
But , as momentum has grown under the president 's guidance - - a major event here seems to be his issuance of a proposal , with his own presidential stamp of approval ( something that had been lacking all along ) -- speculation is that Pelosi may have them , and at least 10 Democrats who voted " no " originally are now considering changing their stance to support the president 's plan .
The NRCC , for its part , will be trying to add some pressure .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Chilean Quake May Have Shortened Earth Days
The Feb. 27 magnitude 8.8 earthquake in Chile may have shortened the length of each Earth day .
JPL research scientist Richard Gross computed how Earth 's rotation should have changed as a result of the Feb. 27 quake .
Using a complex model , he and fellow scientists came up with a preliminary calculation that the quake should have shortened the length of an Earth day by about 1.26 microseconds ( a microsecond is one millionth of a second ) .
Perhaps more impressive is how much the quake shifted Earth 's axis .
Gross calculates the quake should have moved Earth 's figure axis ( the axis about which Earth 's mass is balanced ) by 2.7 milliarcseconds ( about 8 centimeters , or 3 inches ) .
Earth ’s figure axis is not the same as its north - south axis ; they are offset by about 10 meters ( about 33 feet ) .
By comparison , Gross said the same model estimated the 2004 magnitude 9.1 Sumatran earthquake should have shortened the length of day by 6.8 microseconds and shifted Earth 's axis by 2.32 milliarcseconds ( about 7 centimeters , or 2.76 inches ) .
Gross said that even though the Chilean earthquake is much smaller than the Sumatran quake , it is predicted to have changed the position of the figure axis by a bit more for two reasons .
First , unlike the 2004 Sumatran earthquake , which was located near the equator , the 2010 Chilean earthquake was located in Earth 's mid-latitudes , which makes it more effective in shifting Earth 's figure axis .
Second , the fault responsible for the 2010 Chiliean earthquake dips into Earth at a slightly steeper angle than does the fault responsible for the 2004 Sumatran earthquake .
This makes the Chile fault more effective in moving Earth 's mass vertically and hence more effective in shifting Earth 's figure axis .
Gross said the Chile predictions will likely change as data on the quake are further refined .

Yesterday evening , the U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to renew three expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act , after the Senate abandoned the PATRIOT reform effort and approved the extension by a voice vote on Wednesday night .
Disappointingly , the government 's dangerously broad authority to conduct roving wiretaps of unspecified or " John Doe " targets , to secretly wiretap of persons without any connection to terrorists or spies under the so - called " lone wolf " provision , and to secretly access a wide range of private business records without warrants under PATRIOT Section 215 were all renewed without any new checks and balances to prevent abuse .
Despite months of vigorous debate , when PATRIOT renewal bills providing for greater oversight and accountability were approved by the Judiciary Committees of both the House and the Senate , Democratic leaders ' push for reform fizzled in the face of staunch Republican opposition buoyed by recent hot - button events such as the attempted bombing of an airliner on Christmas Day and the shooting at Fort Hood .
The renewed PATRIOT provisions were originally set to expire on December 31 , 2009 , but Congress ran out of time last year and temporarily extended them until February 28th , this coming Sunday .
The new extension is expected to be signed by the President before then .
The one silver lining ?
Despite a push by Republican leaders for a four - year extension , the renewed provisions are now set to expire in one year .
So , although this battle 's been lost , the effort to roll back PATRIOT 's worst excesses is far from over .
Thank you to everyone who took action to support PATRIOT reform this past year ; we hope that you 'll continue the fight with us in the next year .
Touritaly.org Home | Italy MAPS | Academic Content | Links | About Us | Italy News | Italian Phrasebook | Italy Weather | Site Map Pompeii : The Brothel Some of the most fascinating clues about the lives of the ancient peoples who made their lives in Pompeii can be found in the numerous brothels in the city .
It is an indication of the prosperity of the city -- people had money to burn .
Here is one example of the Pompeian " houses of ill repute " .
I chose this one because of its unusual architecture and fine frescoes .
The architecture and external appearance of the building are to me its most interesting features .
Because of the overhang on the upper level , it looks like it could have been constructed in the Middle Ages instead of during the first century .
The erotic frescoes that line the interior of the building are quite well preserved .
The paintings point to the use of the building , but there are more clues in the interior layout .
As you enter the building you will find yourself in a long rectangular chamber or hallway .
Along each side of the chamber are small cubicles .
Evidently these cubicles are the spaces where the ladies would " conduct their work " .
Personally , I think that the working areas were a little on the cramped side .
There certainly was not as much room as the frescoes would lead you to believe .
The rooms are only about 5 feet wide ( about 1.3 meters ) .
There is no way that anyone could have stretched out as the frescoes suggest .
... unless they were really , really short in the first century !

The profitable game of including immigrants in the census , then deporting them .
Henry Arroliga lives in South Texas ’ Port Isabel Detention Center , one of the nation ’s largest immigration detention facilities .
After 17 years of living illegally in the United States , he ’s bracing himself to return to his native Nicaragua .
Although Arroliga could very well be deported within the next month , the 2010 U.S. Census will count him as a resident of Los Fresnos , in Cameron County .
His short stint at Port Isabel will pay dividends to the city , county , and state for the next decade .
Arroliga is one of more than 30,000 immigrant detainees who will be counted in this year ’s census .
Four hundred billion dollars in federal funding over the next 10 years will be distributed based on the count , making detainees worth thousands of dollars to cities , counties , and states where they are briefly detained .
The government will allocate more than $ 100 million in additional funds to places where immigrants are detained .
More than funding is at stake :
The composition of legislative districts , county board districts , and city council districts could be skewed by soon - to - be - deported prisoners .
Census data are used on the state and national levels to determine the sizes and shapes of these districts .
The inclusion of detainees in the count means fewer eligible voters per elected official in places like Cameron County .
It also violates the principle of “ proportional representation . ”
For decades , the government has included prisoners in the census , regardless of their immigration status .
In the past , the impact of immigrant detainees has been slight .
This is the first decennial census since the re-organization of immigrantion agencies and the subsequent boom in immigration detention .
Immigration prisons have expanded from 7,500 beds in 1995 to more than 30,000 in 2010 .
About one - third of the nation ’s immigrant detainees are held in Texas .
That does n’t count undocumented immigrants in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service awaiting deportation proceedings — thousands in Texas alone .
Carl Caulk , the U.S. Marshals assistant
director for prisoner operations , says that recent Border Patrol crackdowns like Operation Streamline have sent the number of immigrants in Marshals ’ custody through the roof .
Operation Streamline mandated that charges be filed against virtually every person caught crossing the border illegally .
Like ICE detainees , these immigrants will be counted in the 2010 census .
The Census Bureau ’s inclusion of immigrant detainees has received little notice .
It comes at a tense time in the immigration debate , with reform advocates facing a challenging political climate .
This year ’s population count points to an often ignored irony :
The country ’s detention facilities are concentrated in districts represented by some of Congress ’ most outspoken advocates of reform — including several South Texas congressmen who will benefit from counting immigrant detainees .
U.S. Rep. Solomon Ortiz , a Corpus Christi Democrat , introduced a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the House this spring .
Yet with about 5,000 beds for immigrant detainees , his South Texas district stands to see millions of additional tax dollars allocated on the basis of the census .
In response to questions from the Observer , Ortiz issued a statement reading : “ The U.S. Census Bureau is mandated by the United States Constitution to count every resident regardless of citizenship status .
I can assure you that it is in everybody ’s best interest to get as many people as possible counted . ”
Until this census , the count had never identified exactly where “ group quarters ” like prisons are and how many people occupy them .
For the first time , this census will let states decide whether to count detainees in local populations .
By excluding prisoners , states would get a more accurate population count and would ensure that funds are not distributed according to locations of large detention centers .
The amount of federal funding directed to the state would not change .
Counting prisoners — residents or immigrants — is against Texas state law .
“ A person who is an inmate in a penal institution or who is an involuntary inmate in a hospital or eleemosynary institution does not , while an inmate , acquire residence at the place where the institution is located , ” reads Texas Election Code Section 1.015 .
Nevertheless , the census counts them as residents .
“ There ’s a clear discrepancy between state law and the Census Bureau ’s methodology , ” said Peter Wagner of the Prison Policy Initiative , a Massachusetts - based research group .
Congressman Ortiz had no comment on how detainees could affect federal funding and redistricting .
Some of his former supporters see his willingness to profit from his district ’s immigrant detainees as evidence of hypocrisy .
“ I ca n’t think of anything more two - faced , ” said the Rev. Miguel Rivera , president of the National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders , and an advocate for immigration reform .
To the Census Bureau ’s dismay , Rivera has urged undocumented immigrants not to fill out the census forms .
“ It ’s our greatest bargaining chip , ” he said .
“ The states and counties want the funding , and we want the legalization . ”
Rivera ’s campaign has received considerable attention , and while many Latino leaders disagree with his approach , he is convinced that threatening to withhold the instruments of federal funding is the way to attract politicians to the table .
Within facilities like Port Isabel , detainees likely wo n’t be able to opt out of the census .
According to Census Bureau officials , for the last month detention center employees have been completing census forms on behalf of inmates like Henry Arroliga .
“ They ’re using them to secure federal funding and political power , and then they ’re shipping them out of the country , ” Rivera said .
“ It ’s an insult . ”
The issue has made Rivera and U.S. Sen .
David Vitter , a Louisiana Republican , unlikely bedfellows .
Vitter , along with several other conservatives in Congress , supported an unsuccessful effort last fall to exclude noncitizens from apportionment and redistricting counts .
“ I do n’t believe noncitizens should be counted in congressional reapportionment , ” Vitter told Congress last fall .
“ I do n’t think states which have particularly large noncitizen populations should have more say and more clout in Congress , and that states like Louisiana that do n’t should be penalized . ”
Or , if you follow the logic , that states like Texas should be rewarded .
In Raymondville , a rural city 100 miles south of Corpus Christi , the census count is buzzing along .
The Census Bureau has a booth outside City Hall .
Local TV stations are advertising the importance of filling out the forms .
People have been hired to distribute forms , part of a 1.2 million temporary work force nationwide that will make up the largest civilian mobilization of Americans in history .
In Raymondville , the conversation is n’t about the scale of the government ’s undertaking .
It ’s about the Willacy Detention Center , the country ’s largest detention facility , holding up to 3,000 prisoners .
When the census came up at the last City Council meeting , a councilman asked city secretary Eleazar Garcia : “ What about the detainees ?
Do we get to count them ? ”
If its population exceeds 10,000 in the census , Raymondville would be in the running for a panoply of state grants .
The only way that could happen is if the city ’s immigrant detainees are included in the count .
“ Overall , we would benefit if we could hit that mark , ” Garcia said .
So would La Villa , just north of McAllen .
The 2000 census found its population to be 1,305 .
Just a year later , the Louisiana - based private prison company LCS Corrections Services Inc. opened the East Hidalgo Detention Center , which houses up to 990 immigrant detainees .
According to its warden , the facility is almost always full .
After the 2010 Census is tallied , the detention center will nearly double La Villa ’s population on paper , potentially doubling its federal funding allocation distributed by the state according to population .
( The facility , run by the U.S. Marshals , is already a boon to the local government , which receives $ 2 per prisoner per day . )
The distribution of funds based on immigrant detainee populations “ points to a flaw in the way the population counts are used , ” said Audrey Singer , a demographer at the Brookings Institution , a Washington - based think tank .
“ The fact that ICE detainees are geographically concentrated will have an effect on the count . ”
In Washington , there appears to be confusion about the inclusion of immigrant detainees in the census .
Congressman Henry Cuellar , a Laredo Democrat , represents a district that includes the 1,900 - bed South Texas Detention Center and the 450 - bed Laredo Contract Detention Facility .
He defended the inclusion of immigrant detainees : “ Vitally important funding that supports these facilities relies , in part , on census data . ”
Experts say Cuellar is wrong .
“ Immigration prisons are funded by the Department of Homeland Security , not formula grants ” based on census data , said Wagner of the Prison Policy Initiative .
Like Rep. Ortiz , Cuellar is a longstanding advocate of immigration reform .
His attitude about immigrant detainees in the census has disturbed immigration - reform advocates in his district .
One reason Texas ’ congressmen and state representatives might be looking the other way is that 375,000 Texans were not counted in 2000 , according to a Census Bureau study .
That cost the state a huge amount of federal dollars .
The main culprit , experts agree , was the difficulty of getting undocumented immigrants — including an estimated 150,000 in the Rio Grande Valley alone — to participate .
This year , the Census Bureau has spent millions on a campaign to convince minorities , including undocumented immigrants , to get themselves counted .
Still , community organizers and activists along the border say the effort faces considerable challenges .
“ The census worker shows up and expects people to be compliant , ” said Michael Seifert of the Equal Voice for America ’s Families Network .
“ Much laughter is heard in the cantina around that idea . ”
During the 2000 census , Seifert said some immigrants distrusted and feared the government — a fear then inspired by President Bill Clinton ’s 1996 immigration enforcement bills .
“ I find it so sweetly ironic that those who have been caught up in the biggest dragnet of a civilian population in American history — the detainees — will be included in the census count , and therefore serve as a ‘ corrective ’ to all of those people who will ignore the census request , ” Seifert said .
The issue could be resolved if Texas decides to remove immigrant detainees from the count before distributing state funds and addressing redistricting .
The Census Bureau has agreed to release data on inmate populations earlier than usual to let states and localities consider it in apportioning districts for 2011 and 2012 races .
It ’s an issue that could be broached in the 2011 legislative session .
Bills to make such adjustments are already pending in New York , Maryland , Illinois , Florida and Wisconsin .
So far , including immigrant detainees in Texas ’ census count has been a non-issue .
“ It ’s hard to believe that the victims of our inhumane immigration detention system are being used like this , ” Rivera said , “ like pawns in a game of state and national politics . ”
Kevin Sieff , an Observer contributing writer , lives in Washington , D.C .
Volunteers in Afghanistan — both locals and foreigners from the MIT Bits and Atoms lab — have been building out a wireless network made largely from locally scrounged junk .
They call it " FabFi " and it 's kicking ass , especially when compared with the World Bank - funded alternative , which has spent seven years and hundreds of millions of dollars and only managed its first international link last summer .
Pictured below is a makeshift reflector constructed from pieces of board , wire , a plastic tub and , ironically enough , a couple of USAID vegetable oil cans that was made today by Hameed , Rahmat and their friend " Mr. Willy " .
It is TOTALLY AWESOME , and EXACTLY what Fab is all about .
The boys at the Jalalabad Fab Lab came up with their own design to meet the growing demand created by the International Fab surge last September .
As usual all surge participants who came from the US , South Africa , Iceland and England paid their own way .
Somebody needs to sponsor these people .
For those of you who are suckers for numbers , the reflector links up just shy of - 71d Bm at about 1 km , giving it a gain of somewhere between 5 and 6d Bi .
With a little tweaking and a true parabolic shape , it could easily be as powerful as the small FabFi pictured above ( which is roughly 8 - 10 d Bi depending on materials )
Achievement hunters , beware !

WITH an apocalyptic sense of humour , Angelinos quip they have four seasons — wildfires , downpours , mudslides and earthquakes .
The first three usually occur during autumn and winter ; the last whenever the fractured rocks beneath the Los Angeles basin decide it 's time to release some megatons of pent - up energy .
Actually , because the region is bounded by a frigid ocean on one side and a baking desert on the other , while the sky above is cloudless for over 300 days a year , the temperature varies more dramatically than is generally appreciated .
So much so , indeed , that once every month or two your correspondent has to reprogram his home 's heating , ventilating and air - conditioning ( HVAC ) system to adjust for the change in temperature and humidity .
It is a fiddly process , involving some three dozen keystrokes for each of the controllers in the house .
The digital controllers used were considered state of the art when the 45 - year - old dwelling was torn apart and rebuilt eight years ago .
Temperatures can be set for waking time , leaving time , return time and bed time .
The settings can be over - ridden temporarily with a couple of keystrokes , and different cycles can be set for different days of the week .
The controllers adjust automatically for daylight - saving time , but need to be reprogrammed whenever the system is flipped from heating mode to air - conditioning .
Really , the controllers are digital only in the sense that they have liquid - crystal displays and send their signals as electrical pulses down wires to a pair of HVAC systems at opposite ends of the house .
The temperature in the boiler has to be set manually and is usually left untouched all year round .
At least it is a Japanese on - demand heater rather than a storage tank .
Apart from the thermostats in the controllers , there are no other sensors inside or outside the building .
As a result , there is no feedback to tell the HVAC or boiler to raise or lower the settings according to ambient conditions — nor , indeed , to tell it whether the building is actually occupied .
In other words , your correspondent 's home is a typical dumb house , ripe for some form of intelligent control .
In conservation terms , the house has been built to the highest commercial standards for insulation .
Even without energy - hogging appliances like washing machines and dishwashers being used only at the most optimal times of the day , annual electricity consumption is still a modest 2.4 kilowatt - hours a square foot — about 25 % less than the average American home .
Ultra -low energy houses , like the Passivhaus standard developed in Germany , manage with an annual 1.5 kilowatt - hours a square foot or less .
So , plenty of savings remain to be had .
To get them , though , means knowing a whole lot more about the pattern of energy use than is disclosed in a utilities bill for the previous month ( or two , in your correspondent 's case ) .
A study done in Florida a decade ago looked at the energy consumption of ten identical houses fitted with the same electrical appliances and equipment .
Despite the similarities , there was a huge variation in consumption — with the most energy - intensive home consuming 2.6 times more than the least .
In other words , the occupant 's behaviour is a crucial factor governing the use of energy .
So , anything that changes the way users behave should reap appreciable savings — for utilities as well as consumers .
The so - called “ smart grid ” attempts to do this by offering customers cheap rates in exchange for letting the utility turn down their thermostats remotely when demand for electricity on the grid peaks .
Forgoing a shirt - sleeve environment for one needing a sweater in the winter or a T - shirt in the summer could save the local power company having to switch on thirsty gas - turbines and other peak - lopping generators .
But survey work done by Parks Associates , a market - research company based in Dallas , Texas , suggests that only 15 - 20 % of consumers are willing to sign up for such “ time - of- use ” or “ demand response ” programmes .
And 35 % of customers say they would not allow the utility to control thermostats in their homes at any price .
Intriguingly , though , the survey also shows that over 80 % of households would pay up to $ 100 for cost - saving equipment if it chopped at least 10 % off their monthly electricity bills .
That is roughly what a residential energy - monitoring system can do .
Such equipment measures the power drawn from the grid using a transformer / transducer device clipped on the electricity meter or breaker box .
The instantaneous values are sent to a wall - mounted display via the powerline or a wireless connection .
The display gives the number of kilowatts being drawn at that moment plus the projected consumption in kilowatt - hours as well as dollars and cents .
Some energy - monitoring systems even display consumption patterns from previous months , along with projected monthly electricity costs , monthly peak demand , and the household 's share of the greenhouse gases being emitted .
Studies show that providing real - time feedback to customers on the amount of electricity they are using — along with its projected cost — prompts them to cut consumption by as much as 15 % .
If they had even better information , they would presumably save even more .
For instance , most energy - monitoring systems on the market today provide just the household 's overall consumption , and they do so only for electricity .
In many places , gas accounts for up to half the energy used domestically .
The few really smart energy - monitoring systems that can break the overall consumption pattern down by the kind of appliances using it are not cheap , but they allow consumers to save even more money — by running things like dishwashers and washing machines during the night when electricity rates are lowest .
Having a lot more information about a home 's energy consumption than is revealed in a brief monthly statement is all to the good .
But having constantly to make decisions about lifestyle according to rules laid down by a local utility can be tedious , to say the least .
That is why your correspondent will be queuing up for a radically different type of home energy - management system when it goes on sale next month .
What is special about the approach adopted by PassivSystems , a small company based in Newbury , England , is that it goes way beyond smart meters and focuses strictly on the consumer 's needs rather the utility 's .
“ Everyone wants lower energy costs , but few people have enough time in the day to become their home 's energy manager , ” says Colin Calder , the firm 's founder .
“ Simply giving people more information about energy consumption is not the solution . ”
The heart of Mr Calder 's system is an intelligent wireless hub which interrogates sensors attached to the HVAC system , the boiler and the various electrical appliances around the home .
It monitors their activity and relays the information to an account that the user can see via a personal computer or smart - phone .
On being set up , the system learns the user 's preferences for four different situations : when the occupants are home ; when they have gone to sleep ; when they are out for a short while ; and when they are on holiday .
Knowing the various times they like to take a shower , the system preheats just enough water at the appropriate time to meet each person 's needs .
When people go to bed , the system senses which rooms can have their heating or cooling powered down .
At the touch of a pre-programmed button , appliances not being used can be switched off and those on standby given just enough juice to keep their memories alive .
Forget to push the button before leaving for work , and you can do so remotely by phone .
Trials suggest an intelligent system like this should be able to reduce energy bills by up to 28 % .
With the hub , controller and various sensors expected to cost around $ 450 and the installation much the same , your correspondent expects to recover his costs within three years .
In the process , his home could become almost as green as those pricey “ passive houses ” the Europeans build .
Instead of using the poverty threshold to exempt low - income people , the bill would exempt households with incomes below the tax - filing threshold — $ 9,350 for individuals and $ 18,700 for couples in 2009 .
Would revise the penalty for some years :
In 2014 , $ 95 a year or 1 percent household ’s income ; in 2015 , $ 325 or 2 percent of income ; in 2016 , $ 695 or 2.5 percent of income ( with a maximum of $ 2,085 for a family ) .
Exemptions : American Indians ; people with religious objections ; people who can show financial hardship ; people without coverage for less than three months ; households with income below 100 percent of the poverty level ( $ 22,050 for a family of four in 2009 ) ; households that would pay more than 8 percent of their income on premiums for the cheapest available health plan .
Penalty :
In 2014 , $ 95 a year or 0.5 percent of a household ’s income , whichever is greater ; in 2015 , $ 495 or 1 percent of income ; in 2016 , $ 750 or 2 percent of income ( with a maximum of $ 2,250 for a family ) .
The penalty would be adjusted for inflation after 2016 .
Starting in 2014 , require that most Americans have a minimum level of health insurance or else pay a penalty .
Open to employers with 100 or fewer workers .
Starting in 2017 , states could allow employers with more than 100 employees to participate in the exchange .
Open to people who do not have qualifying coverage through an employer or a public program .
States would form their own exchanges .
Several states could join together to form a regional exchange .
Create health insurance marketplaces , where individuals and employers can shop for insurance and compare prices and benefits , by 2014 .
The federal Office of Personnel Management , which provides health benefits to federal employees , would sign contracts with insurers to offer at least two national health plans to individuals , families and small businesses .
The new plans would be separate from the program for federal employees , and premiums would be calculated separately .
At least one of the plans would have to operate on a nonprofit basis .
Would not create a new government insurance plan to compete with private insurers .
Starting in 2019 , the subsidies would grow at a slower rate than under the Senate bill .
Would offer more generous subsidies to lower income groups .
Households below 150 percent of the would pay 2 percent to 4 percent of their income on premiums .

Households in the highest income group eligible for subsidies — those between 350 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level ( $ 77,175 to $ 88,200 for a family of four ) — would pay 9.8 percent of their income on premiums .
Health plans would cover 70 percent of the cost of the benefits .
Households in the lowest income group — those below 150 percent of the poverty level ( $ 33,075 for a family of four ) — would pay 2 percent to 4.6 percent of their income on premiums .
Health plans would cover 90 percent of the cost of the benefits .
Would provide tax credits , on a sliding scale , to people with incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level ( $ 88,200 for a family of four ) to help pay insurance premiums and out - of - pocket costs like co-payments and deductibles .
Starting in 2014 , provide tax credits to low - and middle - income people to help them buy insurance through the exchange .
Would increase the penalty to $ 2,000 for each full time worker in the company , but would exempt the first 30 employees while calculating the penalty .
For example , an employer with 53 workers would pay the penalty for 23 workers , or $ 46,000 .
Employers who offer coverage would be required to provide vouchers — equal to what the employer would have paid under the company ’s plan — to low - and middle income workers to obtain insurance on their own through the exchanges .
These firms would not be subject to penalties if any of the employees receive subsidies .
People with incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level ( $ 88,200 for a family of four ) would be eligible for the vouchers if they spend between 8 and 9.8 percent of their income on premiums .
Employers with more than 50 workers that offer coverage would also pay a penalty if any of the workers obtain subsidies to buy insurance .
In this case , the penalty would be $ 3,000 for each employee who receives subsidized coverage , or $ 750 for each full - time worker in the company , whichever is lesser .
Employers with 50 or more full - time workers would pay a penalty if they do not offer health benefits and if any of the workers obtain subsidized coverage through the new health insurance exchanges .
Would not explicitly require employers to offer coverage .
Starting in 2014 , penalize some employers if low - and middle - income workers use federal subsidies to buy insurance .
The federal government would cover 80 percent of the cost of a retiree ’s medical claims of more than $ 15,000 through 2013 , with a cap at $ 90,000 — at which point the employer ’s plan would pay the rest .
Employers with 25 or fewer workers and average wages of $ 50,000 or less could qualify for tax credits .
Employers with 10 or fewer workers and average wages of less than $ 25,000 can get the full credit — up to 35 percent of premium costs between 2010 and 2013 and 50 percent thereafter .
The credit would phase out as firm size and average wage increases .
Starting in 2010 , provide tax credits to small businesses that want to offer coverage .
Subsidize employer plans that cover early retirees ages 55 to 64 .
Would increase Medicaid payment rates to primary care doctors to match Medicare payment rates , which are higher , in 2013 and 2014 .
Would take away the exemption for Nebraska and increase the share of federal spending for covering newly eligible people .
The federal government would pay all of the costs until 2016 , 95 percent in 2017 , 94 percent in 2018 , 93 percent in 2019 and 90 percent thereafter .
Some states that already insure childless adults under Medicaid would receive more federal money for covering that group through 2018 .
From 2014 to 2016 , the federal government would pay all of the costs for covering the newly eligible .
The share of federal spending would vary somewhat from year to year after 2016 , but would average about 90 percent by 2019 , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
Currently , the federal government pays about 57 percent , on average , of the costs of Medicaid benefits .
Nebraska is the only state that would receive 100 percent of the cost of expanding Medicaid .
Would cover everyone with incomes less than 133 percent of the poverty level ( $ 29,327 for a family of four ) .
Starting in 2014 , expand Medicaid to cover millions of additional people , including parents and childless adults who are not eligible under current rules .
The 50 percent discount on brand - name drugs would begin in 2011 .
By 2020 , the government would pay to provide up to 75 percent discount on brand - name and generic drugs , eventually closing the coverage gap .
Would give a one - time , $ 250 rebate to people who face the coverage gap in 2010 ( instead of the $ 500 increse ) .
Would increase the amount of drug costs covered by Medicare by $ 500 in 2010 .
And beginning on July 1 , 2010 , drug makers would provide 50 percent discounts on brand - name drugs and biologics that low - and middle - income beneficiaries have to pay for themselves once the coverage gap begins .
Currently , older Americans in the coverage gap pay 25 percent of the cost of their drugs up to $ 2,830 in out - of - pocket spending , then the full cost of drugs up to $ 6,300 — a $ 3,470 “ doughnut hole ” — after which Medicare catastrophic coverage kicks in and seniors pay only 5 percent of the cost of additional drugs .
Would close a gap in Medicare coverage of prescription drugs , known as the doughnut hole , by 2020 .
The exchanges would offer three other benefit plans , covering 70 percent to 90 percent of costs .
A plan for catastrophic coverage would be available to people up to the age of 30 and those who are exempt from the requirement to obtain insurance .
The basic plan would cover 60 percent of the cost of the benefits .
The proposal would limit out - of - pocket costs at $ 5,950 year for an individual and $ 11,900 for a family .
Require insurance plans to offer a minimum package of health insurance benefits , to be defined by the federal government .
Would extend the ban on exclusion based on medical condition and annual limits to all employer - sponsored health plans by 2014 .
Would extend the ban on lifetime limits and rescission of coverage to all existing health plans within six months .
Insurers would be required to spend more of their premium revenues — between 80 to 85 cents of every dollar — on medical claims .
According to a recent Senate Commerce Committee analysis , the largest for - profit insurance companies spend about 74 cents out of every dollar on medical care in the individual market .
Insurers competing in the new exchanges would be required to justify rate increases and those who raise prices excessively could be barred from the exchanges .
Premiums for older people cannot be more than three times the premium for young adults .
People with pre-existing conditions who have been turned down for health insurance could sign up for a high - risk insurance pool that would be available within 90 days and remain available until 2014 .
Within six months , insurers would be prohibited from denying coverage to children based on pre-existing medical conditions , from placing lifetime dollar limits on coverage and from rescinding coverage when a person becomes sick or disabled .
The ban on exclusion based on pre-existing conditions would be extended to every one when the exchanges are operational in 2014 .
Prohibit insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums because of a person ’s medical history or health condition .
Before 2014 , only children who do not have a choice of coverage from an employer can stay on their parents ’ plan .
Would apply the requirement to cover children to all existing plans within six months , not just new plans .
Would allow children to stay on their parents ’ insurance plans until they turn 26 .
Currently , states set the age at which adults can no longer be covered by their parents ’ insurance .
Within six months , require health plans , including employer - sponsored plans , to cover children of policyholders up to a certain age .
The amount of benefits would vary , depending on the degree of a person ’s disability , but could not average less than $ 50 a day .
The Congressional Budget Office assumes that premiums would be $ 123 a month for benefits expected to average $ 75 a day , or about $ 27,000 a year .
The amount of benefits would vary , depending on the degree of a person ’s disability .

Individuals who have substantial cognitive impairments or are unable to perform two or three “ activities of daily living , ” like eating , bathing or dressing , would qualify .
Starting in 2011 , establish a voluntary federal program to provide long - term care insurance and cash benefits to people with severe disabilities .
No major changes .
Reconciliation is used only for budget - related issues , which means the abortion provisions ca n’t be changed .
Health plans that offer abortion coverage and receive federal subsidies would be required to segregate the federal money into separate accounts and use only the premium money and co-payments contributed by consumers to cover the procedure .
State insurance commissioners would police the “ segregation of funds . ”
People who receive federal subsidies to buy insurance could enroll in health plans that cover abortion .
But subscribers of health plans that cover abortion would have to make two separate monthly premium payments : one for all insurance coverage except abortion and one for abortion coverage .
Health plans could choose whether to cover abortion or not .
But states could prohibit the coverage of abortions by health plans that are offered for sale through the new insurance exchanges .
Prohibit use of federal money for abortions , except as allowed by current law — in cases of rape or incest or if the life of a pregnant woman was in danger .
No major changes .
Reconciliation is used only for budget - related issues , which means the immigration provisions ca n’t be changed .
Could not buy insurance from the exchanges , even if they were able to pay the full cost themselves , without federal subsidies .
Beginning in 2014 , states would receive higher federal reimbursement for the program ’s beneficiaries , increasing from an average of 70 percent to 93 percent .

Senate bill TAX ON HIGH - COST HEALTH PLANS : Starting in 2014 , would impose a 40 percent excise tax on high - cost employer - sponsored group health plans with premiums over $ 8,500 for individual coverage and $ 23,000 for family .
The thresholds would rise each year by the inflation rate plus one percentage point .
The bill would provide a special dispensation to police officers , firefighters , miners and construction workers , who have high premiums because they work in high - risk occupations .
MEDICARE PAYROLL TAX : Starting in 2013 , would increase tax rate — from 1.45 percent to 2.35 percent – for individuals earning more than $ 200,000 a year and families earning more than $ 250,000 .
FEES FROM HEALTH CARE SECTOR : Would impose annual fees , allocated by market share , on health care companies .
Starting in 2010 , drug makers would pay $ 2.3 billion a year .
Manufacturers of medical devices would pay $ 2 billion in 2011 and $ 3 billion after 2017 .
For insurance companies , the fee would start at $ 2 billion in 2011 and gradually increase to $ 10 billion a year in 2017 .
Nonprofit insurance companies could be exempt if they spent a large share of their premiums on medical care rather than administrative costs .
FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNTS : Starting in 2011 , would place a $ 2,500 annual limit on what people can set aside from their paychecks before paying taxes to use for health care expenses .

MEDICARE SAVINGS : Squeeze roughly $ 500 billion out of the projected growth in Medicare over 10 years , including $ 116 billion in cuts to federal subsidies for privately offered Medicare Advantage plans .
They plan to become doctors , researchers and professors , but these students from Liberty University , an evangelical school , also believe God created the Earth in a week , some 6,000 years ago .
Each year , a group of biology students at the Christian university based in Lynchburg , Virginia , travels to the Natural History Museum in Washington to learn about a theory they dismiss as incorrect — Darwin ’s theory of evolution .

The young “ creationists ” examined a model of the Morganucodon rat , believed to be the first and common ancestor of mammals that appeared some 210 million years ago .
Lauren Dunn , 19 , a second - year biology student , was unimpressed .
“ 210 million years , that ’s arbitrary .
They put that time to make up for what they do n’t know , ” she said .
Nathan Hubbard , a 20 - year - old from Michigan and a first - year biology major who plans to become a doctor , regarded the model with suspicion .
“ There is no scientific , biological genetic way that this , this rat , could become you , ” he said , seemingly scandalized by the proposition .

Liberty University is the most prominent evangelical university in the United States , with some 12,000 students who adhere to strict rules and regulations regarding moral conduct .
Its biology curriculum includes a course on “ Young Earth Creationism ” , which juxtaposes Charles Darwin ’s “ Origin of the Species ” with the Book of Genesis .
“ In order to be the best creationist , you have to be the best evolutionist you can be , ” said Marcus Ross , who teaches paleontology and says of Adam and Eve : “ I feel they were real people , they were the first people . ”

David DeWitt , a Liberty University biology professor , opens his classes with a prayer , asking God to help him teach his students .
“ I pray that you help me to teach effectively and help the students to learn and defend their faith , ” he says .

Strongly - expressed faith is not unusual in the United States , a country where 80 percent of the population claim to believe in God and ascribe to established religions .
Polls taken in the last two years found that between 44 and 46 percent of Americans believe that the Earth was created in a week , somewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago .
Creationism , an increasingly popular theory in the United States and elsewhere in the world , rejects Darwin ’s theory that all living species evolved over the course of billions of years via the process of natural selection .
ADVERTISEMENT
The school of thought has adherents among Jehovah ’s Witnesses and some fundamentalist Muslims , but in the United States it has won most converts in the evangelical Christian community .
Former president George W. Bush , a born - again Christian , is among those who say evolutionary theory does not fully explain the Earth ’s creation , though the ex-president also noted he is not a “ literalist ” when it comes to the Bible .
Creationist belief has implications for the way people understand a variety of fields , including biology , paleontology and astronomy , but also impacts questions about climate change and educational debates .
At the Smithsonian Institute , among crowds of weekend visitors , the Liberty University students visited the evolution exhibition , .

But Darwin ’s explanation for why giraffes have long necks — that they evolved over time so they could reach higher foliage — and displays of fossil evidence failed to sway them .
“ Creationism and evolutionism have different ways of explaining the evidence .
The creationist way recognizes the importance of Biblical records , ” said Ross .
He teaches his students that dinosaurs were wiped from the face of the Earth some 4,000 to 5,000 years ago during the Biblical flood that Noah survived by building an ark .
He says carbon - dating techniques that have been used to suggest the Earth is in fact billions of years old are simply not reliable .

He does n’t reject one prominent theory that dinosaurs were wiped out by a massive asteroid that collided into Earth , but suggests the collision coincided with the Biblical flood .
Though Ross acknowledges that the United States is among the most welcoming environments in the world for creationists , he said it can be difficult to convince people to take him and his beliefs seriously .
“ The attitude is when you are a creationist you are ignorant of the facts , ” he said .
Arsenal gained the victory they needed to take full advantage of Chelsea 's defeat earlier in the day , and move to within three points of the league leaders , but their celebrations were muted after a serious injury sustained by Aaron Ramsey , who was carried off after an incident that evoked horrible memories of Eduardo 's compound fracture at Birmingham in 2008 .
Ryan Shawcross was sent off for the challenge , and left the pitch visibly sickened by what he had done .
To their credit , Arsenal recovered from the shock sufficiently to score twice at the death , with a penalty from Cesc Fábregas and a tap - in from Thomas Vermaelen .
It was a toss up which side came into the game with higher morale – Stoke unbeaten in 2010 or Arsenal , who had thrust themselves back into title contention with successive victories .
Tony Pulis came down on the side of boldness , recalling Abdou Faye and Andy Wilkinson in defence after suspension in the strongest available line - up .
Injuries denied Arsenal important players in Andrey Arshavin , William Gallas , Robin Van Persie and Abou Diaby , creating a starting place for Sol Campbell but not for Theo Walcott , who was again on the bench , as was Eduardo , who is still short of match fitness .
One would have thought they must have practiced ways of countering Rory Delap 's threat all week , but if they had , it was to no avail .
Just seven minutes had elapsed when Delap hurled the ball in from the right and Shawcross got to it ahead of Bacary Sagna , redirecting it to the far post , where Danny Pugh headed home at perfunctory range .
How the home crowd loved that , taunting Arsène Wenger , who has been critical of Stoke 's methods , with choruses of : " We only score from our throw - ins . "
Pulis wo n't apologise for any of that of course , nor does he need to , having devised an uncommonly effective use of limited resources .
The goal gave his team a lift , and the initiative , putting Arsenal on the back foot , and the game was 25 minutes old before Fábregas produced their first strike at goal , from distance .
It met with no success , but it did spark Arsenal into action , and after 31 minutes they drew level , Nicolas Bendtner bisecting the centre - halves to get to Fábregas 's right - wing cross and score with a towering header from 10 yards .
Thomas Sorensen was left with no chance , the ball beating him high to his left .
Arsenal thought they should have had a penalty four minutes into the second half when Ramsey , after receiving a short through pass from Fábregas , toppled 12 yards out under Faye 's challenge .
The referee concluded , not unreasonably , that the defender had hustled for possession legitimately and that the Welshman had fallen unnecessarily .
After Stoke 's assertive start , the initiative had changed sides , with Fábregas increasingly influential , and just short of the hour mark Sorensen was happy to touch over Emmanuel Eboué 's thunderous drive from the edge of the area .
Arsenal 's economical , progressive passing was testing the stamina of their opponents who had battled for two hours in their midweek FA Cup replay defeat of Manchester City and Danny Collins was introduced from the bench on the hour .
Stoke still had their moments , notably when Almunia dropped another Exocet from Delap , and the match was boiling towards an intriguing climax when the appetite for it was dulled by Ramsey 's horrible injury .
Such was its seriousness that at least two players were ill on the pitch and it was five minutes before the young midfielder could be carried off , to be replaced by Tomas Rosicky .
Inevitably the atmosphere changed – and not for the better .
The Arsenal fans called the opposition " scum " , while the home crowd lionised Shawcross by chanting his name .
Stoke were consigned to their first defeat in 12 games when a handball by Pugh allowed Fábregas to score from the spot in the 90th minute and Sorensen 's failure to hold Rosicky 's shot enabled Thomas Vermaelen to make it 3 - 1 in added time .
THE FANS ' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT
Chris Baldwin , Stoke.VitalFootball.co.uk
I was too far away from the Shawcross incident to judge , but from where I was there certainly did n't seem to be any malice in the tackle on Ramsey .
Both went in hard , though , and the outcome ruined the game .
We had been defending well and at 1 - 1 had more than a chance to get something .
Up front we had a problem with Fuller and Sidibé , neither of whom looked switched on , probably as a result of their midweek exertions .
Arsenal struggled with Delap 's throws – you would have thought they would have known what to expect .

DUO PUSHES RHODE ISLAND TO DECRIMINALIZE POT Wall Street Journal
PROVIDENCE , R.I. -- A retired police officer and the proprietor of an organic eatery make an odd couple when it comes to trying to overturn marijuana laws in this tiny state , but Jack Cole and Josh Miller are giving it their best shot .
Mr. Cole , 71 years old , is a veteran of decades with the New Jersey State Police , almost all with the drug squad .
Mr. Miller , 55 , runs Local 121 , a restaurant favored among " buy local " diners , and also serves in the state Senate , where he leads a special commission to study marijuana prohibitions .
The panel began hearings in January to discuss an overhaul of the state 's pot laws , starting with decriminalization of small amounts .
As legislators across the U.S. struggle to rescue state budgets hammered by the recession , decriminalization is one idea gaining traction .
Advocates say states could cut costs of policing , prosecuting and incarcerating offenders , and even raise money by taxing users .
" Any respect for this issue lies right now in its impact on the budget , " said Mr. Miller .
His committee will hear testimony Wednesday from Mr. Cole , the founder of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , or LEAP , a national lobby seeking an end to the drug war .
LEAP 's 10,000 members include many former police officers , corrections workers and federal agents of the Border Patrol and Drug Enforcement Administration .
Decriminalization faces resistance from district attorneys and police departments that have grown used to making arrests and building criminal cases in a longstanding war - on - drugs tradition , and often equate decriminalization with being " soft " on crime .
The first steps state legislatures take tend to be narrow : legalizing marijuana use for cancer or glaucoma patients , or allowing municipalities to impose fines on casual smokers .
In California , one of 14 states that allow marijuana use for medical purposes , legislators are weighing a bill to legalize most marijuana sales and create tax and licensing fees for the industry .
The measure was approved by the state Assembly 's Public Safety Committee last month , but probably wo n't advance further this session .
New Hampshire is considering a pair of House bills , one to legalize and tax pot sales , and another to decriminalize possession .
A medical - marijuana bill passed last year but was vetoed by the governor .
Decriminalization measures have also been introduced in Vermont , Virginia and Washington , while medical - marijuana bills are being considered in Maryland , Delaware and Wisconsin , among other states .
Mr. Miller said that in Rhode Island , which allows medical - marijuana use , decriminalization was the next step .
He noted that last month a bill was introduced in the House to make possession of an ounce or less a civil offense punishable by a fine of $ 100 , rather than a criminal offense .
Rhode Island has run budget deficits of just over $ 200 million in each of the past two years , and is looking at a $ 400 million deficit in the next fiscal year on a budget of $ 7 billion .
Savings from decriminalization would n't be great , Mr. Miller conceded -- say , $ 2 million to $ 3 million a year by freeing prison beds occupied by pot offenders .
Rhode Island spends about $ 33,000 a year per inmate .
Not everyone agrees with that math .
Matthew Dawson , deputy chief of the criminal division of the state attorney general 's office , testified before Mr. Miller 's panel last month that the state would achieve " zero savings " from decriminalization .
He said police and prosecutors employed criminal charges for possession to plea bargain with suspects , and that suspects might otherwise have to be prosecuted for more serious crimes , at greater cost to the state .
Others say possession charges help police cajole witnesses into cooperating in criminal inquiries .
Mr. Miller said such arguments may persuade some of his colleagues , but others would look to the decision two years ago in neighboring Massachusetts to decriminalize pot , which raised hopes among some legislators that a similar measure could pass in Rhode Island .
" It 's not far - off California , but the big state next door , " Mr. Miller said .
Mr. Cole traveled to Providence recently to help Mr. Miller craft a strategy .
He often wears a badge that reads : " Cops Say Legalize Drugs .
Ask Me Why . "
In his standard speech , he describes the epiphany he experienced early in his career as an undercover narcotics investigator .
" I learned firsthand of the family - destroying consequences of sending drug users [ often mothers and fathers ] to jail .
I can't think of a better policy for creating the next generation of drug addicts than to remove parents from children , " he said .
" I also realized that when police arrested a robber or rapist they made the community safer for everyone but when I arrested a drug pusher , I simply created a job opening for someone in a long line of people willing to take his place . "
Messrs .
Cole and Miller agreed the former cop 's presentation must appeal to law - and - order politicians .
Mr. Cole said the way to win them over was to show that chasing pot smokers keeps police from fighting other crimes .
" Look at the clearance rates for these crimes , " he said .
In the 1960s , before federal antidrug funds flowed heavily to states , " 91 % of all murders in this country were solved .
Today , it 's 61 % . "
He cited similar drops for arson ( 60 % unsolved ) robbery ( 75 % unsolved ) and rape ( 60 % unsolved ) .
Mr. Cole said the national addiction rate has remained unchanged for a century at about 1.3 % of the population .
He concludes that if drugs are legalized , the addiction rate would stay the same , " but we 'll be spending a lot less to manage it . "

Business reporter , BBC News
The debate looked at wages , debt and the future of the game Football clubs should consider more performance - related bonuses and lowering the basic salaries of players , a sports finance expert has said .
Dan Jones of advisory firm Deloitte called on clubs to look again at how it remunerated its stars .
" There 's no bonus culture .
It 's the same , win lose or draw .
Why is that allowed to persist ? " he asked .
Mr Jones was speaking at a BBC debate on the finances of football held at the Soccerex event in Manchester .
BBC chief economics correspondent Hugh Pym cited City banks such as HSBC and Barclays that were profitable and so paid their key executives bonuses which were several times higher than their salaries .
However , he pointed out that such payments , linked to success , were not replicated in football .
Your debt builds up the spirit in your club breaks the fans see nothing to be optimistic about and the players are not motivated properly because they know they 're going to struggle
Lee Staffrd
Chairman , Sheffield Wednesday
" The thing about high player wages is they are often at loss - making clubs .
There seems to be a mis-match there which you do n't see in other parts of business , " he said .
' Locked in '
Wages paid by top - flight English sides in 2007 / 8 - the latest season for which figures are available - grew by 23 % from the previous season , to £ 1.2 bn .
Chelsea , Manchester United , Arsenal and Liverpool had the highest wage bill in that report .
However , while these clubs are seen as well - resourced , panellists on the debate suggested that smaller teams would especially benefit from changes to player pay structures .
West Ham co-owner David Gold said that high wages were a threat to some clubs , especially if they were subsequently relegated and lost out on cash from television rights deals .
Portsmouth last week became the first Premier League club to be pushed into administration - with its wage bill one of the key reasons behind its £ 60 m debt .
" I do n't disagree about players receiving due reward for amazing skills , what I do n't want to see is that wage structure take clubs into administration , " Mr Gold said .
" You have players earning £ 60,000 or more a week .
Then a club gets relegated and that club is locked into a contract with players . "
Sheffield Wednesday chairman Lee Stafford said his club had suffered those problems after slipping out of the Premier League in 2000 .
" It almost guarantees a downward spiral because you have players that are n't going to want to move on , and clubs are n't going to want to sign them .
" So your debt builds up , the spirit in your club breaks , the fans see nothing to be optimistic about and the players are not motivated properly because they know they 're going to struggle , " he said .
" We feel massively disadvantaged by other clubs that are racking up debts ... paying players that they should not be and getting further up the league .
It 's not a level playing field and we need governance in the game to improve . "
Chief executive of the Professional Footballers Association , Gordon Taylor , said that players " did not hold a gun to the heads of clubs " when it came to wages being set .
And they almost always would continue to play if their club was struggling to pay wages on time , he added .
Earlier , at the Soccerex event , it emerged that Europe 's top clubs had succeeded in delaying the full introduction of Uefa 's new financial fair play rules .
The rules will apply in 2015 instead of 2012 and will govern the amount of debt clubs can accrue , with European bans a possible punishment if they are broken .

Insurance plays a central role in the functioning of modern economies .
Life insurance offers protection against the economic impact of an untimely death ; health insurance covers the sometimes extraordinary costs of medical care ; and bank deposits are insured by the federal government ( see financial regulation ) .
In each case , the insured pays a small premium in order to receive benefits should an unlikely but high - cost event occur .
Insurance issues , traditionally a stodgy domain , have become subjects for intense debate and concern in recent years .
How to provide health insurance for the significant portion of Americans not now covered is a central political issue .
Some states , attempting to hold back the tide of higher costs , have placed severe limits on auto insurance rates and have even sought refunds from insurers .
And ways to cover losses from terrorism have become a major issue .
Temporarily , in response to the massive losses of 9/11 , the federal government adopted a heavily subsidized three - year program for reinsuring terror - related building losses .
( The program was extended . )
In theory , the government can recoup some losses after the fact by levying a surcharge on the premiums of surviving firms .
The Basics
An understanding of insurance must begin with the concept of risk — that is , the variation in possible outcomes of a situation .
A’s shipment of goods to Europe might arrive safely or be lost in transit .
B may incur zero medical expenses in a good year , but if she is struck by a car they could be upward of $ 100,000 .
We cannot eliminate risk from life , even at extraordinary expense .
Paying extra for double - hulled tankers still leaves oil spills possible .
The only way to eliminate auto - related injuries is to eliminate automobiles .
Thus , the effective response to risk combines two elements : efforts or expenditures to lessen the risk , and the purchase of insurance against whatever risk remains .
Consider A ’s shipment of , say , $ 1 million in goods .
If the chance of loss on each trip is 3 percent , the loss will be $ 30,000 ( 3 percent of $ 1 million ) , on average .
Let us assume that A can ship by a more costly method and cut the risk by one percentage point , thus saving $ 10,000 , on average .
If the additional cost of this shipping method is less than $ 10,000 , it is a worthwhile expenditure .
But if cutting risk by a further percentage point will cost $ 15,000 , it sacrifices resources .
To deal with the remaining 2 percent risk of losing $ 1 million , A should think about insurance .
To cover administrative costs , the insurer might charge $ 25,000 for a risk that will incur average losses of no more than $ 20,000 .
From
A ’s standpoint , however , the insurance may be worthwhile because it is a comparatively inexpensive way to deal with the potential loss of $ 1 million .
Note the important economic role of such insurance : without it , A might not be willing to risk shipping goods in the first place .
In exchange for a premium , the insurer will pay a claim should a specified contingency — such as death , medical bills , or , in this instance , shipment loss — arise .
The insurer — whether a corporation with diversified ownership or a mutual company made up of the insureds themselves — is able to offer such protection against financial loss by pooling the risks from a large group of similarly situated individuals or firms .
The laws of probability ensure that only a tiny fraction of these insured shipments will be lost , or only a small fraction of the insured population will face expensive hospitalization in a year .
If , for example , each of 100,000 individuals independently faces a 1 percent risk in a year , on average , 1,000 will have losses .
If each of the 100,000 people paid a premium of $ 1,000 , the insurance company would have collected a total of $ 100 million .
Leaving aside administrative costs , this is enough to pay $ 100,000 to anyone who had a loss .
But what would happen if 1,100 people had losses ?
The answer , fortunately , is that such an outcome is exceptionally unlikely .
Insurance works through the magic of the law of large numbers .
This law assures that when a large number of people face a low - probability event , the proportion experiencing the event will be close to the expected proportion .
For instance , with a pool of 100,000 people who each face a 1 percent risk , the law of large numbers says that 1,100 people or more will have losses only one time in one thousand .
In many cases , however , the risks to different individuals are not independent .
In a hurricane , airplane crash , or epidemic , many may suffer at the same time .
Insurance companies spread such risks not only across individuals , but also across good years and bad , building up reserves in the good years to deal with heavier claims in bad ones .
For further protection , they also diversify across lines , selling both health and homeowners ’ insurance , for example .
The risks normally insured are unintentional , either due to the actions of nature or the inadvertent consequences of human activity .
Terrorism creates a new model for insurance for three reasons : ( 1 ) The losses are man-made and intentional .
( 2 ) Massive numbers of people and structures could be harmed .
( Theft losses fall in the first category , but not in the second . )
( 3 ) Historical experience does not provide a yardstick for assessing likely risk levels .
Nuclear war presented equivalent challenges in the twentieth century .
Had there been a significant nuclear war , insurance companies simply would not have paid .
The losses would have been too massive to pay out of assets , and many of the assets underlying the insurance would have been destroyed .
In time , appropriate insurance arrangements for this new category of massive risk will be developed .
The Identity and Behavior of the Insured
An economist views insurance as being like most other commodities .
It obeys the laws of supply and demand , for example .
However , it is unlike many other commodities in one important respect : the cost of providing insurance depends on the identity of the purchaser .
A year of health insurance for an eighty - year - old costs more to provide than one for a fifty - year - old .
It costs more to provide auto insurance to teenagers than to middle - aged people .
If a company mistakenly sells health policies to old folks at a price appropriate for young folks , it will assuredly lose money , just as a restaurant will lose if it sells twenty - dollar steak dinners for ten dollars .
The restaurant would lure lots of steak eaters .
So , too , would the insurance company attract large numbers of older clients .
Because of the differential cost of providing coverage , and because customers search for their lowest price , insurance companies go to great pains to set different premiums for different groups , depending on the risks each will impose .
Recognizing that the identity of the purchaser affects the cost of insurance , insurers must be careful to whom they offer insurance at a particular price .
Those high - risk individuals whose knowledge of their risk is better than that of the insurers will step forth to purchase , knowing that they are getting a good deal .
This is a process called adverse selection , which means that the mix of purchasers will be adverse to the insurer .
What leads to this adverse selection is asymmetric information : potential purchasers have more information than the sellers .
The potential purchasers have “ hidden ” information that relates to their particular risk , and those whose information is unfavorable are thus most likely to purchase .
For example , if an insurer determined that 1 percent of fifty - year - olds would die in a year , it might establish a premium of $ 12 per $ 1,000 of coverage — $ 10 to cover claims and $ 2 to cover administrative costs .
The insurer might naively expect to break even .
However , insureds who ate poorly or who engaged in high - risk professions or whose parents had died young might have an annual risk of mortality of 3 percent .
They would be most likely to purchase insurance .
Health fanatics , by contrast , might forgo life insurance because for them it is a bad deal .
Through adverse selection , the insurer could end up with a group whose expected costs were , say , $ 20 per $ 1,000 rather than the $ 10 per $ 1,000 for the population as a whole ; at a $ 12 price , the insurer would lose money .
The traditional approach to the adverse selection problem is to inspect each potential insured .
Individuals taking out substantial life insurance must submit to a medical exam .
Fire insurance might be granted only after a check of the alarm and sprinkler systems .
But no matter how careful the inspection , some information will remain hidden , and a disproportionately high number of those choosing to insure will be high risk .
Therefore , insurers routinely set high rates to cope with adverse selection .
Alas , such high rates discourage ordinary - risk buyers from buying insurance .
Though this problem of adverse selection is best known in insurance problems , it applies broadly across economics .
Thus , a company that “ insures ” its salesmen by offering a relatively high salary compared with commission will end up with many salesmen who are not confident of their abilities .
Colleges that insure their students by offering many pass - fail courses can expect weaker students to enroll .
Moral Hazard or Hidden Action
Once insured , an individual has less incentive to avoid the risk of a bad outcome .
A person with automobile collision insurance , for example , is more likely to venture forth on an icy night .
Federal pension insurance induces companies to underfund ( see pensions ) and weakens the incentives for their employees to complain .
Federally subsidized flood insurance encourages citizens to build homes on floodplains .
Insurers use the term “ moral hazard ” to describe this phenomenon .
It means , simply , that insured people undertake actions they would otherwise avoid .
Stated in less judgmental language , people respond to incentives .
In the above salesman example , not only are low - quality salesmen enticed to join , but all salesmen , even those of high quality , are given an incentive to be less productive .
Ideally , the insurer would like to be able to monitor the insured ’s behavior and take appropriate action .
Flood insurance might not be sold to new residents of a floodplain .
Collision insurance might not pay off if it can be proven that the policyholder had been drinking or had otherwise engaged in reckless behavior .
But given the difficulty of monitoring many actions , insurers accept that once policies are issued , behavior will change adversely , and more claims will be made .
The moral hazard problem is often encountered in areas that , at first glance , do not seem associated with traditional insurance .
Products covered under optional warranties tend to get abused , as do autos that are leased with service contracts .
Equity Issues
The same insurance policy will have different costs for serving individuals whose behavior or underlying characteristics may differ .
Because these cost differences influence pricing , some people see an equity dimension to insurance .
Some think , for example , that urban drivers should not pay much more than rural drivers to protect themselves from auto liability , even though urban driving is riskier .
But if prices are not allowed to vary in relation to risk , insurers will seek to avoid various classes of customers altogether , and availability will be restricted .
When sellers of health insurance are not allowed to find out if potential clients are HIV - positive , for example , insurance companies often respond by refusing to insure , say , never - married men over age forty .
Equity issues in insurance are addressed in a variety of ways in the real world .
Most employers cross -subsidize health insurance , providing the same coverage at the same price to older , higher - risk workers and younger , lower - risk ones .
Sometimes the government provides the “ insurance ” itself , although the federal government ’s Medicare and Social Security programs are really a combined tax and subsidy scheme — one that gives a bigger benefit to those who live longer .
The government ’s decision not to tax employer - provided health insurance as income acts like a subsidy .
In pursuit of equity , governments may set insurance rates , as many states do with auto insurance .
The traditional public - interest argument for government rate regulation is that it serves to control a monopoly .
But this argument fails with auto insurance : in most regulated insurance markets , there are dozens of competing insurers .
Insurance rates are regulated to help some groups — usually those imposing high risks — at the expense of others .
The Massachusetts auto insurance market provides an example .
High - cost drivers are subsidized at the expense of all other drivers .
Thus , inexperienced , occasional drivers in Massachusetts paid , on average , $ 1,967 for insurance in 2004 compared with $ 1,114 for experienced drivers .
In contrast , in neighboring Connecticut , where such cross-subsidies were not imposed , the respective rates are $ 3,518 and $ 845 .
Such practices raise a new class of equity issues .
Should the government force people who live quiet , low - risk lives to subsidize the high - risk fringe ?
Most people ’s response to this question depends on whether they think people can control risks .
Because most of us think we should not encourage people to engage in behavior that is costly to the system , we conclude , for example , that nonsmokers should not have to pay for smokers .
The question becomes more complex when it comes to health care premiums for , say , gay men or recovering alcoholics , whose health care costs are likely to be greater than average .
Moral judgments inevitably creep into such discussions .
And sometimes the facts lead to disquieting considerations .
Smokers , for example , tend to die early , reducing expected costs for Social Security .
Should they , therefore , pay lower Social Security taxes ?
Black men have shorter lives than white men .
Should black men pay lower Social Security taxes ?
Government ’s Role in Insurance
Government plays four major roles with insurance : ( 1 ) Government writes it directly , as with Social Security , terrorism reinsurance , and pension guarantees — via the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ( PBGC ) — should a corporation fail .
( 2 ) Government subsidizes insurance : quite explicitly in some programs , such as federal flood insurance , but only de facto in other cases ( e.g. , the PBGC has a large projected deficit ) .
( 3 ) Government mandates a residual market for high risks ( e.g. , Florida ’s program for hurricanes or many states ’ programs for high - risk drivers ) .
Governments hold down prices in such markets either by creating a state fund to cover losses or by requiring insurers who participate in the voluntary market to pick up a certain portion of this high - risk market .
( 4 ) Government regulates matters such as premiums , insurance company solvency ( to make sure that insureds get paid ) , and permissible criteria for pricing insurance ( e.g. , for auto insurance , race and ethnicity are banned everywhere ; Michigan bans geographic designations smaller than a city ) .
Property liability insurance is regulated at the state level , providing many opportunities to compare the efficacy of alternative approaches .
The three main regulatory approaches to pricing have been : ( 1 ) prior approval ( regulators must approve rates before they go in effect ) ; ( 2 ) use and file ( companies set rates , but regulators can disallow them subsequently if they are found excessive ) ; and ( 3 ) open competition ( a market - based system in which rates are deemed not excessive as long as there is competition ) .
Empirical studies conflict as to whether regulation leads to lower prices .
Government participates far more in insurance markets than in typical markets .
The two great dangers with government participation in insurance arise when , as is common , the goals for participation remain vague ( e.g. , promoting the insured activity , redistributing income , or spreading risk effectively ) , or when its expected cost is not recognized in budgets .
With insurance , as with all government endeavors , the citizenry deserves to know both the rationale and the cost .
Conclusion
The traditional role of insurance remains the essential one recognized centuries ago : that of spreading risk among similarly situated individuals .
Insurance works most effectively when losses are not under the control of individuals ( thus avoiding moral hazard ) and when the losses are readily determined ( lest significant transactions costs associated with lawsuits become a burden ) .
Individuals and firms insure against their most major risks — high health costs , the inability to pay depositors — which often are politically salient issues as well .
Not surprisingly , government participation — as a setter of rates , as a subsidizer , and as a direct provider of insurance services — has become a major feature in insurance markets .
Its highly subsidized terrorism reinsurance provides a dramatic example .
Political forces may sometimes triumph over sound insurance principles , but such victories are Pyrrhic .
In a sound market , we must recognize that with insurance , as with bread and steel , the cost of providing it must be paid .

About half of Americans with major depression go untreated , and only 21 percent receive treatment consistent with accepted guidelines , a new study says .
About half of Americans with major depression do not receive treatment for the condition , and in many cases the therapies are not consistent with the standard of care , according to a new study .
The study also showed that ethnicity and race were important factors in determining who received treatment , with Mexican Americans and African Americans the least likely to have depression care .
While many people can feel sad from time to time , a depressive disorder occurs when these feelings start to interfere with everyday life , preventing someone from functioning normally , according to the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) .
The condition can be debilitating , hindering a person 's ability to work , sleep and eat .
A combination of factors likely contributes to the disorder , including imbalances in brain chemicals , genetics , and stressful situations , the NIH says .
Pervious research has indicated that many Americans with depression go untreated , but the current study was the first to break down large ethnic and racial groups into subgroups to look at disparities in treatment .
The researchers used information from the National Institute of Mental Health 's Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys — a combination of three surveys conducted between 2001 and 2003 with a total of 15,762 participants .
Of those surveyed , 8.3 percent had major depression , and about 50 percent of those with the condition received at least one type of treatment .
However , only about 21 percent had therapies that followed accepted treatment guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association .
For example , a situation in which a patient took antidepressants for only one week instead of 60 days and was not monitored by a physician would be against the standard of care , said study researcher Hector M. González of Wayne State University in Detroit , Mich .
González and his colleagues also found that Mexican Americans , African Americans and Caribbean blacks were less likely to receive drug treatment or counseling .
On the other hand , non-Latino whites and Puerto Ricans received the highest use of both therapy types .
The results counter previous research that showed Latinos and whites have about the same treatment rate , González said .
" By breaking Latinos down into subethnicities , we found these disparities in care , " González told LiveScience .
The higher rates of depression care among Puerto Ricans found in González 's study may explain why past research showed Latinos and whites receiving similar care , he said .
The study also showed that psychotherapy ( counseling ) was used more than drug therapy overall .
Psychotherapy rates were highest amongst Mexican and African Americans , suggesting that this type of therapy may be more accepted by these groups and thus could be one method for improving depression care in these minorities , González said .
The results were published in the January issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry , a journal of the American Medical Association .
The work was funded by the National Institutes of Health , National Institute of Mental Health , and the National Institute on Aging .

BEIJING , China —
Google has finally made its move , shifting searches from China to Hong Kong more than two months after threatening to quit China over hacking and censorship .
But the big questions remain unanswered , in particular Beijing ’s next move and how the internet giant ’s shift will affect access to information for the world ’s biggest net population .
In the hours after Google began redirecting mainland Chinese users to its uncensored search engine in Hong Kong , some impact was evident .
The Chinese government ’s own heavy - handed censorship technique replaced Google ’s somewhat softer version : rather than displaying search results that were labeled as censored , searches from China for very sensitive terms like “ Falun Gong ” turned up nothing at all .
Some free - speech advocates applauded Google ’s move .
“ This is a crucial moment for freedom of expression in China , and the onus is now on other major technology companies to take a firm stand against censorship , ” said Arvind Ganesan , business and human rights director at Human Rights Watch .
Others were critical , saying the company ’s decision to shift would hurt Chinese internet users , while a third camp said Google had reached a workable compromise without being too openly hostile .
“ In this case , I think Google is much more irresponsible than the government , ” said Fang Xingdong , a Chinese blogging pioneer .
“ Google should consider the users ’ perspective .
The benefit of internet users is the most important and everything else is secondary . ”
China has offered limited official reaction thus far , mainly via the official Xinhua news agency .
Xinhua posted comments from an unnamed official from the State Council Information Office , saying Google was in the wrong .
“ Google has violated its written promise it made when entering the Chinese market by stopping filtering its searching service and blaming China in insinuation for alleged hacker attacks , ” said the official .
“ This is totally wrong , ” the official continued .
“ We 're uncompromisingly opposed to the politicization of commercial issues , and express our discontent and indignation to Google for its unreasonable accusations and conducts . ”
Kaiser Kuo , a Beijing - based technology writer , said what happens next is important .
If China ’s official reaction is “ kept to the level of a few indignant editorials upbraiding Google for failing to live up to its written promises and goes no further , then I think we can assume that Google.com will remain unblocked . ”
“ Clearly , the best - case outcome would be one in which Beijing accepts this new status quo , ” said Kuo .
“ Obviously they 're not going to announce that this is their plan .
They 'll just declare victory and let things be , not blocking Google.com.hk and not drumming Google out of China entirely . ”
But , Kuo said , if the situation worsens , “ Beijing could still very well make things more difficult — blocking , torpedoing Google business with mobile carriers and handset makers , et cetera . ”
Google is now offering an updated report on which of its services are blocked or censored in China .
Google ’s big move came at a dicey time , underscoring growing concerns about Chinese hostility toward foreign businesses .
A day earlier , the American Chamber of Commerce in China released a survey of U.S. companies that showed 62 percent of those surveyed felt increasingly unwelcome in China .
The survey focused on new rules that might give homegrown companies preference in government contracts , but said the overall climate for U.S. businesses might be souring .
In addition , Monday also opened the trial of four executives from Australian mining giant Rio Tinto .
The four , one of whom is an Australian citizen , were charged with bribery and corporate espionage last summer and have now pleaded guilty to some of the offenses .
China ’s Foreign Ministry has described both as individual cases and not part of a growing anti-foreign business trend .
But the AmCham survey showed that U.S. businesses are feeling some heat and the way forward could be dicey .

Before we dive in , let 's take a look at why we procrastinate so we have a better chance of overcoming it .
There are several schools of thought on procrastination , including that it 's hard - wired into our brains .
According to Psychology Today , there are five main reasons we delay doing things we know we have to get done .

The brain is built to firstly minimize danger , before maximizing rewards .
Any threat to self is minimized , any handy reward is tempting .
This alone accounts for a great deal of our procrastination as we avoid tasks that threaten the self , and we discount future rewards in favor of immediate gratification .
A little more focus on emotional intelligence can help here .
Too often , feelings trump reasons , and we give in to feel good .

JSR - 166 : The Java fork / join Framework
The JSR - 166 are concurrent utilities that were included in Java 5 .
The fork / join framework was a piece of it that did n’t make it into Java 5 .
After all this time the fork / join framework is finally making it into JDK 7 .
What surprised me about the framework is that it is so easy to use .
The fork / join framework is designed to make divide - and - conquer algorithms easy to parallelize .
More specifically , recursive algorithms where the control path branches out over a few paths and they each process an equal part of the data set .
The typical setup is a new class is created that extends either the RecursiveAction or RecursiveTask class .
The parameters that were sent into the recursive function become member variables in the newly defined class .
Then the recursive calls are replaced by invokeAll ( … ) rather than the calls to the function itself .
In writing this post , I kept going back for forth on whether I should use Fibonacci numbers as an example or something with more meat to it .
The computations done by each recursive call of a Fibonacci numbers algorithm is too small to matter , not only that , but there are much better non-parallel algorithms for Fibonacci numbers .
In the end , I decided on showing a merge sort .
It is used as the example in the fork / join documentation , but this will be a more complete example showing both the sequential algorithm and the changes made for the parallel version of the algorithm .
You ’ll see that it ’s not that hard .
First let me start by showing the source code for a typical MergeSort :
public class MergeSort { private static final int SIZE_THRESHOLD = 16 ; public static void sort ( Comparable [ ] a ) { sort ( a , 0 , a. length - 1 ) ; } public static void sort ( Comparable [ ] a , int lo , int hi ) { if ( hi - lo < SIZE_THRESHOLD ) { insertionsort ( a , lo , hi ) ; return ; } Comparable [ ] tmp = new Comparable [ ( ( hi - lo ) / 2 ) + 1 ] ; mergeSort ( a , tmp , lo , hi ) ; } private static void mergeSort ( Comparable [ ] a , Comparable [ ] tmp , int lo , int hi ) { if ( hi - lo < SIZE_THRESHOLD ) { insertionsort ( a , lo , hi ) ; return ; } int m = ( lo + hi ) / 2 ; mergeSort ( a , tmp , lo , m ) ; mergeSort ( a , tmp , m + 1 , hi ) ; merge ( a , tmp , lo , m , hi ) ; } private static void merge ( Comparable [ ] a , Comparable [ ] b , int lo , int m , int hi ) { if ( a [ m ] .
compareTo ( a [ m + 1 ] ) <= 0 ) return ; System .
arraycopy ( a , lo , b , 0 , m - lo + 1 ) ; int i = 0 ; int j = m + 1 ; int k = lo ; // copy back next - greatest element at each time while ( k < j && j <= hi ) { if ( b [ i ] .
compareTo ( a [ j ] ) <= 0 ) { a [ k ++ ] = b [ i ++ ] ; } else { a [ k ++ ] = a [ j ++ ] ; } } // copy back remaining elements of first half ( if any ) System .
arraycopy ( b , i , a , k , j - k ) ; } private static void insertionsort ( Comparable [ ] a , int lo , int hi ) { for ( int i = lo + 1 ; i <= hi ; i ++ ) { int j = i ; Comparable t = a [ j ] ; while ( j > lo && t. compareTo ( a [ j - 1 ] ) < 0 ) { a [ j ] = a [ j - 1 ] ; -- j ; } a [ j ] = t ; } } } public class MergeSort { private static final int SIZE_THRESHOLD = 16 ; public static void sort ( Comparable [ ] a ) { sort ( a , 0 , a.length - 1 ) ; } public static void sort ( Comparable [ ] a , int lo , int hi ) { if ( hi - lo < SIZE_THRESHOLD ) { insertionsort ( a , lo , hi ) ; return ; } Comparable [ ] tmp = new Comparable [ (( hi - lo ) / 2 ) + 1 ] ; mergeSort ( a , tmp , lo , hi ) ; } private static void mergeSort ( Comparable [ ] a , Comparable [ ] tmp , int lo , int hi ) { if ( hi - lo < SIZE_THRESHOLD ) { insertionsort ( a , lo , hi ) ; return ; } int m = ( lo + hi ) / 2 ; mergeSort ( a , tmp , lo , m ) ; mergeSort ( a , tmp , m + 1 , hi ) ; merge ( a , tmp , lo , m , hi ) ; } private static void merge ( Comparable [ ] a , Comparable [ ] b , int lo , int m , int hi ) { if ( a [ m ] .
compareTo( a [ m+1 ] ) <= 0 ) return ; System.arraycopy ( a , lo , b , 0 , m - lo+1 ) ; int i = 0 ; int j = m+1 ; int k = lo ; // copy back next - greatest element at each time while ( k < j && j <= hi ) { if ( b[ i].compareTo( a[j ] ) <= 0 ) { a [ k ++] = b[ i++ ] ; } else { a[k ++] = a[j ++ ] ; } } // copy back remaining elements of first half ( if any ) System.arraycopy ( b , i , a , k , j - k ) ; } private static void insertionsort ( Comparable [ ] a , int lo , int hi ) { for ( int i = lo+1 ; i <= hi ; i++ ) { int j = i ; Comparable t = a[j ] ; while ( j > lo && t.compareTo( a[j - 1 ] ) < 0 ) { a[j ] = a[j - 1 ] ; -- j ; } a[j ] = t ; } } }
Now here is the code for the parallel version of MergeSort :
public class ParallelMergeSort { private static final ForkJoinPool threadPool = new ForkJoinPool ( ) ; private static final int SIZE_THRESHOLD = 16 ; public static void sort ( Comparable [ ] a ) { sort ( a , 0 , a. length - 1 ) ; } public static void sort ( Comparable [ ] a , int lo , int hi ) { if ( hi - lo < SIZE_THRESHOLD ) { insertionsort ( a , lo , hi ) ; return ; } Comparable [ ] tmp = new Comparable [ a. length ] ; threadPool. invoke ( new SortTask ( a , tmp , lo , hi ) ) ; } /** *
This class replaces the recursive function that was * previously here .
*/ static class SortTask extends RecursiveAction { Comparable [ ] a ; Comparable [ ] tmp ; int lo , hi ; public SortTask ( Comparable [ ] a , Comparable [ ] tmp , int lo , int hi ) { this .
a = a ; this .
lo = lo ; this .
hi = hi ; this .
tmp = tmp ; } @ Override protected void compute ( ) { if ( hi - lo < SIZE_THRESHOLD ) { insertionsort ( a , lo , hi ) ; return ; } int m = ( lo + hi ) / 2 ; // the two recursive calls are replaced by a call to invokeAll invokeAll ( new SortTask ( a , tmp , lo , m ) , new SortTask ( a , tmp , m + 1 , hi ) ) ; merge ( a , tmp , lo , m , hi ) ; } } private static void merge ( Comparable [ ] a , Comparable [ ] b , int lo , int m , int hi ) { if ( a [ m ] .
compareTo ( a [ m + 1 ] ) <= 0 ) return ; System .
arraycopy ( a , lo , b , lo , m - lo + 1 ) ; int i = lo ; int j = m + 1 ; int k = lo ; // copy back next - greatest element at each time while ( k < j && j <= hi ) { if ( b [ i ] .
compareTo ( a [ j ] ) <= 0 ) { a [ k ++ ] = b [ i ++ ] ; } else { a [ k ++ ] = a [ j ++ ] ; } } // copy back remaining elements of first half ( if any ) System .
arraycopy ( b , i , a , k , j - k ) ; } private static void insertionsort ( Comparable [ ] a , int lo , int hi ) { for ( int i = lo + 1 ; i <= hi ; i ++ ) { int j = i ; Comparable t = a [ j ] ; while ( j > lo && t. compareTo ( a [ j - 1 ] ) < 0 ) { a [ j ] = a [ j - 1 ] ; -- j ; } a [ j ] = t ; } } } public class ParallelMergeSort { private static final ForkJoinPool threadPool = new ForkJoinPool ( ) ; private static final int SIZE_THRESHOLD = 16 ; public static void sort ( Comparable [ ] a ) { sort ( a , 0 , a.length - 1 ) ; } public static void sort ( Comparable [ ] a , int lo , int hi ) { if ( hi - lo < SIZE_THRESHOLD ) { insertionsort ( a , lo , hi ) ; return ; } Comparable [ ] tmp = new Comparable [a.length ] ; threadPool.invoke( new SortTask ( a , tmp , lo , hi ) ) ; } /** *
This class replaces the recursive function that was * previously here .
*/ static class SortTask extends RecursiveAction { Comparable [ ] a ; Comparable [ ] tmp ; int lo , hi ; public SortTask ( Comparable [ ] a , Comparable [ ] tmp , int lo , int hi ) { this .
a = a ; this .lo = lo ; this .
hi = hi ; this .tmp = tmp ; } @ Override protected void compute ( ) { if ( hi - lo < SIZE_THRESHOLD ) { insertionsort ( a , lo , hi ) ; return ; } int m = ( lo + hi ) / 2 ; // the two recursive calls are replaced by a call to invokeAll invokeAll ( new SortTask ( a , tmp , lo , m ) , new SortTask ( a , tmp , m+1 , hi ) ) ; merge ( a , tmp , lo , m , hi ) ; } } private static void merge ( Comparable [ ] a , Comparable [ ] b , int lo , int m , int hi ) { if ( a [ m] .compareTo( a[ m+1 ] ) <= 0 ) return ; System.arraycopy ( a , lo , b , lo , m - lo+1 ) ; int i = lo ; int j = m+1 ; int k = lo ; // copy back next - greatest element at each time while ( k < j && j <= hi ) { if ( b[ i].compareTo( a[j ] ) <= 0 ) { a [ k ++] = b[ i++ ] ; } else { a[k ++] = a[j ++ ] ; } } // copy back remaining elements of first half ( if any ) System.arraycopy ( b , i , a , k , j - k ) ; } private static void insertionsort ( Comparable [ ] a , int lo , int hi ) { for ( int i = lo+1 ; i <= hi ; i++ ) { int j = i ; Comparable t = a[j ] ; while ( j > lo && t.compareTo( a[j - 1 ] ) < 0 ) { a[j ] = a[j - 1 ] ; -- j ; } a[j ] = t ; } } }
As you can see the majority of the algorithm has remained intact .
As stated above a new class is created that extends RecursiveAction , and the parameters of the function are then passed into that class during creation .
One thing to take note , is that previously only half the size of the original array was created as secondary storage .
Now the entire length of the array is created as a temporary storage .
This is used to avoid different threads needing the same area of the array at the same time .
Changes to the algorithm may be needed , but it definitely helps in making it easier to move to parallel processing .
One other thing to note is the presence of the ForkJoinPool .
The default constructor looks at the processor and determines the appropriate level of parallelism for the task .
I have a quad core CPU , so the ForkJoinPool will spawn at least four threads if necessary .
That said , I ’ve seen in where only two threads are spawned because more than that was not necessary for the given task .
The ForkJoinPool spawns more threads as deemed necessary without starting right at the maximum .
A complete API for the fork / join framework can be found here at the Concurrency JSR - 166 Interest Site .
All that is needed for Java 6 is the jsr166y package .
Some other algorithms that are suited for parallelism that I ’ve been thinking about are graph searching algorithms such as depth first and breadth first search .
Depending on whether they are done on a tree or a graph determines how much the underlying data structure will need to be changed to support the parallelism .
I plan to look at making a parallel version of the quicksort algorithm using this framework .
Most divide and conquer algorithms can be adapted fairly easily to be multi- threaded using this method , but remember for a performance benefit to be seen the task must be sufficiently large .

Lewis Hamilton said he simply was not quick enough after struggling during qualifying for the Australian Grand Prix .
The McLaren driver , who had looked strong in practice , was unable to make it to Q3 , complaining about the lack of grip from his tyres .
Hamilton will start tomorrow 's race from 11th position .
" I was n't fast enough , " Hamilton told the BBC after qualifying .
" I feel I got everything out of the car , I just really did n't have any more grip out of the tyres .
" Unfortunate but we can still have a good race tomorrow hopefully . "
He added : " Basically my first run I got a lot of traffic so I was n't able to do a lap .
So then I came in early - went back out early - and traffic was very difficult out there but I had a clear lap , just was n't able to get ... "
The McLaren driver said his road car incident on Friday , when his car was impounded by the police , had nothing to do with his performance today .
" It was something you learn from and I do n't think it has particularly affected today .
I think the weather , I do n't know if I got the right heat into the tyres or not , but Jenson is doing a good job at least . "
For many centuries , canal boats were propelled by men , horses or mules on the towpath beside the water .
Before diesel power took over , engineers developed several interesting methods powered by electricity : trolleyboats , floating funiculars and electric mules .
Many of these ecological solutions could be applied today instead of diesel engines .
Because of the very low energy requirements , they could easily be powered by renewable energy , generated on the spot by water turbines located at sluices .
One trolleyboat line is still in use .
This is a guest post by Kris De Decker .
Readers will remember that Kris was the author of the Oil Drum post Wind Powered Factories .
A longer version of this post on trolley canal boats was published in low tech magazine .
As described in a previous article , trolleybuses and trolleytrucks would make a lot of sense these days because they could deliver electric transport for a bargain , using simple and existing technology .
The same method was once applied to boats , too .
Not for sea travel , of course , but for canal transport .
Some canal boats were also propelled by systems that resemble those of cable trains , and yet another method combined common railway technology with canal barges .
All this happened at the turn of the twentieth century , mainly in France and to a lesser extent in Germany , in Belgium and ( only experimentally ) in the United States .
Up until the second half of the nineteenth century , canal barges were the main means of transporting goods over longer distances through regions where no good natural waterways existed .
In all of Europe by the end of the 1800s , there were between 19,300 and 24,000 kilometres ( 12,000 and 15,000 miles ) of canals .
In the US in 1880 , the total length of canals was around 7,200 kilometres ( 4,500 miles ) .
Mules and horses
From the 1840s onwards the rapid progress of railways threatened to make these canal networks obsolete .
In 1880 , already 3,200 km ( 2,000 miles ) of canals in the US had fallen into disuse because of the rise of the railroads .
Canal boats , which had a capacity of up to 240 tons in the second half of the 19th century , were towed by horses or mules on the tow path ( sails were not an option on most canals ) .
This method was very efficient compared to non-motorised land - based transport ; a horse could carry 10 times more cargo in this way than was possible when hauling a cart on the road .
Compared to the new railways , however , the cargo capacity of animal powered barges was limited and the speed was low .
In most countries , animal traction remained the only method in use on the canals , until it was superseded by diesel engines in the 1930s or later , or until the canals fell into disrepair altogether ( like in the United Kingdom ) .
But , faced with the decline in traffic at the end of the 1800s , some governments and canal companies attracted engineers to look for more modern and efficient ways of boat propulsion to compete with the railways .
Steam barges
The obvious solution to canal barge transport was the steam engine - the same technology that kept trains going .
Some canal barges were indeed converted to independent steam powered vehicles or towboats , but it soon became clear that this could not work when applied to large numbers of boats .
The reason was the state of the canals .
In those times , canals were simply a large ditch without reinforced banks .
If all barges would be equipped with steam engines onboard , or towed by steam boats , then the wash of the screws ( or paddlewheels ) would have destroyed the banks of the canals in no time .
Another obstacle was the limited depth of most canals , not exceeding 2 to 2.5 metres ( 6.5 to 8.5 feet ) and this only in the middle of the canal .
This made higher speeds problematic , because the stern of a propeller powered boat comes to lay deeper in the water as speed goes up .
A third problem of steam power was that the bulky engine took away cargo space , thereby lowering the efficiency of the transport system .
This made that , even though steam boats already existed since the end of the 1700s , and many of them were in use on rivers and lakes , only 84 of them were operated on American canals in 1906 .
Batteries
Because of these challenges , another obvious method - electric boats powered by batteries - was no solution either .
At the end of the 19th century , thousands of electric automobiles were in use on the streets .
The first " automobile " or independent boat carrying its own battery was already demonstrated in 1838 , and at the end of the 1870s one even made a trip across the English Channel .
But , these boats were not suited for canal transportation .
The propeller or paddlewheel would create the same wash as a steamboat , destroying the delicate canal banks .
The batteries would take up almost all the cargo space .
Overview of electrical methods
Ultimately , engineers found the solution in electric propulsion without the use of batteries .
Roughly , all methods can be divided in five classes :
Trolley propeller towing - engine on the boat .
Trolley submerged chain towing - engine on the boat .
Funiculars - engine on the banks .
Manned electric mules - engine on the banks .
Unmanned electric mules - engine on the banks or over the water .
Most of these systems were initially powered by steam engines , and later adapted to electricity , which made them much more efficient and practical .
Some systems were afterwards converted to diesel engines .
With the exception of funicular boats , all electrical systems were fed by a trolley line .
Apart from some regional success stories , none of these technologies found widespread use , in spite of the many successful tests .
Peak oil and global warming were no concerns in those times .
Most countries chose to further deepen out and reinforce their canals in order to allow self - propelled steam and , a bit later , diesel boats .
At the end of the article I will explain why it is time to ditch these and finally give the trolley systems the attention they deserve ; they are our best chance to develop a completely oil independent , land - based cargo transport network with a large capacity .
The original article discusses all of these five methods .
Here , we are providing only a bit of information about the method that found widespread use on a regional scale .
4. Motor locomotive haulage ( electric mules )
The only method that found a widespread use , at least on a regional scale , adhered to the old and primitive method of haulage or towing by mules on the path next to the canal .
But , for the slow and uneconomical animal , a more efficient mechanical mule was substituted , hooked up to a trolleyline .
The machines were either run upon a track on the banks of the canal - this method being practically a railway along the banks , the boats being trailers connected by a 50 metre ( 165 feet ) long tow line to the motor cars ( illustration below ) - or either run upon the towpath itself - this method somewhat resembling a land - based trolleytruck convoy ( picture above ) .
As with the animal powered systems , two persons were needed to operate the convoy : one on the banks ( driving the locomotive or truck ) and one on the boat ( steering ) .
Using this method none of the boats were equipped with a motor , which resulted in the same advantages as with the funicular [ cable towing ] system : any boat previously towed by mules or horses could be hauled in this way without any adaptations or the need for a specially designed towboat , and no wash was created , leaving the delicate canal banks untouched and eliminating the need for deeper waterways .
Electric mules on rails turned out to be much more reliable on the towpath than trolleytrucks , being operational every day and both day and night .
The trolleytruck system only worked during daylight ( at night too many drivers would end up in the water ) and it could not be operated in winter conditions .
The use and maintenance of the track system was two times cheaper than the trolleytruck system , but because of the higher capital costs a trolleytruck system remained a better choice on sections where traffic was low .
Bring back the trolleyboats !
All the above is more than a gallery of obsolete technology .
Canal transport is already one of the most energy - efficient ways to transport goods .
For every litre of fuel burned , a barge can carry a tonne of cargo for 127 kilometres ( 79 miles ) , compared to 97 km ( 60 miles ) for a train and 50 km ( 31 miles ) for a truck ( source ) .
Electrifying canals could boost this efficiency even further , bringing the possibility of a zero-emission transport system within reach .
These days many canals have reinforced banks , so trolley systems with a propeller would no longer pose a problem .
However , especially interesting are those systems in which traction happens on land instead of in the water ( all systems excluding a propeller ) , because they are extremely energy - efficient .
To move a barge of a certain tonnage at low speeds , an electric mule ( or any of the other systems described ) needs an engine at least 4 times less powerful than when this engine would be placed on the boat itself , propelling a screw ( source ) .
Wheels are more efficient than propellers .
This means that for every litre of fuel , a barge towed by a machine on the banks or via a chain on the bottom of the canal could carry a tonne of cargo for 500 kilometres ( 310 miles ) - ten times more efficient than a truck or lorry .
Zero-emissions transport system
Because many canals have locks and thus artificial height differences between water surfaces , renewable energy could be generated on the spot .
The required electricity to power the barges could also be generated by wind turbines or solar panels , which would make a zero-emissions transport system also possible in flat countries .
Because of the very low energy requirements , the investment in renewable energy would be relatively small ( contrary to , for instance , the plans to charge electric cars using solar panels ) .
And as always , obsolete systems can be substantially improved with today 's technology and materials .
Low - tech canals
Of course , canal barges are much slower than trucks or trains .
But , if they could haul cargo for almost nothing , it would still be an economical choice for many goods .
This advantage would grow if oil prices would rise .
Many abandoned canals could be put in use again , and even new ones could be built .
Almost all methods above were designed for use on very shallow , trapezoidal " low - tech " canals , which were only 2 metres ( 6.5 feet ) deep at the centre , and much less on the sides ( see picture below ) .
These are not public works like the Panama Canal which would take decades and require thousands of workers ( or energy - guzzling machines ) to build .
This is something that might even be done on a community level .

And down goes Soup .
According to the Miami Herald , Panthers forward Gregory Campbell may be done for the season , nursing a broken bone in his foot , sustained March 20th against Buffalo .
Of course , " Soup " is putting the best possible light on the injury : " It 's a broken bone , but once I can put on the skate and push off and feel confident on my stop and starts , then I can come back . "
But will his team ultimately go another route ?
Campbell was in the midst of his best stretch of the year with 4 assists ( +3 ) in his past four games .
He was on pace to break his best month of the season so far ( 2g - 4a in January ) , which is by no means what was expected of the center coming into the 2009 - 10 campaign .
32 points a year ago was a benchmark , playing what some may brand as beyond his projections as a career third or fourth line pivot .
Needless to say , it simply has n't been repeated .
His pugilistic skills have not gone unnoticed , nor unused : 53 penalty minutes in sixty games places him on par with numbers from twelve months ago ( NHL career - high 76 in seventy - seven appearances .
However , Nick Tarnasky has - for now - run with role , and quite effectively .
A restricted free agent in July , it 's difficult to predict what Panthers general manager Randy Sexton has in store for Campbell ; as usual , much will depend upon price ( current salary is $ 762,500 ) and what direction he may wish to drive the club .
There is competition for the roster spot : Shawn Matthias has impressed lately and Cats ' management is under extraordinary outside pressure to acquire a true first - line center over the summer .
Assuming this happens , the top four Florida centers would be Stephen Weiss , Steven Reinprecht , Matthias , and unnamed - hoped - for acquisition .
Which opens another can of worms : as a " skill " player , is it not a horrible waste having Matthias grinding on the third or fourth line ?
Anyway , Cats at Habs tonight ... Live Game Forum fires up around 6ish .
An openly gay student seeking a graduate degree in counseling at a state university is expelled for refusing to agree that homosexuality is immoral and declining to enter an anti-gay indoctrination program .
An openly gay high school guidance counselor speaks out in favor of same sex marriage and is brought before a state licensing board to answer complaints against her filed by marriage opponents .
If you 're a gay rights advocate or liberal civil libertarian , you 're probably outraged by such gross violations of freedom of speech and conscience .
Now ask yourself if you 're equally outraged to learn that the victims in these cases were not your friends and allies but your opponents -- conservative Christians who have been targeted for their beliefs about the immorality of homosexuality and same sex marriage , respectively .
Julea Ward had nearly completed a graduate degree program in counseling at Eastern Michigan University ( EMU ) when she was dismissed for refusing to affirm homosexual behavior as morally acceptable and then refusing to enter a " remediation " program designed to demonstrate the " error of her ways . "
It should be stressed that Ward was not asserting a prerogative to counsel gay clients in spite of her views ; instead , she was relying on the option of referring them to other therapists , and she had done so in a clinical program .
Still , she was dismissed for violating EMU policies , which incorporated American Counseling Association ethical codes and included an obligation to " tolerate different points of view , " as well as prohibitions on " unethical , threatening , or unprofessional conduct " or discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation , ( among other characteristics , including religious belief ) .
Ward has sued EMU in federal court ( the case is pending , awaiting a ruling on cross motions to dismiss ) ; she is represented by the Alliance Defense Fund , ( and this summary of facts derives from the ADF brief ) .
Donald Mendell is a licensed high school guidance counselor in a Maine public school who appeared in a tv ad supporting the successful 2009 ballot initiative to repeal Maine 's equal marriage law .
( I contributed financially to the Maine Equality campaign opposing repeal . )
Citing his appearance in this ad , another guidance counselor filed a complaint against Mendell with the state licensing board .
( Mendell is also represented by ADF , and the complaint against him is pending . )
It alleges that he violated the National Association of Social Worker 's code prohibiting social workers from encouraging or engaging " in any form of discrimination " based on sexual orientation and requiring social workers to " act to prevent and eliminate domination of , exploitation of and discrimination against " any group .
" Don Mendell 's recent appearance in the Vote Yes commercial makes more public his opposition to the support of GLBTQ issues , " the letter complains .
" His negative statements regarding homosexuality help contribute to an environment of negativity that already exists among students .
Our schools work hard to promote respect and dignity for all , regardless of one 's personal beliefs . "
That Mendell was expressing his personal beliefs was an irony apparently lost on the complainant , whose commitment to respecting individual belief seems rather selective .
The conviction that some beliefs ( and the people who harbor them ) are more worthy of protection and respect than others helps explain both the licensing board action against Mendell and EMU 's dismissal of Julea Ward .
Both Mendell and Ward were also accused of violating rules established by private professional associations .
State agencies adopt these rules voluntarily and must enforce them in accordance with constitutional guarantees of free speech .
But Alliance Defense Fund attorneys claim that they 're beginning to see a spate of cases involving complaints to state boards against counseling professionals who consider homosexuality immoral .
They cite a complaint filed ( unsuccessfully ) against Texas therapist whose name appeared on the website of Exodus International , a Christian ministry devoted to " healing " and re-programming gays and lesbians : " We believe that God wants to heal homosexuals through His church .
Our goal is to equip you for that task ! "
Are therapists who offer their services through Exodus International and similar organizations unqualified to practice their professions ?
Should they be denied state licenses ?
I understand the argument that a therapist who offers to " cure " people of homosexuality is guilty of malpractice .
I 'm cognizant of the long , hard struggle to change the view of homosexuality as a disease or disorder and eliminate it from the DSM .
I would defend the prerogatives of private professional associations to decline to certify or otherwise sponsor people who do not comply with their standards and rules .
But it is not the prerogative of the state to withhold or withdraw licenses from people on the basis of their religious beliefs , except in extraordinary cases , for compelling reasons : a teacher whose religious beliefs prevent her from teaching girls or gay students or ethnic minorities should not be licensed to teach in public schools .
Why do n't the cases of Julea Ward or Donald Mendell offer equally compelling reasons to discipline them ?
Mendell was not accused of refusing to counsel gay students or of trying to convince them that they were abnormal or sinful by virtue of being gay .
His offense was expressing his view of same sex marriage in a public debate .
( In fact , his ad opposing same sex marriage was preceded by a pro marriage ad in which another public school teacher appeared ; as far as I know she has not been dragged before any licensing boards . )
Mendell was not accused of misconduct ; he was accused of mis-speak .
Julea
Ward was not accused of misconduct either , and she had complied with policies directing counselors whose values conflicted with prospective clients to refer the clients elsewhere .
She was dismissed from EMU for mis-belief .
She might properly be denied a public school counseling job if she could not in good conscience counsel gay and lesbian students without expressing her strong disapproval of them , ( and if the school employed no other counselors sympathetic to the students ) .
But she has a clear constitutional right to practice her profession privately , and denying her a degree is also a disservice to Christian patients ( of any and every sexual orientation ) seeking counselors who share their religious values and beliefs .
The targeting of Julea Ward and Donald Mendell reflects a tendency to confuse speech or belief with conduct and to seek reprisals against people or groups whose views are equated with actual discrimination .
But equating speech with action is also a semantic dodge for people who prefer not acknowledging ( even to themselves ) that they support censorship and restraints on freedom of conscience .
In the Ward and Mendell cases , " complainants are wielding the canons of professional ethics as if they were blasphemy codes for the state church and you have to punish these people as heretics , " Alliance Defense Fund attorney Jordon Lorence asserts .
" Who 's being the narrow minded fundamentalist and who 's being the civil libertarian in these discussions ? "
The conflict between liberty and equality is familiar , and civil rights movements often grapple with it , as feminist fights over pornography and sexual harassment have demonstrated .
Recently , the drive for gay rights has produced some speech and belief policing : consider the series of cases involving Christian student groups denied official recognition at their schools because of their constitutionally protected membership policies that discriminate against active , " unrepentant " gay and lesbian students , along with heterosexual " fornicators . "
( I 've written about these cases here ; in my view , the associational rights of private student groups should prevail over school anti-discrimination policies , and I suspect that the Supreme Court , which will soon decide the question , will agree . )
Of course the gay rights movement ( like the feminist movement ) includes internal disputes about the wisdom or justice of infringing on First Amendment rights .
In Maine , for example , leaders of the campaign for equal marriage publicly opposed the complaint against Donald Mendell .
But , with the notable exception of the non-partisan Foundation for Individual Rights in Education , which defends the rights of all students , regardless of their views , advocacy groups tend to focus on defending the liberties of people with whom they agree .
Not surprisingly , the right wing , anti-gay Alliance Defense Fund is perhaps the primary defender of First Amendment rights in cases involving the anti-gay speech and belief of conservative Christians .
ADF receives ( and perhaps desires ) little assistance from the ACLU , an increasingly unreliable defender of speech and belief that conflict with its gay rights agenda : while the ACLU aggressively defended the rights of students to wear t- shirts to school celebrating gay rights , for example , it stayed out of an important federal case , Harper v Poway , involving a Christian student punished for wearing an anti-gay t- shirt , even when the case reached the Supreme Court .
National and state spokespeople for the ACLU , once a staunch defender of freedom of conscience , have pointedly ignored an invitation to comment on Julea Ward 's federal case , although they might simply have pointed out that liberty cannot be secured for some without securing it for all .

Loggers made a rare find last week when they came upon a World War II - era U.S. Navy Aircraft in a heavily wooded area near Rockaway Beach .
World War II air crashes in the Northwest
A P-63 crashed into the Bull Run watershed on Sept. 1 , 1944 .
An Army B - 17 crashed Aug. 1 , 1943 , on Cape Lookout on the Oregon Coast , killing nine of the 10 aboard .
The plane was from Pendleton on a gunnery training mission
A Navy PBY - 5 crashed Jan. 31 , 1945 , in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness in Southern Oregon 's Coast Range , killing the crew of seven .
A ground party reached the crash a few days later and deemed the terrain too difficult to recover bodies .
They buried the crew there .
A Navy F6F Hellcat crashed on Deadman Peak in the Blue Mountains in November 1944 , killing a pilot out of Pasco , Wash .
A party located the crash in June 1945 and found the pilot 's body .
A B -17 crashed Aug. 16 , 1943 , south of Langdon Lake in the Blues , killing the pilot , 1st Lt. Lewis W. Hubbard , and three crewmen .
The bomber was on a training flight from Pendleton .
An Army P - 38 crashed sometime in 1943 in a farmer 's field near Onalaska , Wash . , killing the pilot .
An Army B - 24 crashed Feb. 12 , 1945 , into a ridge in Oregon 's Pueblo Moutains , three miles northwest of Denio , Nev . The 11 persons on board died .
..
A Navy PV - 1 Ventura crashed Nov. 29 , 1945 , five miles east of Mount St. Helens on a flight from Seattle to Red Bluff , Calif .
.
A B -17 crashed Dec. 2 , 1943 , into a ridge near Potlatch , Idaho .
Pilot Capt . John E. Gaffney and six others bailed out and lived .
A B - 24 crashed April 23 , 1944 , 25 miles northeast of McDermitt .
The crew of 10 bailed out and was rescued by Indians from the McDermitt reservation .
Crashes documented by Sig Unander Jr. , of Cornelius , a self - described aviation archeologist .
Now , Navy investigators are focusing their efforts on determining if human remains might also be at the scene .
" If this is one of our shipmates we would treat that like we would treat one who died today with respect to our fallen comrade and respect to the family , " said Sean Hughes , Navy Region Northwest Public Affairs Officer .
" We would try to connect the past with the people who may still be alive .
I do n't want to speculate that there are remains , but if there are , we will treat them with the utmost respect . "
Investigators were initially concerned that there might be unexploded bombs or bullets on the site , but a search by Oregon State Police bomb technicians turned up no obvious signs of any unexploded ordnance , Hughes said .
Workers for a lumber company spotted the plane while harvesting timber March 18 , according to Tillamook Sheriff Todd Anderson .
They initially spotted a wing , tail , landing gear and other debris .
The debris was found in a heavily wooded area on private property off a logging road , and covers about a 200 - yard area .
The aircraft has been identified as a
It was found about 20 miles northwest of Naval Air Station Tillamook , which was decommissioned in 1948 .
However , the station of origin has not been determined and Hughes said it is too soon to say if or when the plane was listed as missing .
Anderson said he was told by the Pentagon that it was a two - person plane .
" I 've talked with a retired sheriff who was here since the 1950s and he is not aware of that type of crash , " Anderson said .
" The Air Station Tillamook flew the Curtiss from 1942 to 1948 on sub missions .
They carried a torpedo weighing up to 500 pounds that was meant to disable Japanese subs .
There is one reported missing from 1945 with two crew members . "
Anderson said his primary concern is determining if there are " fallen comrades , " and secondly , if the plane might have been decommissioned and sold and flown by someone other than the Navy .
Sig Unander Jr. , a Cornelius resident who has spent years tracking down the wreckage of military airplanes , said there have been many crashes of Helldivers based out of Astoria .
" I am unaware of one crashing there but there are probably 30 military aircraft not accounted for in Washington , Oregon , Idaho , and Montana from the mid 1930s through mid 1940s . "
A team of Navy personnel are working on - scene to investigate and share information with Joint Prisoner of War / Missing in Action Accounting Command .
Personnel include archeologists , DNA experts , ordnance specialists and their own public affairs unit .
" The JPAC team does this all the time , " said Hughes .
" They are on scene collecting as much data from the scene as possible to share with the command , which has fairly extensive data on missing personnel .
Safety and integrity of the aircraft site is paramount .
It is important that the Navy team on - scene be allowed to make a thorough , undisturbed investigation at this time . "
Once it 's determined if there are human remains at the site , that will determine the next phase of the investigation , Hughes said .
" It may be a project that goes on for a while , " said Hughes .
" This is just the initial phase . "

Advertisement South African President Jacob Zuma has begun a three - day visit to Zimbabwe , aiming to ease tensions within the fragile year - old unity government .
It is thought Mr Zuma will assess the country 's readiness for an election , which could take place next year .
He was greeted at Harare 's airport by both President Robert Mugabe and PM Morgan Tsvangirai , who agreed to share power after disputed elections in 2008 .
They are at odds over key issues and have struggled to revive the economy .
The crisis in Zimbabwe has forced some three million people to flee across the border to South Africa , where they live as refugees .
' Year of anxiety '
When the Southern African Development Community ( Sadc ) appointed Mr Zuma as its chief mediator on Zimbabwe in 2009 , Mr Mugabe 's critics hoped he would take a tougher line on Zimbabwe 's president than his predecessor , Thabo Mbeki .
But there has been little public evidence of a different approach to Mr Mbeki 's policy of " quiet diplomacy " .
OUTSTANDING DISAGREEMENTS
Harassment
MDC accuses Zanu - PF of campaign of violence , Zanu - PF dismisses claims as ' outrageous ' Senior officials
MDC says central bank governor and attorney general must be replaced , Zanu - PF disagrees Roy Bennett
MDC says terrorism charges against him should be dropped , Zanu - PF says courts must decide Provincial governors
Mr Mugabe refuses to swear in MDC nominees White - owned farms
MDC says farm seizures must stop , Zanu - PF disagrees Western sanctions
Zanu - PF wants Tsvangirai to get them lifted
Bitterness and unease in Zimbabwe Polarised lives of rich and poor Zimbabwe 's forgotten children According to South African officials , Mr Zuma is in Harare to " facilitate the removal of obstacles which hinder the full implementation of a power - sharing deal " .
The BBC's Karen Allen in Johannesburg says it seems increasingly likely that Mr Zuma 's focus will be ensuring that new electoral laws are in place in time for a possible vote next year .
Mr Mugabe recently said he would stand in the next election if his Zanu - PF party wanted him .
A spokesman for Mr Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , Nelson Chamisa , told the BBC's World Today programme that since the unity government was formed , " it has been a year of disappointment , a year of anxiety and suspense , a year of unfulfilled promises " .
He said the only way of brining finality and closure would be to hold " free and fair elections under a new constitution " .
But our correspondent says many Zimbabweans fear a repeat of the violence of the elections two years ' ago .
The MDC has accused Mr Mugabe of breaking the power - sharing deal by unilaterally appointing a central bank governor and attorney general .
It also says its activists are still being harassed and beaten by Zanu - PF militants and members of the security forces .
The trial of senior MDC politician Roy Bennett on terrorism charges has further divided the two parties .
For his part , Mr Mugabe has angrily accused Mr Tsvangirai of not doing enough to have Western sanctions lifted .
On a recent visit to the UK , Mr Zuma also tried unsuccessfully to have those sanctions eased .
He said he disagreed with the view that more pressure was required .

One of the most mind - boggling choices dog and cat owners face is how to safely guard against fleas and ticks .
Those creepy crawlers are n’t just gross ; they can transmit disease to both pets and people .
Pets need protection , but many of the solutions on store shelves are loaded with chemicals that could be risky to their health — and yours .
Vladimir Godnik / fStop / Offset
So what ’s a responsible pet lover to do ?
The key is to stop the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from allowing these harmful products to reach store shelves in the first place .
Until the EPA does this , however , you can educate yourself about the risks and benefits of various treatment options , then bring that knowledge to the store .
There are ways to keep all your family members , including the furry ones , safe from dangerous pests and the most toxic ingredients .
The perils of pest protection
Most conventional flea and tick products — including collars , topical treatments , sprays , and dusts — are registered as pesticides and regulated by the EPA .
( Those given orally , like pills , must be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . )
But here ’s the ugly truth : Many of the pesticides allowed for use on pets are linked to serious health issues in people , such as cancer and neurological and respiratory problems .
Pets can also suffer : Skin irritation , neurological problems , gastrointestinal disorders , and even organ failure have been reported as a result of pet poisonings .
The government has faced criticism from NRDC and other watchdog groups about insufficient safety standards for these products .
Consumers , as well as some veterinarians , do n’t know the whole story , says NRDC senior scientist Miriam Rotkin - Ellman .
“ Many vets count on the EPA to make sure that the products on the market are safe if used correctly . ”
Unfortunately , the ingredients in these products are still quite dangerous , and regular use can result in unsafe exposure , particularly for children and pregnant women .
For example , even low - level exposure to organophosphates and carbamates — two particularly dangerous families of pesticides found in some flea treatments as well as in agricultural and lawn products — have been linked to learning disabilities in children .
For this reason , most household uses of these pesticides have already been banned .
Unfortunately , kids can still be exposed to them from their furry siblings ' flea collars or other products .
Going nontoxic .
Fortunately for many families , fleas can be controlled without resorting to harmful chemicals .
Always try the strategies below first before considering chemicals — safer chemicals — if additional protection is needed .
Here ’s what you can do :
Groom your pets regularly .
Common soap and water will kill adult fleas .
In addition , comb your animal ’s fur with a fine - tooth flea comb , and dunk any critters into a container of sudsy water .
Clean , clean , clean .
Wash your pet ’s bedding weekly in hot , soapy water , and vacuum and wipe down pet - frequented surfaces often , including behind and underneath furniture and between couch cushions .
If you ’re the victim of a flea infestation , Karyn Bischoff , a toxicologist at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine , recommends doing this daily .
For severe cases , professional steam cleaning may be needed for your carpets .
Take preemptive steps in your yard and garden .
It helps to put beneficial nematodes — worms that eat flea larvae — in the soil where your pet is likely to frolic .
Find them in garden supply stores or online .
Diatomaceous earth is a less toxic option for the home and yard , says Rotkin - Ellman , “ but it can be really damaging if it is inhaled or gets into your or your pet ’s eyes . ”
Use caution and protective gear , and use it only in areas where pets and kids wo n’t be exposed .
Look for products marketed to control pests , and avoid the kind used in swimming - pool systems .
Be wary of products marketed as “ natural . ”
Sadly , there ’s no magic nontoxic bullet to wipe out these pests .
Natural products and herbal remedies should also be approached with caution .
They may not work — and some are n’t safe , says Bischoff .
Many of these contain peppermint , cinnamon , lemongrass , cedarwood , or rosemary oil .
While these may be safer than some of the synthetic chemicals , they have also been linked to allergies in both pets and humans , and not much is known about how well they actually work .
If you give these a try , monitor your pet and family closely for adverse reactions .
Considering chemicals
There are varying degrees of danger when it comes to these products and the chemicals they contain .
Work with your vet to craft a custom plan for your pet , and keep some basic guidelines in mind to spot safer products :
Ask about oral flea- prevention treatments .
Pills with the active ingredients lufenuron , nitenpyram , or spinosad can be a better option , for both animals and humans , than treatments that leave residue on fur that might get on hands or furniture .
But oral meds need to be prescribed by a vet and are considerably more expensive , so they may not be a realistic option for all pet owners .
Identify safer ingredients .
If chemical products are necessary for additional flea or tick control , NRDC recommends s-methoprene or pyriproxyfen , which are less toxic ingredients — but read the labels carefully because some products use them with other , more harmful pesticides .
Avoid products that include synthetic neonicotinoids ( like imidacloprid and dinotefuran ) , which are harmful to bees and may be toxic to the developing brain of young kids .
Be wary of flea collars .
These products can contain some of the most dangerous insecticides , including tetrachlorvinphos , carbaryl , and propoxur .
Some of the collars posing the greatest risk are already being phased out of production , and NRDC is suing the EPA to ban the rest .
Until that happens ( and until older products are off store shelves entirely ) , either avoid collars altogether or be vigilant about searching labels for those particular active ingredients .
Use extra caution with tick products .
When it comes to tick prevention — or combination flea - and - tick products — the news is even grimmer .
Most products designed to repel these buggers include possible carcinogens and nervous - system toxins like fipronil , permethrin , pyrethrins , or imidacloprid .
“ Our recommendation for ticks is to use the least toxic option available , at the lowest level , and only when you need it , ” Rotkin - Ellman says .
If you live in an area where ticks and Lyme disease are prevalent , you probably need protection — but talk to your vet about how much and how often .
Pregnant women and young children should minimize their exposure .
Buy a species - specific product .
Two common ingredients in flea - and - tick products , permethrin and pyrethrins , are very toxic to cats .
Do n’t put these ingredients on your dog , either , if you also have a cat that could snuggle up with or brush against it .
Choose the right formula for your pet ’s weight .
An EPA investigation showed that small dogs ( 10 to 20 pounds ) were most likely to have reactions such as rashes , vomiting , diarrhea , and seizures from topical treatments .
Dogs that are old , young , sick , or on meds are also at higher risk .
( Flea and tick control can interfere with other medications , rendering them ineffective or even poisonous . )
There are even breed - specific sensitivities , so a conversation with your vet is in order before you decide how to proceed .
Do n’t rely on shampoos .
Flea and tick shampoo may seem like a safer , more cost - effective option , but they often contain many of the same ingredients as topical treatments and can cause adverse reactions and allergies , Bischoff says .
Moreover , they ’re not meant to take the place of preventive options .
“ You ’d use a shampoo for an animal with an infestation and then , usually , follow up with a topical treatment , ” she says .
Read labels , and take the same precautions with shampoos as you would with spot - on or collar products .
Report health issues immediately .
If you or your pet reacts to a pet product containing pesticides , call your local poison control center , talk to your doctor , and , later , report it to the National Pesticide Information Center at 800-858-7378 .

" We want to make the whole process as intuitive and painless as possible . "
Another new feature is CrossOver 's ability to download installation " recipes " directly from the CodeWeavers online Compatibility Database , located at http://C4.codeweavers.com.
" If another CrossOver user has figured out how to use CrossOver to install a Windows application , they can upload that installation recipe to our database , " said White .

White confirmed that CodeWeavers offers porting services to Windows software developers as well .
CrossOver 9.0 is available immediately at www.codeweavers.com.

Best of Craigslist :
To the guy who tailgated me for 20 miles
If you need to sell a couch - or buy one cheap - Craigslist can be your best friend .
If you need to kill some time and let out a few laughs , well , Craigslist can still be your best friend .
Although many of the posts in the Rants and Raves section of Craigslist are nothing more than a waste of time and space , there are the occasional gems that are nominated to wear the title of ' Best of Craigslist . '
This particular memo wears such title , and likely because of the strong closing tip .
This is a little video of a machine that makes Mario repeatedly punch a block and get a coin .
It was made out of LEGO Mindstorm sets and Perler beads .
At least I think it was .
It could be made out of magic and donkey dicks for all I know .
Hit the jump for the machine in action .

Shares in Prudential tumbled 12 % after the UK 's second - largest insurer announced plans to buy AIA for $ 35.5 bn ( £ 23 bn ) .
The Prudential said that the agreement to take over the Asian arm of AIG was a " compelling " chance to create South East Asia 's leading insurer .
But investors sent Prudential shares lower on concerns that the deal will be part - funded by a $ 20 bn rights issue .
Pru shares closed down 72 pence at 530 p , after hitting 515 p at one point .
ANALYSIS By Juliana Liu , BBC News , Singapore Hundreds of panicked customers queued outside the Singapore and Hong Kong offices of AIA to terminate their policies in September 2008 , during the height of the global financial crisis .
But after the US government bailed out parent company AIG , business returned .
And now AIA will be sold to repay that debt .
AIG is selling its crown jewels .
Its Asian unit is the oldest in the region , and one of the most profitable .
The combined firm would be the clear market leader in some of the Asia 's most populous and fast - growing countries : China , Indonesia and Thailand .
Asians have the highest personal savings rates in the world .
China 's consumers and banks save just over half of their total income a year .
Other countries are not far behind .
Pru may be paying a premium for AIA , though the deal will double the number of customers it serves .
BBC business editor Robert Peston said that the $ 20 bn rights issue ranked as one of the biggest cash calls by a UK company .
Only the emergency rescue rights issues of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds have come anywhere close in respect of amount of money raised , he said .
The Prudential will also raise $ 5bn in borrowings to fund the deal .
Prudential will pay US - based AIG $ 25bn in cash plus $ 10.5 bn in shares , giving the US company an estimated 11 % stake in the UK firm .
Shares in the Prudential were suspended in London this morning pending an announcement , but fell immediately trading resumed .
Analysts at brokerages Oriel Securities and Panmure Gordon downgraded Prudential shares on fears about the size of the rights issue .
Kevin Ryan , analyst at ING , said the fund - raising was " going to be enormously dilutive .
No one knows exactly what AIA contains or how profitable it is , or how it overlaps with Pru's existing businesses " .
The acquisition is a big move for Prudential chief executive Tidjane Thiam , who is only five months into the job .
He said : " This transaction is hugely exciting and a one - off opportunity to transform the group , [ putting ] us in a strong leadership position in all the critical growth markets in the region . "
The merged company will retain its headquarters and listing in London .
But an application for a dual primary listing in Hong Kong will be made in " due course " , Mr Thiam said .
He said that there were no plans to sell the Prudential 's UK operation , and described London as the company 's " historic home " .
It 's quite difficult to argue that the Pru is buying AIA at a fire sale price
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert Peston 's blog " The UK generates cash and capital for us - it's a very important part of the group and sits comfortably within our portfolio , " Mr Thiam said .
The Prudential has about seven million customers in the UK .
Demand for personal financial services in Asia is booming , fuelled by the region 's strong economic growth .
The Prudential is already the second biggest insurer in South East Asia .
This deal is expected to make it the biggest .
Risks Analysts believe the deal , which would double Prudential 's market value to about $ 46bn , faces a number of hurdles .
Shareholders in the Prudential will need convincing that the two companies can integrate their complex structures in 13 Asian markets .
Demand for personal financial services in Asia is booming For example , AIA and Prudential operate with different joint venture partners in India and China .
Such agreements may have to be unwound .
In some Asian markets , the combined group 's dominance could raise competition issues .
Sally Yim , a senior analyst at Moody's , said : " In Singapore [ AIA and Prudential ] may have over 30 % market share .
It 's significant .
There might be some questions raised , but I do n't think it would trip the deal . "
Toby Langley , analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein , said in an research note : " Pru - AIA would have number one market position in eight key Asian markets , and would put considerable daylight between itself and other Asian players . "
He added that a deal " has substantial industrial logic and could be very attractive for Prudential " .
Financial services boom Asia 's rapid economic growth has generated huge demand for financial services , said Hugo Young , managing director of Aberdeen Asset Management Asia , in Singapore .
[ an error occurred while processing this directive ]
In an interview with the BBC World Service , he said : " The reasons for [ Pru and AIA ] being interested in Asia are simply the dramatic growth of financial products , life assurance , and the like that we 're seeing exploding through Asia , as Asia develops rapidly .
Whereas the more developed markets of the US and Europe are relatively mature .
" Many moons ago there was scepticism , particularly among Chinese , about taking life policies , given its association with death in a perverse sense .
Life policies were not uppermost in many people 's list of investment requirements and protection requirements . "
Prudential said it hoped to complete the rights issue by early June , and get regulatory approval for the acquisition in the third quarter of 2010 .
AIG was bailed out by the US government in 2008 and is now 80 % owned by it .
In total , the firm has received $ 182.5 bn of government funding .
Prudential 's move for AIA came as AIG was preparing to float its Asian arm in Hong Kong in April .
The flotation had an estimated value of $ 10bn , which would have been among the largest listings on any market this year .
There had also been speculation that the Prudential 's UK life assurance business would be sold off to UK company Resolution .
However , Resolution has released a statement saying it has not been holding any talks with Prudential about the matter .

Megyn Kelly wanted to talk about Fox News ' latest Opinion Dynamics poll , which asked people about their attitudes on government spending and the reach and power of the federal government , with a set of questions clearly geared toward Tea Party movement sentiments , as well as a recent CNN poll -- similarly trying to gauge the Tea Partiers ' reach -- that found 54 percent believe the federal government poses a threat to their rights .
So she brought on Fox 's token liberal , Alan Colmes , to discuss these results , and he pointed out that at least some of those who see the federal government as a threat to their rights are people who object to the Republican - backed Patriot Act .
Then he asked an interesting question of the Tea Party folks :
Colmes : I 'd like to know exactly what freedom -- what freedoms are being taken away from people ?
Kelly : People are worried they 're going to lose their health - insurance coverage !
They 're worried the federal government is going to step in , take over , and they 're not going to be able to see their coverage .
Colmes : I did n't see any particulars about exactly what freedoms people think are going to be taken away .
I would like to know what they are .
Kelly :
There is just as much in this survey about health care as there is the Patriot Act !
Colmes : Yeah , but nothing in this survey says particular health care , particular Patriot Act , it 's just a general question , " freedoms " .
I mean , what particular freedoms .
People call my radio show all the time , ' My freedoms are being compromised . '
All right , I ask them .
What freedom is being compromised ?
What freedom have you lost under Barack Obama ?
Kelly :
You tell me , Alan -- do you think the Democrats on Capitol Hill are going into 2010 election thinking , ' The problem with numbers like this is the Patriot Act !
It is the Bush administration policies . '
Colmes :
They 're also not going , ' The problem is health care .
If we get health care , my freedoms are being taken away . '
How do your freedoms get compromised ?
Kelly tried to argue that the people who fear for their freedoms are monolithically anti-Obama Tea Partiers , and reflected somehow in the high numbers of those opposing the Senate health - care reform bill .
But Colmes pointed out , accurately , that a large portion of those opposed to the Senate bill are people who want a public option .
Kelly :
If you have a majority of Americans saying that the federal government poses a threat to the right[s ] of Americans , those are not people who want the public option !
Colmes :
Well , what rights are being -- wait a minute , you 're suggesting that the public option is more government .
No , it gives you greater options .
It gives you greater opportunity .
I 'd like to know what freedoms people think are being taken away .
What particular freedom -- where in the Bill of Rights are you losing something , based on what ?
What have Obama or Democrats done to take any right away from you ?
I 'd like to know what that is .
Kelly : OK , and on that note , e-mail me at Kelly@FoxNews.com and you can answer that question .
In other words : No answer from Megyn .
Because she did n't have any after Colmes shot down her health - care trial balloon .
Right - wing fearmongering pundits like Beck , Hannity , Limbaugh , and the rest of the long list have made it conventional wisdom among the right - wing Kool - Aid drinkers that Obama somehow mysteriously are " taking away our freeeeeedoms ! "
But they never can tell you exactly what freedoms are being taken away without calling out the Oath Keepers and their black helicopters , can they ?
Which is why the Megyn Kellys out there just say nothing .

The announcements come amid growing complaints that systems across the nation are delivering tap water that poses health risks to residents .
Government and other scientists have identified hundreds of chemicals that are linked to diseases in small concentrations and that are unregulated in drinking water , or policed at limits that still pose serious risks .
In some instances , laws are sufficient , but they have been ignored : More than 20 percent of the nation ’s water treatment systems have violated key provisions of the Safe Drinking Water
Act over the last five years , according to an analysis of federal data by The New York Times .
And the other major water law — the Clean Water Act — has been violated more than half a million times , though few polluters were ever punished .
To correct such lapses , the E.P.A. intends to reform agency policies that essentially require regulators to examine pollutants one at a time .
Those adjustments will allow government scientists to evaluate large groups of similar contaminants at the same time and to issue new rules that apply to dozens of chemicals .
“ This is a dramatic change in how we think about regulation , ” said Cynthia C. Dougherty , the director of the agency ’s office of ground water and drinking water .
“ We ’ll be able to move much faster and issue stronger rules . ”
The agency previously announced it was developing plans to crack down on polluters and force water systems to abide by cleanliness laws .
Image Lisa Jackson , the E.P.A. administrator , said it planned stricter regulation of four cancer - causing chemicals .
Credit ... Cliff Owen / Associated Press
“ We lost the public over the past decade by moving slowly and focusing on solitary contaminants that most people have never heard of , ” said Dr. Pankaj Parekh , director of the water quality division for Los Angeles .
“ This will help us talk about health impacts , rather than long , complicated chemical names . ”
Imagine this , if you can .
You and your friends are out at an art gallery — the Contemporary Art Institute of Detroit , or CAID — for something called " Funk Night , " basically an all - night dance party .
The party , open only to members , happens once a month .
So there you are , reelin ' with the feelin ' , when suddenly , at 2 a.m. , the place is invaded by screaming cops with guns drawn .
Except you do n't even know they are cops .
They are dressed completely in black paramilitary gear , with flashlights mounted on shotguns .
They force some patrons to lay face - down outside in the mud for hours .
Eventually , you are informed that this is a police raid .
You are ticketed for " loitering in a place of illegal occupation . "
They let you go — but tow your car , leaving you on Rosa Parks Boulevard with no way to get home .
If you want your car back , you 'll have to show up later and pay $ 900 .
That is , if they can find it ; one man says his car was evidently stolen from the cop lot .
Does that sound like a fascist nightmare ?
Welcome to Detroit .
If this sounds familiar , that 's because it actually happened , on May 31 , 2008 .
Though I have n't gotten a response from a police spokesman , they do n't seem to dispute this account of what occurred that night .
According to Michael Steinberg , legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan , the police allege that CAID did n't have a license to host " Funk Night . "
There were also allegations that the art gallery was serving liquor after hours .
" But the police had no reason to suspect that the CAID 's patrons knew that Funk Night was not properly licensed or that it was in any other way an illegal operation , " Steinberg said .
Yet the cops did what they felt like doing .
They make a lot of money impounding cars , for one thing .
Everybody present was searched — without a warrant — and no drugs or weapons were found .
But some of the patrons , mostly young people in their 20s and 30s , say they were kicked , shoved and hit .
So imagine that were you , and you do n't have money or connections .
Where do you go for help ?
Eventually , a handful of these kids found their way to the most authentically American institution I know : the ACLU .
Freedom is a fragile thing , and the ACLU 's whole reason for being is to defend your constitutional rights .
They get a bum rap a lot of the time .
Blowhard right - wing morons call them " left - wing radicals . "
Some liberals and Jews are uneasy because they 've defended American Nazis ' constitutional right to protest .
Virtually everyone was grossed - out when they defended the free speech rights of NAMBLA , the North American Man / Boy Love Association , which is just what it sounds like it is .
But you know what ?
They defend those creeps to show that our freedoms apply to everyone .
The ACLU is now suing the Detroit Police Department in federal court over what they did to those poor art gallery patrons .
Earlier , Steinberg told me , they got all the criminal charges dropped .
They 'd like it if courts order compensation for the victims , and maybe direct the city to pay their legal fees .
But that 's not what the ACLU really wants most .
They want the courts to declare what the Detroit police did that night was unconstitutional , and to issue an injunction forbidding them from doing it again .
By the way , those cops did Detroit 's image terrible harm .
Some of the people brutalized that May night were suburban residents who say it will be a cold day in hell before they ever spend a day or a dime in Detroit again .
So ... suppose , for a moment , that you are idealistic and want to make a difference , and make this community and this country a better place for all , frankly , including yourself .
Well , you could throw your money and energy into promoting some politician who might or might not get elected , and then might or might not live up to their promises when in office .
Or you could support the one group that is all about helping Americans live up to their ideals , helping protect the young and innocent from fascist - minded or sadistic cops , and keeping the promise of America real .
You could volunteer to help the ACLU , because freedom can't defend itself .
Check aclumich.org .
They 'll leave the light of liberty on , and keep the Constitution working for you .

Farewell to Steve Wilson :
You could criticize his style and tactics , but nobody doubted who the No. 1 investigative reporter in the Detroit TV market was .
WXYZ - TV's Steve Wilson was going after Kwame before beating up on His Dishonor was cool .
Last week , it was announced that Wilson 's contract would n't be renewed , evidently to save money .
Investigative reporting takes time and costs a lot .
If you do it right , sometimes weeks of work do n't result in a single story .
However , if you send a reporter out to discover that cars get stuck when it snows , you are guaranteed lots of cheap , usable footage .
That 's what counts in the news business these days .
I do n't know Wilson well , but some years ago , a friend who runs a nonprofit called me in a bit of a panic .
Stevo wanted to check out their operations , look at their records .
" Have you done anything wrong ?
Do you have anything to hide ? " I asked her bluntly .
" Not at all , " she said .
In that case , give him everything he wants , I advised .
She did exactly that .
He spent days looking at her records .
Result : He did nothing .
The bean counters at Scripps - Howard , the corporate parent of WXYZ - TV , could n't have found that cost - effective .
I was dismayed to learn he'd be gone , but not greatly surprised .
A few days before , I got a confidential note from a well - placed source at another station , bemoaning the demise of investigative reporting at local television in Detroit .
" WXYZ may not renew Wilson .
They are down a producer and have cut back on travel and staff photographers .
WDIV never had much of an investigative unit to begin with .
Efforts to bring in big journalistic guns like [ Detroit Free Press reporter Mike ]
Elrick did n't work .
Oh , they also hired a guy from Flint who was supposed to do investigative , but he wound up doing daily news .
...
" Fox ( WJBK - TV ) had the largest investigative unit with three reporters , three photographers , a producer and a managing editor .
They are down now to one reporter and two photographers who also fill in for daily news stuff .
The reporter is Rob Wolchek , the ' Hall of Shame ' guy .
He 's good , but he is actually more like a consumer reporter than an investigative guy .
The bottom line ... is that the TV stations are n't supporting investigative reporting any more .
" And that 's a damn shame from the citizens ' standpoint . "
Well , my source is right , but clearly did n't have his priorities straight .
True , TV newsrooms in the future may no longer uncover corrupt politicians and businessmen who are stealing our money .
They may not look into who is permitting the destruction of the Great Lakes by the Asian carp .
But they intend to leave no jackknifed tractor - trailer truck unfilmed , and will still show us pictures every time the cops find the body of a local sex crime victim .
What more could an informed citizen possibly need to know ?

What happens when a balloon explodes ?
Dr Yan Wong , presenter from BBC One's Bang Goes The Theory finds out with the help of a super slow motion camera capturing 2,700 frames per second .
The first test showed how the air inside a balloon is put under pressure when it is being blown up , and the molecules in the latex are stretched .
But when they cannot stretch any more the balloon 's latex tears itself apart .
Each piece shrinks , making a noise , if pieces move faster than the speed of sound .
In the second experiment , it can be seen how compressed air inside the balloon expands when it is popped , pushing smoke in one direction - similar to an explosion .
The programme returns on Mondays , 1930GMT from 15 March .

COMMUNISTS HIDE BEHIND RADICAL ENVIRONMENTALISM
& THE GREENS
By Dr. Laurie Roth
March 5 , 2010
NewsWithViews.com
The environmentalists ( with their various pet names ) pretend to have the last supply of empathy , caring and best intentions .
The ever evolving Green and environmental ‘ shape shifter ’ rushes in to save the planet from ruin .
We ca n’t forget the endless and desperate speeches by Al Gore about the horror of Global warming and its destruction of the planet .
We even saw how he was honored with the Nobel peace prize ….. right along with other notable brilliant ones , Yasser Arafat , the thief and anti Semitic terror in Chief of Palestine and Barack Obama , the messiah of hope and change .
Global warming fraud
We have all seen this last year the unraveling of data and real science regarding global warming .
The real scientific community and now media world has hailed it a complete failure and fraud .
I would even ad ‘ criminal ’ since the self appointed and honored messiahs of global warming and environmentalism were most happy to ignore the truth , real science and reality , taxing us and the world ( stealing ) to solve this mythological problem .
They were all most happy to control our money , what we eat , buy , grow , develop and herd just to solve the mythological crises .
Gee , it kind of makes you wonder if just controlling our lives , money and choices was what they wanted all along .
Close relative , The Greens
The Green movement , a close relative of control and horror boldly asserts to save the planet they must have ‘ sustainability ’ ( get used to less water , less food , less everything , defined as the Greens define it … )
They hide behind the usual , invented enemies such as urbanization , industrialization and our development because , evil achievers that we are ruin our air , contaminate our water and food .
We just hate people and have no regard for anyone .
I have interviewed a courageous expert in this area on my national radio show many times , Holly Swanson who wrote the leading book on this fraudulent and dangerous push , ‘ Set up and Sold Out . ’
In her in depth tracking of the Greens real agenda , she points out classic communism peppered through our schools , culture and politics .
The Greens even try to rewrite our Religions and faith to reflect the real worship priorities ….. that is , worshiping nature , not the living God .
The Green movement and view of a green revolution is total control over people , what we eat , drink , where we go , what we grow , what we spend and what we speak and believe .
People are in the way ….. we are numbers and widgets to be discarded or worse if we do n’t …..’ submit ’ and obey .
So far as we probe and dig through the global warming , environmental and Greens sewage we see nothing but a Saul Alinsky type vehicle on an international scale , to control every thing in people ’s lives , all in the name of saving animals , the dying environment and poor people in developing countries .
In truth , this well funded and controlled push is nothing but faced lifted communism and the same old Nazi party … wanting genocide .
It is n’t just Al Gore , Obama and other environmental gurus … .
It was used by Adolph Hitler with the Nazi party .

Hitler used to talk and write about the Jews and their alleged cruelty to animals .
He also built a case that the Jews felt they were above the law and nature and were addicted to capitalism and trying to pacify and control nature .
In Nazi thinking , the Jew was simply a threatening species totally messing up nature , their surroundings and animals .
They were the enemy of Social Darwinian evolutionary laws , thus the developing , national emergency to stop the unnatural and dreaded Jews .
Hitler was a poster child for ‘ Rules for Radicals ’ 101 .
We all know the rest of the story , except Amedinajad .
You know , that silly guy who says the Holocaust never happened and that Obama thinks as the right to go nuclear .
The Nazi party was ‘ green . ’
They were green and preaching all its tentacles of control and blame before they murdered massive millions of men , women and children .
Nazi leaders and many masses in Germany pretended they were doing the will of God even .
Could such abuse , controls and even murder happen again under the guise of environmental control ?
Let ’s look at how tyrants take control .
They develop a big crises to solve so they can reach into our lives and control from .
Along with the crises , they develop and point out enemies to demonize and destroy .
These classic vehicles of control include the environment , ( trees , parks , animals , food and water ) .
Castro in Cuba , Hitler in Germany and many more tyrants act like them want to only save the dying food and water supply while saving animals .
Always , certain groups , people , events and property ownership are in the way .
If you recall , Castro ran on ‘ change ’ helping the desperate poor and fixing his battered country .
Once in , he fixed it all right .
He sent out his henchmen and collected all the guns from people , then started stealing property and businesses from the people .
People so enjoy the change they rush to barely put together boats and drown in the ocean on the way to America .
If we are to survive the push of environmentalism and its evil this time , we must not allow any theft of ‘ cap and trade ’ and other environmental , property controlling and seizing bills to take control .
It is not too late to stop the genocide of the masses in our country by stopping the environmentalist and greens , dead in their tracks .
Already , we have seen with the Obama administration , Nepolitano and his czars , that people are considered all but numbers .
Cass Sunstein , Obama ’s regulatory czar wants hunting outlawed and animals to be able to sue people .
The enemy of our country is being renamed , from Islamic radicals and terrorists , to us domestic terrorists ….. returning vets , pro lifers , pro sovereignty folks , gun owners and Christians .
We are the new and growing danger to America as was revealed in the last , leaked Homeland security report .
Now , with Obama pushing a Cyber Security bill ( to control the Internet if there is a mystery crises declared ) , Council on Governors bill ( now he will talk directly with leaders of the states , thus controlling even deeper ….. assuming there is a crises of course )
Interpol has the right to zoom around our country and be above our laws ….. why ?

I pray that the world will never again allow something as unbelievably evil as the Holocaust to ever happen again .
In order to stop that danger , we must stop the organized and endless effort to turn people into ‘ sustainable ’ numbers that can be discarded at will and the worship of animals and nature .
Apple 's new iPad has helped to define the broader tablet market , even though it has yet to ship , according to research firm ABI Research .
The firm said Tuesday that shipments of tablet devices - defined as touchscreen interface devices measuring five to eleven inches with WiFi , video and gaming capabilities , will measure four million units in 2010 , and rise to 57 million units by 2015 , prodded along by the iPad .
" Apple 's iPad is not the first media tablet , " senior ABI Research analyst Jeff Orr said in a statement .
" But it does help define this new device category . "
According to the firm , the main focus of tablet devices will be for entertainment , and he said they will not replace laptops , netbooks , or mobile phones .
In addition , ABI said that it believes tablets will remain a , " premium or luxury product for wealthy industrialized markets for at least several years . "
The firm also believes that the iPad will help offer other tablet makers , especially smaller companies trying to bring new devices to market , exposure that could boost their sales .
" New entrants to this market are at a disadvantage since they lack the retail relationships and network operator agreements already built by the more mature vendors , " Mr. Orr said .
" Surprisingly , Apple may have done them a favor by raising the public profile of the whole media tablet category . "
Jeff Gamet and this reporter discussed similar ideas in the most recent episode of The Apple Context Machine podcast , published over the weekend .
Our comparison was to the boost that Apple gave USB with the introduction of the USB - only iMac .
USB had been around for some time before the iMac , but did not explode in after the iMac 's release , when electronics vendors rushed a barrage of USB devices onto the market .
ABI 's research suggests that iPad could have a similar effect on the tablet market , boosting awareness of and exposure to competing devices .

From Yahoo Sports ’ Dan Wetzel :
The International Olympic Committee allowed Miller to keep on his helmet a tribute to a cousin who died due to complications from leukemia .
Miller started in net against Switzerland here Tuesday with the phrase “ Matt Man ” painted on his Olympic mask as a tribute to Matt Schoals , who died in 2007 at age 18 .
“ Matt Man ” was the nickname Miller , 29 , used for Schoals .
“ It was n’t a violation of the IOC rules , ” said Dave Fischer , the Team USA spokesman .
An extensive research project has studied the effects of soccer on muscle strength , postural balance , bone mineral density and reflex response to a sudden push in the back among adult women and men .
Five scientific articles are now being published in Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports showing that regular participation in soccer increases both bone mass and bone density , causes a significant improvement in standing postural balance and improves muscle strength .
Together , these effects reduce the risk of falls and bone fractures .
The observed improvements in bone mineral density , strength and postural balance due to recreational soccer are of particularly interest for a large group of women but also for elderly men , says project leader Associate Professor Peter Krustrup , Department of Exercise and Sport Sciences , and continue " It is well known that the risk of falls and fractures increases with age as a result of weaker bones , poorer balance and attenuated ability to trigger rapid muscle force , but the present results suggest that soccer -- and possibly other ball games -- is an effective training method to reduce bone weakening that comes with increasing age . "
Better bones from soccer than from running
A 14 - week study in which women aged 20 - 47 years trained soccer twice a week showed marked increases in bone density in the left and right tibia .
Furthermore , soccer training showed an elevated mass of the calf muscle , greater muscle strength , and an improved balance .
A 16 - months training intervention for the same subject group showed that prolonged soccer training for untrained premenopausal women elevates whole - body bone mineral density .
The women who participated in the study had never played soccer before , implying that all can benefit from soccer .
Interestingly the short - and long - term training effects on bone mineral density were greater for the soccer players than for a similar group of runners and an inactive control group .
" During soccer training and games , the players perform many sprints , turns , kicks and tackles .
This combination of actions help achieve a variable bone impact that appears to provide a better stimulus to bone mineralisation than running , " explains project leader Peter Krustrup .
Little training required
Small - sided soccer games for 1 hour two to three times a week during 12 weeks for untrained men aged 20 - 40 years resulted in significant increases in muscle mass and leg bone mass , whereas no effects occurred for the inactive control group .
The postural balance was improved as well .
In a follow - up study on long - term effects of soccer for men , it was demonstrated that 64 weeks of training have an additional effect on both muscle mass and leg bone mineral density .
These effects were observed despite the fact that the training volume was reduced significantly .
After the first 12 weeks the training frequency was only 1.3 times per week , indicating that a relatively small amount of training can nevertheless affect bone strength in the longer term .
70 - year - old men as fit as 30 - year - olds
The research group has also examined muscle function and postural balance in a group of 65 - 75 year old men who have played recreational soccer most of their lives and compared the values with a group of men at the same age without specific training and a group of 30 - year - old untrained men .
" The research shows that 70 - year - old men , who have played soccer most of their lives on a recreational basis , have just as good a balance and rapid muscle strength as untrained 30 - year - olds and much better balance and muscle strength than their peers " says Peter Krustrup .
As an example , the untrained older men had more than twice as many falls in a one - leg balance test , compared to the soccer - trained older men and untrained young men .
About the project
Led by Professors Peter Krustrup and Jens Bangsbo from Department of Exercise and Sports Sciences , University of Copenhagen , 50 researchers from seven countries have studied the physical , psychological and social aspects of soccer and the results are remarkable .
A number of scientific articles from the project are published on 2 March 2010 later this month the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports will publish a special edition issue entitled " Football for Health " containing 14 scientific articles from the soccer project .
The research project has received funding from FIFA -- Medical Assessment and Research Centre ( F - MARC ) , The Danish Ministry of Culture , TrygFonden , United Federation of Danish Workers ( 3 F ) , The Danish Football Association , Team Denmark and The Danish Sports Confederation .
It ’s getting really annoying that young Americans continue disproving our theory that they are whiny , self - entitled stains on society .
Like Derrick Martin here , the 18 - year - old Georgian high school senior who battled to take his boyfriend to the prom , won , only to get kicked out of his parents ’ house because of all the media fracas .
Speaking of media fracas ?
The above interview .
Derrick ?
It ’s folks like you , and Constance McMillen , and Cynthia Stewart , who are our heroes .
Meanwhile , it ’s your your high school administrators that need educating — even Derrick ’s , whose school district says they ’re only letting him take a gay date because they do n’t have rules to prohibit it , and not because they “ approve ” of any particular “ lifestyle . ”
This was going to happen at some point , the Droid Eris has been rooted !
Unlike many of the rooted Android phones , the Eris already has a ROM ready for installation that we ’d written about a couple weeks back .
So , Eris users , if you ’re tired of waiting for Verizon ’s supposed update , then sit back , read through the instructions and get your # ( root ) on !
Where did this come from ?
Well XDA , of course !
Keep in mind , rooting your device voids your warranty .
Rooting is usually for those brave enough to possibly kill / brick your device .
If you ’re willing , or just plain do n’t care , than this guide is for you !
You can always stop by the thread over at XDA for step by step instructions if you ’d rather read than follow the video instructions , and possibly say , ‘ Hey , Dev , thanks ! . ”
For those of you who are n’t ready to root their device , all you have to do is wait till Mid-April , supposedly .
Last time Verizon sent out a OTA update to the Eris , some people had their whole devices wiped .
Now , that probably will not happen when the official 2.1 rollout starts , and you most definitely have to wipe your entire device if you do root , too .
With both my MyTouch , Hero , and Nexus One , I ’d rooted them all within the first week of having them , and have no complaints .
Then again , i know what to expect , buying the G1 when it was first available for preorder , and then rooting it in a very long , tricky way .
Rooting has come a long way , I tell you !
Besides the damn official unlocking of the Nexus One bootloader , ca n’t undo that one .. yet .
Their are both pros and cons to rooting , and for the most part , ROMs available to rooted devices are pretty bleeding - edge .
With the exception of the Sense ROM for the Nexus One , rooted ROMs can be somewhat unreliable , but it does n’t take long for the fellas over at XDA to whip up something awesome .
The choice is yours .
Have fun #ing !

So here ’s the situation .
We ’ve been through the second - worst financial crisis in the history of the world , and we ’ve barely begun to recover : 29 million Americans either can’t find jobs or can’t find full - time work .
Yet all momentum for serious banking reform has been lost .
The question now seems to be whether we ’ll get a watered - down bill or no bill at all .
And I hate to say this , but the second option is starting to look preferable .
The problem , not too surprisingly , lies in the Senate , and mainly , though not entirely , with Republicans .
The House has already passed a fairly strong reform bill , more or less along the lines proposed by the Obama administration , and the Senate could probably do the same if it operated on the principle of majority rule .
But it does n’t  and when you combine near - universal Republican opposition to serious reform with the wavering of some Democrats , prospects look bleak .
How did we get to this point ?
And should reform advocates accept the compromises that might yet produce some kind of bill ?
Many opponents of the House version of banking reform present their position as one of principle .
House Republicans , offering their alternative proposal , claimed that they would end banking excesses by introducing “ market discipline ”  basically , by promising not to rescue banks in the future .
Pets come in all shapes and sizes .
From Baxter the bulldog to Sally the Siamese , all pets have one thing in common :
They need your love .
But with hectic workdays , followed by busy evenings filled with after - school activities or errands , it ’s easy to forget your furry friend from time to time .
Adorable sweater wearing pug that looks a bit too depressed as it hangs around outside cafe Trieste in San Francisco .
Someone needs to give the little guy some love .

When President Obama did n't meet with the Dalai Lama during his October trip to Washington , it gave many the impression that human - rights promotion was not central to this administration 's foreign policy .
This impression needs to be promptly corrected .
While the U.S. accepts that Tibet is part of the People 's Republic of China , for decades our country has supported Tibetan autonomy , especially in culture and religion .
If the U.S. were to step back from this position , increased Chinese repression of Tibetans would likely follow .

At 22 , Jon Jones impressive both physically and mentally In latest win over Brandon Vera , Jones shows he ’s still working as hard as ever despite the hype
Hyoung Chang , Denver Post
BROOMFIELD , Colo . —
There 's no arguing that , at 22 years old , Jon Jones is one of the most impressive fighters competing in mixed martial arts .
The only part that is up for debate :
What about him impresses you most ?
The most - hyped fighter in the UFC added more fuel to the fire Sunday , dominating a talented and hungry Brandon Vera in a main event bout that was supposed to represent the toughest challenge of his career .
While on the surface it might have appeared an easy win for Jones ( 10 - 1 ) , plenty went into the fighter 's latest step up the light heavyweight ladder .
With so much focus on how he would handle a veteran fighter like Vera ( 11 - 5 ) , Jones admitted he was more emotional headed into Sunday 's fight than in any other fight .
" He was supposed to be the toughest fight of my career and it pushed me to the point where I was thinking about him all the time , " Jones said .
" He 's the kind of fighter that talks a lot of trash and I did n't appreciate it , so it was a little more personal for me to win this fight and win it in devastating fashion . "
But while Jones 's emotions were to win the fight emphatically , it did n't stop him from stepping back and making a logical assessment of his opponent 's style .
Jones wisely recognized that Vera 's greatest opportunity to win the fight would be when both fighters were standing .
So , rather than go for an electrifying knockout against a dangerous striker , Jones attempted a takedown in the first 10 seconds of the fight and took Vera 's strength away immediately .
" I bought a book that talked about fighting in your core and fighting a smart fight , " Jones said .
" Fighting Brandon Vera , I knew he 's a great striker and I was preparing for it .
" When I read that book I realized , there 's no need to strike in this fight .
I 've been a wrestler since I was 14 years old .
Why go out and have a Muay Thai fight with somebody who might be better than me ? "
It 's a humble way to approach a fight — especially for a fighter with such high expectations placed on him .
Off the top of UFC president Dana White 's head , only Tyson Griffin and B.J. Penn built as much hype early in their careers as Jones has .
White still is frustrated by the one loss on Jones 's record , as he believes Jones was improperly disqualified in a fight with Matt Hammill last December when he landed illegal elbows from the mount position .
" That one loss on his record drives me crazy , " White said .
" Every time he gets in the octagon and I see that one loss , it 's going to drive me nuts .
" He should have had a point taken away , not been disqualified .
The reason Hammill could n't continue in that fight was his shoulder , it had nothing to do with the illegal elbows . "
Despite all that 's been said and written about him , however , Jones 's desire to improve as a fighter has n't seemed to slow .
Widely regarded as an unorthodox and unpredictable fighter , Jones has built his style based on what he 's learned in the gym from instructors and what he 's taught himself using methods like YouTube .
While it 's known that Jones comes from a Greco - Roman wrestling background , he 's evolved that style into his own by combining it with moves he 's picked up from studying judo on the Internet .
" A lot of the moves I 'm performing are n't actually Greco - Roman , they 're judo , " Jones said .
" You ca n't use a trip in Greco - Roman .
I do n't have an official judo coach but I 've been , it sounds weird , getting on the Internet and watching a lot of Judo moves .
I take it seriously . "
After his latest victory , Jones is certainly worthy of a shot at the light heavyweight title in the near future , although White said Sunday he'd like to see him compete one more year before that happens .
With a 6 - foot - 4 frame and unbelievable strength , it 's likely that Jones 's physical attributes will receive most of the credit for his success .
But as Jones eluded to in his post - fight interview Sunday with Joe Rogan , it also was a series of veteran moves the young fighter made that helped him win the fight beforehand .
" Obviously , the hype is warranted , " White said .
" He 's a serious talent and he gets better every time .
He 's very motivated and he 's smart .
He 's going to do well . "

Who knew wine in a bag could be so… designer ?
functional ?
pretty ?
Or that a decanter could aerate and feed the wine right back into the bottle ?
Leave it to Danish company MENU to help us rethink the way we interact with our wine !
I love the the Wine Breather Carafe ~ which can be used either by attaching it to the bottle , and flipping it … then flipping it back into the bottle , OR serving it out of the carafe .
It ’s designed by Norm , idea and patent by Peter Orsig .
( Does n’t the shape remind you of those adorable Aladdin sake bottles ? )
Also fun is the Baggy Wine Coat designed by Jakob Wagner ~ wine in a bag never looked so ruggedly high tech .
Also cute in the new collection ~
Norm ’s stackable , spherical , tripod set for condiments !
So playful , they ’d be delightful in a restaurant !

High point 80,000 years ago may hint at flaws in ice - age theory .
Minerals deposited in caves flooded by the Mediterranean show sea-levels 81,000 years ago .
Tony Merino
Precise measurements of sea level from Mediterranean caves have revealed that about 81,000 years ago the seas stood much higher than previously thought — even higher than today 's levels .
The finding may force scientists to reconsider how Earth 's large ice sheets wax and wane in response to changing climate .
Changes in global sea level are used to trace the fluctuations of ice sheets .
As ice sheets advanced from a low - point around 125,000 years ago to a maximum around 20,000 years ago , sea level fell — although there was plenty of variation along the way .
125,000 years ago , seas stood roughly at today 's heights , whereas at the last glacial maximum , sea levels were 130 metres lower than at present .
But a group led by Jeffrey Dorale , a geologist at the University of Iowa in Iowa City , now suggests that 81,000 years ago the sea level increased sharply to reach a high - point , roughly one metre above today 's level1 .
" At face value this is a very beautiful and solid piece of work , " says Wallace Broecker , a geologist and climate scientist at Columbia University 's Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades , New York .
" It suggests that , for reasons unknown , the sea level which at the time should have been down some 15 metres instead went up one metre , and then went right back down again within just a couple of thousand years . "
Sea up , ice down
If Dorale 's measurements stand up to scrutiny , they also imply that glaciers and ice sheets receded dramatically over a very short period before starting to grow again at similar speed .
What triggered the melting , and what made glaciers start growing again , is unclear .
" It could all come down to an anomaly , caused by some complex feedbacks perhaps related to the global carbon cycle .
But we really do n't know , " says Dorale .
Measurements of past sea levels have been plagued by uncertainties — such as the extent to which tectonic movement has deformed Earth .
And sea level height around 80,000 years ago has been an issue of intense debate .
Previous reconstructions , based on the growth of coral reefs off Haiti , Barbados and New Guinea , suggested that the sea level then was 7–30 metres below its present value .
2
Dorale and his team dated layers of calcite , a mineral deposited in coastal caves on the Spanish island of Mallorca that were flooded when the sea level rose high enough .
Because tidal activity in the Mediterranean Sea is extremely low , and because there has been little tectonic movement in the region , the mineral encrustations are thought to reflect the mean sea level with unique accuracy .
Experts acknowledge the robustness of the team 's observations and dating methods .
But they caution that the inferred rates of sea level change will not be the last word on the issue .
" This is an exciting study that will certainly spur further work , " says Peter Huybers , a palaeoclimatologist at Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
" But it might be premature to draw definite conclusions on how rapidly the sea level has changed 80,000 years ago . "
The rhythm of ice
Dorale says that the timing of the sea level changes raises questions about what kind of climate change could have caused it .
Observations so far suggest that ice - sheet growth and decay in the past few million years happens on average to a 100,000 - year beat .
Temperatures and greenhouse - gas levels , measured from ice cores , also follow this long - term rhythm .
These cycles have been linked to the Milankovitch theory , which calculates how small changes in Earth 's orbit and axial tilt bring about a regular succession of cold and warm periods because they alter the intensity of sunlight reaching the Northern Hemisphere in summer .
3
Calculated sunlight variation comes in three rhythms — of 23,000 ; 41,000 and 100,000 years .
Although the 100,000 - year periodicity is weak , it seems to have dominated the most recent cycles , and has been used to explain observed sea - level and ice - sheet fluctuations .
The new discovery of rapid ice - sheet growth suggests that glacial cycles do not couple precisely with records of sunlight variation and greenhouse - gas concentrations , says Dorale .
" The variations in solar power seem too small to cause the large changes in ice cover that we know have occurred over the past 700,000 years , " he says .
One of the shorter periods of Milankovitch sunlight variation may also need to be taken into account .
ADVERTISEMENT
But Carl Wunsch , a physical oceanographer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge , thinks that the result brings no fundamental conflict with established ideas about long - term glacial cycles — which he says have always hovered rather widely around the 100,000 - year Milankovitch cycle .
Concluding that glacial cycles may arise because of climate fluctuations that are unrelated to long - term sunlight cycles would be a gross simplification , says Huybers .
" It 's tempting to conclude that the 100,000 - year cycle must now be reconsidered , " he says .
" But people have been arguing about glacial cycles and their length for a long time . "
In their single - minded quest to notch a political victory , Democrats in Congress late Sunday night enacted deeply flawed health care legislation that was propped up on misleading estimates and backroom deals — the repercussions of which will hurt this nation for years to come .
In Colorado , it ’s possible the bill ’s passage could cost a few key Democrats dearly come election time , and it could hurt the party overall .
Thankfully , however , Democrats in the House did not use the “ self - executing ” rule , which basically would have “ deemed ” that the bill had passed — without forcing an actual vote on the bill .
Many legal scholars claim the process is unconstitutional , and it almost certainly would have been devastating , politically , for the Democrats who pushed it through and for the country overall .
President Obama campaigned on reforming America ’s sick and costly health care system , and for the better part of the year , we were right there with him .
Our health care system needs help .
But this is a bad bill .
Not only are we disgusted by the slick politics and shady deals that helped seal the deal , the policies rooted in it are more than problematic and it will do little to bring down costs .
The Senate is now expected later this week to “ fix ” the main health care bill through “ reconciliation , ” which means they need only a simple majority vote .
But the bill approved Sunday night needs only the president ’s signature now .
We can only hope Congress actually cleans up the sleazy deals that weighed down the Senate bill .
The House finally was able to pass the bill because some representatives switched their earlier positions .
Colorado Congresswoman Betsy Markey caved to partisan interests and abandoned her initial principled opposition to flawed health care legislation .
Originally , Markey said the House bill did little to bring down the costs that already burden so many businesses and individuals .
And she was right .
So what ’s changed ?
Just a little arm - twisting and — poof — she ’s on board .
Like Markey , others in Congress switched their votes after seeing a preliminary Congressional Budget Office estimate on the bill ’s cost .
But as The Washington Post pointed out last week , the CBO ’s “ work is often more art than science , and although the forecasts that accompany legislation are always filled with uncertainty , this one contains more than most . ”
The CBO can only score the legislation it ’s given , and this legislation double - counts Medicare cuts and makes hopeful pronouncements .
Proponents say it cuts the deficit , but a huge chunk of that cut comes from the federal takeover of student loans , which lawmakers inexplicably jammed into the reconciliation bill .
The numbers just do n’t add up .
This is not a credible way to make policy , and it is no way to treat the American people .
America needs health care reform .
But we needed a bill that included a public option to provide some competition to insurance companies and to bring down costs .
Instead , we ’re left with a piece of transformational legislation that is so toxic and loaded with special deals , Democrats originally did n’t even want to vote for it .
Everyone , stop what you 're doing .
The day you 've been patiently waiting for has finally come .
That 's right , the Engadget app is now available for the Android platform ... totally free , of course .

It ’s just another ordinary day .
You feel the rumble in your stomach , and wander into the kitchen to find a healthy snack .
What you find when you enter may make you change your mind .
Gnats .
Those pesky little insects are flying around the fresh fruit and other areas in the kitchen .
This may be a result of fruit going bad , dirty dishes left in the sink , or from the trash can that needs to be emptied .
Gnats are drawn to the odors of rotting food .
They are also attracted to other warm and moist places , such as houseplants .
These are areas in which they lay their eggs .
Gnats multiply very fast , so it ’s best to take action right away .
Lucky for you , you may already have the answer in your kitchen pantry .
Vinegar .
Below are ways on how to use vinegar to get rid of gnats .
First of all , before you start , you ’ll want to make sure any old fruit is thrown out , and toss the garbage bag in the dumpster .
You ’ll also want to clean out your sink of dirty dishes , and wipe down counters that have crumbs on them .
Once you ’ve done a basic kitchen clean up , grab that bottle of vinegar .
A popular way to get rid of gnats using vinegar involves a small empty bottle .
Fill the bottle with vinegar , almost to the top .
Put the cap on securely , and poke a few holes in the cap .
Gnats are attracted to the vinegar , and will climb in .
Once they climb in , they wo n’t be able to get back out .
If the gnats are in more than one spot in the house , fill up several bottles and place them where they are collecting in groups .
Let these bottles sit for a few hours , then simply throw them out with the trash .
Repeat the process if needed .
If you do n’t have any spare empty bottles , you can also use small bowls .
You wo n’t be able to secure a lid very easily to a bowl , but do n’t worry .
In the bowl , mix the vinegar with some dish soap .
The gnats will once again be attracted to the vinegar , and climb into the bowl .
The dish soap causes the mixture to be sticky , in which case the gnats will get stuck and wo n’t be able to escape .
Again , let the bowls sit for a while and then empty and repeat if needed .
For gnats that gather near the drain of the sink , you can pour a little vinegar around the drain , as well as down the drain .
The gnats will gather around the vinegar , and you can simply rinse them down the drain with water .
If the gnats are collecting on surface areas such as counters , you can mix some vinegar in a spray bottle along with some warm water .
Simply spray the mixture on the counter top where the gnats are , and wipe them away with a paper towel .
Be sure to take the used paper towels out to the dumpster right away so they do n’t make their way back into the house .
This spray also works well on houseplants .
If the bottle or bowl trick does n’t capture all of the gnats that have gathered in or around houseplants , they can be cleared out by wiping the leaves with a paper towel that is damp with water and vinegar .
Gnats can be annoying little insects that can invade your kitchen and home very quickly .
It happens to every home eventually , no matter if you ’re a clean freak or not .
Just one piece of slightly rotted food item can attract gnats .
Luckily , you have the secret weapon in your kitchen .
You now know how to use vinegar to get rid of gnats .

The video of Yolanda and Theo Molemohi was shown to the court A father made a " farewell video " of his two children before strangling them after the breakdown of his marriage , a court has heard .
Petros Williams urged four - year - old Yolanda Molemohi and Theo , two , to say goodbye to their mother in the film , played to Manchester Crown Court .
Mr Williams ' wife Morongoe Molemohi , 30 , found the bodies of her children at his flat in Whalley Range last October .
The 37 - year - old denies two counts of murder .
The tape was among handwritten notes found at his flat .
The court heard it was labelled " Daddy , Yolly , Theo. Byee The End " with a note attached which read : " Play the video , made for your memories , thank you , Petros . "
I went to pick them up from under the duvet .
I thought they were sleeping
Morongoe Molemohi Mr Williams was said to be jealous that his wife had started to meet other men through internet dating websites .
Andrew Thomas QC , prosecuting , said the defendant even chose internet connection cables from the family computer to kill his children as a " symbolic act of punishment " to his wife .
He said : " The prosecution say it was a spiteful , selfish reaction to the breakdown of his marriage .
It was a deliberate act and the prosecution say this was murder . "
' Drastic action '
The video shows the children sitting in the living room with Mr Williams initially behind the camera before he joined them on the sofa and told them : " Say , ' bye Mummy ' . "
Mr Thomas said : " It is hard to say why the defendant made the video at the time and whether he had decided to take the drastic action he took two days later .
" The prosecution say that it was a sort of farewell video from the defendant and his children to the mother . "
The video was found at the Whalley Road flat , the jury heard Other notes found in the flat said : " Good things come to an end , bye Mo. Petros " , " I love you Theo and Yolanda .
You were great company , meet you in heaven .
Love Daddy Petros " and " Sorry My Lovely Yolly and Theo .
Sorry Mummy decided to leave us for a new boyfriend . "
The couple moved to the UK in 2002 and had lived in Whalley Road since 2004 but their marriage suffered difficulties and both had affairs , the jury was told .
Miss Molemohi also claimed she had been the victim of domestic violence .
She had moved out of the family home a week before the killings when Mr Williams told her he was no longer prepared to see her set up dates online while they lived together .
The children stayed with their father while Miss Molemohi travelled to get them ready for school and to put them to bed .
' Very alone '
On the morning of 15 October , Miss Molemohi went to the flat and found the children dead .
Mr Williams was arrested , the court heard .
" I went to pick them up from under the duvet .
I thought they were sleeping , " Miss Molemohi said .
Under cross-examination from Jeffrey Samuels QC , Miss Molemohi admitted she had no family in the UK and was isolated and felt " very alone " .
Mr Samuels asked her : " Did you in fact kill them , Miss Molemohi ? "
She replied : " I can not believe you are even suggesting that . "
" I did not kill my children , I would die for them . "
The case continues .

TONY JONES : Good evening , and welcome to Q&A .
Answering your questions tonight : the Federal Minister for Agriculture , Tony Burke ; mental health expert and Australian of the Year Patrick McGorry ; Rabbi Jacqui Ninio of Sydney 's Progressive Emanuel Synagogue ; the author of The God Delusion and the Greatest Show On Earth , evolutionary biologist and outspoken atheist Richard Dawkins ; Family First senator Steven Fielding ; and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition Julie Bishop .
Please welcome our panel .
And we 're also sending out best wishes to Sister Veronica Brady , who was going to be part of tonight 's panel but had to withdraw at the last minute due to ill - health .
Remember , Q&A is live from 9.35 Eastern Time .
Join the Twitter conversation with your comments .
If you have a question send it by SMS to 197 55 222 or go to our website , abc.net.au/qanda .
Let 's go straight to our very first question tonight .
It comes from Arthur Lith .
ARTHUR LITH :
It 's a question for Richard Dawkins .
Can one be a believer in God , as well as a believer in the theory of evolution ?
TONY JONES : Richard , we 'll start with you obviously .
RICHARD DAWKINS : First I want to say why am I the only one who is outspoken ?
TONY JONES : You want to be .
RICHARD DAWKINS : Obviously you can be a believer in God and in evolution , because the archbishop of Canterbury is , the Pope is - at least the previous pope was and the present pope almost is kind of there and so is any bishop , any archbishop , so is any cardinal , so is any priest worthy of the name .
So that is absolutely clear as an empirical fact .
It is easy to be both .
I find it slightly hard .
I have a certain niggling sympathy for the creationists , because I think , in a way , the writing is on the wall for the religious view that says it 's fully compatible with evolution .
I think there 's a kind of incompatibility , which the creationists see clearly but the archbishops and the bishops , nevertheless they 've see the evidence .
Anybody who 's seen the evidence knows that evolution is a fact and so you can't get away from it , but I think the writing 's on the wall .
TONY JONES : Evidently 40 per cent of Americans disagree with you and they can't reconcile their faith with the theory of evolution .
RICHARD DAWKINS :
The figure varies between 40 and 45 per cent and has done for about the last 30 years .
It 's an astonishing figure and that appears to be true .
Gallup polls seem to suggest that that is true .
It 's even worse than that , because they actually believe that the world is less than 10,000 years old and because since the true age of the earth is 4.6 billion years old , that 's a non-trivial error .
I 've previously compared it - I 've previously compared it to believing that the width of North America is eight yards .
TONY JONES : Steve Fielding can one be a believer in God , as well as a believer in the theory of evolution ?
STEVE FIELDING : Look , I 'm not an expert on these issues whatsoever and I think people in Australia have different beliefs and their faith may driver them one way or the other .
I actually believe in creationism .
I think the Prime Minister does as well , so I suppose at the end of the day each person will come to their own conclusion on the issue , Tony .
TONY JONES : You believe in creationism .
Because I 've never heard you state this , but it's a fact is that you believe in creationism not evolution .
Is that right ?
STEVE FIELDING :
That 's correct .
But , look , each person will come to their own conclusion and I ...
RICHARD DAWKINS : Well ...
STEVE FIELDING : ... you know .
TONY JONES : Richard , you 'd like to respond ?
RICHARD DAWKINS :
Do you believe the world is less than 10,000 years old ?
STEVE FIELDING : Look ...
RICHARD DAWKINS : No , do you believe that ?
STEVE FIELDING : Look , I think that there are a lot of questions in this area and I think people will come to their own conclusions .
I do n't want to force people into one way or the other .
RICHARD DAWKINS :
You 're not being asked to forced .
You 're not being asked to forced .
JULIE BISHOP : It 's either a new earth creationist or an old earth creationist , so which is it , Steve ?
RICHARD DAWKINS : So , you 're a young earth creationist , who believes the world is less than 10,000 years old .
You 're a parliamentarian in Australia , who believes the world you live in is less than 10,000 years old ?
STEVE FIELDING : I did n't say that , by the way .
You 're saying that I said it was 10,000 .
TONY JONES : Okay .
STEVE FIELDING : I did n't say that .
TONY JONES : Okay .
No , you did n't say that .
RICHARD DAWKINS : Do you ?
Do you believe it ?
TONY JONES :
It is an open question , though .
STEVE FIELDING : Look , I think ...
TONY JONES : Is that what you actually believe ?
STEVE FIELDING : Look , I think that the science today will discover more and more but I think that most Australians come to a view .
They either believe that we evolved or we came from creation and I think that , you know , people - you can believe whatever they like on that issue .
I 'm not trying to force that issue onto anyone , Tony .
TONY JONES :
So where did human beings come from ?
STEVE FIELDING :
Well , you may well ask this guy .
He 's got firm views on that perspective from there .
TONY JONES : Just in your view , I 'm just interested in , before we move on .
STEVE FIELDING : Well , as I said , I believe that people , you know , started from being created .
But , look , there are some other views out there about people evolving from other types of animals .
TONY JONES :
As in apes , for example ?
STEVE FIELDING :
Well , that 's what others - some believe that , yeah .
TONY JONES : Jacqui , let me bring you in here .
We 'll come back to that , Steve .
Your view : can one believe in evolution and still reconcile faith in God ?
JACQUELINE NINIO : Absolutely , and I think I 'm in very good company , as it turns out , with many religious leaders who believe that the science is pretty clear that , you know , we evolved but I think that there are still many unanswered questions , and I think we go to a big bang or whatever theory we start with and there 's always questions that we do n't have an answer to and I think for me I answer those questions with a divine being or a God .
Others will answer it in a different way , but I do n't think there incompatible at all .
TONY JONES : So your God is the person or the being which created the big bang which started the whole process and then stepped aside .
Is that the way it is ?
JACQUELINE NINIO : Yeah , in my mind God was involved somehow , somewhere .
There was something before the big bang and there are questions that we do n't understand .
There are still things we do n't know and for me my faith and my belief tell me that that was the role of God was involved there somewhere but , you know , I do n't think that negates the science and I do n't think that the story that we have in the Bible in any way negates all that we know in science .
I think as human beings struggling to understand and to make sense of our worlds , and I think we can learn a lot from the creation story in the Bible .
Not necessarily about how the world was created but good moral teachings and lessons about humanity and about the earth and the world and how we should treat each other and how we should treat the world .
TONY JONES : Tony Burke ?
Go back to the original question : can one be a believer in God as well as a believer in the theory of evolution ?
TONY BURKE : Oh , the simple answer to that is yes .
I should add I 've spent my whole political career avoiding ever making a comment on religion and you bring me here tonight .
Tonight !
TONY JONES : Welcome to our panel .
TONY BURKE : I can't for the life of me see where there 's a conflict there .
I just can't .
TONY JONES : Julie ?
JULIE BISHOP : Evolution and faith can and do co-exist and I think many scientists and theologians are able to reconcile their belief in evolution and the scientific fact and theory and also a belief in a higher being .
And , you know , I understand the evolution side of it .
You know , amino acids to proteins to molecules to cells to organisms and then to a creature that has the bring power to question its own origins .
That is man .
But as Pope Benedict did say , he said it 's absurd to suggest that these should be presented as alternatives .
That is evolution or faith and , in fact , they can co-exist .
They do n't have to exclude each other and who answers the imponderable question , " Well , where did everything come from originally ?
I mean , where did the original amino acid come from ? "
So I think there 's room for both and they have co-existed happily in Australia and will continue to do so .
TONY JONES : Okay .
There 's a question down the front .
I 'm going to come to you in a moment , but first of all we 've got a question that draws in Patrick McGorry and I 'm going to go to Dan Anderson first .
There 's Dan .
DAN ANDERSON : Professor McGorry , in your experience do you think that belief in a transcendent being or in the transcendent in general is part of normal , healthy human psychology or is it a symptom of mental illness ?
PATRICK MCGORRY : That 's obviously a trick question , right ?
TONY JONES : Do your best , Phillip .
PATRICK MCGORRY : Well , look , you know , I 've looked after a lot of people over the last 20 or 30 years who have had very significant psychiatric disorders and , you know , it 's quite common for religious themes to actually manifest within the context of their symptoms so , you know , religion and mental health do co-exist in that way but clearly , also , spirituality is an important part of positive mental health .
So I think there 's two sides to this coin and , you know , I think the question - we could talk about that for hours , really .
TONY JONES : Let 's go back to Richard Dawkins .
I mean , you refer to belief in God as " the God delusion " .
I 'm wondering whether you think that spirituality may have a positive psychological benefit , as the questioner implies ?
RICHARD DAWKINS : No , I do n't think it has a positive psychological benefit .
As to whether religious belief is a mental illness , I do n't think it 's fair to call it a mental illness because so many people actually do it .
On the other hand I think you could say that if you met one person , just one person , who claimed to believe some of the things that religious people as a whole claim to believe , you would think they were suffering from ( indistinct ) .
I mean it 's just because so many of them believe it that we treat it as normal .
But if you actually met somebody who said he believed that water could turn into wine , a man could walk on water , that a man could raise somebody else from the dead , you 'd say , " Well , put him away . "
But because so many people believe it , you take it seriously .
TONY JONES : Okay , I 'm told we 've got a question come in , a web question .
It 's from Cassandra Devine in Victoria .
It 's too Richard Dawkins : " Why do you feel the need to express your views so stridently when they 're not always welcome ?
Is n't it rather like going around to playgrounds and telling children that Santa Claus is n't real ? "
RICHARD DAWKINS :
In modern English vocabulary , it 's more or less impossible to use the word atheist without preceding it with the adjective strident .
They simply go together .
I am not strident .
I am not more strident than anybody else .
Now , is it like disillusioning children about Santa Claus ?
The weird thing is that children manage to grow out of Santa Claus and for some reason ...
TONY JONES : Let 's throw that to Jacqui , and the questioner says that questioning faith might be a bad thing ?
It might sort of cause people stop believing in Santa Clause or whatever .
JACQUELINE NINIO : I think we have - as people of faith , we have an obligation to question and to continually be understanding and reinterpreting and trying to find meaning within our tradition and I can say for myself that what I understand and believe about God now was not what I understood and believed about God when I was 10 and it's not what I understood when I was five it wo n't be what I understand when I'm 90 .
I think that it's an evolving process to understand God and what God is and how God is in the world , and I think ...
TONY JONES : Here 's the interesting thing : you keep reinterpreting God as you get older , by the sound of it .
Do you ever consider that perhaps God does n't exist ?
JACQUELINE NINIO :
No , I do n't , but there are those who do and I think for me my faith in God is quite strong but I think for many , many believers it 's very - of course you question the existence of God and that sometimes you may come to the position that God does n't exist and all kinds of things can happen in your life and in the world and the way you view things and there 's an amazing Jewish philosopher who said the second you start to define God , you already limit God .
God is un-understandable in some ways by humanity and so the second we try and grapple with it , we 're already limiting what God is .
I think that there 's an unfolding understanding of God as you change and as the world changes and all we can do as human beings is to approach it from where we are and from our understanding and what we know in that moment .
TONY JONES : Now , before we come to our questioner down the front who had his hand up , Richard , do you regard that as just clever sophistry ?
RICHARD DAWKINS : I was wondering what on earth it meant , I must say .
JACQUELINE NINIO : I preferred clever sophistry , myself .
TONY JONES : Okay .
We do have a question down the front here and I 'm going to go to you .
You had your hand up .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Yes , my question is for Professor Dawkins .
Given that your previous role at Oxford University was about , you know , propagating the knowledge of science to the public , which I think you 've done excellently with , you know , the Great Australian Earth and also the BBC documentary that you did were you , you know , exposed the stupidity of homeopathy and so called eastern medicine , do n't you think it would have been prudent to stick on that sort of line as opposed to driving a wedge between religious people and science ?
I mean , in my opinion what you 've sort of done , probably inadvertently , is create a situation whereby people like Steve , who are actually in control of , you know , whether our country has an emissions trading scheme , you know , believing in climate change or not have to question science over their faith .
Would n't it be better to separate the two issues completely and just say , " This is science .
This is evidence .
You know go out and make the best decisions that you can based on fact and what you , you know , believe in your own personal life should be completely separate " ?
RICHARD DAWKINS :
It 's a familiar line of argument and I 've met it often .
I think it 's - that was n't supposed to be a put down .
It 's a genuinely difficult question .
It 's a question of political expediency .
The implication of your question is that there 's something about religion which is personal and which does n't have any bearing - that evidence does n't have any bearing upon it .
Now , as I scientist I care passionately about the truth .
I think that the existence of a supreme being - a supernatural supreme being - is a scientific issue .
Either there is a God or there is n't .
Either there are gods or there are no gods .
That is a ...
AUDIENCE MEMBER : ( Indistinct )
RICHARD DAWKINS : Yes , because it's a supremely important scientific question .
If the universe was created by an intelligence , then we are looking at an entirely different kind of scientific theory from if the universe came into existence by natural means .
If God or gods had something to do with the creation of life , then we 're looking at a totally different kind of biology .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : How so ?
RICHARD DAWKINS :
So I think you can't just say religion and science have nothing to do with each other .
Science can get on and you let people have their own religious - of course you let people believe whatever they like .
But you cannot say that science and religion are completely separate because religion makes scientific claims .
It certainly makes scientific claims about miracles , as I mentioned before , and you cannot reconcile an authentic approach to science with a belief in miracles or , I suspect , with a belief in supernatural creation .
At least the very least you should say is that this is a scientific question .
TONY JONES : Okay .
No , I 'm sorry , I 'm going to interrupt you there , because we 've got lots of questions .
You 're watching Q&A .
Remember you can send us your web or video questions to our website .
The address is on your screen .
But our next question tonight comes from in the audience and it's from Renee Brasier .
RENEE BRASIER : Professor Dawkins , you are clearly against the teaching of creationism in the context of the science classroom , but do you think there is any value in teaching religion studies in schools ?
TONY JONES : I wo n't start with you , if that 's okay .
I might go to Tony Burke first of all for an answer to that and I 'll come back to you .
TONY BURKE : I think on the teaching of religious studies there is a significant role there for parents as to whether or not they want that to be one of the things that 's taught to their children .
I agree with the comment that religious teaching does not belong in the science room .
I do agree with that but I also think , that there 's significant issues for parents .
Some parents want their children to have a religious education .
Some what their children to have a religious education that exposes them to a whole range of different faith belief systems and some do n't want to go there at all and I actually reckon that 's personal enough for parents to have a significant say in that .
TONY JONES : Let 's go to Julie Bishop , because I want to hear , as I said , from the three politicians before we go to the rest of the panel .
JULIE BISHOP : Tony , you might recall there was a debate earlier this year when it was suggested that the Bible should be taught in schools and there was quite a controversy about it .
I happen to believe that the Bible is one of the all time best sellers .
That 's a fact .
And it is the basis of so much western morality and thought and history and law and western culture and literature and it does n't have to be taught in religious classes .
It could be taught academically along with - - -
TONY JONES :
What about is science classes ?
JULIE BISHOP : Well , along with the works of Shakespeare and the Iliad .
But , no , I believe that intelligent design is not something that would be taught in a science class .
I mean science , as far as I 'm concerned , is the search for the natural causes of universe and that 's what science should be about .
We do n't have intelligent design classes as such in Australia , as far as I 'm aware in the curriculum , but I think that it should be open to parents and open to schools to choose to offer religious instruction if that 's what the schools and the parents wish to have .
TONY JONES : Steve Fielding , they do n't have it in many schools , but they do have it in the school associated with your church , where they do teach creationism , Waverley College .
STEVE FIELDING : Look , different schools teach different things .
There 's Jewish schools , there 's Christian schools , there 's all sorts of schools .
Look , I actually think religion and science are separate .
I do n't think they should be taught in science , no .
TONY JONES : I noted - I looked at the website of Waverley College .
It has a slogan that says , " All your children will be taught by the Lord . "
What does that mean exactly ?
STEVE FIELDING : Look , it may be that you 've read more than I have , Tony , but , look , at the end of the - look , for example , I mean my faith if personal .
I do n't think I 've ever really come out and spoken about it .
It 's the media that have quizzed me more on it than I 've actually gone out and actually spoken on it .
In actual fact I first met the Prime Minister when I was first elected and it's funny , you know , he sat there , pulled out his Bible out of his top pocket and started to lecture me and give me a sermon and I thought , that 's interesting .
I 've never done that to anyone and here 's the Prime Minister , first meeting , never met the guy , he pulls out his Bible .
He 's probably still got it in his top pocket , I think .
But look , it 's not - I think it 's very personal and I think that , look , I 've got my decision making - my core decision - making team .
I have a Jew and an atheist .
I think you should be making policy on common sense and what is best for Australia .
I do n't think that , you know , Australians like the idea of having it driven by religion and that is the truth , Tony .
I 've never raised the issue .
It 's very personal to me .
I 've never gone out and done what Kevin Rudd 's done - meet someone for the first time ...
TONY JONES : Okay .
Okay .
STEVE FIELDING : ... and pull out the Bible and lecture them .
TONY JONES : I 'm going to interrupt you , because once again we 've got a web question on this subject .
It 's from David in Victoria : " Do you believe intelligent design should be part of the science curriculum , taught alongside evolution or do you believe it is non-scientific and should be relegated to the rubbish bin ? "
And while you 're talking Steven Fielding , we 'll go to you first ?
STEVE FIELDING :
What was the question ?
Sorry ,
Tony , I missed it .
I was thinking about ...
TONY JONES :
The question was about whether intelligent design should be taught in the science curriculum ?
STEVE FIELDING : Look , I actually think that kids are pretty smart and I actually think that there 's room , potentially , to be actually taught both and allow the kids to work it out .
You know , I mean , I think they 're pretty smart .
TONY JONES : Not in the science room .
I said before Tony .
So in the science room , I 've told you before , and I 'll say it again , religion and science should be separated .
I do n't think there 's room for that and that 's why I 'm saying is that , you know , if you really - if parents are concerned then maybe the schools should teach both , but not in the science class , if you know what I mean .
I think kids can work it out themselves with their parents themselves from there , but I do n't think it should be in science at all .
I 'll make it quite clear .
Religion and science are two separate issues .
TONY JONES : All right , Richard Dawkins , is that a compromise that you 're comfortable with ?
RICHARD DAWKINS :
Well , I 'd like to answer the previous question , which was , after all , put to me .
TONY JONES : Yeah , of course you may .
RICHARD DAWKINS :
Which was : do we think that religion should be taught in schools not in science classes ?
Of course it should not be taught in science class , but it certainly should be taught .
Religion is a very important part of our culture .
As Julie Bishop has said , it 's a very important part of literature .
She also said it 's important for our morals and goodness sake I hope we do n't get our morals from it .
JULIE BISHOP : No , I did n't say that .
No , I said it 's a basis for western morality and thought .
RICHARD DAWKINS :
Well , I very much hope it is not the basis for western morality .
JULIE BISHOP : But it has been .
I mean , that 's a fact .
RICHARD DAWKINS :
It is the basis for a lot of western literature and for that reason it 's very important to teach it .
You ca n't understand European history without being steeped in religion , because so many of the wars were about it .
There 's another very good reason for teaching religion , comparative religion , which is that children will then learn that there are lots of different religions and they 're all incompatible and they can't all be right and so what is , I think , actually rather wicked is taking children who are too young to know and teaching them , " You belong to this religion " .
" You belong to - you 're a Catholic , " or " You 're a Muslim , " or whatever it might be .
That I think it wicked .
What you should say is , there are people called Catholics and they believe this .
There are people called Protestants .
There are people called Muslims who believe that .
People called Jews who believe the other .
That 's important .
That 's worth teaching .
Let children make up their minds when they 're old enough but do n't tell children that they belong to this religion or that .
TONY JONES : Jacqui ?
Jacqui , let 's hear from you and bear in mind that I think you heard Julie Bishop , former education minister , suggest that teaching of the Bible in schools might be a good idea .
I mean are you - I mean , I suppose it depends whether we 're talking about Old Testament or New Testament from your point of view .
JACQUELINE NINIO :
Yeah , I think that there are many , many religious beliefs and I think it 's really important maybe for some of the reasons that Richard suggested to be able to let people know the beliefs of various religious communities and I think that it 's really important in order to breakdown the misunderstanding and the prejudice and the division that happens between people when instead of seeing actually the differences between religions that teaching about them can actually find a lot of commonality , as well , and a lot of places where we do agree and we - and we do see things in the same way .
But not just teaching religion .
I think we should be teaching other moral basis of thought and other philosophy , as well , and I think on the point of not telling your children what religion they are , I think we have an obligation as parents .
We are raising our children .
We are making decisions for them all the time and I think this is ...
TONY JONES :
Are you at all worried that in religious schools children get indoctrinated , which I think is one of the points Richard was making ?
JACQUELINE NINIO :
Well , I do n't want to speak for all religious schools but the ones I know I do n't feel they 're indoctrinated .
I think there 's a very - well , I do n't know .
The ones that I know , there 's a very healthy spirit of questioning and a lot of opening for children to , you know , to question what 's going on and to question belief and to ask - and to not necessarily follow their parents .
And , you 're right , if they come to an age and a time when they decide that that philosophy or that religion is not for them then they 're not going to remain part of it .
But I think , you know , as a parent , I want to be giving my child a firm foundation in my beliefs ( indistinct ) .
TONY JONES :
All right , let 's hear what Patrick thinks about this .
Teaching religion in schools , are you comfortable with it ?
Are there limits ?
Where do you set them ?
PATRICK MCGORRY : I thought you were going to let me off the hook , Tony .
TONY JONES : No , we want to explore who you are .
PATRICK MCGORRY : Yes .
Yes .
Well , look , I very much agree with what Jacqui and Richard have been saying about the value of teaching comparative religion .
I 've seen that in my own children .
They went to a nominally religious school of one particular domination , but it was extremely liberal and they certainly did n't teach any religion in science classes .
They taught it in a comparative religion way .
My youngest son learnt a lot about Islam through that process and really noticed the common features , actually , with other major religions .
So I thought that was really valuable for him to do that .
But I certainly do n't think that intelligent design should be taught anywhere , really .
TONY JONES : Okay , you 're watching Q&A , the live and interactive forum where you get to ask the question .
Our next question comes from in the audience .
It 's from Hamzah Qureshi .
HAMZAH QURESHI : My question is for Professor Dawkins .
Considering that atheism cannot possibly have any sense of absolute morality , would it not then an irrational leap of faith , which atheists themselves so harshly condemn , for an atheist to decide between right and wrong ?
RICHARD DAWKINS : Absolute morality - the absolute morality that a religious person might profess would include what , stoning people for adultery , death for apostasy , punishment for breaking the Sabbath .
These are all things which are religiously based absolute moralities .
I do n't think I want an absolute morality .
I think I want a morality that is thought out , reasoned , argued , discussed and based upon , I 'd almost say , intelligent design .
Can we not design our society , which has the sort of morality , the sort of society that we want to live in - if you actually look at the moralities that are accepted among modern people , among 21st century people , we do n't believe in slavery anymore .
We believe in equality of women .
We believe in being gentle .
We believe in being kind to animals .
These are all things which are entirely recent .
They have very little basis in Biblical or Quranic scripture .
They are things that have developed over historical time through a consensus of reasoning , of sober discussion , argument , legal theory , political and moral philosophy .
These do not come from religion .
To the extent that you can find the good bits in religious scriptures , you have to cherry pick .
You search your way though the Bible or the Quran and you find the occasional verse that is an acceptable profession of morality and you say , " Look at that .
That 's religion , " and you leave out all the horrible bits and you say , " Oh , we do n't believe that anymore .
We 've grown out of that . "
Well , of course we 've grown out it .
We 've grown out of it because of secular moral philosophy and rational discussion .
TONY JONES : Tony Burke ?
The follow up question , I suppose , is from where do you derive your sense of morality ?
Is it from the Bible or is it from some sort of humanist principles ?
TONY BURKE : Okay , you 've now got me where I did n't want to be .
I guess for me and Richard can say it 's cherry picking , the concept a couple of thousand years ago from a bloke who my faith follows that says even if someone is your enemy you ought to love them , for me that 's a fundamental part of how people should interact with each other ideally .
Fundamental .
And I reckon a lot builds from that and some of the principles that build from that are n't that different from the best humanist principles that Richard wants to cherry pick .
But I 've got to say if you want to look at the worst that people have done in history , you can find religious examples and you can find atheist examples .
I do n't think Mao Tse Tung 's China during the cultural revolution as an atheist regime or Stalin 's Russia are great examples of morality either .
People have done some shocking things in human history , sometimes in the name of religion .
Sometimes in the name of whatever other division they could find but to say that that 's an argument against religion , I do n't think matches the level of logic that Richard 's demanding of everyone else .
RICHARD DAWKINS : I ...
TONY JONES : Can I just interrupt you there because what was raised by Tony Burke was obviously the sermon on the mount , the beatitudes , which does provide a kind of moral template for a lot of people .
I mean , turn the other cheek , love your enemy as yourself , blessed are the peacemakers , blessed are those who are persecuted because they stand up for what 's right , et cetera , the meek shall inherit the earth .
Those are principles you could take as a humanist as moral principles , are they not ?
RICHARD DAWKINS : I 'm delighted to cherry pick those .
Jesus said some wonderful things and the sermon on the mount is terrific .
Modern morality goes back to that and says , yes , that 'll do .
That 's very good .
The Mao Tse Tung point , of course , is religious .
TONY BURKE :
And every religious war is not .
Come on .
RICHARD DAWKINS : No , the difference is this : we are not counting up the number of good things and bad things that have been done by people who happen to be religious or who happen to be atheist .
We 're looking at whether there are religious or atheistic motives for doing good or bad things .
Is there a logical pathway that leads from religious faith to doing bad things ?
Sure as hell there is .
Is there a logical pathway that leads from atheism to doing bad things ?
No , you can not make a logical pathway that way .
Nobody would ever say , " Because I 'm an atheist I 'm going to kill somebody . "
You could very well say , " Because I am a Christian I 'm going to go and kills Muslims . "
" Because I 'm a Muslim I 'm going to go to kill Christians . "
This is something that 's happened throughout history .
Nobody has ever said , " Because I 'm an atheist , I 'm going to go and kill somebody . "
TONY JONES : Okay , we 've got a questioner down the front here and just wait a moment , we 'll come to you straight away .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Professor Dawkins , thanks for your presence here .
I think there 's a very obvious flaw in the logic that you 've used there .
You seem to conveniently forget that many of the wars that have been fought in recent years and see , indeed , the most controversial ones , they have been this direct result of the desire to spread these values of capitalism , these values of democracy , which essentially are exactly what you 're against in one way , shape or form .
So whether it 's spreading democracy or spreading capitalism or any of these ways of life or a few decades before spreading communism or whatever , it has to be faced up to that these ideologies were what people used to advance wars , to advance persecution and oppression .
So how can you possibly say that it 's only in the name of religion that these sorts of acts have been done when ...
RICHARD DAWKINS : No , I never said ...
AUDIENCE MEMBER : ... clearly the reality is the exact opposite .
RICHARD DAWKINS : I never said that .
There are plenty of other ideologies .
Ideology is what motivates people to do these things , not atheism .
Communism could well motivate .
Nazism motivated people to do these terrible things .
These are things that people believe as a matter of faith , not religious faith in that case but faith , whereas atheism is not that .
TONY JONES : Okay .
I 'm going to go now to another question from the audience .
It 's from Andrew Kollington .
ANDREW KOLLINGTON : My question is to Senator Fielding .
You 're courageously open about your religious and moral beliefs .
As a believer in God , do you accept the Bible as the word of God and those who participate in homosexual behavior ought to be shunned or be put to death as the Bible demands ?
Or do so called ' moderate Christians ' simply choose to ignore the word of God in this case , picking what passages they feel best suit our social trends of the day ?
STEVE FIELDING : Look , I 'm certainly not fearful of gays , as someone said just the other night , I think , on 60 minutes .
But , look , I do n't think gays should be shunned or put to death .
That 's just a joke .
That is just absolutely insulting .
It 's actually - I find it , you know , really offensive for that to even be even thought of .
TONY JONES : But it is ...
STEVE FIELDING : But I 'm just is I find that ...
TONY JONES :
It is ....
STEVE FIELDING : Not you yourself ...
TONY JONES : Those penalties ...
STEVE FIELDING : ... but just the question , you know .
TONY JONES : Those penalties are actually cited in the Bible .
I think that 's the point he was making .
STEVE FIELDING : Yeah .
Look , I actually do n't believe in that at all , so that gives you ...
RICHARD DAWKINS : Well , why not ?
I mean , it 's the Bible .
How do you decided then ?
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Senator , do you find God offensive ?
JULIE BISHOP : I was just saying the Bible is a text some 2000 years old .
You 've got the Old Testament which , you know , the stories in the Old Testament are fascinating .
They are intriguing .
The new testament tells the story of a man who tried to do good things and who began this movement of Christianity that is still with us today .
He must have been an outstanding person , let 's face it .
But the beautify of the psalms , the message behind the parables , does n't mean that you have to be absolutely wedded to each word .
It means that there were messages there that live through the ages and I do n't have any difficulty with the New Testament at all in that regard .
But it does n't mean that I live my life according to every single chapter of the New Testament .
TONY JONES : Let 's hear a brief response from Richard Dawkins ?
RICHARD DAWKINS : The New Testament - you believe , if you believe in the New Testament , that God , the all powerful creator of the universe could n't think of a better way to forgive humanity 's sins than to have himself put on earth , tortured and executed in atonement for the sins of humanity ?
What kind of a horrible , depraved notion is that ?
JULIE BISHOP : You know , can I just say one thing ?
TONY JONES : Yes .
JULIE BISHOP :
You know what disturbs me about this debate and that is that people should respect other people 's views .
Now , the neo-creationists say that there 's no scientific theory or fact and they deny it and the neo -Darwinists deny that there 's faith or religion .
Let 's show some respect for different people 's views and then I think the debate will be perhaps much more pleasant .
RICHARD DAWKINS :
What is wrong - when you say - you 're implying I did n't show respect .
JULIE BISHOP : No , I 'm saying that what disturbs me about this debate and we see it often is that there are extremes .
And whenever I see extremes I 'm concerned .
RICHARD DAWKINS : But the extreme is in the New Testament .
I simply told you what is New Testament doctrine .
That is St Paul 's view , which is accepted by Christianity .
That 's why Christ came to earth , in order to atone for humanity 's sins .
If it 's extreme , it 's not me that 's being extreme , it 's the new testament that 's being extreme .
TONY JONES : No , well , I 'm going to jump in here , because is that not a story of sacrifice and therefore has something admirable attached to it which is the opposite of what you suggested ?
RICHARD DAWKINS :
Do you think it 's admirable ?
You think it 's admirable that God actually had himself tortured for the sins of humanity ?
TONY JONES : That is the Christian view obviously .
RICHARD DAWKINS : That is the Christian view .
If you think that 's admirable , you can keep it .
TONY JONES : Okay .
Tony Burke , first of all , quickly ?
TONY BURKE : I do n't think your ridicule of people 's faith is much better than what you 're criticising .
I really do n't .
RICHARD DAWKINS : But I just stated it .
I did n't ridicule it .
I simply stated it .
TONY BURKE : No. No. No. No. Sorry , if you go back over the words you used , once you 're stating it you did then ridicule it .
You did .
And if you want to look at the challenges and the conflicts and making a community around the world work together , then the level of respect that so many religions have not shown for each other absolutely needs to be lifted and your level of respect and tolerance could probably be a bit better too .
RICHARD DAWKINS : Let me answer that .
Let me answer that .
I did not more than state the Christian doctrine and Tony then said , " That is the Christian doctrine .
Is n't it admirable . "
People said , " Yes , it 's admirable . "
So how is it disrespectful if I simply state what it is and half the audience think it 's admirable ?
What 's disrespectful about stating it ?
TONY BURKE : Press rewind , hear your own words .
You have changed them .
TONY JONES : Okay .
RICHARD DAWKINS : I have not .
TONY JONES : I 'm sorry , I 'm going to bring in our other panellists quickly to respond to this and we 'll start with Patrick .
Your thoughts ?
PATRICK MCGORRY : Well , I find the whole discussion a bit frustrating , I 've got to say , because I 'm a minister in the real world .
This is very intellectual stuff , you know .
I 'm thinking about the people that are being tortured these days , you know , and , you know , what 's happening to them and so I think - and it's on a whole lot of different bases .
I would say ideology rather than faith is the driver of it .
You could say faith is a kind of ideology , as Richard probably agree with that .
That 's the problem and we 've got , you know , millions of people around the world that are still suffering these days .
Slavery only went out about 100 years ago .
We 've still got torture .
All of these social evils are still with us .
So what are we doing about it ?
I 'd like to talk about more practical things .
That 's my tendency .
TONY JONES : Okay .
Well , we do have a - we 've got a lot of people with their hands up .
We do have a question which relates to one of your practical interests , and it comes from Dennis Colombo .
Question nine .
Where 's Dennis ?
DENNIS COLOMBO :
It 's a different kind of question , Tony .
My question is both political parties , the Coalition and Labor , have been severely criticised about their handling of the boat people asylum seekers .
I 'm wondering if the non-politicians and the audience have got some insight into how they think we should go about it and perhaps lead us in a fresher direction .
TONY JONES : Patrick , let 's start with you on this .
PATRICK MCGORRY : Well , this is a subject very close to my heart .
I 've worked with asylum seekers and refugees since the late eighties and ...
TONY JONES :
And you 've been scathing about immigration detention practices .
PATRICK MCGORRY : I think I 've seen the situation deteriorate in Australia since that time .
At that point in the 1980s we had a very positive international reputation for looking after refugees and dealing with them in a very humanitarian way and the whole situation deteriorated quite significantly in the last 20 years .
We 're starting to dig ourselves out of that hole now and I am worried that we 're - in the context of the political debate , we might be going to do a u-turn backwards again .
So I am concerned about that , particularly from a mental health point of view , because the two things we know about the people that are coming to Australia and seeking asylum are 90 per cent of them are genuine refugees and 50 to 60 per cent of them have been through very extreme experiences .
They are not only the most courageous people , but they also are extremely vulnerable and traumatised .
So the one thing we have to do as a country is not add insult to injury and make that worse , and there are two things that do that : prolonged uncertain detention .
And I 'm not saying mandatory detention is n't necessary for certain purposes .
Brief detention is quite warranted for health and safety checks .
And the second thing , and this is the thing I have most clinical experience with was the effect of temporary protection visas on people .
That was just an absolutely devastating experience for people .
TONY JONES :
Well , let me ask you this , because the question that 's being raised now is whether this government has actually shifted the problem offshore - effectively outsourced it so that the same people who were put in detention in Australia are now largely being kept in detention funded by Australia and in detention centres built by Australia dollars in Indonesia ?
PATRICK MCGORRY : Well , I 'm just going to stick with the health focus here .
The key thing is to make sure that mental health and health facilities are available to them .
That 's the key issue with the offshore issue .
Do they have access to proper mental health care and other types of health care in the locations they are being maintained .
TONY JONES :
Do you fear that they may not ?
PATRICK MCGORRY : I 'm not sure about that .
I think there are processes to try to ensure that happens , but I have n't been to the offshore detention centres , so I can't answer it definitely .
TONY JONES : Okay , let 's go to Julie Bishop on this .
There 's been a fair bit of talk about this recently .
In fact , the Opposition has pretty much accused the government of shifting the focus of this detention of asylum seekers back to Indonesia and putting the problem in their lap .
JULIE BISHOP : Well , our concern is that the government weakened the border protection laws and has essentially said to Indonesia , " This is now your responsibility to sort it out . "
The Prime Minister actually rang President Yudhoyono and asked him to intercept a boat that was heading to Australia and asked him to intervene and take it to Indonesia 's shores and then essentially said to Indonesia , " It 's your problem . "
Same with the Oceanic Viking .
There is nothing humane about a policy that encourages people to go to people smugglers , puts them aboard leaky boats and sends them across the seas .
We know that there are 105 Afghanis who were on boat last November coming down from the north and have n't been seen since .
We do n't know how many other situations there are like that , so there 's nothing humane about the people smuggling trade .
What we need to do is ensure that Australia meets its obligations to be a humanitarian - a good humanitarian country and we do take our share of humanitarian refugees under an organised program , but we must also ensure that the integrity of our borders are such that we do n't have people arriving by boat in circumstances which causes death and injury ,
TONY JONES : Very briefly , the logic of that would be to keep them in detention centres in Indonesia , which have been outsourced and built by the Australian Government .
JULIE BISHOP : Well , working with the transit countries and working with the source countries to ensure that they do n't get into the hands of the people smugglers .
TONY JONES : Tony Burke ?
TONY BURKE : I think the point that we need to discourage seriously people smuggling is inarguable .
There 's no argument against that .
You have a situation and Julie 's referred to more recent example .
I remember all the discussion following SIEV -X .
People drowned on the way here and that 's not the way we want people to get here .
It 's also the case that the solution is not , once people get here , to treat them pretty cruelly and say , " Oh , there you go .
We found a deterrent . "
And under temporary protection visas what we said to people was - Australia said to people was , " Even if you 're found to be here genuinely , even if you have ticked every box in being a true refugee , we 're not going to give you any certainty possibly ever , and that brought down mental health consequences which were n't in their interest , were n't in Australia 's interests and I really hope the opposition is not serious about wanting to bring them back .
TONY JONES : Can I just ask you this .
How do you know the same things are n't happening in detention centres in Indonesia , where you have no control but simply provide funding ?
TONY BURKE :
What they are there in place of is the camps which , in terms of living conditions , the camps that people have been waiting on , whether it be Lombok or elsewhere , have not been good situations .
The fact that Australia is helping Indonesia with the people who are there is a better situation than what was happening prior to our assistance .
TONY JONES : Let 's hear from Jacqui Ninio .
I mean , interesting question for you , I think , because are there parallels here with the 1930s and what happened with Jewish people who desperately tried to find third countries to take them and they simply were n't allowed in any of these places ?
They were kept in camps .
Sometimes they just could n't get anywhere .
They could n't find a port that would take them ?
JACQUELINE NINIO : Absolutely , and I think the telling thing is that , you know , the statistic that 90 per cent of the people who are coming are genuine refugees - they 're people escaping and fleeing the most horrendous situations and we are so blessed and so lucky to be here and I understand also the need for health checks and for security checks , but really it needs to be done in the most humane way possible for these people who have been through so much already just to give them a home and a place and we have enough space .
We have enough room and they 're each human beings and I think that we need to be reaching out to them and to bring them in in the most - the best possible way , I think .
TONY JONES : Steve Fielding , let 's hear from you .
I mean , Family First - I can remember when you first came to parliament , Family First had quite a strong position that people were being poorly treated in detention centres .
That seems to have evolved , if I may say that .
STEVE FIELDING : Yeah , look , it certainly has and , look , Family First realises that our vote is going to be crucial on this issue .
I think it is going to come up in parliament , I think probably before the election .
I went to Christmas Island this year .
The Rudd Government was able to get me there , which was good , and I spoke to some of the boat people or asylum seekers fresh off one of the boats .
I asked them , " Did you pay any money ? " - and this is not the driving force here - and they said , " Yes , about $ 8000 and another 20 on the way . "
Now , I said , well , how many actually make it to Australia . "
And out of a hundred about 20 get through .
And I thought , blimey , that 's a lot of people that people smugglers are playing on people 's minds .
Some get detained and some are actually killed along the way and some actually die along the way that nobody hears about .
Now , this is a real issue .
I voted - my record on this is pretty strong .
I voted against some of the Howard Government changes .
I look at this issue seriously .
I voted against some of the Howard Government issues .
My vote was crucial .
He withdrew the bill from parliament .
Would n't even have the guts to bring it into parliament , because I said I was n't going to vote for it .
Now , that 's ...
JULIE BISHOP : ( Indistinct ) .
STEVE FIELDING : Many people may not know that .
Then when the Rudd Government got elected the Rudd Government made some changes which I thought were a good move , more humane .
I backed those changes .
My vote was , again , crucial on those issues .
Now , what I did n't expect was thousands of people to start arriving in Australia .
We have a problem , okay ?
Now , before we start overreacting and say , " What are we going to do ? " you have to admit we have a problem .
First of all every person that Australia takes that comes through an authorised way we take one less from the front of the queue .
These people are wait ...
AUDIENCE MEMBER : ( Indistinct )
STEVE FIELDING : Hold on a second here .
When you say there 's no queue , there 's people waiting for years - for absolute years - and everyone we take by boat we take one less .
And , secondly , we are making it even easier for the boat people .
Now , I 'm proud , as an Australian , that we should treat people humanely but I did n't expect the problems of thousands of people coming and actual boats .
So we do have to admit that we 've got to address this issue .
How we need to address it ?
We have to have a fair dinkum debate without all the decisiveness about it .
TONY JONES : All right .
I just want to hear from Richard Dawkins .
The same debate , essentially , has been going on in the UK .
In fact , right across Europe .
Your thoughts on hearing it repeated here ?
RICHARD DAWKINS : I 've been rather moved to hear the very humane statements that have been made .
I do n't feel I should contribute to this debate .
I know nothing about the Australian situation .
But I was moved , especially , by what the rabbi was saying .
TONY JONES : Okay .
And Patrick McGorry , finally to you .
I mean you seem to be reflecting on the way the conversation is going .
I 'm just interested on your thoughts .
PATRICK MCGORRY : Well , I think a number of points have come out .
Look , it 's an upstream problem .
You know , it 's a massive worldwide problem .
When Senator Fielding says , you know , there are large numbers coming , actually in world terms there are a couple of thousand on Christmas Island .
It seems like a lot because there 's been an increase but if you look at it in world terms , Australia itself takes 130,000 people plus into the country every single year .
So we 've got - it has n't been looked at in a logical way , this issue , because it 's been politicised for the last 15 years or so .
I just do n't think the media , the politicians , the community have really had a logical look at this issue .
TONY JONES : I want to just complete this by going back to Julie Bishop .
Do you take the view that the Navy should basically toe the boats back to Indonesia ?
JULIE BISHOP : Well , that was Kevin Rudd 's view before the last election .
He said ...
TONY JONES : Is it your view now ?
JULIE BISHOP : I 'm just saying it was Kevin Rudd 's view before the election that they should take the boats back .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : ( Indistinct )
Is it your view ?
JULIE BISHOP : Thank you .
My view is that we should be working with the source countries , the transit countries to do what we can to stop the boats coming .
Now , if ...
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Why ?
JULIE BISHOP : Because it is inhumane to put people on boats where they have a very high risk of drowning and we 've seen it already with 105 people left the northern shores - it was Indonesia or Malaysia .
They have n't arrived , have n't been seen since last November .
Now , that is a ( indistinct ) so ...
TONY JONES : So , briefly , should the boats be stopped and towed back to Indonesia ?
That was the question and I 'm just wondering whether you actually have a position on that ?
JULIE BISHOP : Well , obviously in some circumstances that might be possible .
In other circumstances it wo n't be possible .
So you 'd obviously look at each ...
TONY JONES :
So if you find a boat at sea full of people , are you saying - because that 's when it 's possible ...
JULIE BISHOP : It would depend .
TONY JONES : ... are you saying that it should be then towed back if it 's seaworthy ?
JULIE BISHOP : Well , it would depend on the circumstances .
Kevin Rudd rang President Yudhoyono and asked him to send the Indonesian Navy down to collect them and take them to Indonesia .
So it depends very much on the circumstances .
But my point is first you must work with the source and transit countries to make sure that we can get rid of this people smuggling trade and process refugees in a much more humane way .
TONY JONES : Tony Burke ?
TONY BURKE :
The one thing that has n't been mentioned at all is that people are also fleeing countries .
Part of the motivation right at the beginning is someone has a well - founded fear of persecution and there is no doubt that the situation in Africa , while still intense , is less intense in some parts than it was a few years ago .
The number of people leaving Africa has gone down .
Similar in parts of the Middle East and in Sri Lanka the number of people leaving or who had partially escaped and were waiting has gone up a lot .
Now , that puts extra pressure on our region and I know the Opposition do n't like talking about the so called push factors but the truth is we have a big change ...
JULIE BISHOP : You do n't like talking about the pull factors ...
TONY BURKE : ... we have a bit change in the region and when you 're talking about 90 per cent of people having a well - founded fear of persecution , you need a smart solution , a responsible solution , but it can't be based on a level of cruelty to their mental health once they arrive .
TONY JONES : Okay .
Talking about once they arrive , what Julie Bishop said earlier was it was the Prime Minister 's position prior to the election that boats be towed back to Indonesia .
You did n't deny that .
That 's true , is it ?
TONY BURKE : Yeah .
There are times when you can and there 's limits under the international law of the sea when you can and one of the ways that does effectively have a dent on the people smuggling trade is if a whole lot of people have paid money to the people smuggler and then they arrive back in port .
I mean , you can achieve very rarely - very rarely - because frequently the moment the boat 's sighted , it starts to sink .
TONY JONES :
But essentially the towing back option is still an option - a live option for this government , is that right , from what you 're saying ?
TONY BURKE :
The theory of it , as what was put by Kevin at the time , is something that has been very rarely possible .
There 's been times when it 's been attempted but I 'm not going to pretend that we 're able to do it on every occasion because what do you then do if ...
TONY JONES : But you would do it .
That is the point .
You would do it .
TONY BURKE : No. No. No. I 've said that Tony .
Yes .
TONY JONES :
When you could , you would do it ?
TONY BURKE :
The answer to that is yes .
It 's limited by international law of the sea and it's also limited by what do you do the moment that boat starts to sink .
TONY JONES : All right .
I 'm sorry , we 're - I know there 's people with their hands up .
We 're running out of time .
We 've got time for just one more quick question .
It is a web question from Patrick O'Shea in Queensland .
" Do you wish for or indeed hope for an afterlife ? "
So this takes us back to religion and let 's start with Julie Bishop .
Do you wish for or hope for an afterlife ?
JULIE BISHOP : Well , I hope this is not it .
I mean , is this it ?
TONY JONES : There is life after Q&A .
JULIE BISHOP : I 'm told there 's life after politics .
So , yeah , obviously that 's part of my faith .
I hope that there 's something beyond what we have on earth .
I do n't know .
I do n't think about death that often actually and so it 's part of my hope that there is something more but I have n't , you know , formed that in any sense that , you know , I 'm going to be up there with angels and that sort of thing .
I do n't mean that , but I just think that we have this being , human kind .
I believe we have a soul and I would hope that the soul lives on .
TONY JONES : Patrick McGorry , do you wish for or hope for an afterlife ?
PATRICK MCGORRY : Yeah , I probably agree with general .
That 's my general feeling .
I 'd like to think that .
You know , I think about my family and I think about my parents and , yeah , I 'd like to think that .
TONY JONES : Jacqui ?
JACQUELINE NINIO : I think there 's more to us than this body .
I think we are an essence or a soul and a spirit and I do n't think that when our body dies that dies , as well .
What it is we 'll never know .
And , well , we will know hopefully at some point , but I do n't know now and I think my religion teaches me to live the best possible life that I can here and now and to do the best I can in the world and not to focus too much on what comes next , just to do the best I can now .
TONY JONES : Very brief answer , Tony Burke .
TONY BURKE : I reckon it 's true and I reckon Richard 's going to love it .
TONY JONES : Richard ?
RICHARD DAWKINS : Let 's be realistic about this .
We have brains .
It 's brains that do the thinking .
Our brains are going to decay .
That will be that .
But when you say , " Is this is ? "
How much more do you want ?
I mean this is wonderful .
We have a ...
TONY JONES :
At least another five minutes .
So you do n't wish for an afterlife ?
RICHARD DAWKINS : Would n't it be incredible tedious after the first thousand years or so ?
TONY JONES : Okay , sadly , we do n't have a thousand years to run the program .
We are out of time .
One hour is n't quite enough to answer all these big questions .
Please thank our panellists : Tony Burke , Patrick McGorry , Jacqui Ninio , Richard Dawkins , Steve Fielding and Julie Bishop .
Okay .
Next week the battle of the columnists : outspoken conservative Miranda Devine ; anything but conservative Catherine Deveny ; politics lecturer Waleed Aly ; Parliamentary Secretary Bill Shorten ; and Shadow Minister for Health Peter Dutton .
So look forward to another fiery discussion next Monday night when we return .
Good night .
These and a dozen other observations led Lanier to conclude that something had gone terribly wrong : that we had reached a point where the network was being exalted as far more important than any individual .
It is a thesis he explores in his book .
" The central mistake of recent digital culture is to chop up a network of individuals so finely that you end up with a mush , " he writes .
" You then start to care about the abstraction of the network more than the real people who are networked , even though the network by itself is meaningless .
Only the people were ever meaningful . "
One of the articles of faith of the " open culture " movement is expressed in the aphorism , " Information wants to be free " .
Typically it is used as a justification for illegal file - sharing but , as Lanier points out , information can't in any real sense " want " to be free .
" Information of the kind that purportedly wants to be free is nothing but a shadow of our own minds and wants nothing on its own , " he writes .
" It will not suffer if it does not get what it wants . "
Information only becomes real when it is experienced by a real , live human being .
Likewise , it takes a human mind to design and build the machines .
He uses the example of the series of chess games staged in 1997 between world champion Gary Kasparov and the IBM supercomputer , Deep Blue .
Kasparov famously lost the encounter , provoking much hand - wringing about whether computers had finally caught up with humans and were about to overtake us in terms of intelligence .
But this was , says Lanier , a massive over - reaction and symptomatic of the pedestal on which we tend to place computers and artificial intelligence .
" What happened was primarily that a team of computer scientists built a very fast machine and figured out a better way to represent the problem of how to choose the next move in a chess game , " he writes .
" People , not machines , performed this accomplishment . "
If Lanier were just another self - interested commentator railing about the technology dumbing down culture and destroying jobs , then his book would probably be less noteworthy .
However , Lanier is no Luddite - in fact he is perhaps the ultimate web insider .
As well as a computer scientist he is an artist , multi- instrumentalist musician and composer who pioneered the concept of virtual reality nearly 30 years ago and has had a long and varied career at the cutting edge of computer technology .
So it 's all the more remarkable that he is prepared to declare the web has " gone sour " and taken a radical detour away from the early simple idealism that believed technology could empower individuals and inevitably create something good .
This , he writes , has been " superseded by a different faith in the centrality of imaginary entities epitomised by the idea that the internet as a whole is coming alive and turning into a superhuman creature " .
One of the main targets of Lanier 's critique is the concept of the " wisdom of the crowds " or the " hive mind " .
This is the idea beloved of so many social media enthusiasts that the collective wisdom of a large number of people , generally harnessed online , will exceed that of the individual .
Wikipedia is the classic example often cited in support of this theory .
Lanier believes that by fetishising and over - stating the power of this collective so - called intelligence we undervalue individual humans .
" The ' wisdom of the crowds ' effect should be thought of as a tool .
The value of a tool is its usefulness in accomplishing a task .
The point should never be the glorification of the tool . "
He considers that " an adventurous individual imagination " is far more valuable than anything produced by a crowd .
Yet we continue to overestimate the potential of computers and the web to behave intelligently , talking down the power of our own brains and consciousness and talking up the abilities of the machines .
" People often make themselves stupid to make the machines seem smart , " says Lanier .
" We are flooded with information but the only reason we are flooded with information is that the people who designed the software systems do n't know the difference between quantity and quality .
So if you design something like Twitter where people are encouraged to say , ' Oh , I just had a sandwich ' , then of course it will be flooded .
To design systems like that and then to say , ' Now we have this intelligent software to filter it , ' is ridiculous . "
Lanier is also scathing about the way in which the internet leaves many individuals with little choice but to give away their work for no payment .
This effect has been heralded by many ( most notably Chris Anderson , editor of magazine , in his book Free : The Future of a Radical Price ) as a positive re-casting of our economic system , but it has failed to impress Lanier .
In his analysis , this new way of doing " business " takes all value away from the efforts of the individual in order to allow a small number of companies , such as Google , to make money for themselves .
" One effect of the so - called free way of thinking is that it could eventually force anyone who wants to survive on the basis of mental activity ... to enter into some sort of legal or political fortress - or become a pet of a wealthy patron - in order to be protected from the rapacious hive mind , " writes Lanier .
" What free really means is that artists , musicians , writers and filmmakers will have to cloak themselves within stodgy institutions . "
When was published , Lanier braced for a " faecal storm " - the web faithful do n't take kindly to criticism - however , he says he has been pleasantly surprised by the reception the book has received , and the messages of support from many people working inside technology companies .
" I thought I was going to be pounded by people who hated what I had to say .
There has been some of that and some ad hominem attacks as one would expect but there has been an extraordinarily warm reception on the whole . "
And perhaps that 's because , unlike other web dissenters such as British journalist Andrew Keen , Lanier 's arguments are far more measured than shrill .
And , while he raises as many questions as he answers - in places the book reads like a collection of loosely related ideas drawn together rather than a coherent " manifesto " - Lanier 's thoughts are a welcome counterbalance to the orthodoxy that the web is an overwhelmingly positive development for humanity .
2011 Subaru Impreza WRX STI – Click above for high - res image
The day after mashing around an ice course in Park City , Utah , we sat down with one of Subaru 's product planners to discuss what the automaker has in store in the near - term .
Our questions ranged from Subaru 's thoughts about adopting torque - vectoring all - wheel drive ( " We 're looking into it . " ) to what , if any progress was being made on the Toyobaru front ( " No comment " ) .
But when asked about a four - door version of the STI , our question was met with a slightly cocked head , a small smirk and a faint glimmer in the exec 's eye .
Could a sedan be in the cards ?
Maybe .
But judging by this solitary teaser of the 2011 Subaru Impreza WRX STI , it appears that the rally - bred hatch is getting an all - new wing inspired by Subaru 's dearly - departed WRC contender .
We 'll know for sure on Thursday when the wraps officially come off at the New York Auto Show

While trying to make an ice cream that could be fried or brûléed , I accidentally produced a recipe that very closely resembles Salep Dondurma – the fabled Turkish stretchy ice cream .
Dondurma means ‘ ice cream ’ in Turkish .
Salep dondurma is an ice cream made with flour from the ground tubers of wild Turkish orchids .
Some say the word Salep is derived from the word for fox testicles , which makes sense if you look at the picture below .
Salep flour contains a hydrocolloid that produces a stretchy , chewy ice cream .
The ice cream has to be worked long and hard to make it stretchy –almost the way you would to make gluten develop in a bread dough .
Vendors in Turkey beat and pound the hell out of it with long rods to get the consistency right .
When the texture is right you can cut the ice cream with a knife and eat it with a fork .
Harold McGee told me about Salep Dondurma in 2007 .
He wanted to cover ice creams with alternative textures in a class he teaches with us at the FCI ( the next one is in April , by the way ) .
Nils and I decided to make some for the class , but we could n’t – turns out it is illegal to export Salep , which only grows in Turkey .
The Turks love Salep so much that they are hoarding the world ’s supply .
It takes something like a thousand salep orchids to make one kilo of flour .
You ca n’t increase Salep production ; it is wild , not farmed .
So McGee suggested we use guar gum as a substitute .
Guar made a very chewy ice cream , but it was n’t like the pictures and descriptions of Salep Dondurma .
After the class , McGee wrote a piece on Salep and other non-standard ice creams for the New York Times , which includes a photo of the most amazing mustache I ’ve ever seen .
Mc Gee ’s article piqued the interest of our friend Professor Kent Kirshenbaum of NYU and the Experimental Cuisine Collective .
He and a Turkish graduate student wanted to find a way to reproduce Salep Dondurma legally here in the US .
Under the auspices of scientific research they smuggled some Salep flour out of Turkey .
The ice cream they made at the FCI with that Salep , flavored with gum mastic ( Chios Mastic ) , was my first authentic Salep Dondurma .
Indeed , guar was not a substitute for Salep .
Guar , as Kent pointed out , is a galactomannan ( a type of complex polysaccharide ) .
Salep , on the other hand , is a glucomannan –like Konjac flour .
We tried Konjac , but unfortunately it did n’t work .
We seemed to be out of luck .
Fast forward to last week .
I was n’t thinking about Salep .
I had a hydrocolloid class coming up , and I wanted to demonstrate a few new recipes : how about a fryable , brûlée - able ice cream using a fluid gel ?
Fluid gels are made by blending a solid gel , usually agar or gellan ( a type of hydrocolloid made by CP Kelco ) .
Once blended , the fluid gels have some properties of a liquid , and some of a solid .
When they are standing still they act like gels ; when force is applied they give way like a fluid .
Thick fluid gels look like purees , but have the mouth - feel of a sauce .
Thin fluid gels look like a liquid , but can suspend particles .
I chose gellan because I wanted a thick fluid gel that would n’t melt .
There are two types of gellan : high - acyl and low - acyl .
High - acyl gellan is freeze - thaw stable – great for ice cream .
Unfortunately , it melts at high temperatures , especially in milk .
Bad for an ice cream that you intend to fry .
Low - acyl gellan wo n’t melt when fried , but it is n’t freeze - thaw stable ; I decided to add Guar to increase freeze - thaw stability ( thickeners like guar can do that ) .
Most Guar tastes pretty crappy , but we have some nice guar from TIC Gums with a dead neutral flavor .
The result : ice cream with a texture almost exactly the same as Salep Dondurma !
I was surprised and excited .
It gets better : this same month my Turkish intern , after many botched attempts on our behalf , made her first successful Salep smuggling run .
We whipped up some authentic Salep Dondurma to compare with our fake batch .
We were still impressed .
Real Salep is slightly more stretchy , but the mouth - feel of our imposter is almost exactly the same .
Plus , unlike Salep Dondurma , this stuff can be brûléed or deep - fried .
I called CP Kelco .
They said they were not aware of any strange Salep - like behavior when Gellan and Guar are combined .
I had to figure out whether the Guar was needed for the Salep texture , or whether gellan would work alone .
If gellan alone worked , was it necessary to use dairy to get the Salep texture ?
Many hydrocolloids have weird interactions with dairy , including gellan .
If gellan alone did n’t work , would another thickener other than guar work in concert with gellan to give the Salep texture ?
Maybe Xanthan ?
CP
Kelco had asked why the hell I used guar to help with freeze / thaw instead of Xanthan , which is what they would use .
I had some more experiments to do .
We tested Heston Blumenthal ’s flaming apple sorbet , a non-dairy gellan fluid gel , and confirmed that gellan alone in a non-dairy system does not yield a Salep feel .
I then made a milk - based ice cream with gellan and no guar .
It was creamy and delicious ; many people in our class loved it .
It could be brûléed and fried , but it did n’t have Salep - ness either .
Gellan and dairy alone were not sufficient .
Next I tried ice cream with gellan and xanthan –nope .
There is something special about gellan and guar together .
Tests yet to run : Gellan and locust bean gum , gellan and Konjac flour , and gellan and guar in a non-dairy system .
As luck would have it , one of the students in our Hydrocolloids class was Turkish .
She gave us a two - thumbs up for authentic Salep texture !
Here is the recipe for our fake Salep .
This version is flavored with tea .
Fake Fryable , Brûlée- able Salep Darjeeling Dondurma
24 grams Singell Darjeeling tea leaves ( A second flush Darjeeling from Harney and Sons with a fruity , muscatel note )
500 grams cold milk
500 grams cold cream
5 grams KelcoGel F Low Acyl Gellan Gum
3 g salt
5 grams TIC Flavor Free Guar ( TIC is a company ; they make a neutral tasting guar .
Most guar is “ beany ” tasting –not delicious borlatti bean tasting either , just guar bean tasting . )
150 grams granulated sugar
2 scraped vanilla beans
3 egg yolks ( beaten )
2 grams Calcium Lactate Gluconate
Combine the milk , cream , and tea leaves .
Infuse the mixture in a vacuum bag at full vacuum plus 30 seconds .
Allow to steep till flavor is developed ( about 1 hour ) .
Strain tea from milk / cream mixture and add gellan , salt , and guar .
Whisk vigorously to combine ( this step disperses the gellan and begins to hydrate the guar ) .
Bring the mixture to a boil while stirring ( to hydrate the gellan ) .
Simmer for 1 minute ( ensures the gellan is hydrated ) .
Remove from heat .
Add sugar and vanilla and stir ( drops the temperature a bit ) .
When mixture drops to 83 or 82C add the egg yolks and stir ( if you go higher you might curdle the eggs .
The yolks increase the creaminess of the recipe ) .
When the temperature drops to 70C mix in the calcium and stir ( I read a reference that calcium added to milk / gellan systems might cause problems if added above this temperature .
Calcium added below this temperature will also cause problems ) .
Put mixture in an ice bath to set .
When mixture is completely set , blend in a high - speed mixer till creamy .
Freeze with liquid nitrogen in a Kitchen - Aid mixer fixed with a paddle attachment .
Beat until the ice cream gets stringy and stretchy .
To make creamy ice cream without the Salep feel omit the guar gum and increase the gellan to 7 grams .
I 'm not surprised that Miss Beverly Hills , Lauren Ashley , opposes gay marriage -- after all 45 percent of young Californians voted for Prop 8 , as did 7 million Californians generally .
But I have to say , I am impressed with her courage in coming forward and for speaking up for Carrie .
The elected officials of city of Beverly Hills are not demonstrating tolerance or kindness by continuing the avalanche of hatred against supporters of Prop 8 .
Well , Maggie G let that mask slip a bit and we got to see what we all know is lurking underneath .
Gallagher has come to the defense of ( shocker ! )
Miss Faux Beverly Hills Lauren
Ashley , who not only said gays should n't marry , but trotted out the old Leviticus Bible verse saying gays are an abomination and should be killed .
We all know Maggie Gallagher makes her living off of peddling anti-LGBT hate with the National Organization for Marriage .
She claims she 's just " saving marriage from the evil gays " and that she does n't hate us .
Sure she claims that we out to recruit kids , indoctrinate them in schools , and destroy them by being parents , but that 's just a little political difference , right ?
She 's Miss " warm and fuzzy " homophobia , especially if you see the media coverage of her .
While Gallagher may want to gloss over what Lauren Ashley really said and just make her a " traditional marriage " martyr like Carrie Prejean before her , she does n't get to .
A reminder on what Ms. Ashley said :
The Bible says that marriage is between a man and a woman .
In Leviticus it says , ' If man lies with mankind as he would lie with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination .
They shall surely be put to death and their blood shall be upon them . '
The Bible is pretty black and white .
I feel like God himself created mankind and he loves everyone , and he has the best for everyone .
If he says that having sex with someone of your same gender is going to bring death upon you , that 's a pretty stern warning , and he knows more than we do about life .
She 's right .
It is pretty " black and white . "
Ashley said GAYS SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH .
By endorsing her and saying you are " impressed with her courage " , especially without disavowing her call for death to gays , you are doing the same thing , Maggie .
Not so warm and fuzzy now , is she ?
This is n't about Prop 8 or marriage equality .
It 's about a publicity - hungry young woman trying to get her 15 minutes of fame by saying gays should be killed .
Wrap her in good Christian martyrdom if you 'd like , Maggie Gallagher , but she made her point very clear .
As have you .
So the next to you carpetbag yourself into a state to peddle your wares of anti-equality hate and fear - mongering with a smile , Maggie , I hope this moment follows you .
You do n't get to pick and choose or rewrite the history of what someone like Lauren Ashley said or stands for .
You support and admire a person that thinks " having sex with someone of your same gender is going to bring death upon you . "
It does n't get much clearer than that .
As I said before , you do n't get a pass on this , Maggie .
You ca n't use a call to death for LGBT people as a political bumper - sticker without staining yourself with it .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Chinese police arrested thousands in a drive against Internet pornography throughout 2009 , officials said , vowing a deepening crackdown that critics say is being used to tighten overall censorship .
The Chinese government has run a highly publicized campaign against what officials said were banned smutty and lewd pictures overwhelming the country ’s Internet and threatening the emotional health of children .
Chinese police said late on Thursday the crackdown on Internet pornography had brought 5,394 arrests and 4,186 criminal case investigations in 2009 -- a fourfold increase in the number of such cases compared with 2008 .
The announcement on the Ministry of Public Security ’s website ( www.mps.gov.cn) said the drive would deepen in 2010 .
Police would “ intensify punishments for Internet operations that violate laws and regulations ” , said the statement from the ministry ’s Internet security section .
“ Strengthen monitoring of information , ” it urged , “ Press Internet service providers to put in place preventive technology . ”
With an estimated 360 million Internet users , China has a bigger online population than any other country .
But the ruling Communist Party worries the Internet could become a dangerous conduit for threatening images and ideas .
The ministry did not say how many of the 5,394 suspects arrested were later charged , released or prosecuted .
The anti-pornography drive has also netted many sites with politically sensitive or even simply user - generated content , in what some see as an effort by the government to reassert control over new media .
China has banned a number of popular websites and Internet services , including Google ’s Youtube , Twitter , Flickr and Facebook , as well as Chinese content sharing sites .
The use of counterfeit coupons for groceries and other items has risen as budget - conscious consumers increasingly get their coupons from online sources .
Only about one - tenth of 1 % of the 3.3 billion coupons redeemed in 2009 were fakes , according to NCH Marketing Services Inc. , a coupon clearing house .
But the number of fraudulent redemptions increased by 14 % from 2008 .
On top of that , the Coupon Information Corp. , a non-profit organization monitoring fraud on behalf of food companies , has indentified 198 faulty coupons since late December -- more than the previous decade combined .
" Hard times kind of bring out the worst in some people .
In this bad economy , there 's more incentive to put one over on the retailers and the brands , " said Matthew Tilley , director of marketing for Inmar Inc. , a big coupon processor .
Food manufacturers distribute coupons via newspapers , direct - mail booklets and Web sites .
After shoppers use them to buy products , the coupons are sent to clearing houses like NCH or Inmar , which verify the redemptions .
Manufacturers then reimburse retailers the full value of the coupons .

2009 Corvette ZR1 : First Drive
The 2009 Corvette ZR1 is the best car ever made .
It redefines what performance cars are capable of , Read more
Add carbon fiber and ceramic brakes to an F - 150 and you 've still got a big truck .
Add the same upgrades to the race - focused ' Vette and you 're shaving seconds and breaking hearts with the Corvette Z06 Carbon Edition .
It 's an upgrade that finally helps the Z06 live up to its atomic number ( for all you non -math nerds , Z is another way of saying " atomic number " and " 6 " is the atomic number for the element Carbon .
Jeez , do we have to spell everything out ? ) .

Other outlets may point out the Corvette Z06 Carbon " slots , " or creates another notch , between the Z06 and the Corvette ZR1 .
While sure , this is technically true , you 've got to look past the in - market - car - salesman - what - slots - where - approach and appreciate how GM 's actually gving their track - loving customers something utilitarian .
Despite the ZR1 being the top of the Corvette food chain , when you go to a weekend autocross or local ' Vette club track day — it 's the Z06 owners sweating the clock .
Not the ZR1 owners .
To help them out , Chevy 's giving the Z06 Carbon Brembo carbon ceramic brakes from its boisterous brother ZR1 for better stopping , enhanced cooling for bigger performance , and carbon fiber touches for lower weight .
You could argue the black 20 - spoke 19 - inch / 20 - inch wheels front - and - back wrapped in Michelin PS2 tires are for better stance and traction but let 's be honest , they just look good .

Speaking of looking good , this edition will be available in either Inferno Orange or something called all - new Supersonic Blue with black headlamps and mirrors , ZR1 - style spoiler , and even Euro - styled racing numbers .
And in case you want all of this without snagging all the attention , both the performance upgrades and aesthetic upgrades can be ordered separately for the Z06 .
Paying homage to the debut of the Corvette at Le Mans with Briggs Cunningham and John Fitch 50 years ago with a carbon fiber - themed package that is n't tacky or awful .
How'd they pull that off ?
5d dynamic stylesheets
This is the fourth of five quick posts about some browser quirks that have come up in the last few weeks .
You can avoid blocking rendering in IE if you load stylesheets using DHTML and setTimeout .
A few weeks ago I had a meeting with a company that makes a popular widget .
One technique they used to reduce their widget ’s impact on the main page was to load a stylesheet dynamically , something like this :
var link = document.createElement (' link ' ) ; link.rel = ' stylesheet ' ; link.
type = ' text/css ' ; link.href = ' / main.css ' ; document.getElementsByTagName( ' head ' ) [ 0].appendChild( link ) ;
Most of my attention for the past year has been on loading scripts dynamically to avoid blocking downloads .
I have n’t focused on loading stylesheets dynamically .
When it comes to stylesheets , blocking downloads is n’t an issue – stylesheets do n’t block downloads ( except in Firefox 2.0 ) .
The thing to worry about when downloading stylesheets is that IE blocks rendering until all stylesheets are downloaded1 , and other browsers might experience a Flash Of Unstyled Content ( FOUC ) .
FOUC is n’t a concern for this widget – the rules in the dynamically - loaded stylesheet only apply to the widget , and the widget has n’t been created yet so nothing can flash .
If the point of loading the stylesheet dynamically is to not mess with the containing page , we have to make sure dynamic stylesheets do n’t block the page from rendering in IE .
I created the DHTML stylesheet example to show what happens .
The page loads a stylesheet dynamically .
The stylesheet is configured to take 4 seconds to download .
If you load the page in Internet Explorer the page is blank for 4 seconds .
In order to decouple the stylesheet load from page rendering , the DHTML code has to be invoked using setTimeout .
That ’s what I do in the DHTML + setTimeout stylesheet test page .
This works .
The page renders immediately while the stylesheet is downloaded in the background .
This technique is applicable when you have stylesheets that you want to load in the page but the stylesheet ’s rules do n’t apply to any DOM elements in the page currently .
This is a pretty small use case .
It makes sense for widgets or pages that have DHTML features that are n’t invoked until after the page has loaded .
If you find yourself in that situation , you can use this technique to avoid the blank white screen in IE .
The five posts in this series are :
In Iraq , insurgent networks had a motherlode of military - grade explosives for making roadside bombs .
In Afghanistan , fertilizer bombs are the weapon of choice , making detection and interception a much greater challenge , according to the head of the Pentagon 's bomb - fighting organization .
In a bloggers roundtable today , Lt. Gen. Michael Oates , Director of the Joint IED Defeat Organization , said that Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan , had lobbied Afghan President Hamid Karzai to impose a ban on ammonium nitrate fertilizer , one of the common ingredients for homemade explosives .
" When Gen . McChrystal identified the threat to troops from ammonium nitrate - based fertilizers – none of which are produced in Afghanistan – he went to President Karzai and in very quick order , he had a presidential ban issued on ammonium nitrate fertilizers , both in the country and for importation , " Oates said .
Oates added , however , that it was also difficult to detect ammonium nitrate if it was smuggled across the border from Pakistan .
" There 's been a concerted effort to working with the Pakistani government to shut down the transshipment of of precursors , " he said .
The picture above shows a pile of ammonium nitrate discovered in a cordon and search of the Shawal bazaar in Kandahar .
But as Afghan and coalition security forces capture stashes more ammonium nitrate , insurgents may turn other ingredients , such as potassium chlorate .
While there is not a ban on these materials in Pakistan , Oates said there were " serious discussions involving the Pakistanis " about restricting the sale of both ammonium nitrate and potassium chlorate .
For fighting these primitive bombs presents another challenge :
They do not have a high metal content that can be easily detected .
Oates said " persistent surveillance " on Afghanistan 's road network would be key , although that 's easier said than done .
" Getting these persistent surveillance capabilities into Afghanistan is a transportation challenge , " he said .

Originally designed to serve suborbital space tourism , vehicles like SpaceShipTwo , shown here with its carrier aircraft WhiteKnightTwo , could open up new opportunities in research .
( credit : J. Foust ) Celebrate suborbital
A new type of human spaceflight is rising before our eyes .
It is something few could have predicted 20 or even 10 years ago , yet it was right under our noses : suborbital spaceflight .
NASA and the Obama Administration are to be commended for their farsighted thinking in encouraging and funding the development of suborbital applications beyond tourism .
Late last month almost 300 participants — far more than initially anticipated — gathered at their own expense in Boulder , Colorado for the Next - Generation Suborbital Researchers Conference .
The conference — the first of its kind for this new type of human spaceflight — demonstrated the powerful draw of this new American industry for something far beyond its space tourism roots for scientific and engineering research , technology development and educational applications .
At that conference , NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver surprised and delighted the assembly by announcing a $ 75 - million , five - year effort proposed in President Obama ’s NASA FY2011 budget for the development and flight of NASA - funded experiments and ( once vehicle safety certifications satisfy NASA requirements ) hopefully experimenters and educators , too .
NASA and the Obama Administration are to be commended for their farsighted thinking in encouraging and funding the development of suborbital applications beyond tourism , and putting the United States at the forefront of what many expect to become a worldwide activity .
In doing so , they are opening up a host of exciting new possibilities for a diversity of fields , including aerodynamics , microgravity sciences , space life sciences , upper atmospheric research , education , and public outreach .
Now , with both the advent of suborbital capabilities and funding for research and education applications , NASA ’s next - generation suborbital efforts also offer an important new capability to routinely and inexpensively develop , test , and screen payloads and technologies before they fly to the International Space Station .
Encouraging the development of reusable suborbital spacecraft lines that fly at expected rates of dozens to hundreds of flights per year , depending on the manufacturer , will also yield important operational experience for future reusable orbital transportation systems .
Moreover , because commercial suborbital vehicles promise the first large - scale public access to spaceflight , they will undoubtedly increase excitement about space travel — something that I suspect will dramatically increase public support for NASA ’s human spaceflight program .
As this year and next unfold , it is expected that at least two and perhaps as many as four “ next - gen ” reusable suborbital spacecraft will begin test flights to space and back .
Never before in the half - century long history of human spaceflight has such a rich diversity of flight systems been in use .
In this , there are the seeds of a revolution in human spaceflight with strong analogies to the revolution in computing that occurred when mainframes were supplemented with personal computers .
And during 2010 and 2011 it is my hope that NASA and the Administration will take still longer strides and bolder steps to further exploit the great start they have made in fostering the domestic suborbital spaceflight industry .
Three specific steps come to mind , each of which offer to amplify the impact of this new and very 21st century American industry , and the space access capabilities it offers :
Encourage other federal agencies , such as NIH , NSF , DoD , NOAA , and USGS to also leverage the new suborbital capabilities coming on line to better serve their communities and missions .
Encourage foreign space agencies to also invest in suborbital applications — flying their own crew and payloads .
Such a move could quickly and easily advance NASA ’s ambitions to internationalize human spaceflight and to further interest in farther flung cooperative endeavors for ISS exploitation and even exploration of the Moon , asteroids , and planets .
Streamline and accelerate efforts within NASA to authorize the flight of NASA and NASA - sponsored personnel on suborbital missions , thereby further increasing public interest in human spaceflight and creating a space economy where public participation becomes increasingly safe and increasingly ubiquitous .
As a scientist , as an aerospace executive , as a former NASA manager , and as an American , I am excited about the new era of frequent , low - cost suborbital access to space for people and payloads .
Hundreds of tourists and now hundreds of researchers and educators have expressed their interest in suborbital spaceflight .
In this , there are the seeds of a revolution in human spaceflight with strong analogies to the revolution in computing that occurred when mainframes were supplemented with personal computers .
We are truly standing on the threshold of a renaissance for human spaceflight .
Join me in celebrating the promise of suborbital spaceflight by urging the Congress to fully fund commercial suborbital research in NASA ’s budget proposal for FY 2011 .
And join me in further encouraging NASA and other federal agencies to fully utilize the burgeoning suborbital industry and the revolutionary capabilities it offers to expand space access , research , education , and commerce .
Home
As housing prices have collapsed from their halcyon bubble peak , many are peering out into the foreclosure landscape that is the current U.S. real estate market and are wondering if prices now fall in line with economic fundamentals .
The problem in many areas across the U.S. is n’t so much with housing prices but actual employment and wages .
Take for example cities like Detroit where homes can be had for less than the price of the cars they are producing .
At the crux of the banking bailout and its subsequent failure was that it only focused on aiding the stability of the current banking order .
As trillions of dollars have been funneled to prop up banks , in reality , little has been done in remedying the foreclosure crisis because at the core , prices were in bubbles .
The pop is always painful .
Trying to mitigate the problem has essentially created a transfer of wealth to banks where they now , after years of cronyism , can now offer principal reductions which actually had a place in what are known as cram downs through bankruptcy .
A pound of flesh was always extracted .
But let us return to current housing values .
Are prices cheap ?
Source : Chart of Day
On the surface , especially when you aggregate the U.S. into one data point , the above chart seems to show prices coming back in line .
But this is highly deceptive for a variety of reasons .
As we have noted , home prices should ideally be a function of local incomes and economic industries .
After all , these are the people that will live in these places and service the debt .
At times it appears those in Wall Street have never ventured out to actually see the cities where many of their toxic loans were made .
Not only do they not care , they have no idea what the local economy can support .
I recall that in 1929 , at the height of the stock market right before the crash , a time when supposedly all was well 60 percent of Americans fell under the poverty line !
This egocentric view of Wall Street has not changed over the century .
And when we think of home prices , we first have to look at employment levels :
Gallup now has a poll tracking underemployment and we find that 20.2 percent of Americans fall in this category .
This is why in the midst of one of the most historical stock market rebounds ever , many Americans are unable to pay their bills .
This is another reason why in the middle of countless government programs , home foreclosures are still on pace for another record this year .
It has gotten to the point where some banks are offering a six month payment free plan where if unemployment hits you , then you can stop paying your mortgage ( millions have already done so ) :
“( CNN Money )
We ’re planning to help recently unemployed homeowners by giving them the ability to pay as little as $ 500 a month on their mortgage , which is effectively less than the price of an average one - bedroom rental nationally , ” Sanjiv Das , CitiMortgage ’s president and CEO , told CNN Radio .
Borrowers are covered by the program for 90 days when they submit documents proving they are recent recipients of state unemployment benefits , Das said .
Some homeowners may be able to get extensions after the 90 days expire , depending on their situation . ”
As worthy a cause this may be , many Americans already know another option is available .
Renting .
All these banking bailouts and mortgage gimmicks have failed to address the actual underlying problems in the overall economy .
In fact , they try to return to the heyday of the housing and banking bubble .
As you have noticed , home values have not increased yet stock values of banks have soared .
This is no accident .
In states like California , home valuations are still in bubbles in many cities .
Let us take a look at California as one entity first :
One often used metric of home valuation is household income versus price .
Even after a 50 percent drop in home values in the state , home values are still too high with a home price to income ratio of over four .
Overtime it seems that a ratio of three seems to reflect a “ fair ” value and of course this depends on local economies since some states have higher wages .
It is important to note that California was actually in line with home values in 1970 and then went off on its own path .
But a state with a 12.5 percent unemployment rate , much higher than nationwide data , is hard to stand pat and justify sky high prices in certain areas .
In some regions like Riverside County homes with five figures can now be found .
Yet this correction means little to the middle class if they have no job or fear being cut .
There can be no sustained housing recovery without having an economy to back it up .
Now we can use Nevada , Arizona , and Michigan to show really “ affordable ” housing but again looking at this in context of employment it does n’t really show the entire story .
Let us rather look at a diverse market area like Los Angeles County since this is a good example of an overpriced region that has corrected fiercely yet is still overpriced :
Prices in Los Angeles County have fallen by 42 percent from their peak .
Although this correction seems significant the median price is still $ 315,000 while the median household income is at $ 70,029 ( a ratio of 4.4 ) .
Much of this is skewed since lower priced areas are the bulk of recent home sales .
In some cities the ratio is over 7 .
Now compare this to values in 2000 when the median home price was $ 187,000 and median household income was approximately $ 50,000 ( a ratio of 3.74 ) .
Keep in mind this is based on 2008 Census data .
Since then , the unemployment rate in Los Angeles is now over 13 percent meaning the underemployment rate is up to 25 percent .
It is easy to get caught up in the depth of price cuts but prices have fallen for an important reason .
They were overpriced .
The question now centers on economic valuations and many areas are still in deep economic trouble and home prices do not reflect these new realities .
That is why for most Americans , when they hear about an economic recovery to them it centers around employment .

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs feels that Google " violated the alliance " it had with Apple when the search giant began producing cellphones that resemble the iPhone , according to a The New York Times piece that details the bitter rivalry between the two technology giants .
In an extensive piece profiling the battle between Apple and Google , dubbed by one person as " World War III " due to the level of animosity involved , multiple sources told the Times that Jobs feels betrayed by Google .
" We did not enter the search business .
They entered the phone business , " Jobs was quoted as saying at a company meeting .
" Make no mistake ; Google wants to kill the iPhone .
We wo n't let them . "
The report also corroborated previous claims that Jobs used an expletive to dismiss Google 's " do n't be evil " mantra .
The comment from the Apple co-founder reportedly earned " thunderous applause " from the company employees present at the meeting .
The Times noted that Jobs seems to be " unusually emotional " in the battle with Google .
It said the company 's lawsuit against HTC portrayed Apple as " an aggrieved victim finally standing up to the playground bully . "
The report alleged that Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page considered Jobs a mentor , and were regular visitors to the company 's Cupertino , Calif. , campus .
And while the relationship between Jobs and Google CEO Eric Schmidt was said to be pleasant , the two were reportedly " never close friends . "
Relations between the two companies allegedly turned sour when the Android mobile operating system was first introduced .
A series of heated meetings between Apple and Google executives took place soon after .
" Many of those meetings turned confrontational , according to people familiar with the discussions , with Mr. Jobs often accusing Google of stealing iPhone features , " the report said .
" Google executives said that Androidâs features were based on longstanding ideas already circulating in the industry and that some Android prototypes predated the iPhone . "
" At one particularly heated meeting in 2008 on Googleâs campus , Mr. Jobs angrily told Google executives that if they deployed a version of multitouch â the popular iPhone feature that allows users to control their devices with flicks of their fingers â he would sue .
Two people briefed on the meeting described it as ' fierce ' and ' heated . ' "
It was the introduction of Android , the Chrome browser , and Google 's plans to release its own netbook operating system that forced Schmidt off of Apple 's board of directors last August .
It was soon after that the two began competing for acquisitions .
While it was previously known that Apple talked with AdMob about a potential acquisition , the Times revealed more details on the talks :
" While Apple conducted due diligence on the deal , AdMob agreed to a 45 - day ' no shop ' provision , a routine clause that prevented the start - up from offering itself for sale to others , according to three people briefed on the negotiations .
But after Apple inexplicably let 45 days pass without consummating its offer , Google pounced . "
Google purchased AdMob for $ 750 million three days after the " no shop " provision with Apple expired .
One executive told the Times that Google was willing to pay the premium just to keep the company away from Apple .
Soon after the deal was struck , Apple responded by acquiring competing mobile ad firm Quattro Wireless .
The report even mentions the persistent rumors that Apple could partner with Microsoft to make Bing the default search engine and maps provider for the iPhone .
As usual , Apple declined to comment on anything for the story .
Compared with other industrialized countries , highly educated women are poorly represented in the paid work force in South Korea , where Confucian - influenced tradition continues to give married women overriding responsibility for managing the household and raising children .
In 2007 , only 60.9 percent of women with college or graduate degrees were employed , the lowest rate among the 30 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development .
( The O.E.C.D. average was 79.9 percent . )
Women who do work outside the home tend to be clustered in low - level service and manufacturing jobs — a fact that had consequences in the recent recession .
In the United States and Europe , more men than women lost their jobs .
But in South Korea , a whopping 90 percent of those made jobless were women , partly because they made up so many of the part - time and contract workers who have proved easy targets when it comes to cutting costs .
In January , just over 45 percent of working - age women were employed , compared with almost 70 percent of men .
Women bring in only 52 percent of what men get in wages , according to the U.N. Development Program ’s gender empowerment measure , which last year ranked South Korea 62nd out of 109 countries in terms of income and of political and economic participation and decision - making .
Faced with all this , it has been the government that has led the way to expand women ’s rights .
Since the mid-1990s , it has enacted laws addressing issues like sexual and domestic violence .
It has also revised more than 300 existing laws to eliminate gender bias since 2005 , the year the Constitutional Court threw out provisions in the Civil Code that said that only men could be the legal head of household and that children must take their father ’s surname , thus toppling centuries - old tenets of Korean society .
Women ’s rights advocates still mention this ruling as one of their greatest coups .
“ Our strategy has been to change the laws and institutions first so the rest of the society can catch up in changing attitudes and culture in favor of gender equality , ” said Chung Bong - hyup , director general at the Ministry of Gender Equality , which was established in 2001 .
Typically , I work out in my own home gym .
Sometimes , however , I venture out and grab a workout at this really great warehouse - type gym in town .
Either way , I love my gym options .
Yet because of where I train , and when , I sometimes forget what it ’s like for exercisers who are n’t , well , me .
Recently , though , I was reminded of just how bad it can be out there .
And that reminder came courtesy of a terrible personal trainer .
Trainers :
Some good , some bad
Now , please do n’t get me wrong .
I ’ve met tons of great trainers over the years .
In fact , many of them are actually PN readers and customers .
However , I ’ve also met some that are n’t qualified to shovel the sidewalk in front of the gym , let alone charge $ 50 - $ 100 an hour to “ help ” people get in shape .
And unfortunately , as in many areas of life , the bad seem to outnumber the good .
And it ’s the people who need help who ultimately pay the price .
So , in today ’s update , I ’d like to share with you my top 10 strategies for telling the difference between a great trainer and one that should n’t even be washing your gym towels .
Note : the bad nutritionists are n’t safe either .
Most of these same differences apply to them too .

10 characteristics of bad trainers and nutritionists
# 1 : They Do n’t Do Any Assessments
The best trainers perform thorough and complete assessments when working with a new client , before doing anything else .
On the training front , that means doing movement screening and even basic performance tests .
And on the nutrition front , that means looking at the client ’s current intake and assessing a host of lifestyle variables , including : schedule , primary complaints / discomforts , current level of social support , willingness to change , and more .
But is that how most trainers and nutritionists do things ?
Heck no .
Most trainers perform no assessments whatsoever !
And if any are performed at all , they ’re usually done in the “ free consultation ” that comes with your gym membership in order to embarrass a client into purchasing personal training .
That ’s a huge mistake .
Good assessments are the only way to gain real knowledge of a client and make the critical coaching decisions — without which you have about a snowball ’s chance in hell at seeing real results .
If you ’re not put through a thorough battery of assessments in your first session , RUN .
# 2 : They Can’t Demonstrate Previous Successes
Personal training and nutritional consultation is n’t cheap .
In fact , meeting with a trainer 4 x per week for 6 months can cost between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 dollars .
So , what are you getting for your 5 - 10 grand ?
Well , if a trainer or nutritionist can’t demonstrate his or her previous successes , you have no idea .
None at all .
The best trainers and nutritionists keep detailed statistics of their clients .
They track client adherence .
They log how their clients ’ bodies are changing and over what time period .
They record performance and lifestyle changes .
They keep photo albums with before and after photos .
And they can point to compelling testimonials from previous clients about their services .
They can probably even introduce you to a few , so you can talk to them directly about the experience .
The worst trainers and nutritionists have nothing .
No photos .
No testimonials .
No data .
Nothing .
If your trainer ca n’t show you compelling evidence that they ’ve helped people like you get the results you want , assume that it ’s because they ’ve never actually done it before .
# 3 : They Do n’t Have Multiple Certifications
Most personal trainers in the world today have nothing more than a high school diploma and a personal training certificate they got at a weekend personal training seminar .
And most nutritionists have little to no training specific to exercise nutrition .
( Registered dietitians do need to possess an undergraduate degree .
But this degree specializes in clinical nutrition — i.e. , what to serve hospital patients — NOT exercise nutrition .
Big difference . )
So if you have exercise and performance related goals , are these the types of folks you want to throw your money away on ?
Not me .
If it were me , I ’d look for someone with multiple certifications .
Someone who has clearly made it a priority to seek life - long education .
Someone who ’s gone out and sought a diverse knowledge profile , learning about training methodologies , body composition , nutrition , supplementation , and more .
The best trainers go out and do this .
They ’re life - long learners .
They spend 5 - 10 hours per week reading top - shelf training and nutrition information from the best in the field .
The worst trainers , they stick with their weekend certification .
They waste their time reading muscle magazines , or People magazine .
And they end up not even knowing how much they do n’t know .
# 4 : They Are n’t Healthy or Fit
Just like realtors who ’ve never owned a home and financial planners who are broke , out - of - shape trainers and nutritionists piss me off .
Now , let me clarify .
You do n’t have to look like a fitness model to be fit and healthy .
So that ’s not the standard here .
However , if a trainer does n’t have more muscle , less fat , and a better health profile than the average person , why would I listen to any advice on building muscle , losing fat , and getting healthier from them ?
It ’s a no brainer .
If a trainer or nutritionist is n’t healthy and fit — and does n’t practice the behaviors necessary to remain that way — they ca n’t be my coach .
# 5 : They Do n’t Know The Difference Between an Outcome and a Behavior
“ I need to lose 10 lbs , ” that ’s an outcome goal .
“ I need to exercise 5 times per week , ” that ’s a behavior
goal .
Trainers and nutritionists who do n’t know the difference between the two should be fired immediately .
You see , focusing on outcomes , that ’s the job of the trainer / nutritionist .
Their program needs to be built in such a way that the outcome is an inevitable consequence .
However , focusing on behaviors , that ’s the client ’s job .
Therefore any trainer worth a damn knows that to achieve success , their clients must be rewarded for successful behaviors , not for specific outcomes .
Followed this week ’s habits 90 % of the time and did n’t miss any workouts ?
That ’s worthy of a reward — regardless of the outcome — because it ’s this pattern of behavior that ’ll eventually lead to success .
In addition , the best trainers have ways to monitor behaviors and track client adherence / accountability ( such as the PN adherence chart , the software we use in the Lean Eating program , etc ) .
The worst trainers , on the other hand , they make progress seem like voodoo , separating the outcome ( weight loss , etc. ) from the behaviors necessary for the accomplishment of that outcome ( X exercise sessions per week , eating X servings of vegetables per day , etc. ) .
Your trainer should give you simple behaviors to practice , track whether you ’ve done so , and reward you when you have .
That ’s their job .
So are they doing it ?
Or are they just asking you to step on the scale ?
( Or worse yet , neither ? )
# 6 : They Do n’t Have A 3 - Month Plan From The Start
Before day 1 , session 1 , after all the assessments are complete , the best trainers and nutritionists will already have , in hand , at least a 3 - month plan based on their client ’s level , needs and goals .
When I walk around commercial gyms , it seems like a cruel joke ( and the joke is on their clients ) that most trainers are making up workouts as they go along .
There ’s no plan .
There ’s no “ big picture . ”
They ’re making stuff up as they go .
What a waste of everyone ’s time and the client ’s money .
I mean , seriously , where else in life do we find noteworthy success coming as a result of no planning , no forethought , and such obvious lack of care ?
If your trainer or nutritionist ca n’t show you their 3 - month outline on day 1 , session 1 , after all the assessments are complete , get away .
Fast .
# 7 : They Do n’t Carry A Clipboard or Notebook
Clients want to achieve something measurable .
So what happens when your trainer or nutritionist measures nothing at all ?
The best trainers and nutritionists measure everything .
They monitor and record performance variables like sets , reps , and rest intervals .
They monitor nutrition habit and behavior compliance .
They monitor workout attendance .
They monitor body composition .
They take pictures .
Need I go on ?
The point here is that you miss what you do n’t measure and record .
Also , without metrics , no one knows if progress is actually being made .
So is n’t it time we got rid of all these trainers who do n’t measure or record anything in favor of those trainers who do ?
# 8 : They Do n’t Know How To Help All Types of Clients
There are basically three types of coaches .
First , there are the coaches who are simply terrible , who ca n’t get great results with any of their clients .
Of course , there are plenty of these out there .
But if you ’ve got your head up , these are easy to spot .
Next , there are the coaches who are great , who can get great results with all of their clients no matter who they are or where they ’re coming from .
Of course , these are few and far between .
And if you find one , you lucked out .
And finally , there are the in - between coaches , those who seem to get great results with some clients but can only help a small percentage of those that actually come to see them .
The goal of every trainer and nutritionist should be to learn the techniques and strategies necessary to help EVERY type of client that comes to see them .
That ’s the hallmark of the great ones .
# 9 : They Do n’t Integrate Training and Nutrition
In order to change your body , there is something you need to know .
And you will likely never learn it at a commercial gym .
Exercise , alone , does n’t work .
Time and time again , the research has demonstrated that without a dietary intervention , even performing 5 - 6 hours of well - designed exercise programming each week leads to surprisingly little body composition change .
So you can bet that the best trainers offer an integrated nutrition solutions as part of their programing .
They schedule private nutrition sessions .
They assess your nutritional intake and compliance regularly .
They show you around the grocery store .
And more .
The worst trainers ?
They either leave you to figure it out on your own .
Or they offer useless nutritional sound bytes in between workout sets .
# 10 : They Do n’t Care
Let ’s be honest here .
If your trainer or nutritionist does n’t do most of the activities I ’ve listed above , regardless of whether or not they say they care , they simply do n’t .
They do n’t care about being good at their job .
They do n’t care about helping you achieve your goals .
They just do n’t care .
And that ’s the worst part of this all , is n’t it ?
People are throwing thousands of dollars a month at people who just do n’t give a shit .
It ’s a shame .
But it ’s not necessary .
Armed with a little knowledge , informed people can choose wisely if a trainer or nutritionist is in their future .
The Precision Nutrition Certification
This article comes down kinda hard on those trainers and nutritionists sleepwalking through their day jobs .
And for good reason .
If they do n’t care , I want them out of my field — immediately .
However , for the trainers and nutritionists who follow Precision Nutrition , the ones who DO care , the ones willing to go above and beyond to be excellent and truly help people , I ’m going to do everything in my power to change things .
We ’re going to raise the bar in the fitness industry .
For good .
If you ’re a coach , or you want to be …
Learning how to coach clients , patients , friends , or family members through healthy eating and lifestyle changes — in a way that ’s personalized for their unique body , preferences , and circumstances — is both an art and a science .
If you ’d like to learn more about both , consider the Precision Nutrition Level 1 Certification .
The next group kicks off shortly .
It 's not like your two ears really need 7.1 channels of audio , but what your home theaterneed is simplicity and an eagerness to support the third dimension .
In truth , we can only safely say that those beliefs are shared by Pioneer , who has today introduced a new pair of 5.1 AV receivers that offer Bluetooth streaming , HDMI 1.4 and an unmistakable " 3D ready " label .
There 's also the obligatory Works with iPhone certification on the VSX - 820 - K , which enables it to transfer iPod navigation control and on - screen graphics from the remote back to the Apple device .
Outside of that , most everything else is identical between the two , as they each offer five channels of 110 watts , at least 3 HDMI sockets and rather reasonable price tags .
Speaking of , you 'll be asked to pay $ 229 for the 520 and $ 299 for the 820 when they splash down later this month .
Sheikh Tantawi has died suddenly of a suspected heart attack Egypt 's foremost Muslim cleric , Sheikh Mohammed Sayed Tantawi , has died , aged 81 , while on a trip to Saudi Arabia .
Sheikh Tantawi was the Grand Imam of the al - Azhar mosque and head of the al - Azhar University , Sunni Islam 's centre of learning and scholarship .
He died of a heart attack in the Saudi capital Riyadh , where he was attending a prize - giving ceremony .
Sheikh Tantawi had infuriated radical Islamists with his moderate views on women wearing the veil .
His body will be taken to the Saudi city of Medina , the burial place of the Prophet Muhammad , for burial , Egyptian authorities said .
An adviser to the Sheikh told Egyptian television Sheikh Tantawi's death was a shock , as before leaving for Saudi Arabia he had seemed in " excellent shape and health " .
FROM GLOBAL VOICES
He leaves behind an unreformed al - Azhar - an institution that includes a university and a school system as well as a theological center - whose credibility has hit rock - bottom .
This may be because Tantawi was too pliant towards the regime , or because of the growth of various trends in contemporary Islam that reject al - Azhar 's centrality .

What is this ?
A member of Sheikh Tantawi's office , Ashraf Hassan , told news agency Reuters that Mohamed Wasel , Sheikh Tantawi 's deputy , was expected to temporarily take over leading the institution until the Egyptian president appointed a new head for the body .
Sheikh Tantawi was appointed to his position by Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak in 1996 .
But as a government appointee , he was always forced to negotiate a careful path between his religious imperatives and his government position , the BBC's Christian Fraser in Cairo says .
He was vocal in his opposition to female circumcision , which is common in Egypt , calling it " un-Islamic " .
Last year , Sheikh Tantawi barred female students at the university from wearing the full - face covering niqab veil .
He also caused upset other Muslim scholars by saying that French Muslims should obey any law that France might enact banning the veil .
His views on the veil prompted Egypt 's Muslim Brotherhood to accuse him of " harming the interests of Islam " .
He has also condemned suicide attacks , saying extremists had hijacked Islamic principles for their own ends .
" I do not subscribe to the idea of a clash among civilizations .
People of different beliefs should co-operate and not get into senseless conflicts and animosity , " he told a conference in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur in 2003 .
" Extremism is the enemy of Islam .
Whereas , jihad is allowed in Islam to defend one 's land , to help the oppressed .
The difference between jihad in Islam and extremism is like the earth and the sky , " Sheikh Tantawi said .

Imagine this :
Not long after getting word that you are HIV positive , you receive a letter from your insurance carrier .
They 're revoking your coverage because , upon examining your medical records , they 've decided you knew about your condition and hid it from them .
You have no idea what they are talking about ; you bought this policy before the diagnosis .
But when you inform them of this , and even provide some evidence that their investigation is in error , they ignore you .
Meanwhile , you 're on the hook for unimaginable medical bills , since you 're uninsured and there 's not a carrier in the world that will take you now .
Jerome Mitchell did n't have to imagine .
It happened to him .
According to a new story by investigative reporter Murry Waas , Mitchell in 2002 bought an individual policy as he prepared to begin college .
A few months later , he learned he was HIV positive .
That 's when Fortis insurance , which is now part of Assurant , informed him they were canceling his coverage .
Apparently a Fortis reviewer went through his medical file and found a nurse 's note , dated from 2001 , referencing his HIV status .
The memo happened to be in a pile of records from 2002 , suggesting it may simply have been mis-dated ; even the reviewer who found it asked whether that one piece of paper was sufficient grounds for revoking coverage .
With the help of a social agency that works with HIV patients , Mitchell supplied Fortis with evidence of the actual diagnosis date and begged them to reconsider .
Eventually he sued -- and won .
A South Carolina Jury awarded him $ 15 million .
But it was n't simply because of what Fortis had done in this one case .
It was also because Mitchell 's story was emblematic of how the company conducts business .
Relying upon court records and interviews , Waas explains :
Previously undisclosed records from Mitchell 's case reveal that Fortis had a company policy of targeting policyholders with HIV .
A computer program and algorithm targeted every policyholder recently diagnosed with HIV for an automatic fraud investigation , as the company searched for any pretext to revoke their policy .
As was the case with Mitchell , their insurance policies often were canceled on erroneous information , the flimsiest of evidence , or for no good reason at all , according to the court documents and interviews with state and federal investigators .
Like other major health insurance companies , Fortis has a " rescission committee " that reviews recommendations to cancel a policyholder 's insurance .
But in the case of Fortis [ Presiding Judge Michael Nettles wrote ] the committee rarely did more than " rubber stamp " already flawed recommendations .
" There were no rules , no minutes , no notes , and , in accordance with instructions from general counsel not even a record of who was present , " the judge wrote about the committee .
During the meeting in which Mitchell 's insurance was rescinded , " there were more than 40 other customers , whose cases appeared before the rescission committee for review in no more than one and one half to two hours , representing an average of three minutes or less per customer , " he wrote .
...
" Not only did Fortis choose to rely on one false and unreliable snippet of information containing an erroneous date to the exclusion of other information which would have revealed that date to be erroneous , Fortis refused to conduct any further investigation even after it was on notice the evidence which aroused its suspicion to be false , " the judge noted .
...
" In addition to these acts towards ( Mitchell ) there was evidence that Fortis has for some time been making recommendations for rescission , and acting on those recommendations , without good - faith investigation conducted fairly and objectively ...
Fortis pre-programmed its computer to recognize the billing codes for expensive health conditions , which triggers an automatic fraud investigation by its " Cost Containment " division whenever such a code is recognized . "
I do n't know any more about the case than what I 've read in Waas 's article .
But if you 're skeptical , consider that the case eventually went to the South Carolina Supreme Court , which upheld the verdict .
And although the high court reduced the award to $ 10 million , the Chief Justice reached the same conclusion as the trial judge : " We find ample support in the record that Fortis ' conduct was reprehensible .
Fortis demonstrated an indifference to Mitchell 's life and a reckless disregard to his health and safety . "
In a prepared statement , Assurant said that " We disagree with certain of the court 's characterizations of Assurant Health 's policies and procedures in the Mitchell case . "
Then , after noting that the case is still in some sort of appeals -- I 'm not sure what kind , since the Supreme Court already ruled on the main case -- it added that " All insurance companies have processes to review claims to ensure their accuracy , completeness and compliance with policy provisions and we evaluate all claims on an individual basis .

Remodeling a bathroom is a daunting task especially when you try to imagine a new layout in the already existing space .
Knocking down the entire bathroom is not necessarily the best idea due to the pipework done in the room .
The good news is , there are several other ways of remodeling your bathroom without using extreme measures .
Outlined below are some of the simple expert remodeling tips for your bathroom to achieve success .
1.Design a bathroom layout
Come up with a clear design of how you want your bathroom to appear .
You may decide to work with a professional designer who will help you achieve that desired look and avoid costly errors .
If you have a small budget , you could carry out some research on the internet .
You will find some DIY projects you can do on your own to save costs .
It is necessary that you avoid making massive changes to original sanitary ware layout to reduce plumbing costs .
Changing the location of the bathtub or toilet is quite challenging , and you will need to hire professional plumbers .
For a huge range of bathroom catalogues , you can visit Catalink .
2. Select sanitary ware before installation
These include sinks , bathtubs , and faucets .
You should also consider the bathroom furniture and the type of floor to be installed .
Be specific on every item and where it should be installed .
It will help you avert expensive alterations .
Additionally , you can recycle any quality items you may have in your bathroom such as faucets .
You might want to spray paint them so that they match the color of your remodeled bathroom .
In the case of the toilet , simple replace the toilet seat and lid .
Do not throw money down the toilet !
3 . Make use of mirrors
Mirrors make a tiny bathroom feel larger .
Incorporate large mirrors into the bathroom to make it appear more spacious and lighter .
Mirrors without frames , in this case , work best especially when fixed to cover an entire wall .
4 . Hide the pipework
When looking to achieve a perfect finish in your bathroom , conceal all the pipework .
You will need the help of a reputable plumber when it comes to this project .
Hidden pipes make it easier to install your desired floor perfectly .
It is also essential that the pipes are within reach in case of a leakage .
5. Ventilation
You cannot afford to forget about the ventilation system in your bathroom .
There is a lot of dampness in the bathroom as it is mostly a wet room .
As a result , you need to install a ventilation system .
An extractor fan could be the most appropriate as it will get rid of most of the moisture from that room .
You also need to change the wooden frames on your bathroom windows as they may rot with time .
6. Extra storage spaces
Your bathroom does not need to be cluttered especially after a renovation project .
Make use of storage spaces such as baskets and cabinets to keep everything hidden .
You can add a vintage vanity that will make the space look lively and homey .
Newly discovered archaeological sites in southern and northern India have revealed how people lived before and after the colossal Toba volcanic eruption 74,000 years ago .
The international , multidisciplinary research team , led by Oxford University in collaboration with Indian institutions , unveiled to a conference in Oxford what it calls ' Pompeii - like excavations ' beneath the Toba ash .
The seven - year project examines the environment that humans lived in , their stone tools , as well as the plants and animal bones of the time .
The team has concluded that many forms of life survived the super - eruption , contrary to other research which has suggested significant animal extinctions and genetic bottlenecks .
According to the team , a potentially ground - breaking implication of the new work is that the species responsible for making the stone tools in India was Homo sapiens .
Stone tool analysis has revealed that the artefacts consist of cores and flakes , which are classified in India as Middle Palaeolithic and are similar to those made by modern humans in Africa .
' Though we are still searching for human fossils to definitively prove the case , we are encouraged by the technological similarities .
This suggests that human populations were present in India prior to 74,000 years ago , or about 15,000 years earlier than expected based on some genetic clocks , ' said project director Dr Michael Petraglia , Senior Research Fellow in the School of Archaeology at the University of Oxford .
An area of widespread speculation about the Toba super - eruption is that it nearly drove humanity to extinction .
The fact that the Middle Palaeolithic tools of similar styles are found right before and after the Toba super - eruption , suggests that the people who survived the eruption were the same populations , using the same kinds of tools , says Dr Petraglia .
The research agrees with evidence that other human ancestors , such as the Neanderthals in Europe and the small brained Hobbits in Southeastern Asia , continued to survive well after Toba .
Although some scholars have speculated that the Toba volcano led to severe and wholesale environmental destruction , the Oxford - led research in India suggests that a mosaic of ecological settings was present , and some areas experienced a relatively rapid recovery after the volcanic event .
The team has not discovered much bone in Toba ash sites , but in the Billasurgam cave complex in Kurnool , Andhra Pradesh , the researchers have found deposits which they believe range from at least 100,000 years ago to the present .
They contain a wealth of animal bones such as wild cattle , carnivores and monkeys .
They have also identified plant materials in the Toba ash sites and caves , yielding important information about the impact of the Toba super - eruption on the ecological settings .
Dr Petraglia said : ' This exciting new information questions the idea that the Toba super - eruption caused a worldwide environmental catastrophe .
That is not to say that there were no ecological effects .
We do have evidence that the ash temporarily disrupted vegetative communities and it certainly choked and polluted some fresh water sources , probably causing harm to wildlife and maybe even humans . '
Sitting in Jacob Needleman ’s living room in the Oakland hills , I fished in my bag for the tiny microphone I planned to use with my iPhone , to record our conversation .
“ Is that what you ’re using ? ” he asked , with great interest .
He held up his own phone .
“ I just got one of these .
Will this really work ? ”
He sat next to me on the couch as I pointed him through the app store on his phone .
“ There it is , ” I said , pointing to iTalk .
“ That ’s what I ’m using . ”
He tapped the screen , but the app that came up for download was …
iTalk to God .
“ That ca n’t be it , ” he laughed .
It was n’t — but what a setup .
What is God ? is an unlikely title for a book by a philosopher , unless the question is meant rhetorically , or as a starting - off point for a discourse on language , or on the foibles of the mind , perhaps .
But Jacob Needleman asks the question in earnest , and then proceeds — in the course of this most personal of the dozen or so books he ’s written — to answer it .
What is God ? , out last month from Tarcher / Penguin , is an intellectual autobiography — the story of Needleman ’s education and formation as a scholar and teacher — but it ’s also a narrative of what might be called a conversion .
A young Ivy- educated professor , “ allergic ” to religion , enthralled by science , finds himself obliged to teach a religious studies survey class ; to his surprise , he discovers a world of rigor and inquiry in theological writing .
The story he tells , of the intertwining of his intellectual and spiritual searches , has a real suspense to it : how does an atheist come to believe in God ?
In a conversation earlier this month we discussed this question , the challenges of talking about religion in the contemporary cultural arena , fundamentalism and atheism , and the practice of real communication .
________________________
RD : In your book you refer to William James ’ discussion of religious emotion , how he says on the one hand that anything can generate a feeling of the sacred , but on the other , that there are some feelings that are purely religious .
What does he mean by that ?
JN : Yes it ’s an important question .
And apart from what James says , it ’s a general question .
Religious emotion is sometimes understood as an ordinary emotion about a religious entity , or a religious theme , or a religious object , or religious teaching .
In other words , I can be excited at a football game by the San Francisco 49ers , and I can , with the same quality of energy , the same part of myself , be similarly excited by the Bible , or the teachings of Jesus , or Buddhism , or something of that kind .
The object is different , but the actual emotion can be the same .
You can even say , “ I love hamburgers ! ” and then , “ I love my child . ”
Is it the same emotional entity , only the object happens to be different ?
One would n’t want to say that exactly .
And so that ’s one aspect of religious emotion , when we ’re lost in a mystical thing , or lost in the Avatar movie , or something like that .
How I understand it , is that there are different qualities of what we would loosely call emotion .
I make a distinction between feeling and emotion in order to talk about them .
There is such thing as deep , essential feeling which is part of our human nature .
And we have it under many conditions .
In relationships , or with a child , and especially in a spiritual context .
And that comes from a different part of ourselves — a literally organically different part of ourselves .
We are born with that capacity , and it is an instrument of knowledge as well as feeling — and it does n’t always have to be positive , it can be even be anger .
Like Christ in the temple , chasing the money changers out .
There is divine anger as well .
The distinguishing characteristic of this kind of feeling is that it is non-egoistic .
However , almost all the emotions that we know , especially in our “ fallen ” state , are somewhat egoistic ; not necessarily always bad , it ’s just they ’re concerned about me , with my gain , and my social standing , or how I feel about myself , or what I want to get materially , psychologically , socially .
The question about religious emotion cannot be answered without making that distinction .
And real spiritual feeling is an entirely different thing .
it ’s non-egoistic .
It ’s very personal , but it ’s not me me me .
Can an atheist feel religious emotion ?
The egoistic emotions can be very violent , agitating , destructive — the result , to some extent , of what the Buddhists call attachment .
There are other words for that : you might say one is “ swallowed ” by a personal reaction , an egoistic reaction , and it becomes someone ’s whole identity and there ’s a violence attached to it .
So one can believe in God in such a violent , attached way that it becomes its very opposite in terms of its quality , its action , its effect on human life , its effect on oneself .
It can become as bad as murder .
And one can be an atheist so passionately that one is willing to steamroll down and destroy anyone who disagrees .
Most fundamentalists and atheists are not that extreme .
But some are .
And so we have to acknowledge , just because I say I love Man it does n’t mean I actually do .
When this gets into the political sphere it always becomes violent .
It becomes destructive .
Not necessarily physically , but legally , emotionally , socially .
All kinds of ways .
You must love your neighbor or I ’ll kill you !
This is not an exaggeration .
You see this kind of thing .
That ’s one of the things that happens with religion .
The statements , the expression can be very nice , but the forces through it are deadly .
It can be atheism or Christianity or Judaism , or it can be a soccer game .
That ’s the thing .
Now , an atheist can not believe in the conventional religious gods of the culture and still feel a great sense of the sacred , even if you do n’t call it sacred .
And there are many people , great scientists , who feel this way .
When I was younger I was totally allergic to what I saw as religion : Judaism and even worse , Christianity — it was my enemy .
But I loved nature , and for me nature was sacred .
I did n’t use that word , but it made me quiet ; it made me feel a sense of something greater than myself ; it made me wish to serve something .
So I was an atheist , but I recall it as spiritual — a spiritual atheism .
How did your ideas about religion change ?
Well , as I say , in my life it was more or less thrust upon me .
I needed a job .
It was 1962 — ancient times — I was hired at San Francisco State and I was obliged to teach a course called the History of Western Religious Thought .
For me I had no desire to teach anything like that .
I was totally allergic to religion .
But I had training as a philosophy student , a grad student , a PhD .
I did very well , was at the best colleges , best universities —
Harvard , Yale — and I was willing to undertake preparing myself to teach such a course .
Philosophers generally do n’t want to come anywhere near that kind of stuff — nor did I .
But I honorably tried to prepare myself .
It meant I had to read theologians , Christian writers like St. Augustine — whom I had hated .
You see in my book where I talk about burning the pages of the book , that ’s exactly what happened .
I ’m not exaggerating .
I was so happy to see it go up in flames ; I had suffered so much from that book .
And later I read it and I loved it — a great , great man .
So it forced me to read and prepare myself , and I could n’t believe how superficial my understanding of religion had been , even with a liberal education from the best universities .
I discovered things about religion ; I could n’t believe how good , how interesting , how profound — and how distorted it had become , how shallow it had become .
So more and more I got deeply interested in religion because I had to teach it .
And then I got personally interested in my own personal , spiritual search which I started to undertake .
Which came to you by happenstance , as you describe it .
Yes , by happenstance .
There ’s a long story there too .
I encountered the particular teaching of Gurdjieff when I was quite young , in college , and abandoned it .
And by chance in San Francisco someone who was part of that was in my class and at first I thought , No , I ’ve already tried that and I ’m not interested .
But he urged me to read a book .
I read it .
I realized there is something here after all .
So that was a parallel .
My personal inner work was parallel with my academic work in a way .
Although I never made the connection between God and what I had studied with the Gurdjieff teaching .
It was not a religion , it was something else .
It was n’t called a religion , was n’t meant to be equated with religion .
And there were reasons for that .
I think Gurdjieff felt that the language of religion had become too associated with things that were not really sacred .
It ’s a complicated story .
In any case the personal search paralleled my study of religion , mystical traditions especially , and then Eastern traditions — Hinduism , Buddhism — that got deeper and deeper .
And my inner life , personally .
And there was a point when those two lines touched each other .
And all the emotional force , the emotional power , of the word God that had come to me in my childhood , all that emotional power that had been suppressed and hidden in some dark place — when those things came together it was like the sun rose .
It was : Ah , that ’s what God is .
I ’ve already experienced it .
Not at the deepest — there are many levels — but that was one level .
You talk in the book about having remained an atheist , even during years of great interest — even expertise — in religion and theology .
Yes , deep down , no matter how much I appreciated and understood religion — because it was damned interesting , and it was philosophically honorable .
I defended Judaism , I defended Christianity .
I gave lectures on it .
I wrote books and I could explain it .
But down deep I still did n’t believe that this idea of God corresponded to something out there , really .
Or in here — either way .
My mind believed it .
But somewhere down deep I did n’t really .
It was only when I actually touched a certain level of inner experience , and I said , Ah , that ’s it .
Now I am absolutely certain that there is such a thing .
I always believed , as I was studying these things , that there was something higher in the universe .
I never thought it was a dead , mechanical universe , like scientism .
It was only when I experienced it as part of me that I saw that it was true .
You refer to the idea of the human being as microcosm , or miniature universe , and how self - knowledge can open onto a more universal understanding .
But how about the social ?
What happens when human beings come together ?
The best and the worst of humanity comes in groups .
Think of the difference between a mob and a community .
A mob is low level — with no insult intended to animals — but it ’s a bestial mass , a herd obeying the coarsest violent emotions , self - suggestions or fantasies .
Anger and the mob have caused untold horrors throughout humanity ’s history : the mass mind , the herd instinct .
When people come together they sometimes exaggerate .
the worst qualities of human beings .
But without a community , without help , without interrelationship , I do n’t think most human beings can ever come to true spiritual development .
You need a community of some kind or other .
Very rarely , if ever , without the help of environment or community or culture , does someone appear who becomes a highly evolved person , in my opinion .
What kind of community would be the question , and how difficult that is .
People can relate to each other in such a way that it calls down something , and I ’ve experienced that .
When two or three people seriously listen to each other , speak and exchange with each other , something appears : “ Where two or three come together in my name , ” is , I think , a fact .
It ’s in the possible existence of such community that I think the hope of the world lies .
I do n’t think the world can make it without developed human beings , and a community supporting inner development .
Meanwhile we ’ve got a public culture that seems particularly contentious — debate as blood sport …
People are attached to their opinions .
Put simply , that means their fears and anxieties , their agitation , have been fueled or absorbed by an idea or concept or thought .
It ’s hard to get to the root , because the root of this is the fundamental sleep of mankind — or corruption , or sin , or ignorance , whatever word you want to use .
And people cannot listen to each other .
When we ’re talking , you and I , mostly when I ’m talking and trying to listen to someone I maybe hear — if I ’m lucky — one - third of what they say .
Mostly I hear my own thoughts , and when I try to write down what they ’ve said I mix it with my own thoughts .
But there is a discipline which one can obtain .
It ’s not that hard .
It ’s to step back from one ’s own opinions , make a space in myself and let you in .
I do n’t have to agree with you but I have to let you in , so that you are heard .
I hear you .
And you let me in .
And that way something very beautiful can appear ; I can still disagree completely with you , but I do n’t deny your humanity .
The art of listening is the first step of every ethics .
That ’s been misunderstood : as if to become good is to become ethical .
But it ’s not a question of acting and doing the right thing — that ’s hard .
But we can listen to the other , give our attention , which is our precious human substance , to the other person .
When I give my attention to you it ’s a little bit of love , whatever you might call it : and that ’s the source of ethics .
That ’s been lost entirely .
And it ’s really practical , it can happen .
But people ca n’t do it .
They do n’t do it .
They do n’t know they have this capacity .
They think listening is simply waiting for you to pause so I can come in .
Speaking of listening , you use stories from your teaching experience to such great effect .
It sounds as if teaching for you has been a laboratory …
Absolutely .
That is exactly the word I would use .
And you teach courses in religion , spirituality , so you encounter every kind of opinion .
I was so interested in that encounter you describe with the dogmatic student , the fundamentalist …
What an interesting thing that was for me .
Because I was always nervous when fundamentalist people came to my class .
Mostly I let them speak but I do n’t pay much attention , because I know they ’re going to come back with the same old thing and not going to listen to anybody .
They ’re often nice people but they ’re just impervious , waiting for the chance to come in and say Christ is this or that .
This guy , for some reason , there was something appealing about him .
He ’d greet me : “ How are you this fine day ? ”
He would sit in the middle of the room and he would plunk the Bible down .
I was teaching a course on really spiritual esoteric thought : René Guénon , and P.D. Ouspensky .
These are two heavy hitters in esoteric thought , and I thought , this guy is not going to swallow any of this .
Well all right , as long as he takes notes and does the exam it ’s fine .
But I liked him .
He would always sit there with his bible and he would criticize .
It was strong , but it was not hateful ; it was not violent .
So I took the chance of trying to listen to him .
I would make an effort to practice what I preach and listen to a person I totally disagree with about a subject I know a lot about .
So we started having a conversation , and one of the subjects had to do with interpretation of scripture .
At one point we were back and forth and I realized : this man , I disagree with him a lot but he has a heart .
This is not a maniac — he has a heart , he ’s feeling something .
And I started respecting his being , really , in a sense , without any sense of agreeing with his thoughts .
Anyway , he started saying things like : you ca n’t have criticism , you ca n’t have interpretations , you ca n’t have commentaries — what is right is what ’s in the Bible .
It sounded like the old literalistic fundamentalist kind of thing .
But it was n’t , because he was saying something really interesting : let the Bible interpret itself .
And it ’s true , if you could really receive the Bible , if you could really open to the words — this leads into the whole big question about how you read scripture .
In its deeper sense , scripture was never meant to be an academic study , where you take questions in your mind .
In its deepest sense you can only understand real scripture when you need something , when you need truth of a certain kind and you need help .
Then scripture speaks .
Whether it ’s Christian , Jewish , or sacred books of the Gnostics , or whether it ’s Buddhist — really scriptural texts .
Scripture is not just recording what Jesus said ; scripture is men and women coming together , working inwardly to be true to something and together trying to produce something that has at least a bit of truth of the heart .
Real scripture , though it might on the surface seem contradictory or violent , these things are often symbolic and can only be understood with the heart and the head together .
Not just with the head .
So I started criticizing as a professor , but I did n’t want to stay in my head like that with this man for some reason .
I could give him all kinds of good jabs , ask him questions that would refute him , but as I went on playing my role as a professor I started coming down into my own heart .
This guy started being less rigid .
He was a heart coming up and relating to a head , and I was a head coming down and relating to a heart .
A beautiful meeting .
This so - called fundamentalist was a human being .
Someone might look like an unpleasant fanatic in certain conditions , you begin to speak to them , and — well , you might be quite surprised .
Male sexual harassment claims against women are on the rise — does this mean we 're finally accepting the existence of female sexual aggression ?
Advertisement
Coverage of male sexual harassment victims has generally focused on same - sex cases , and Sam Hananel 's piece for the AP is no exception .
But it does include this tidbit :
Cases involving women making unwanted advances toward men may also be rising as women make up a growing part of the work force .
Last year , the Regal Entertainment Group , which operates a national chain of movie theaters , agreed to pay $ 175,000 to settle a lawsuit by a male employee who claimed a female co-worker repeatedly grabbed his crotch at work .
When the employee complained to his supervisor and the theater 's then - general manager , he claims , she failed to stop the harassment and instead retaliated against the victim with unfair discipline and lower performance evaluations .

While Hananel notes that the percentage of sexual harassment claims filed by men doubled in 1980 and 2009 , from 8 to 16 % , it 's surprisingly difficult to find out what percentage of these claims are filed against women .
But what 's not hard is finding individual cases of female - on - male harassment .
Cynthia M. Piccolo of Medhunters.com mentions the 2000 case Casiano vs. AT&T Corp. , in which " The male plaintiff said that his female supervisor gave him a satisfactory evaluation only , because he would n't submit to her sexual advances , which resulted in his being ineligible for a management program . "
And back in 2007 , MSNBC's Eve Tahmincioglu noted that the first - ever court case of sexual harassment against a man , brought in 1995 , named a woman as the perpetrator .
In this case , the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Domino 's Pizza after a female supervisor harassed a male manager : " She would caress his shoulders and neck , and pinched his buttocks , " the suit said .
Is the fact that more sexual harassment claims against women are coming to light , and more men are willing to come forward and file them , a sign that society is beginning to accept — and punish — women as aggressors ?
Perhaps — but we still have an extremely fraught relationship with female aggression , criminal or not .
Pickup artists claim that men can't handle female pursuit in a romantic context , and when women attack others , we laugh and look the other way .
An extreme example — alleged murderer Amy Bishop — leads to extensive cultural handwringing .
What does it mean , we ask , that a woman can kill ?

Hananel 's piece treats female - on - male harassment as something of an anomaly .
Though he mentions the Regal Entertainment Group example , he also says , " most charges involve men harassing other men . "
And he leads with a male - on - male case : " John Pilkington 's boss would n't take no for an answer .
During more than two years as a food runner at an upscale steakhouse in Scottsdale , Ariz. , Pilkington says his male supervisor groped , fondled and otherwise sexually harassed him more than a dozen times . "
Are situations like Pilkington 's actually more common , or are men simply more willing to come forward when they 're harassed by other men ?
It 's a complicated question , as homophobia may play a role — some men might avoid speaking out for fear of being perceived as gay .
But for others , being victimized by a woman might seem more embarrassing than being harassed by a man .
EEOC attorney Mary Jo O'Neill says that for male harassment victims , " everyone expects that they would be able to handle it and take care of it themselves . "
Might this expectation be especially strong if the harasser is a member of " the weaker sex ? "
And might journalists consciously or unconsciously choose to focus on cases like Pilkington 's because a male aggressor still seems more believable ?
Tahmincioglu 's lead is telling :
We often talk about sexual harassment against women in the workplace but for this column I 'm going to address the growing problem of sexual harassment against men in the workplace .
Are you laughing ?
You probably are .
Of course , sexual harassment is n't funny , but perhaps people are more likely to laugh when it comes from women , who are still supposed to be passive in bed , in bars , and in the workplace .
Whether she 's Naomi Campbell , a supervisor at Domino's , or just a woman openly flirting , ladies who defy this expectation make us nervous .
And while this may be starting to change — Casiano vs. AT&T Corp. was dismissed , while Regal Entertainment Group had to cough up some money — we still have a long way to go .

I have a nostalgic fondness for one the most famous movie quotations uttered by the great comic actor W.C. Fields :
“ It ai n’t a fit night out for man or beast ! ”
As a kid growing up in Dayton , Ohio in the 1950s , I often heard my father and his old World War II Army buddies say those words to each other on snowy or rainy nights .
Every time they said it , they ’d chuckle .
I ’d chuckle , too .
But at the time I did n’t actually know where they got the line or why it was funny to them .
It was n’t until my college days that I saw the W.C. Fields movie that popularized the line —
The Fatal Glass of Beer — and realized they were quoting him .
That famous Fields two - reel “ short subject ” was first released to movie theaters nationwide on March 3 , 1933 .
My Dad and his friends had seen it and other Fields films at local movie theaters in Dayton when they were young .
It was produced by Mack Sennett , the Canadian - born Hollywood mogul who produced many classic silent and early “ talkie ” comedies from 1911 until the mid-1930s , including the Keystone Cops films , and films by legendary comedians like Fields , Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle .
If you ’ve seen The Fatal Glass of Beer then you know the line “ It ai n’t a fit night out for man or beast ” is used repeatedly in it for comic effect .
If you have n’t seen the film , you can watch it on YouTube and other sites .
It ’s a classic !
The movie is set in the Yukon during winter .
W.C. Fields plays a local prospector named Mr. Snavely , who lives in a remote , rustic cabin with his wife .
Six different times in the movie , Fields opens the cabin door , looks out , then intones : “ It ai n't a fit night out for man or beast . ”
Every time he does , a gust of wind blows a cloud of snow into his face .
The audience can see that it ’s obviously a bucketful of fake snow being thrown at Fields from off screen .
It ’s clearly hokey , as intended .
The Fatal Glass of Beer was , in part , a send - up of earlier , badly - produced films and vaudeville shows .
It also mocks the moralistic tone of some early movies and older anti-drinking temperance shows .
The title of the film comes from a faux temperance song Fields sings during the first few minutes , at the request of his friend , a local Canadian Mountie played by Richard Cramer .
Fields accompanies himself by seeming to play what the Mountie calls a “ dulcimer . ”
It ’s actually a zither and Fields strums it while wearing thick furry mittens and singing off - key .
The song , credited to vaudeville comedian
Charlie Case
, tells the tale of a young country boy who goes to the big city and visits a bar , where a group of rowdy city boys talk him into drinking “ the fatal glass of beer . ”
That single drink immediately causes the poor boy to have delirium tremens , go wild and crazy and break a Salvation Army worker ’s tambourine .
The moral of the song , as given in the lyrics , is do n’t drink alcohol and “ Do n’t go ‘ round breaking people ’s tambourines . ”
Yes , the song and movie are as kooky as that sounds .
It ’s almost as surreal as a Monty Python skit .
Indeed , I view it as a forerunner of the kind of creatively wacky humor the Pythons are known for .
The Fatal Glass of Beer was n’t a big hit when it came out .
But it eventually became a cult classic , giving my father and millions of other people a funny line to say when the weather is nasty .
By the way , Fields says “ man or beast , ” not “ man nor beast . ”
The latter is a common misquote .
As I recall , my late father said it correctly .
I think he was as much of a W.C. Fields fan as I eventually became .
This one ’s for you , Dad .

William Kevin Innes , an Asheville man arrested last June and charged with trying to pass off a private currency as legal tender , has sent a plea from jail asking community members for help in securing his release before his trial , which is slated to begin next month .
In the undated , handwritten letter , titled " Injustice Comes to Asheville , " Innes asserts that his " alleged crime " amounts to no more than " trying to help small businesses by promoting the use of a local - acting , precious - metal currency as the United States Constitution says the whole country should be using . "
The federal government , however , sees the case quite differently .
" When groups seek to undermine the U.S. currency system , the government is compelled to act .
These coins are not government - produced coinage , yet purchasers were led to believe by those who made and sold them that they should be spent like U.S. Federal Reserve notes , " acting U.S. Attorney Edward Ryan declared in announcing the arrest last year .
" Such claims are in violation of federal law . "
According to the indictment , Liberty Services , the company that distributed the Liberty Dollar , violated the law by designing coins and bills that resemble official U.S. currency ( the indictment specifically cites the use of the head of Lady Liberty and a torch ) and by encouraging private merchants to make change with Liberty Dollars in $ 5 , $ 10 , $ 20 and $ 50 denominations .
According to the Liberty Dollar Web site , 74 Asheville area merchants were accepting the currency at the time of the arrests .
After Innes was named in search warrants issued in connection with a 2007 FBI raid on the Liberty Services headquarters in Indiana , he told Xpress he had never represented the currency as legal tender .
In the letter , he says he was careful to ask local law - enforcement officials that his actions were legal .
" From the beginning of 2003 , I have continuously received assurance from law enforcement , including Sheriff Van Duncan , that no law was being broken , " Innes writes .
" How is the FBI serving and protecting the country by arresting me ? "
Duncan says he did meet with Innes about two - and - a - half years ago , but though he knew the FBI was investigating the Liberty Dollar group , he " really was n't at liberty to say much to him one way or the other " about the legality of their activities and therefore " really did n't give any information .
Innes , says the sheriff , " told me a little bit about what they were doing .
I then called the FBI and let them know about the meeting . "
Even among federal agencies , the Liberty Dollar 's legal status has seemed murky .
A 2006 statement by the U.S. Mint said that using Liberty Dollars in place of standard currency would be criminal .
But that same year , a Treasury Department official told the media that merchants were free to accept them if they wished .
Private currencies ( such as those used by particular towns or resorts ) are not unheard of and have n't generally faced legal challenges .
What sets the Liberty Dollar apart is its nationwide reach and backing by precious metals .
Since his incarceration in the Caldwell County Jail , Innes ' letter asserts , " I am being punished as though guilty before I have had any opportunity to prove my innocence .
The lack of sunshine , bad food , hostile guards and the overcrowding makes this dungeon more severe than most prisons . "
The other defendants , including Liberty Dollar creator Bernard von NotHaus , are out on bond .
However , Innes ' status is complicated by his Canadian citizenship .
Due to that and his upcoming trial , Innes is considered a risk to abscond and has thus been unable to gain release .
In the letter , Innes says he 's trying to get his application for U.S. citizenship accepted and to raise the roughly $ 20,0000 needed to secure his release .
The letter also asks community members to intervene on his behalf by writing affidavits for his immigration lawyer , donating money for his bail , and sharing his letter ( which is addressed to a " Friend of Freedom " ) with other folks who might support his cause .
Innes ' wife , Julia Gaunt , sees her husband about twice a month and is leading the effort to secure his release .
" I do n't think he 's being treated fairly by the federal government , " she says .
" The Liberty Dollar folks have said that they believe they 'll be acquitted , that they have a very strong case .
The other three were released on signature bonds , but he 's been in jail almost six months now . "
But while calling conditions in the jail " appalling , " she says Innes has " really kept his spirits up .
He 's maintaining a vegetarian diet , meditation and exercising , all in his cell , " she notes .
" The only creative outlet he has is pen and paper .
I think a lot of the community is in the dark about what happened to him . "
Gaunt has invited community members interested in helping Innes to contact her at 582-9115 or write him at the jail .
Despite the many challenges , Innes ends his letter on an optimistic note , tying his advocacy of a precious - metals - based currency to a larger struggle for change , declaring that the " whole situation is ' history in the making ' !
Positive change is finally sprouting within people and through cracks formed because certain structures have become too rigid and have begun to wither and decay .
Out of the old , new life and [ is ] springing up and also a desire for a kinder way to share this beautiful planet .
I have jumped into this struggle for positive change with both feet .
You can say I 'm now in over my head !
This [ is ] my call for you to throw me a lifesaver . "
Innes ' trial is scheduled to begin March 2 at the Statesville Federal Courthouse .

US officials are investigating how a child was apparently allowed to direct planes at New York 's JFK airport - one of the country 's busiest .
The probe comes after an audiotape caught the boy directing several pilots preparing for take - off last month .
In one exchange , the boy is heard saying : " JetBlue 171 contact departure . "
The pilot responds : " Over to departure JetBlue 171 , awesome job . "
The boy was apparently with his father - a certified air traffic controller .
The adult is later heard saying with a laugh : " That 's what you get , guys , when the kids are out of school . "
In another exchange , the child says : " MS 4 - 0 - 3 , contact departure , " and then adds : " Adios , amigo . "
The pilot responds : " Adios , amigo . "
The pilots on the tape appear to be not concerned that a child is giving them instructions .
The incident happened on 17 February , when many New York pupils were on a week - long break .
The age and name of the child and the adult on the audiotape were not immediately known .
' Not indicative ' incident
The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement : " Pending the outcome of our investigation , the employees involved in this incident are not controlling air traffic .
" This behaviour is not acceptable and does not demonstrate the kind of professionalism expected from all FAA employees . "
The agency did not give any further details .
The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said the incident was " not indicative of the highest professional standards that controllers set for themselves and exceed each and every day in the advancement of aviation safely " .
What country does the US fail to officially recognize , and yet is legally bound to defend ?
The answer is Taiwan , otherwise known as the Republic of China ( ROC ) , a country born as the last redoubt of Chiang Kai - shek and his Nationalist army , which fled to the island in 1949 after being routed on the mainland by the Peoples Liberation Army .
There the Nationalists , and their successors , have languished ever since – succored and defended by the US government .
While our relationship with the real China is too important to endanger by granting official recognition to the ROC , US support for Taiwan has been generous , consistent , and long - standing .
Long before there was an Israel lobby worth noticing , the infamous China lobby wreathed its multiple tentacles around official Washington , wielding an influence that was very often decisive .
During the late forties and fifties , Taiwan ’s lobby was a major force on the American right , wielding inordinate power – and backed up by large sums of money – in an effort to secure their lifeline to US subsidies and protection .
Alfred Kohlberg – an importer and businessman with extensive investments in China – and his allies funded various ultra-conservative groupings in the US , funneling money from Taiwanese government sources to lobbying efforts aimed at supporting Taiwan .
Kohlberg , with the aid of Senator Joseph McCarthy , whipped up anti-Communist hysteria to the point where Congress investigated the Institute on Pacific Relations ( IPR ) , which opposed support to Taiwan , targeting it as a " Communist front . "
The Kohlberg - McCarthy campaign portrayed the State Department and academia as riddled with pro-Communists , traitors intent on having the US abandon the Nationalists , thus giving Mao ’s Communists free rein in China .
As Murray Rothbard points out in The Betrayal of the American Right , the China lobby was instrumental in steering the Republican party out of the " isolationist " ( i.e. anti-interventionist ) position it had taken during the Thirties and early Forties , and propelling it into the cold war years and beyond as the party of untrammeled aggression .
In any case , the power of the China lobby waned during the Nixon years and the rapprochement with Mao , but the lobby still had enough power to ensure passage , in 1979 , of the Taiwan Relations Act .
The Act stipulates that the United States will " consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means , including by boycotts or embargoes , a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States . "
Furthermore , the Act requires the US “ to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character , ” and “ to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security , or the social or economic system , of the people on Taiwan . ”
In short , we are " legally " required to go to war with China in the event Beijing tries to take back their breakaway province , a possibility that has been raised several times in the past half century or so – and could easily arise again .
While the power of Taiwan ’s lobby has long since waned , the arms manufacturers who derive a regular source of income from the provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act – Lockheed - Martin , United Technologies , Boeing , and Raytheon – employ a powerful Washington lobby that doubtless had a major hand in getting the go - ahead for the $ 6.4 billion arms deal .
That ’s what Washington is all about : the national interest has little if anything to do with it .
As long as the merchants of death make huge profits – while the rest of the country is slipping into an economic depression – that ’s all anyone in the Imperial City cares about .
China has reacted with ill - concealed rage , breaking off its limited military cooperation with the US , and threatening sanctions against American companies involved in the deal .
Most notable , however , is not the content but the intensity of Beijing ’s protest , as reported in the Washington Post , over a headline detailing how " China ’s Strident Tone Raises Concern Among Western Governments , Analysts " :
" China ’s indignant reaction to the announcement of U.S. plans to sell weapons to Taiwan appears to be in keeping with a new triumphalist attitude from Beijing that is worrying governments and analysts across the globe . "
Ever since the end of the cold war , the US has stood astride the globe triumphantly proclaiming its " right " to attack any nation , anywhere , for any reason , " preemptively " – but it ’s the Chinese who are the " triumphalists " !
To put the issue in proper perspective : Imagine if Texas governor Rick Perry carried out his half - serious suggestion that Texas secede from the Union , and China opted to sell the Republic of Texas $ 6 billion worth of Patriot missiles , Blackhawk helicopters , and sophisticated detection systems – for " defensive " purposes only , of course .
Washington would rightly consider this very close to an act of war .
To the Washington Post , however , other nations have no right to assert their sovereignty : indeed , such impertinence is usually punishable by having " rogue nation " status conferred upon the " transgressor , " who is from that moment a prime candidate for " regime change . "
The Post details the list of issues that vex US - China relations , including climate - change and " cyber- security . "
The US claims China is somehow involved in hacker attacks on Google , as well as other targets , albeit without providing much in the way of evidence .
The climate - change dispute is over China ’s refusal to surrender its national sovereignty to Western technocrats intent on reducing emissions and " saving " the earth from the ravages of technology .
China , for its part , is just now entering modernity , and is not about to let itself be pushed back into a pastoral pre-industrial existence by environmentalist do - gooders .
According to the Post , " This new posture has befuddled Western officials and analysts :
Is it just China ’s tone that is changing or are its policies changing as well ? "
It ’s only natural that the Post , the voice of Imperial Washington , is " befuddled " by such obstinacy .
They simply ca n’t understand why the Chinese guard their sovereignty so jealously , and seem to treasure their independence from the West .
Why oh why wo n’t they go along with the program ?
It is often stated that the Chinese will never dump their lion ’s share of US debt instruments because they would stand to lose an awful lot of money .
As US - China relations take a turn for the worse –with the US firing the first shots of a trade war by imposing tariff restrictions on selected Chinese goods – the certainty of Chinese restraint becomes highly problematic .
The Chinese have already warned the US government their debt level is making such investments highly risky , and Beijing may not be averse to playing the debt card if it involves a mater of national pride – or national self - preservation .
If China really felt threatened by US arms sales to Taiwan – perhaps as a prelude to an official declaration of independence on the part of the ROC – they have the power to stop US military aid dead in its tracks .
All they have to do is simply cease buying up the US debt – and dump what they have .
That would be the financial equivalent of a nuclear detonation going off in the center of Washington .
It ’s a measure of the political pull of the arms lobby , and the anti-mainlanders in US officialdom , that we ’re taking that kind of risk .
In needlessly provoking the Chinese , the Obama administration is caving in to the lobbyists , both foreign and domestic , and their allies in the War Party , who would like nothing better than a new enemy to justify their profit margins and ceaseless warmongering .
Our real national interests lie in maintaining peaceful trade relations with the country that has replaced us as the world ’s factory .
We have no interest , not even an ideological one , in supporting the Taiwanese secessionists against the central government in Beijing : While China is an authoritarian state , Taiwan is very far from being a democracy .
The form is there , but the content is sadly lacking .
Even if Taiwan were a Jeffersonian republic , however , we still could not rationally guarantee its security in the face of China ’s overwhelming presence .
The idea of going to war with the mainland over the status of Taiwan is absurd : in reality , such a war would make short work of the Taiwanese themselves , and we would be left with a major conflict on our hands – one we would soon regret initiating .
It is simply not realistic to pretend we can guarantee Taiwan ’s sovereignty , and , to make matters simpler , this realization does not involve any concession of principle .
Indeed , the official US position is that it has no position , whilst maintaining only unofficial relations with Taiwan ’s government in deference to Beijing .
Will we go to war to preserve a government we have n’t even granted the courtesy of official recognition ?
The Chinese Communist regime , left to itself , cannot and will not survive : the pressures of modernity on the strictures imposed by the " Chinese road to socialism " are bound to crack the system at its very foundations .
China , like the old Russian empire , can be characterized as a veritable " prison - house of nations , " and is bursting with ethnic tensions nearly invisible to the Western eye .
As in the former Soviet bloc countries , no one believes the official ideology , a highly compromised form of " market socialism " with a totalitarian overlay .
All of these factors militate against the survival of the last major Marxist regime on earth .
However , the demise of Marxism - Leninism as the ideological inspiration of Chinese government cadres has created a void increasingly filled by ultra-nationalism .
The West remembers the Tiananmen Square protests and the " goddess of democracy , " but more recent manifestations of popular sentiment have centered around perceived insults from foreigners : e.g. , the Hainan island incident in 2001 , which brought out thousands of Chinese students protesting " US imperialism . "
The sometimes violent protests were tamped down by the government , which has good reason to fear any expression of popular opinion – especially opinion that implicitly criticizes them for being soft on the Americans .
For the moment , the leaders of the Communist Party have been wary of whipping up too much nationalistic sentiment , in fear it could boomerang .
If pressed , however , the leadership could well take a nationalistic turn , in which case China ’s foreign policy – so far relatively pacific and inward - looking – could take a more aggressive turn .
In which case our actions will have provoked and encouraged the very outcomes they were supposed to prevent .
In poking our sword at the dragon , we take the risk it may suddenly awake .
Better to let him die in his sleep .

I live and work on FOSS .
But there 's a real problem with most FOSS : for something that prides itself on the source being readable by everyone , and even cames up with ' laws ' like ' given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow ' , the actual source code of most FOSS is horrible , unreadable , garbage .
Actually , I wonder if ' Linus ' Law ' should n't actually be something like ' Linus ' Necessity ' : given that the source is so horrible we need lots of people so that one of them will be able to figure out what the hell it was we wrote .

Then I would pick at random two source files ( each source file had to be fairly large , i.e. more than 100 lines of code ) and score them being as generous as possible using the following categories and assigned a score to each .
I weighted the scores heavily towards doing simple things that have a high benefit ( for example , describing the purpose of a file of function ) :
File Description ( FD ) : did the file I open have some sort of description ( near the top ) of what the purpose of the file was for .
I was n't asking for a detailed explanation , but just a little helper so that a new reader could get going on the purpose .
Score : +5 ( if present ) , - 5 ( if not )

I was n't asking for a detailed explanation , but just a little helper so that a new reader could get going on the purpose .
Score : +5 ( if present ) , - 5 ( if not ) Function / Interface Description ( FID ) : did any of the functions , or interfaces , in the file have a description .
I would have liked to have seen all the arguments specified and return codes and caveats explained , but I was extremely generous : even if one function had a little header with a minimal description of the function it got into this category .

Score : +5 ( if present ) , - 5 ( if not ) Useful Comments ( UC ) : did the file contain at least one useful comment .
A useful comment points out something that is n't obvious to the reader , or some trap for the unwary .
Score : +1 ( if present ) , - 1 ( if not )
: did the file contain at least one useful comment .

Score : +1 ( if present ) , - 1 ( if not ) Stupid Comments ( SC ) : did the file contain at least one stupid comment like ' increment i' or ' loop through records ' .
Score : - 1 ( if present ) , +1 ( if not )
: did the file contain at least one stupid comment like ' increment i' or ' loop through records ' .
Score : - 1 ( if present ) , +1 ( if not ) Understandable ( U ) : did I feel like I would be able to understand most of the code given 30 minutes of reading the file and browsing the rest of the source .
This was very subjective , but was used to take into account things like clearly named functions , or really well named member variables .

Score : - 1 ( if present ) , +1 ( if not ) Bonus ( B ) : I had a special bonus category which I could hand out if I felt like it .
A positive score here was for particularly well documented , and written code , neutral for most code and negative for really hideous stuff .
Score : +10 ( loved it ) , - 10 ( yuck ) , 0 ( in general )
Of the top 50 projects one ( XAMPP ) was excluded because it's a distribution of other code and not new code .
What I found was not a pretty picture :
65 % do n't bother describing even in the most minimal way even one of the functions I saw
60 % of the projects do n't bother with describing the purpose of a file
59 % of the projects scored negatively using my system
53 % contained useless comments
40 % looked incomprehensible to me without major effort
33 % contained commented out or # if 0 code
There was one bright spot : 85 % contained at least one useful comment .
But given that my percentages underestimate the problems ( because I was very generous ) these figures are horrible .
The best projects were ( in order of score ) : GNUWin32 ( thanks GNU Project ! ) , GTK + and The GIMP installers for Windows , NASA World Wind , Ghostscript , WINE , Miranda , MinGW ( thanks GNU Project ! ) , Erases , and DC ++.
Come on FOSS people .
Have some pride in your work !
Remember , writing some decent comments is a gift you are given to people who read your code , and to yourself .
( Note that if you are the author of one of the projects above it 's possile that I made a mistake and just happened to pick the wrong files to read .
Send me examples of how great your code is and I 'll publish a rebuttal here ) .

Firstly , since I 'm about to slam Free and Open Source Software let me point out that I am not a Microsoft fan boy , that I use Firefox , Thunderbird , Ubuntu , EMACS , all the GNU tools , the GIMP , Apache , TRAC , OpenOffice , etc. on a daily basis .
I live and work on FOSS .
But there 's a real problem with most FOSS : for something that prides itself on the source being readable by everyone , and even cames up with ' laws ' like ' given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow ' , the actual source code of most FOSS is horrible , unreadable , garbage .
Actually , I wonder if ' Linus ' Law ' should n't actually be something like ' Linus ' Necessity ' : given that the source is so horrible we need lots of people so that one of them will be able to figure out what the hell it was we wrote .
When I started my well - known open source project I decided that I 'd better make the code readable for two reasons : firstly , I was sure that I would n't get to work on it often so I 'd have to come back and read old code and comments and other coding standards would make that easier ; secondly , I was sure that other people were going to read my code .
The second thing turned out to be really important for two reasons : firstly , other people were able to read my code and contribute and I kept them to a similar coding standard and style and hence the code is ( reasonably , I 'm not claiming I 'm perfect ) readable .
Perhaps more importantly one day I was being interviewed for a job and the interviewer said : " Yes , we 've all read your code " .
They 'd downloaded my project and checked me out .
( I got the job ) .
Now , I 'm not trying to slam all FOSS here and for the purposes of this entry I have not examined some of the most famous projects ( e.g. Linux kernel , Apache , Firefox , ... ) , but I decided to take a look at the top 50 most downloaded projects of all time on SourceForge .
Then I would pick at random two source files ( each source file had to be fairly large , i.e. more than 100 lines of code ) and score them being as generous as possible using the following categories and assigned a score to each .
I weighted the scores heavily towards doing simple things that have a high benefit ( for example , describing the purpose of a file of function ) :

What I found was not a pretty picture :
