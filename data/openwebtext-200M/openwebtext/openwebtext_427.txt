Android Scan
Android Developer Challenge submission by Jeffrey Sharkey
Android Scan has been renamed to CompareEverywhere for the second half of the Android Developer Challenge .
Video demo
A few months ago I had a great opportunity to share my application as part of an Android Developer Profile .
Older details
Android Scan is one of the 50 winners of the Android Developer Challenge , more details to be released on Monday .
I 'll also be at Google I /O later this month .
Scan is an Android application that finds pricing and metadata for anything with a barcode .
Here are some key features that make Scan stand out :
Automatic barcode recognition using onboard phone camera using ZXing library
using onboard phone camera using ZXing library Shows CD , DVD , or book cover along with detailed reviews from Amazon.com
from Amazon.com
Searches over a dozen stores , both online and brick + mortar Highlights brick + mortar stores that are nearby , with option to call the store or get directions
Links to online storefronts to buy online from the phone
, both online and brick + mortar Tracklisting for CDs , along with option to play sample tracks right on phone
For books , searches local libraries to see if they have a copy
Watch the quick 3 - minute video that shows the power of Scan in action with real barcodes :
How do I use Scan ?
Well , it 's pretty simple really , just point your phone at a barcode and scan it .
You 'll probably need to get pretty close to the barcode .
Try filling the camera window with the barcode , and make sure you have good light .
If you 're running on the emulator , check out the section below for instructions on hooking up a webcam .
Once you hit " Scan " the Android will try recognizing the barcode , and will then ask a remote server to gather up metadata and prices about the item you scanned .
This will usually take about 15 seconds .
When it returns , you 'll be shown some metadata about the item you scanned , mostly for you to verify that we found the correct item online .
You 'll see reviews from Amazon.com that you can scroll through and read .
On the " Sellers " tab , you can browse a list of sellers who have the item you scanned .
These can range from online stores like Half.com , to a brick + mortar Barnes and Noble down the street , to your local library if they have a copy .
Scroll through the list using the arrow keys to pick a store , then tap on " Link " to jump to their website .
If it 's a brick + mortar store , " Directions " will show driving directions from your current GPS location and " Call " will call the store 's local phone number .
The seller list is sorted by price , allowing you to quickly get a gauge of what the item is selling for .
If you scanned a CD album , you 'll probably see a " Tracks " tab that lists all of the album 's tracks and their play length .
If the album is available in the Amazon MP3 store , you 'll see a " Play " button which will stream and play a 30 - second sample clip of the track right on your phone .
That 's the basics of what Scan does .
The power lies in the Python backend that does the heavy lifting of searching stores for you .
It runs on a remote server to keep phone bandwidth low .
You can read more about the server script in a separate section below .
Working with an emulator
So are you stuck with an emulator instead of a real Android phone ?
You can still get a camera working to scan barcodes , just like we showed in the video .
I 'm using the approach pioneered by Tom Gibara with his remote camera idea .
Essentially you 're using the Java Media Framework to latch onto your computer 's USB webcam and create a network camera that the Android can hook into and use .
I did all of my development on Linux , so the JMF can be a slight pain to get working correctly .
In either case , go grab Tom 's WebcamBroadcaster class and get it started up on your local computer :
Then connect to the running JMF program from Scan by changing the camera source to " Socket camera ( using JMF ) " and entering your local IP address .
Be sure to use your computer 's real IP address , as 127.0.0.1 has a special meaning to the Android emulator .
Then click " Save changes " and switch back to the " Scan " tab .
You should now see your webcam live on the Android device .
Move around , zoom in on a barcode , and click " Scan " just like you would with a real phone device .
You might have trouble with cheap webcams because the optics are n't detailed enough for Scan to recognize the barcode .
If you keep getting barcode recognition errors , try again with a better webcam , or using better lighting .
Using a MiniDV camera
I ran into issues with cheap webcams not providing enough barcode detail , and instead had to use a firewire MiniDV camera as my video source .
I did this using the same JMF approach above , except I used a sweet utility called DV4 Linux that emulates raw1394 devices as V4L devices .
Because the JMF recognizes V4L devices perfectly , I just wrapped my JMF console commands using their utility :
dv4lstart jmfinit dv4lstart java WebcamBroadcaster
It worked flawlessly , and this is what I used to create the overview video linked earlier .
Here 's the DV4 Linux website with source code :
What is the backend ?
Because scraping store APIs can be bandwidth expensive , the actual searching is handled by a separate server written in Python .
The Android phone feeds the scanned UPC / ISBN code and a current zipcode to the server , which then feeds back a very condensed XML response with the essential data .
Here 's a list of the specific sites / APIs that we scrape :
UPC Database
Amazon.com API
Half.com API
Yahoo API
Barnes and Noble ( items and store locations )
Hastings ( items and store locations )
Local libraries ( San Francisco , San Jose , Portland )
The Python script will mark any nearby stores or libraries with an address and phone number .
For metadata , the script fills in details from any available data source , which means it can still provide answers even if one or more APIs fail .
How is Scan able to play sample music clips ?
Scan can play back sample music clips for any album available in the Amazon MP3 store .
This feature is n't even provided by Amazon at this point , so we have some pretty sweet screen - scraping going on in the Python backend that digs deep into Amazon to pull out sample clips that can be played easily on the phone .

Well , is n't that special .
Brad , I do n't think I 'm alone when I say that ' our side ' is overdue for some very good karma .
I 'd think of this as a gift .
And there are at least ' 6 or 7 ' who ca n't WAIT to hear the whole story .

I apologize for this , but I have to do it .
One of those compulsion type things , you know .
If you have n't read this , please do so : Consensual Political Intercourse
Then read the discussion here : Uncounted discussion on Care2
It is long , but almost every possible objection is put forward and addressed .
Towards the end someone suggests a new little group that is just forming and is open to anyone .
You might want to check out the beginning of the discussions there also .
Again , I apologize .
And even more profusely for what I am about to say .
This may be a fascist tyranny , but it is not a prison .
Just because we 've been punked once or twice before , does not mean we have to keep bending over .
There are women in Africa who have been brutally raped and mutilated but survived and are now self - sufficient and helping others .
We not only have the right to the citizen - owned transparent participatory democracy of the Creekside Declaration , but according to an older declaration , the Declaration of Independence , we have the duty to reject tyranny and establish democracy .
We can not do that by voting in rigged elections .
Sorry .

I 'll let you keep guessing on that one , Mr. Blue , until I 'm able to finish up this story .
But you likely know , I 've advised many to bring such equipment with them , to document instances such as this , when they go to vote ...

The system is mocking us .
But to Die Bold my friends is to die with honor , right ?
As long as we die , I guess , then its okay .
What if we were to keep living ?
We would just shrivel more and more and look more like the image we fear becoming .
So if we can blast a cap off in some Arab 's face , then we can live the glory of capitalizing on our own vanity .
Do n't you see Brad , you voted wrong .
You do n't support the facelift operation so you were helped in order that you might understand later .
Where is Kevorkian , sonny ?
Call Jimmy Carter !

Great !
We 're going to have some more evidence !
More smoking guns !
Now , er , if only we had a democracy , we could do something with it ....
Remember when Kathleen Wynne videotaped the officials in Cuyahoga County manipulating the ballots ?
They never saw a day in jail .
I 've got a copy of Richard Hayes Phillips ' book , Witness to a Crime , CD included --- fully documented evidence that the 2004 election was stolen , but Bush is still in office and can't be removed .
And then there was Clint Curtis who got documented evidence , sworn affidavits from voters , that he had won his election , and he filed a Federal Election Contest , but Congress dismissed it , as they did several others .
And where is it they just went to court and won the right to look at the election documents and are now frantically seeking computer experts to help them develop a database that might enable them to analyze those documents within the five day deadline for filing for a recount ?
I have a friend in Africa .
He gets the GPS coordinates for mass graves in case someday somebody is ever interested , but he does n't advise villagers to go out and get themselves slaughtered so that he can get more evidence .
Personally , I do n't need any more evidence .
I already know our elections are rigged .
Some people wo n't care no matter how much evidence there is .
I guess it is a personal thing .
I 'm just wondering if it is possible for those who are gathering evidence to maybe consider also working on establishing democracy , just in case the evidence is ruled inadmissible ?
Or is the evidence itself the only goal ?
And if so , how many fully documented presidential election thefts do we need before we can stop asking them to please steal another ?
Just askin ' ....

For Christ 's sake , why does n't some fucker that works in the LA news pick up on these voting machine problems ?
Are they totally retarded or something ?
Are n't these issues considerably more earth - shattering than these boring , banal " scoops " that they have on celebrities , etc ?
Would some reporters please grow some god damn balls and start looking into these issues .
What could possibly be more important than those who are voted into offices that decide how our country is run , and the process by which they are voted in , as well as the accuracy of said vote ?
Does n't anyone fucking care anymore ?
Come on , CNN , Brad lives right around the damn corner from you ( or so I thought he has previously said ) .
Obviously I 'm not speaking to most of the regulars here .
WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE DO THEIR FUCKING JOB AS JOURNALISTS AND COVER AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR A CHANGE .

On the " did you record the flipping " question - In Texas some Election Judges ( particularly the R type ) - if they saw you making such a recording - will instruct you to power down the device or even instruct you to leave the voting place , even if you have not finished voting .
If you protest , they can , and some may well , have you arrested .
Election Judges in TX have the power of a District Judge on Election Day .
TX Election Code , new this year , says : BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS : SECTION 1 .
Subchapter A , Chapter 61 , Election Code , is amended by adding Section 61.013 to read as follows : Sec. 61.013 .
USE OF CERTAIN DEVICES . ( a ) A person may not use a wireless communication device within 100 feet of a voting station .
( b ) A person may not use any mechanical or electronic means of recording images or sound within 100 feet of a voting station .
( c )
The presiding judge may require a person who violates this section to turn off the device or to leave the polling place .

This could be a big break .
Brad should be a regular on Olbermann .
He should be on with Colbert and Stewart .
He certainly has an internet presence .
There are clearly more than a few who check into this place .
As Al Franken says , it 's a blog run by a guy named Brad .

I 've become somewhat obsessed with the faces feature in iPhoto .
Currently , I have about 7000 unidentified faces in my library .
I knock out a few hundred here and there .
It 's oddly satisfying , but I go to a lot of large events - events where a lot of people look familiar because they are regulars , but I do n't know them .
This makes finding faces rather cumbersome , especially since the method of ignoring faces requires the mouse .
Everything else can be done with the keyboard .
Plus , does n't track repeatedly ignored faces , so the same faces keep showing up .
Well , I 've discovered a way to work around these cumbersome limitations .
Doing everything with the keyboard makes things go a lot faster .
If you 're using the Find Faces feature and skip faces you do n't know ( because you do n't want to pause to use the mouse ) , the next time you click on Find Faces , you 'll be presented with those same unknown faces over and over again .
They build up and always get presented in the same order , so you end up spending a lot of time skipping them before you get to new faces .
To avoid this , just name all these unknown faces ' Unknown ' ( or some other word with an uncommon starting letter ) .
Then all you have to do to ignore a face ( once you 've tabbed to it ) is type a 'u . '
After you 've labeled a bunch , open the ' Unknown ' face album and bulk - confirm all the unwanted faces .
Now the next time you use Find Faces , you 'll get right to the new faces .
A few other time - saving tips :
You can create a smart album containing unnamed faces , open the album and hit the info button , then start tabbing and naming .
The photos with unnamed faces will disappear as you update them .
This allows you to have a good idea of your progress .
Not naming a face when the person 's name is on the tip of your tongue , can make them rather hard to return to when their name pops into your head .
I find it useful to name them something like '?
Alan 's Wife ' or some other memorable note .
All such names will be at the top of your Faces album listing ( because of the question mark ) , and you can change the name of all occurrences simply by renaming the album .
Let auto - complete do most of the work .
Most times , the first few letters are all you have to type before iPhoto fills in the rest of the name .
Note , iPhoto uses Facebook , your contacts , and your previously named faces for auto - fill , but it skips contacts ' middle names and does not include nicknames .
When confirming faces , if you come across a different face that you know , you can right / control - click and name it .
Plus , sometimes all it takes to remember a name is the context of the photo , but the Find Faces feature does not let you zoom - out to see the whole image .
Yet , when confirming faces , you can unzoom / zoom with the switch at the top - right of the window .
I find that the confirm - faces interface is a faster way to find new faces than the Find Faces feature and I was methodically going through each face album to find new faces this way before I discovered the smart album trick mentioned above .
[ crarko adds : Faces is not a feature I use very much , but this might get me to start .
By the way , sorry about the slow July .
I 've been on vacation a bit , and the hint queue is pretty bare at the moment .
I 'll be putting up a couple of polls related to Yosemite as we await the public beta .
Things will probably remain slow until that release . ]
THAT a healthy way of life can prevent cancer is well known .
It is also becoming clear that clean living can help those who already have tumours to survive , and may even prevent the disease from coming back .
A number of studies have shown these effects in breast cancer and colon cancer .
But how they work at a molecular level remains a mystery .
One person keen to know what is going on is Dean Ornish of the University of California , San Francisco .
Besides his academic job , he is the founding president of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute , a charitable foundation based in Sausalito , California — and , as he freely admits in the interests of full disclosure , an author of general - interest books on preventive medicine and a consultant for large food companies on how to make “ more healthful foods ” .
He was also one of the first to show scientifically that healthy living ( a low - fat vegetarian diet , plenty of exercise and — of course — no smoking ) can not merely stop , but also reverse the progress of coronary heart disease .
He and his colleagues therefore decided to look at gene activity in a group of people with cancer who had chosen to change their ways rather than undergo medical treatment , to see if that would illuminate the nature of the health - giving processes in question .
The team chose men with prostate cancer for their study .
They picked this cancer because it is slow - growing .
When such a cancer has been diagnosed early , doing nothing is a reasonable alternative to the trauma of surgery , radiation or hormone therapy .
Dr Ornish enrolled 30 such early - stage patients into a programme of “ comprehensive lifestyle changes ” .
These included a low - fat , whole - food , plant - based diet , stress management , moderate exercise and plenty of “ psychosocial group support ” .
Patients ' prostates were sampled at the start of the study , and then three months later to see what had changed .
For a gene to do its work , it has to be transcribed into a molecular messenger .
This messenger , a molecule of a substance called RNA , carries instructions to the protein - making parts of a cell , telling them what to make .
The more RNA messengers that have been transcribed from a gene , the more active that gene is assumed to be .
Count the shifting number of messengers , then , and you can see the effects on the genes of a course of treatment .
And that , using so - called gene - chip technology , is what Dr Ornish did .
He and his colleagues found that after three months , the activity of more than 500 genes was altered in the prostate in a way that might be expected to help fight cancer .
The good life turned off tumour - promoting genes ( known as oncogenes ) — including several that are the target of efforts to develop anti-cancer drugs .
Meanwhile , disease - preventing genes , including one for a protein that may help the immune system to recognise tumour cells , were switched on .
Exactly how changes in lifestyle have this effect on the genes is unclear .
But the study suggests the process reaches deep into the body 's molecular biology .
Before anyone rushes out for a quick glass of wheatgrass juice , though , there are a few caveats .
First , 30 patients is quite a small sample , so the results should be treated cautiously .
Second , there was no control group .
Though a “ before and after ” comparison like this does have some value , it is better to conduct a study in which half the participants do not receive the treatment under test , and then compare the two halves .
Nevertheless , the results are intriguing .
As far as Dr Ornish is concerned , the message is that it is wrong to be nihilistic about cancer and assume that nothing can be done because “ it is in the genes ” .
As for how much prevention is necessary , he says his earlier work showed a correlation between the degree to which patients adhere to the kind of changes he proposes and the level of improvement they make .
“ It is ” , he adds , “ all in my book . ”

To the Editor :
Re “ To Curb Traffic on the Internet , Access Providers Consider Charging by the Gigabyte ” ( news article , June 15 ) :
To the list of odious consequences of “ Internet metering , ” one more concern should be added : the threat to artistic expression .
As a screenwriter , I have watched with dismay as fewer and fewer companies have come to control both movie production and distribution .
Recently , many filmmakers have turned to the Internet as an affordable opportunity for self - distribution and thus greater artistic freedom .
It is an unfortunate reality that many Internet service providers are owned by the same companies we are trying to escape ( Time Warner and Comcast , for instance ) .
By regulating access to part of the Internet , these companies could easily limit challenges to their film and TV distribution arms , thereby diminishing artistic opportunity for the country as a whole .

Let ’s have a riot for food , since nobody is expecting such a thing :
“ We ’re still trying to figure out why so many people showed up . ”
Since the economy is going so great , food prices are so low and that price of gas makes us the envy of the world …
Milwaukee police said they have restored order but will remain outside of the Marcia P. Coggs Human Services Center after a crowd awaiting free food vouchers became unruly this morning .
it just makes no sense that 2,500 people would show up at a welfare office first thing on a Monday morning , and then start rushing the door …
Police responded to the building about 7 a.m. after 2,500 people lined up on the sidewalk and eventually began to block traffic in the street .
A number of people had rushed the door , and some people became caught in the crush ; however , there were no serious injuries , according to Schwartz .
because it ’s not like a chance for affordable housing :
In a steady stream over two days , about 3,700 people took applications , all hoping theirs will be one of the 300 drawn in a waiting list lottery for housing in Plymouth .
The turnout was a sign of a growing metro- area problem : a shortage of affordable housing .
In fact , experts had predicted it .
Each time a housing authority opens its Section 8 wait list , applicants overwhelm it .
you ’d think that people were desperate or something :
Dramatic evidence of the post - Katrina shortage of affordable housing was on view Wednesday in Kenner , where thousands of people — far more than usually turn out for this yearly event — queued up for the chance to apply for housing vouchers . …
The crowds , who first began lining up on Tuesday , were generally well - behaved .
But five people were arrested Tuesday and Wednesday for disturbing the peace , said Police Chief Steve Caraway .
Four were from New Orleans and one from Baton Rouge .
“ It ’s larger than ever before , ” Caraway said , surveying the crowd just before the office started taking applications at 9 a.m .
“ They ’re telling us there ’s people from five different states here . ”
since it ’s not like this kind of “ surprise ” has n’t happened before :

The US has released video excerpts of a controversial air strike in the Afghan - Pakistani border region which Pakistan says killed 11 of its soldiers .
The US said that the footage proves that US forces were legitimately targeting pro-Taleban militants .
It argued that its forces had acted in self - defence after coming under attack in clashes with pro-Taleban militias .
Pakistan 's military said earlier that the soldiers had died as a result of an " unprovoked and cowardly act " .
The BBC's Martin Patience in Kabul says it is unusual for the US to release video footage of its operations and indicates that the military has come under great pressure to justify the airstrike .
Pakistan - US relations hit a low Meeting feared Pakistani militant
The grainy , monochrome images - taken by an unmanned drone - show a small group of men firing small arms and rocket - propelled grenades from a ridge at coalition troops who were off camera in the valley below .
The voiceover on the footage said that the ridge was in the Afghan province of Kunar , about 182 m ( 200 yards ) from the Pakistan border .
" It is clear there are no structures or ( Pakistani ) outposts in the impact area , " the voiceover said .
It said that coalition forces were on a reconnaissance mission in the area at the time of the attack and were waiting for a helicopter to pluck them to safety .
The video showed " anti-Afghan militants " moving to positions it said were inside Pakistan and the impact of a bomb which the voiceover said killed two of them .
The survivors then fled into a cave , the video voiceover said , where three more bombs were dropped nearly three hours after the clash started .
The voiceover said all the militants were killed and that about 12 bombs were dropped in all .
Earlier , the US state department described the deaths of Pakistani soldiers in the air attack as regrettable , and said there was a need for better communication .
A hillside appeared to have been stripped bare by fighting
The incident took place on Tuesday night at a border post in the mountainous Gora Prai region of Mohmand , one of Pakistan 's tribal areas , across the border from Kunar province .
The Pakistani government summoned the American ambassador to protest in person about the disputed attack .
It comes at a time of tension between Pakistan and the US over how to deal with militants in border areas , the BBC's Kim Ghattas reports from Washington .
" Every indication we have at this point is that this was indeed a legitimate strike in defence of our forces after they came under attack , " coalition spokesman Geoff Morrell told reporters .
Sovereignty Expressing regret , the US state department said the incident was a reminder that " better cross - border communications between forces is vital " .
The 11 Pakistani soldiers were buried on Wednesday in the north - western city of Peshawar .
A Pakistani army statement said the incident had " hit at the very basis of co-operation " with the US .
Prime Minister Gilani condemned the deaths in parliament saying that Pakistan 's sovereignty was at stake .

Advertisement A spokesman for a pro-Taleban militant group in Pakistan said it had launched an attack on US and Afghan troops trying to set up a border control post .
In Peshawar , a relative of the one of those wounded in the fighting said that US troops had opened fire on both tribespeople and Pakistani soldiers .
" Then suddenly bomber aircraft came and started bombing , " Seed Aman told The Associated Press .
Lawless border
There is increasing anger in Pakistan at US strikes on its territory which have killed more than 50 people this year , says the BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad .
Taleban fighters have a strong presence in the border areas of the tribal districts and local administrators have little power there .
There is rising frustration among Nato and Afghan troops at Pakistani efforts to negotiate peace deals with pro-Taleban militants on its side of the border .
Afghan and US - led forces accuse Islamabad of not doing enough to deny Taleban militants a hiding - place in Pakistan 's tribal areas and to stop them from infiltrating the border .
Pakistan denies the accusations , saying it has lost about 1,000 soldiers fighting militants in the tribal border areas .

Reverse brain drain threatens U.S. economy By Alan M. Webber Until recently , if Americans heard the words " brain drain , " they knew clearly what that meant : Bright , talented scientists , engineers and other techies from all over the world were migrating to the United States .
They were drawn here by the world 's best universities , the most dynamic companies , the freest economic and social environment and the highest standard of living .
Today , while many of these conditions still apply , Americans are starting to hear a new term : " reverse brain drain . "
What it suggests is the United States is pursuing government and private - sector policies that , over the long run , could lead to a significant shift in the world 's balance of brainpower .
Recently , President Bush 's chief economic adviser , Gregory Mankiw , touted the advantages for U.S. firms of outsourcing jobs overseas .
But that trend , if left unattended , could have serious implications for this country 's economic competitiveness .
For its part , the federal government seems intent on letting " controversial " scientists — for example , those dealing with research that touches on the issue of abortion — go to other countries and keeping foreign talent out .
U.S. companies are happy to outsource knowledge work while , at the same time , buying out the contracts of their most experienced workers — all in the name of reducing costs .
And the one sure way to grow new brains — a high - quality educational system — has failed to produce enough homegrown talent .
As the economy globalizes , and as first - class creative minds go abroad , stay abroad or are produced abroad , other nations may challenge the United States ' role as the leader in innovation and creativity .
The prospect of that challenge tomorrow — more than the loss of jobs today — is what the debate over America 's economic future ought to be about .
First , recent government policies are sending talented U.S. - based researchers overseas and clamping down on the arrival of new researchers to this country .
A recent article by Carnegie Mellon professor Richard Florida in The Washington Monthly magazine makes a persuasive case that the Bush administration 's policies are shooting this country 's economy in the , well , the brain .
Florida 's book ,
The Rise of the Creative Class , demonstrates that the most competitive communities are those that have the highest concentration of talented individuals , a high degree of technological innovation and a high level of tolerance for diverse lifestyles .
But , Florida says , the United States is losing its edge in these categories .
He cites the case of Roger Pederson , one of the leaders in stem - cell research , who left his job at the University of California to pursue research in the United Kingdom .
Why ?
The British government recruited him at the same time the Bush administration was clamping down on stem - cell research .
Losses such as Pederson 's are n't being filled by enough new arrivals .
Talented foreigners are n't coming here , sometimes because we are n't letting them in .
A National Science Board study found that U.S. visas for immigrants to work in science and technology dropped by 55 % from 2001 to 2002 , largely because of the post - 9/11 clampdown .
Second , American firms are contributing aggressively to the reverse brain drain .
For decades , they shifted blue - collar manufacturing jobs to parts of the world with low labor costs and acceptable quality standards .
Now , they are outsourcing knowledge work — engineering , software , product design and development — to such countries as China , India and Russia .
Intel CEO Craig Barrett has warned that Russia , China and India already have as many as 250 million to 500 million knowledge workers — the kind of highly educated , technologically skilled employees who can write computer code , design sophisticated products and manage high - end production processes .
Companies that contract with these foreign workers are , in effect , outsourcing their brains .
In the short term , they may save money and boost profits .
In the longer run , they outsource creativity and , gradually , erode their capacity to generate new products and services .
At the same time , U.S. companies are offering early retirement or attractive buyout opportunities to their most experienced , most knowledgeable and most expensive workers , in the name of economic savings .
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the percentage of Americans ages 55 - 64 who are gainfully employed continues to drop from mid-1960s highs .
The thinking behind this strategy is the same as for sending knowledge work overseas : find newer , often younger , replacement workers at lower cost .
It 's a fool 's bargain .
Foreign or younger workers cannot replace what the older workers contribute in the way of institutional memory , long - term relationships and applied creativity .
The company loses both the knowledge capital and social capital that come with long - term , smart , high - performing workers .
Finally , the problem of a reverse brain drain is exacerbated by the continuing crisis in American education .
A recent column by Nicholas Kristof in The New York Times makes the point that U.S. education simply is doing a lousy job in math and science .
The most recent international ranking of eighth - graders from around the world in math and science put the United States 19th , just after Latvia .
India and China were not included in that trends survey — but it's a safe bet that if they had been , the U.S. would have slid to 21st .
Why does this matter ?
Consider Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 's testimony this month before the Senate Banking Committee .
When asked about outsourcing and the rising U.S. trade deficit , Greenspan sagely commented that education , not trade or outsourcing , would determine the fate of U.S. workers .
No one disputes the fact that , when it comes to economic dynamism , the United States still ranks at the top .
But the combination of these " reverse brain drain " policies presents a clear danger to America 's future competitiveness .
The long - term trends in the world economy are clear :
We are shifting inexorably toward a knowledge economy , where productive , well - paid work is based on ideas , information and adaptive thinking .
Work involves more intangibles ( brains ) and fewer tangibles ( muscles ) .
The country and the companies with the best brains will win .
The only way for the United States to out - think , outsmart and out - innovate the competition , is to look hard at government policies that either send our best brains overseas or discourage more brains from coming here ; to question business practices that increase reliance on foreign brains while " buying out " our own ; and to demand more from our education system .
It 's not too late to stanch the reverse brain drain .
But first we have to put our own brains to work on the problem .

VIENNA ( Reuters ) -
They knew it would be risky to exhibit a homoerotic version of Christ ’s Last Supper , but curators at museum of Vienna ’s Roman Catholic Cathedral were n’t ready for a barrage of angry messages and calls to be shut down .
The source of the dispute , which Austrian media has dubbed Vienna ’s version of the Mohammad caricature row , is a retrospective honoring Austria ’s cherished artist Alfred Hrdlicka , who turned 80 earlier this year .
But not everyone has been wishing Hrdlicka a Happy Birthday .
And the Cathedral Museum ’s director and Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn , the archbishop of Vienna , have both come under fire from some museum visitors and Catholic websites .
The Church hastily removed the main picture , “ a homosexual orgy ” of the Apostles as Hrdlicka describes it .
But the protest has continued , much to the surprise of the small Cathedral Museum which is nestled down a narrow street in Vienna ’s historic Gothic quarter .
The museum ’s director defends both Hrdlicka ’s work and his decision to host the artist ’s controversial versions of biblical imagery in a museum tied to the Catholic Church .
“ We think Hrdlicka is entitled to represent people in this carnal , drastic way , ” Bernhard Boehler said in his small museum office , across the street from Vienna ’s imposing St. Stephan ’s Cathedral .
He said the museum never intended to offend people but that art should be allowed to provoke a debate .
“ I do n’t see any blasphemy here , ” he said , gesturing at a Crucifixion picture showing a soldier simultaneously beating Jesus and holding his genitals .
“ People can imagine what they want to . ”
Boehler says that picture drew particular criticism from some visitors , along with a sculpture of Jesus on the cross without a face or loincloth that some Christians found offensive .
But the most disputed work was ‘ Leonardo ’s Last Supper , restored by Pier Paolo Pasolini ’ which showed cavorting Apostles sprawling over the dining table and masturbating each other .
Hrdlicka says he represented the men in this way because there are no women in the Da Vinci painting which inspired it .
Pasolini was a controversial Italian filmmaker and writer who was murdered in the 1970s .
The exhibition has attracted fierce criticism on religion blogs in Austria , Germany and even in the United States , with bloggers denouncing it with terms such as “ blasphemy ” and “ desecration . ”
“ The exhibition should never have taken place .
The Director should apologize to Catholics worldwide for this , ” an article on conservative Catholic website kreuz .
net said .
In the United States , conservative columnist Rod Dreher wrote on his widely read religion blog “ I would n’t have guessed that , given his reputation , a man like ( Cardinal ) Schoenborn would have stood for this abomination for half a second . ”
The museum took down the Last Supper piece at Cardinal Schoenborn ’s request just over a week after the ‘ Religion , Flesh and Power ’ exhibition opened , leaving a blank black wall at the entrance to the display .
“ This has nothing to do with censorship , rather corresponds with the understood “ reverence for the sacred , ” the Cardinal ’s spokesman said in a statement .
“ It is also an act of respect towards those believers who feel this portrayal offended and provoked them in their deepest religious sensitivity . ”
The diocese says the museum ’s decision to show Hrdlicka ’s work does not mean it identifies with everything it portrays .
Hrdlicka agrees but points out that the Last Supper piece was not intended as a swipe at the Catholic Church .
“ There was such a reaction to its physicality .
For me it was quite surprising the museum wanted to show the piece in the first place , ” he told Reuters by telephone .
“ If the Cathedral Museum is having problems now , it ’s not really my affair , it ’s for the Cathedral Museum to deal with . ”
He said overall he was pleased with the display and praised the director for being “ strong ” .
A communist and atheist , Hrdlicka has said the Bible is the most thrilling book he has ever read and that religious imagery forms a central core to his work .
Boehler says the angry emails he has received remind him of how some reacted to Mel Gibson ’s 2004 film “ The Passion of The Christ ” .
In his opinion , critics of the film ’s violence and physicality also missed the point .
“ The Crucifixion was brutal and it would be a lie to say everything in our world is nice , ” he said , pointing out that Hrdlicka is an anti-war activist who has seen the effects of Nazism and violence first hand .
“ We in Europe have been affected by this and it influences how we see ( Hrdlicka ’s ) work . ”
Boehler , like Hrdlicka , says the art debate can be compared to the Danish cartoon row , where an image of the Prophet Mohammad with a bomb in his turban enraged some in the Muslim world who saw it as blasphemous .
The angry reaction to Hrdlicka ’s work has only been verbal and the museum says some Christians have been balanced and support the exhibition , despite disagreeing with the artist ’s approach .
Curator Martina Judt said the exhibition was meant to prompt this kind of balanced reaction .
The museum wanted to show that controversial works inspired by religious imagery can be discussed without taboo .
“ People have said the Catholic Church has become a lot more liberal , ” she said .
“ But in the end , the reactions show this perhaps is n’t the case . ”
ANTANANARIVO ( Reuters ) - Some 55 dolphins have died , after coming ashore on a beach in the northwest of Madagascar , conservationists said on Monday .
The melon - headed whales , a species of dolphin , were first spotted at sea last month , but then became stranded on a beach last week , Herilala Randriamahazo , from the Wildlife Conservation Society , a non-profit organization , told Reuters .
“ We have counted 55 dead dolphins today , ” Randriamahazo said by telephone from Antsohihy , the seaside town where the dolphins died .
They were buried in a mass grave , he said .
American specialists had arrived on Monday to examine possible reasons for the beaching and to lead some remaining dolphins out to sea , he said .
“ This is the first time that Madagascar has seen such sea animals , ” he said .
A spokeswoman for the Indian Ocean island ’s environment ministry said the dolphins had created a stir .
“ Lots of people are going to Antsohihy to see these animals for the first time , ” she said .

Aspartame Fact Sheet
Equal® - NutraSweet ®
The " Real Facts " - Are You At Risk ?
The safety of aspartame has been an ongoing controversy for over 27 years .
Despite claims by the sweetener industry that aspartame is " safe " because it is FDA approved , the information in this fact sheet clears up any disinformation and sets the record straight .
The consumer advocates listed in this fact sheet have been informing and educating consumers about the dangers of aspartame for many years .
They are some of the most reliable sources , providing the most updated research confirming aspartame is a carcinogen and should never have been approved by the FDA to be used in the public food supply .
THE FACTS : Aspartame is in over 6,000 products including 99 % of all chewing gum and children ’s medicine .
The American FDA first approved aspartame ( NutraSweet ® / Equal® ) Aspartame 's initial approval was quickly rescinded , nonetheless , because it was shown in laboratory studies to cause brain lesions and carcinogenic tumors .
After 10 years of corporate research studies , final FDA approval was secured in 1981 shortly after President Reagan appointed new FDA Director , Dr. Arthur H. Hayes .
ASPARTAME TOXIC EFFECTS
Aspartame breaks down into : Phenylalanine 50 % - In 1987 , Dr. Louis J. Elsas , Emory University , told a US Senate Committee , " In the developing fetus , phenylalanine could be magnified four to six fold …
The effect would be expressed as mental retardation or potential certain birth defects . "
Phenylalanine lowers the brain seizure threshold .
According to neurosurgeon , Dr. Russell Blaylock , MD , phenylalanine crosses the blood brain barrier , blocking the production of serotonin , a key neurotransmitter which controls moods and sleep patterns .
Reported psychological symptoms are : Suicidal Depressions - Panic Attacks and Anxiety [ PAD ] - Manias - Sleep Disorders - Severe Mood Disorders [ rages , mood swings ] - Brain Chemical Imbalance o Brain Wave Malfunctions [ shows up in EEGs ] - Personality Disorders - Hallucinations - Aspartic Acid 40 % - Dr. John Olney , MD , warned GD Searle representatives that aspartic acid caused lesions , or holes , to form in the brains of his lab animals .
In 1986 , Dr. Olney appeared on CBS " 60 minutes " with his findings , but nothing to date , has come of his research .
The methanol in aspartame breaks down into formaldehyde ( embalming fluid ) and formic acid , which is the same as the chemical compound of venom in insect stings .
At temperatures exceeding 86 degrees Fahrenheit ( the average human body temperature is 98.6 F. ) , methanol is implicated in birth defects and fetal alcohol syndrome in newborn infants .
Before aspartame approval , 1 in 1500 infants were born with autism .
Today , the number has risen to 1 in 150 .
Methanol expert , Dr. Woodrow Monte , PhD , writes in Aspartame : Methanol and the Public Health : " For every molecule of aspartame , there is a molecule of methanol released . "
Classic signs of methanol poisoning include : lethargy , confusion , leg cramps , back pain , severe headache , abdominal pain , slurred speech , fainting , visual loss / blindness , labored breathing .
Because of its ability to pass into the brain , aspartame exacerbates or can cause the following medical conditions : Epilepsy , Parkinson's , Alzheimer 's , Multiple Sclerosis , Chronic Fatigue Syndrome , Lymphoma Fibromyalgia / Eosinophilia Myalgia , Mental Retardation / Birth Defects , Diabetes / Hypoglycemia , Graves Disease , Heart Disease , Lung Disease , Liver Disease , Kidney Disease , Brain Tumors [ astrocytoma/glioblastoma ] , Pancreatic Disease , Kidney / Adrenal Disease , Arthritis , Blindness , Tinnitus , PMS , Carpal Tunnel , Lyme Disease , Muniere 's Disease , Other : Rare / Hard to diagnose disorders
In animals tested from 1971 to 1974 , the results showed that 13 out of 320 lab animals developed brain tumors .
In addition , 73 of 145 female rats developed gross mammary tumors .
Dr. Adrian Gross , FDA toxicologist , in a letter to Congress , Oct. 30 , 1986 , stated , " In any such study of even a few hundred test animals , it takes no more than a dozen or so of them to exhibit a particular lesion ... to associate with the test agent , aspartame or its related chemicals . "
In addition , Pathologist Dr. Charles H. Frith spent 3 days with the FDA to review the 145 animals from this toxicity study .
Sufficient slides substantiated 73 female animals with grossly observed tumor masses .
" The Bressler Report " can be read at http://www.presidiotex.com/bressler
Current aspartame research findings :
In the last two years , the Ramazzini Cancer Institute , led by Dr. Morando Soffritti , Bologna , Italy , released two studies confirming the toxicity of aspartame and its carcinogenic effects .
The results of the 8 - year aspartame study ( March , 2006 ) in which 1,800 rats were exposed to different doses of aspartame over a 36 month time period concluded that aspartame , even at low dosages , is multi-carcinogenic , including the formation of leukemia and lymphoma in the laboratory animals .
The latest study at Purdue University , Artificial Sweeteners Increase Weight Gain Odds , showed that diet products increase hunger and cause weight gain .
The Framingham Study showed the increased risk of heart attack and metabolic syndrome disorders .
WHAT YOU CAN DO TO INFORM OTHERS : Copy and distribute this Fact Sheet to everyone you know .
If you are using any products containing aspartame and have been experiencing adverse physical or emotional health symptoms , stop using all diet products for a period of 4 - 6 weeks .
If you are under medical treatment for any recent health concerns and are / were an aspartame user - have your doctor enter into your official medical record that you suspect that aspartame may have caused some , if not all , of your symptoms , and that you are stopping use of the diet sweeteners and want to be " monitored " by your health care team as you get better .
Very Important ...
If You Care About Your Health
The Health of Your Children and Grandchildren ...
Get Involved - Spread The Word !
Write to your Congress person and write letters to the FDA and food manufacturers who use aspartame .
Copy the editor of your local newspaper , stating your displeasure about the silencing of and lack of information about the facts concerning aspartame by government and industry .
Take all aspartame products ( opened or not ) back to the store and exchange them for healthy " whole " foods .
This sends a message to the manufacturer that consumers will no longer tolerate neurotoxins in our foods and in our children 's products .
The following are the most reputable websites available on the worldwide web to educate consumers on the true facts about the dangers of aspartame .
Visit these websites to learn more about the dangers of aspartame and the other artificial chemical sweeteners on the market today .

HER NEW BOOK ON SPLENDA ®
Splenda® : Is It Safe or Not ?
Dr. Janet Hull has a new book .
Splenda® is just as deadly as aspartame .
What is the chemical makeup of Splenda® ?
Sucralose also known as Splenda® is synthesized by this five - step process :
1. sucrose is tritylated with trityl chloride in the presence of dimethylformamide and 4 - methylmorpholine and the tritylated sucrose is then acetylated with acetic anhydride ,
2. the resulting TRISPA ( 6,1',6 ' - tri - O - trityl - penta - O- acetylsucrose ) is chlorinated with hydrogen chloride in the presence of toluene ,
3. the resulting 4 - PAS ( sucrose 2,3,4,3', 4'- pentaacetate ) is heated in the presence of methyl isobutyl ketone and acetic acid ,
4. the resulting 6 - PAS ( sucrose 2,3,6,3', 4'- pentaacetate ) is chlorinated with thionyl chloride in the presence of toluene and benzyltriethylammonium chloride , and
5. the resulting TOSPA ( sucralose pentaacetate ) is treated with methanol ( wood alcohol , a poison ) in the presence of sodium methoxide to produce sucralose .
So sucralose becomes a low - calorie sugar with a complicated process that results in Splenda ’s® chemical formula :
1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-BETA-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-4-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranoside .
This is Splenda® .
Are you sure now you want to be consuming these deadly chemicals ?
Sucalrose is also in many food products , including over the counter drug medications , like Rolaids antacid .
Also , Listerine 's new Citrus mouth wash .
Make sure you read the labels .
In addition , it contains these deadly chemicals , some known to cause cancer in animals , some are even listed on the EPA as poisons :
Acetone - Acetic acid - Acetyl alcohol - Acetic anhydride - Ammonium chloride
Benzene - Chlorinated sulfates - Ethyl alcohol - Isobutyl ketones
Formaldehyde
Hydrogen chloride - Lithium chloride
Methanol - Sodium methoxide
Sulfuryl chloride - Trityl chloride - Thionyl chloride - Toulene

And this is the person that first alerted Consumers about this deadly chemical ...
A spartame C onsumer S afety N etwork
Mary Stoddard and Washington D.C. Attorney , Jim Turner's
Aspartame Consumer Safety Network .
Mary was the first consumer advocate in 1987 before all others
in educating consumers about this deadly chemical sweetener .
Stoddard 's and Turner 's site provide eye opening information about the artificial sweetener , aspartame - presented in a rational , intelligent manner .
Both are the original pioneers of the international anti-aspartame movement .
Journalist , Mary Nash Stoddard and Washington attorney , James Turner , Esq. have been instrumental in educating the general public around the world as to the reported dangers of aspartame .
Their website is where people go to when they have questions about this issue and need answers from the experts .
About Mary Nash Stoddard
Author / Broadcast Journalist / Expert Medical Witness / Food Safety Consultant
Mary co-founded the massive international anti-aspartame movement in the mid 1980's , following the brain tumor death of her forty two year old husband , Mike .
In 1985 , Ms. Stoddard suffered a life threatening aspartame - related blood disorder , whereupon , The NutraSweet Co. offered her an all - expense paid vacation for two anywhere in the world , if she would agree to be tested by their doctors .
She declined , with the blessing of her doctor , and the rest is history .
She has conducted multi-national lecture tours and is a popular visiting professor at colleges , universities and medical schools .
Stoddard 's efforts over the past nearly two decades has led to the present rejection of the sweetener by many of the food and beverage giants of industry .
These companies rush to distance themselves from the liabilities associated with use of a neuro - toxic substance in their products .
She has testified in court as an Expert Medical Witness and like her famous counterpart , Erin Brockovitch , has helped with a number of lawsuits on behalf of consumers .
Her powerful message has reached millions around the world through the airwaves on radio and television , in print and personal appearances .
Stoddard also wrote " Deadly Deception - Story of Aspartame " , a toxicology sourcebook , edited by Ms. Stoddard .
The book was the first book written about the dangers of aspartame .
The book documents the harmful effects of the world 's most toxic artificial sweetener .
The 250 page toxicology sourcebook is endorsed by doctors , scientists , medical reporters and mentioned by Dr. Robert Atkins on his radio show in New York .
The companion one hour " Deadly Deception " video is further documentation - taped at a prestigious scientific conference .
You can purchase both , as well as audio tapes and CD's at Stoddard 's website .
Make sure you read Stoddard 's recent article concerning her warnings of the recent decision of the IADSA to increase food additives in foods , even in babies foods .

Robert Lupo of Santa Rosa had never been on an airplane until last month , when he flew to India to get his hip replaced .
The 45 - year - old self - employed contractor had dropped his Kaiser coverage before an uninsured driver hit him last summer while he was riding his motorcycle .
A $ 50,000 settlement covered those medical bills and living expenses while he was unable to work , but Lupo later learned he needed a hip replacement - a $ 30,000 price he could n't afford .
With pain as his primary motivator , Lupo started researching his options online .
He eventually found his way to WorldMed Assist , a 2 - year - old Concord company that is part of a growing industry that makes arrangements for Americans to get medical care abroad .

Lupo's hip surgery and hospital stay cost $ 8,880 at Wockhardt Hospital in Bangalore .
Even with the $ 1,300 airfare , the procedure totaled about a third of what it would have cost Lupo at a local hospital .
" My hip feels great , " said Lupo , who was recovering at home while making magnets out of photographs from India to send back to the nurses and hospital staff in Bangalore .
" But I really do n't want to go to another Third World country again , to tell you the truth , unless I had to .
This was a means to an end .
But the pain was so bad I would have swum the English Channel if that 's what it took . "
No official statistics are kept on how many Americans travel overseas for medical care , but one estimate places the number at 150,000 in 2006 .
Other trends are more clear - cut .
Many Americans are uninsured - nearly 47 million at last count - and others have health insurance that does not adequately cover procedures they desperately want or need .
A medical tourism industry has grown to facilitate global health travel .
A trade association to represent these companies formed last year .
Also last year , a major insurer started a separate company to help members seek international care .
Crossing international borders for medical care is not new .
For decades , Americans have sought certain types of care in other countries , specifically elective or cosmetic procedures , along with treatments that are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
But now , industry experts say , Americans are going overseas for increasingly complex surgeries .
In addition , more patients seem willing to accept that quality of care in some foreign hospitals may be the same or higher as that found on U.S. soil , at a fraction of the cost .
Wouter Hoeberechts , chief executive of WorldMed Assist , does n't like the term medical tourism because he says it trivializes the industry by conjuring up images of post - operative patients recuperating on the beach drinking margaritas .
" Typically , what we have seen is people who want to save money - who do n't have insurance or have poor insurance , " he said , adding that his company is paid by the international hospital rather than by patient fees .
" But we 're seeing a shift where it 's not just all about money .
Quality is becoming very important . "
Huge savings involved
Unquestionably , the price differential is the main draw .
Heart bypass surgery , which can cost more than $ 130,000 in the United States , can be performed for $ 10,000 in India and $ 19,000 in Turkey .
Gastric bypass surgery , typically $ 18,000 to $ 25,000 , can be done for $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 in many other countries , while the newer " lap band " procedure , which costs about $ 16,000 here , can be performed for half that price in countries like Mexico and Turkey .
Hoeberechts ' company recently arranged for a Florida landscaper to have a liver transplant expected to cost $ 350,000 in the United States for just $ 55,000 in India .
But will the quality of care be as good as here at home ?
That depends on whom you talk to .
Industry experts recommend going to foreign hospitals with recognized international accreditation , such as from Joint Commission International or the International Society for Quality in Health Care Inc .
WorldMed Assist , for example , works with just five hospital groups in four countries , all of which are certified by Joint Commission International , a nonprofit U.S. organization that accredits overseas hospitals .
A native of The Netherlands , Hoeberechts said his company does not work with facilities in countries that permit citizens to donate organs to foreigners .
American physicians warn that patients who seek care overseas for complex procedures such as orthopedic surgeries may underestimate the potential for something to go wrong , both overseas and upon their return .
" Everything is made in China now .
It does n't have to be that way for health care , " said Dr. Robert Klapper , chief of orthopedic surgery at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and spokesman for the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons .
" You take major risks when you go elsewhere . "
Klapper admitted he typically ends up seeing only those who run into trouble but said that such complications happen and that puts local surgeons at a disadvantage because they lack information about the procedure .
Fresno surgeon Kelvin Higa , president of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery , said that in addition to wanting to save money , patients often travel overseas out of frustration because health insurance carriers make it so difficult for them to get surgery for obesity .
While he does not recommend going overseas for care unless patients have no alternatives , he said he understands the allure of the savings .
" I outsource my dictation to India because of the price difference .
I understand medical tourism , " he said .
" Adjustable banding is half the price in Tijuana than it is San Diego .
If the company sells the lap band to Mexico for a third of what they sell it to a United States hospital , how can you compete with that ? "
The medical tourism industry typically caters to those who do not have insurance or whose insurance will not cover the treatment they seek .
But one major insurer - Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina - last year became the first U.S. health plan to form a subsidiary to help its members seek care abroad .
Companion Global
Healthcare works with major employers to offer employee members the option of seeking health care abroad at one of its seven partner hospitals accredited by Joint Commission International .
The benefit is a cost savings to primarily companies that are self - insured , meaning those firms that take on the risk of medical costs incurred by their employees .
A companion plan
Still in its infancy , Companion Global Healthcare has served only three patients , said David Boucher , assistant vice president of health care services for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina and Companion Global Healthcare .
" We 're not sending people out of the country .
We know an increasing number of members are going out of the country for care ; what we 're trying to do is make it a little easier for them if they choose to do it , " said Boucher , adding that he thinks the service will take off if employers provide financial incentives for patients to choose overseas care .
A trade group for the growing industry , the Medical Tourism Association , was formed last year to help protect the reputation of quality businesses that help people seek care overseas as well as provide standards and guidelines , said Renee - Marie Stephano , general counsel and chief operating officer for the group , which has just 12 facilitator members .
" We establish a series of best practices and we have ethical guidelines .
We promote the highest quality of care so any unethical behavior would not be tolerated , " said Stephano , adding the group does not condone such practices as commercial surrogacy , organ selling and some unapproved treatments for life - threatening conditions .
Lupo , who otherwise would not have been able to afford surgery , praised the quality of care by the nurses and doctors in the Bangalore hospital , which he said was every bit as modern as an American facility .
His new hip was more than worth the 28 - hour travel time , the occasional mosquito in his hospital room and the fight with a taxi driver who tried to take him to his uncle 's rug shop instead of his destination , he said .
The experience also gave him a greater appreciation of life at home .
" We 've got a lot of stuff that 's wrong here , " Lupo said .
" I left here thinking this really sucks that I have to go to another country to get hip surgery because I can't afford it .
But after I got it done and got back , I realized we do n't really have it that bad . "
Medical procedures without borders More Americans are going overseas for health care .
Here are tips when considering having surgery performed abroad : -- Research your alternatives , starting with exhausting the possibility of getting care in the United States and whether it 's worth getting treatment elsewhere .
The procedure must be expensive enough to make the trip worthwhile , considering the added costs of travel and accommodations .
It also must have a relatively short recovery time and predictable follow - up care .
--
Consider working with a company that can facilitate the care , travel and transfer of medical documents and other information .
--
Investigate the background and training of the surgeon as well as the quality of the foreign hospital .
Avoid politically unstable countries . --
Make sure follow - up care is available upon your return .
For those with coverage , insurance may or may not cover the cost of post - operative care or complications associated with procedures performed overseas .

Global warming has caused dramatic shifts in some aquatic communities in which fish populations die off and lobsters , crabs and squid move in .
The finding comes from a new analysis of 50 years worth of fish - trawling data collected in Narragansett Bay and adjacent Rhode Island Sound but may apply elsewhere , researchers said .
Resident fish communities have progressively shifted from vertebrate species ( fish ) to the invertebrates ( lobsters and crabs ) ; from bottom - feeders to species that find their food higher up in the water column ; and from larger , cool - water species to smaller , warm - water dwellers .
" This is a pretty dramatic change , and it's a pattern that is being seen in other ecosystems … but we 're in the relatively unique position of being able to document it , " said Jeremy Collie of the University of Rhode Island , leader of the new study .
Collie said that while most of the changes observed in the survey occurred slowly , an abrupt change appeared to take place in 1980 and 1981 when benthic species ( or bottom - feeders ) , such as winter flounder and silver hake , declined and pelagic species ( or those that feed closer to the surface ) , such as butterfish and bluefish , increased .
" We think there has been a shift in the food web resulting in more of the productivity being consumed in the water column , " Collie explained .
" Phytoplankton are increasingly being grazed by zooplankton , which are then eaten by planktivorous fish , rather than the phytoplankton sinking to the bottom and being consumed by bottom fish .
It 's a rerouting of that production from the bottom to the top . "
Collie also noted that it was the decline of benthic species that had freed up the bottom of the bay for lobsters and crabs to move in .
And while the number of fish caught in each trawl increased over time , the size of those fish decreased , which Collie attributes to rising sea surface temperatures in the area — which increased by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ( 2 degrees Celsius ) since 1959 — because " fish that live in warmer water are smaller . "
Fishing could also be a factor because it tends to remove the largest fish from the community , but Collie thinks that climate is " the dominant signal . "
The findings of the study will be presented in the July issue of the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences .
The weekly trawl is funded by the University of Rhode Island .

Top 10 Surprising Results of Global Warming

WASHINGTON , DC -- Contrary to the popular perception of a so - called " opting out revolution , " new sociological research from the June issue of the American Sociological Review reveals that professional women 's employment rates have continually pushed higher over time , and that the employment gap between mothers and childless women is shrinking .
To determine the truth behind the opting out phenomenon described in mass media reports , sociologist Christine Percheski examined trends among college - educated women born between 1906 and 1975 and found that professional women 's employment levels have made steep gains over time , especially for mothers of young children and women in historically male professions .
Despite anecdotal reports of successful working women returning to the home to assume child care responsibilities , less than 8 percent of professional women born since 1956 leave the workforce for a year or more during their prime childbearing years , according to the study .
Percheski's research shows that the number of women with young children who work full - time year - round has increased steadily , growing from a rate of 5.6 percent of women born 1926 to 1935 ( referred to as the " Baby Boom Parents " by Percheski ) , to 38.1 percent of women from Generation X ( born 1966 to 1975 ) .
More professional Generation X mothers of young children were working full - time year - round than their counterparts in any previous generation .
Percheski finds that among mothers of older children ( those age 6 to 18 ) , full - time employment is the norm for professional women of Generation X .
When examining general labor force participation rates , Percheski finds even more drastic growth .
About a third of women with young children from the Baby Boom Parents group participated in the labor force while their children were under age 6 , but the rate increased to a little more than three - quarters for Generation X mothers of young children .
According to Percheski , the employment gains of recent cohorts do not seem to have been achieved through reductions in fertility , as fertility levels have remained similar across women born from 1946 to 1975 .
Not only are more women with children working , but Percheski's research shows a trend of women working longer hours .
The percentage of professional women working more than 50 hours a week increased from less than 10 percent of women born before 1935 to more than 15 percent for most women born after 1956 .
Long hours were more common even for mothers of young children .
Ten percent of Generation X mothers with young children worked more than 50 hours a week ; but just over 1 percent of their Baby Boom Parent counterparts worked more than 50 hours a week .
For those with older children , the rate was 15 percent of Generation Xers working long hours versus about 2 percent of Baby Boom Parents doing so .
Percheski also examined the characteristics of professional , college - educated women in their main reproductive years , ages 25 to 39 , who were not employed or enrolled in school the previous year .
Although the vast majority of non-working women have children at home , Percheski found that an increasing percentage of women in the younger groups she studied did not .
Fewer of these non-working women were married as well .
Percheski asserts that this is evidence of the weakening influence of children and marriage on women 's employment rates .
" Contrary to an opt - out revolution , professional women -- including mothers of young children -- are working more than ever , " said Percheski .
" Despite this increase in women 's employment , we can not assume that combining professional work and family life is easy for most women .
Indeed , many working women successfully combine these roles by making great personal sacrifices , including curtailing their sleep , civic involvement or leisure time . "
Percheski used cross-sectional data from the U.S. Census and the American Community Survey to examine trends by 10 - year birth cohorts of college - educated professional and managerial women in the United States from 1960 to 2005 .
She analyzed labor force participation ; full - time , year - round employment ; and work hours exceeding 50 hours per week .
She is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Sociology and the Office of Population Research at Princeton University .
Sociologists have also studied the factors that affect the decisions of the small percentage of women who do " opt out " of the workforce .
The fall 2007 issue of the American Sociological Association 's Contexts magazine included sociologist Pamela Stone 's examination of " The Rhetoric and Reality of Opting Out , " in which Stone describes the home and workplace dynamics that contribute to these decisions .

“ There were a lot of voices saying , ‘ Why do this now ?
Why do we have to do this now ? ’ ” Mrs. Boxer said , opening the Democrats ’ argument for the bill .
“ Because it is , in fact , one of the greatest challenges of our generation and we have to respond with a landmark bill , and it will take us awhile and we must get started . ”
The bill is a revision of a plan proposed last year by Mr. Warner and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman , independent of Connecticut .
The measure would reduce American production of climate - altering gases by nearly 70 percent from current levels by 2050 .
It would provide billions of dollars in subsidies for energy conservation and environmentally clean technologies , creating millions of jobs , proponents say .
The sale of the permits would raise more than $ 5 trillion for the government in the coming decades , money that the bill proposes to distribute to affected industries , consumers and local governments in one of the biggest programs of redistribution of American wealth in history .
The bill ’s proponents say the money would help pay for a technological leap that would create millions of new jobs while cleaning the atmosphere .
Given the timing and the range of opposition , it appears unlikely that the bill will pass the Senate .
( Similar efforts are under way in the House . )
President Bush has stated opposition to the mandatory emissions limits and numerous other provisions .
But history shows that far - reaching environmental legislation often gets off to a slow start , then passes both houses of Congress and is signed into law when the political time is ripe .
“ If we get a majority or even close , we will be that much closer to addressing global warming and passing legislation in the next Congress , whoever the president is , ” said David Doniger , director of climate policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council .
“ We may not get it done this year , but if not we start next year just a few steps from the finish line . ”
Senator Bob Corker , a freshman Republican from Tennessee , said in an interview that he favored a cap - and - trade program in theory but found serious flaws in the bill .
He will be among those seeking to derail it .

Maine 's main pain maintains train of disdain
by Jeremy Hooper
Maine 's most indefatigable gay rights foe , Mike Heath , has begun rallying his troops in anticipation for yet another ignoble attempt to stem the tide of reasoned progress .
In a new post to his site , Heath says the following about the gay community 's goals and the reasons he sees for why such need to be halted in the Pine Tree State :
We must launch a referendum to stop Maine from endorsing the special legal right to sexual promiscuity .
So called " gay " activists want to rob our civilization of the legal and social concept of marriage .
They want to replace it with a very special ( in the bad sense ) construct called civil unions .
Everyone has the right to marry already .
Nobody should have legal rights that are premised on being sexually promiscuous !
NO SPECIAL RIGHTS FOR HOMOSEXUALITY !
PERIOD !!
Uhm , legal rights " premised on being sexually promiscuous " ?
Gee , and here we thought we were pushing for the freedom to marry the partner of either gender of one 's choosing , not for marriage that 's limited only to those who 've f***ed at least ten people in the past month .
What fools we have been !
But then after those " wise " words regarding the " special " right to marry someone who you actually want to have sex with , Heath goes on to ( a ) detail his plans for keeping gays ' ring fingers free of metal , and ( b ) solicit reader opinions to help him shape his agenda .
He says :
We are going to need hundreds of volunteers to gather signatures .
We will gather signatures at the polls in June and November .
We will present our petition to the government in January 2009 .
Our referendum -- which will prevail at the ballot , I have no doubt of that -- will be voted by all the people of Maine in November of 2009 .
Our referendum petition will prohibit recognition of civil unions and same sex marriage , at the very least .
At this point this is just me talking .
I need to hear from you .
I need your ideas .
Most of all , I need your show of support to be persuaded that I should even recommend this to my board .
The forces that want same sex marriage are gathering meaningless signed post cards to present to the Legislature next year .
We need to gather meaningful signatures .
If we spread the task across many churches and individuals we can do it without stressing anybody out .
Let 's pull together and do the right thing .
Let 's say NO to special rights for homosexuality once and for all .
Email me at [ email protected ]
Okay , first off :
We 're a bit frightened by the whole " will prohibit recognition of civil unions and same sex marriage , at the very least " line .
Because to be perfectly frank , to be gay is to never completely discount to what extreme place your opposition might take its campaigns of demonization .
So when they say that denying marriage and even civil union equality , a HUGE issue for many LGBT people , is just the " very least " of what they have up their sleeve , we can't help but shiver when we think of what they might consider at the " very worst " end of their anti-gay spectrum .
Does it involve exportation , cages , forced therapy ?
EEK !
But moving past our valid trepidation regarding our opposition 's endgame :
We 're thinking that all of us who find peace in progress and tumult in discrimination have a responsibility to write Mike and tell him what we , the ones who are dehumanized by his rhetoric , would like to say about his falsely righteous endeavors .
So whatdya say , " special " gays and their allies -- since Mike has handily provided his contact information , why do n't we each drop him a calm yet firm message explaining how our equality is not " special , " our sex lives are not innately " promiscuous , " and our bodies and souls are not deserving of the cruel bombardments that he and his ilk have been firing at both for decades ?
After all , do n't our lives matter when it comes to the matter of our lives ?
Sure Mike probably wo n't listen , since the major problem of this so - called " culture war " is the anti-gay side 's refusal to actually deal with the real , tangible human beings who are drastically affected by their actions .
However , we can't help but believe that when all is quiet in their heads , some of what we say HAS to register .
Rhetoric is easy to print and pass off to unsuspecting folks .
But it 's much more difficult to convince your brain that what you know in your heart to be bullshit is truly " fact . "
And it 's also more difficult to shun a person to their face , either real or virtual , than it is to midlessly tell a like - minded choir that the dude who lives down the road and does n't bother anyone is a " sick pervert " in need of saving !
So let 's do it -- let 's give him a face and dare him to shun .
And if he does spit ion your eye , by all means let us know !

In a world first , a University of Melbourne study has shown that topical oestrogen could help prevent HIV infection by blocking entry of the virus into the human penis .
The study to be published in PLoS ONE journal June 4 reveals that application of oestrogen to the human penis increased the thickness of the natural keratin layer on the skin , which could prevent HIV from infecting the male .
The epithelium of the human penis is richly supplied with oestrogen receptors suggesting it could respond to topical oestrogen .
Dr Andrew Pask from the Department of Zoology at the University of Melbourne analysed the tissue samples from 12 foreskins and made the discovery .
“ This suggested that oestrogen could induce a thickening of the keratin layer of the foreskin epidermis in the same way as it acts in the vagina , ” said Dr Pask .
“ Keratin on our skin acts a barrier to viral infection .
We hope to be able to enhance this protection with the use of a naturally occurring , weak oestrogen , ” said Professor Roger Short of the Faculty of Medicine , Dentistry and Health Sciences who lead the research .
To confirm its effect , topical oestrogen was applied to the human foreskin for a two week trial .
This resulted in a rapid and substantial increase in keratin thickness .
“ We have found a new avenue to possibly prevent HIV infection of the penis . ”
HIV is one of the greatest health crises the world has ever seen , and affects over 40 million people worldwide .
Professor
Short says that HIV is on the rise particularly in countries where males are not circumcised .
“ In countries where circumcision is not religiously or culturally accepted , oestrogen treatments to the penis could be very effective in reducing the spread of the disease . ”
Mr Bhama says he is ardent supporter of Mr Obama A group of Indians are planning to present a statue of the revered Indian monkey God , Hanuman , to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama .
The group decided to order the idol after they read a magazine report saying that Mr Obama carried a good luck ' monkey king ' charm .
They say that a Barack Obama victory would be good for India .
Hindus revere monkeys which they believe are descendents of the monkey God Hanuman .
The two - foot tall , 15kg gold - polished , brass idol has been made as a present for Mr Obama because " he will be good for India if he becomes the next president , " according to Brij Mohan Bhama , leader of the group .
Mr Bhama belongs to the ruling Congress party and also runs a textile mill in the western city of Mumbai .
' Monkey charm '
" We have heard that he carries a small monkey charm in his pocket .
So he is a devotee of Hanuman .
That 's why we want to present him with this idol , " he said .
Mr Bhama and his friends have also invited Carolyn Sauvage - Mar , chairwoman of the group , Democrats Abroad - India , to a meeting they are holding on Tuesday to pray for Mr Obama 's success .
The Delhi - based group registers voters , sponsors events and occasionally hosts Democratic Party leaders visiting India .
Obama stands for change .
We are hoping that he will bring about change so that oil and food prices come down
Brij Mohan Bhama Mr Bhama is hoping that Ms Sauvage - Mar will pick up the idol and arrange it to be delivered to Mr Obama .
" They have invited me for the prayer .
I am happy to go to bring best wishes to Obama , " she said .
She said she would talk with the organisers and find out whether she would be able to help in shipping the idol to Mr Obama .
Ms Sauvage - Mar said the people organising the prayer meeting for the presidential candidate had possibly read a Time magazine article which mentioned that Mr Obama carried a " monkey king good luck charm " .
" Senator Obama has a good luck charm .
We do n't know whether it is of Hanuman .
But the people here think it is Hanuman , " she said .
Mr Bhama says he is an ardent supporter of Mr Obama - even his email identification is bhamaforobama .
" Obama stands for change .
We are hoping that he will bring about change so that oil and food prices come down , " he said .
" India will progress if he comes to power . "

What are these ?
Here 's the relationship between the year over year growth in job hires ( data here ) and consumer sentiment since 2001 ( a shorter time period than in the first graph ) .
It 's not a perfect fit , but the two series move somewhat in unison after mid 2002 .
Something ’s happening here .
What it is ai n’t exactly clear .
But my guess is that the way the Bush boom crested without ever leaving most people better off than they were in 2000 , and the sense that there ’s something fundamentally rotten with the system , have produced a wave of disillusionment and revulsion that goes beyond the real economic effects so far .
Wow .
The latest read on consumer confidence is stunningly bad .
We ’re probably in the early stages of recession — but consumer sentiment is already worse than it ever got under Bush I .
The steady decline in the rate of growth of job hires beginning in 2004 , and the negative growth in hires at the end of the sample are also notable .
Relative to the previous year , hires are currently falling at around 2 % :
Some notes :
First , the graph shows year over year growth rates .
Monthly growth rates for hires look quite a bit different , there is far too much noise to see any pattern ( the growth rates shown in the graph are equivalent to the average monthly growth rate over the past year ) .
Second , I 'm not sure this relationship is causal .
If it was , I would think that the growth in job hires causes confidence rather than the other way around , though I can think of stories of how a revealed lack of confidence about the future would cause firms to cut back on hiring today .
I suspect both of these series reflect the general state of the economy and that is what is driving the co-movement instead of one of the two causing the other .
Third , I wish I had a longer series for hires so I could determine if the lack of correlation at the beginning of the sample is an aberration , or a common feature over the extended , earlier sample .
But given the available data , and it does appear that the two series have moved together over the last few years .
That 's expected as consumer confidence ought to reflect economic conditions .
Update : Reading Floyd Norris and Paul Krugman gave me an idea about how to extend the analysis using a different series .
This is employment growth for all workers aged 25 - 54 versus consumer sentiment ( both are three month moving averages ) :
Employment Growth ( ages 25 - 54 ) and Consumer Sentiment
Update :
The graph above shows monthly employment growth rates , but I meant to show year over year rates .
Using year over year growth rates gives :
The fit is good at times , but there are notable departures , e.g. the late 1990s .
Robin Hanson runs a great blog called Overcoming Bias , which is essentially about ways we fool ourselves , both individually and collectively .
A form of bias I ’m interested in is the great deference we pay to power , often far more than is warranted by the facts .
I ’m particularly interested in the damage this does to powerful people , since it greatly reduces the incentive they have to perform well ( if people are going to pay attention to you anyway , you have less incentive to improve your ideas ) , and it also diminishes feedback that can help them improve their ideas .
A few examples ( I ’m guilty of numbers two and three , incidentally ) :
People ’s early works , when they are unknown , are often better than their later works , after they ’ve become famous .
See , e.g. , Tom Clancy .
A professor speaking pretty much complete rubbish , and yet being taken seriously by a group of more junior academics .
According to James Watson ’s account , Linus Pauling should have discovered the structure of DNA before Watson and Crick , but made a stupid error , and then had the misfortune that none of the people around him were confident enough to speak up and say “ Hey , that ’s obviously wrong ! ”
I ’ve seen this in minature a thousand times .
A professor shutting down a grad student in a group , simply by disagreeing with them .
People tend to assume that the professor is right 100 percent of the time , and the student 0 percent .
A more accurate breakup in my experience is 60 / 40 .
Professors usually are n’t much smarter or more knowledgable than grad students .
A rich or famous person holding forth on pretty much any subject , from things they understand well , through to things they barely understand at all , and having other people pay serious attention .
An example is the frequent pronouncements on how to solve world hunger we get from Hollywood starlets .
Their concern is laudable , but surely there are better experts on this subject ?
It ’s not hard to think of ways for the powerful to avoid these forms of bias .
But in practice it may be rather hard to implement them – it ’s nice having people pay attention to what you say !
And for the less powerful , it ’s hard to see how to avoid them at all .
Hope is the worst of evils , for it prolongs the torments of man .
— Friedrich Nietzsche
We ca n’t give up hope , I ’m often told .
Keep hope alive , the saying goes .
If we lose hope , nothing will ever change … or so they believe .
Well , I ’m here to say : Fuck hope .
We live on a planet brimming with hope yet that same planet is under perpetual assault … and the hopers are losing .
The corporations raping our eco-systems do n’t hope they can steal more land , exploit it , poison it , and make boatloads of cash .
They make a plan and make it happen … damn the torpedoes .
( You might even call it “ direct action . ” )
Monsanto does n’t put its faith in candlelight vigils or humans standing in the shape of a peace sign .
They get busy putting their people into positions of power , writing legislation , and bullying and smashing anyone opposed to their insane agenda .
General Motors does n’t reserve its opinions for government sanctioned “ free speech zones . ”
The television , Internet , magazines , movies , songs , radio , etc. are all inundated with GM ’s taxpayer - subsidized propaganda … just as the planet is inundated with GM ’s output .
McDonald ’s does n’t waste time hoping things will go its way when its days are chock filled with brainwashing , killing , poisoning , destroying … and counting its profits .
Hope never enters into the equation .
“ Hope is a bad thing , ” sez Henry Miller .
“ It means that you are not what you want to be .
It means that part of you is dead , if not all of you .
It means that you entertain illusions .
It ’s a sort of spiritual clap , I should say . ”
Author Derrick Jensen explains the impotency of hope as good as anyone : “ I ’m not , for example , going to say I hope I eat something tomorrow .
I just will .
I do n’t hope I take another breath right now , nor that I finish writing this sentence .
I just do them .
On the other hand , I do hope that the next time I get on a plane , it does n’t crash .
To hope for some result means you have given up any agency concerning it .
Many people say they hope the dominant culture stops destroying the world .
By saying that , they ’ve assumed that the destruction will continue , at least in the short term , and they ’ve stepped away from their own ability to participate in stopping it . ”
If Jensen makes it sound an awful lot like religion , well , for most folks , the verb “ hope ” is virtually synonymous with “ pray , ” while “ hope ” the noun is often interchangeable with “ faith . ”
Hope is for suckers .
How about some good old - fashioned anger , rage , and passion ?
( Che sez : “ If you tremble with indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine . ” )
Let ’s forget hope and aim for vision , clarity , strategy , courage , and finally : some goddamned results .
“ Creativity comes from trust , ” sez Rita Mae Brown .
“ Trust your instincts .
And never hope more than you work ” ( as
they say in South Florida : bingo ) .
At its worst , hope is a dangerous cop-out .
At best , it ’s a frivolous idea .
But even so , as Henry Miller sez : “ Ideas have to be wedded to action . ”
Wedded , huh ?
Repeat after me : “ I do . ”
President Bush says Africa has been a foreign policy priority
Bush interview
He called it a " seminal decision " not to intervene with force , taken partly out of the desire not to send US troops into another Muslim country .
Mr Bush was speaking to BBC World News America before flying to Africa .
He also discussed controversy over China 's Olympics - saying he would attend the event as scheduled .
After Hollywood director Steven Spielberg withdrew his assistance to the Olympics in protest at China 's policy towards Darfur , Mr Bush said he would not be taking a similar stance .
" I view the Olympics as a sporting event , " he told the BBC's Matt Frei .
I 've got a firm , heartfelt commitment to the continent of Africa
President George W Bush
Full interview transcript Bush interview : Your reaction
But he added that he would meet Chinese President Hu Jintao and " remind him that he can do more to relieve the suffering in Darfur " .
Mr Bush is scheduled to leave on Friday for his second tour of Africa - though he said on Thursday he might be delayed if a crucial wiretapping bill was held up in Congress .
He is due to visit Benin , Tanzania , Rwanda , Ghana and Liberia .
The president will be travelling with his wife , Laura .
They will visit hospitals , schools and businesses , hoping to show how US investment in health and development programmes has made a real difference to Africans .
Aid promises
Mr Bush said he had a " firm , heartfelt commitment to the continent of Africa " .
But he said it was also in the interest of US and global security to tackle poverty there .
WATCH FULL BUSH INTERVIEW - ON TV Newsnight , BBC Two , 2230 GMT , Thursday BBC World News America , via BBC News 24 , Friday , 0030 GMT BBC World News America , via BBC World ( outside UK only ) , Friday , 0000 GMT / 1900 ET / 1600 PT
" We have people who are suffering from disease and hunger and hopelessness .
The only way a radical can recruit is to find somebody who 's hopeless , " he said .
US aid to Africa has grown rapidly since Mr Bush entered the White House in 2001 .
He said on Thursday it had doubled over his first term and was set to double again by 2010 .
Asked by Matt Frei if he felt he had got the credit he deserved for such investment , Mr Bush replied : " I 'm not one of these guys that really gives a darn about elite opinion .
What I really care about is - are we saving lives ? "
Interrogation bill veto
Mr Bush will not visit Kenya , where inter-ethnic violence erupted after recent disputed elections , or Sudan .
But his aides say he will discuss both crises with African leaders during his trip .
PRESIDENT BUSH'S ITINERARY Benin - Cotonou : arrival ceremony , meets president Tanzania - Dar-es - Salaam : meets president , tours hospital ; Arusha : tours hospital , textile mill and girls ' school Rwanda - Kigali : meets president , visits genocide memorial Ghana - Accra : meets president , state dinner Liberia - Monrovia : meets president , visits university
Rice to visit Kenya
Mr Bush condemned the government of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe and said he would put more pressure on neighbouring South Africa to find a diplomatic solution .
" I just happen to believe their government could do more to enhance a free society in their region , " he said .
Talking about events at home , he defended his threat to veto a bill passed by the US Senate outlawing the interrogation technique of water - boarding , dismissing fears that that might send a negative message around the world .
Asked whether America still occupied the moral high ground after Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay , Mr Bush gave a crisply blunt answer , our interviewer says .
" Absolutely , " he replied .
" We believe in human rights and human dignity .
We believe in the human condition .
We believe in freedom . "
Mr Bush was similarly robust in his defence of his actions in Iraq , saying : " The decision to move Saddam Hussein was right .
And this democracy is now taking root .
And I 'm confident that if America does not become isolationist - you know , and allow the terrorists to take back over , Iraq will succeed . "
Matt Frei is the presenter of BBC World News America which airs every weekday at 0030 GMT on BBC News 24 and at 0000 GMT ( 1900 ET / 1600 PT ) on BBC World ( for viewers outside the UK only ) .

SANTA ANNA PUEBLO , N.M. —
Advisers to Sen. John McCain ’s presidential bid say he will not try to “ soften ” the Republican party ’s platform on abortion and same - sex marriage to appeal to more voters .
McCain associates told The Washington Times that his operatives are not going to work behind the scenes to eliminate the party ’s calls for constitutional bans on abortion and homosexual marriage before the GOP convention in September .
Previous Republican nominees , such as former Kansas Sen .
Bob Dole , have sought to alter the party ’s positions , which are honed and released in the platform immediately before the nominating convention .
Mr. McCain , one adviser said , also will keep his hands off the fight taking place here this week among Republican state officials over how to change the presidential primary schedule for 2012 .
“ The current system is not really a system — it ’s a free - for - all and unfair to candidates and voters , ” said David Norcross , chairman of the party ’s rules committee , which is convened yesterday as state GOP chairmen meet for the first time since Mr. McCain became their putative presidential nominee .
“ It costs more because of unpredictability and because strategic planning is impossible .
Voters will be better served , I think , by more order and fewer sound bites and horse - race poll nonsense . ”
The Republican National Committee ’s Rules Committee began deliberating yesterday on five proposed plans to change the presidential primary schedule to avoid the “ front - loading ” that took place this cycle .
Its goal is to preserve the legitimate interests of the various states in playing a significant role in deciding on the party ’s presidential nominee .
Michigan Chairman Saul Anuzis , whose state violated RNC rules by holding its primary earlier than allowed this year , has helped author one of the plans designed to prevent a de facto national primary .
“ There is frustration with the way the process went this time , primarily because of timing , ” Mr. Anuzis said .
“ The front - loading and timing of various primaries caused us to go into the holiday season , and a lot of people did n’t like that . ”
Five states this year violated the RNC ’s rules against holding nominating contests prior to Feb. 5 , and each of those states is to be penalized by not having half its delegates seated at the Sept 1 - 4 Republican National Convention .
A McCain camp adviser , speaking on the condition of anonymity , also labeled as “ dead wrong ” a rumor among conservative leaders and activists that Bobby Kilberg , considered by critics to be liberal on social issues , would be masterminding the September Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minn .
“ Bobby Kilberg will have nothing to do with the platform , ” the adviser said .
“ Do you think we are crazy ?
Why would we want to change the platform ? ”
He said another longtime Republican operative , Maria Cino , “ is managing the national convention under the direction of Mike Duncan and the Committee on Arrangements .
It has been the case for more than a year and will not change . ”
The GOP ’s 2004 platform opposes same - sex marriage , saying “ the well - being of children is best accomplished in the environment of the home , nurtured by their mother and father anchored by the bonds of marriage . ”
Its plank on abortion is that “ the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life , which can not be infringed .
…
Our purpose is to have legislative and judicial protection of that right against those who perform abortions . ”

実際に購入してみた！飲むタイミングが重要
私も実際に、ルックルックイヌリンプラスを購入してみました。もちろん、1番安い公式サイトからですね。
到着したルックルックイヌリンプラスの実物がこちら。
パッケージにもありますが、イヌリンだけでなくプラス成分も摂れるのは嬉しいですね。サラシアや桑の葉も、血糖値にアプローチしてくれる成分です。
飲むタイミングが重要？食前に飲んでおきたい
早速ルックルックイヌリンプラスを飲んでみたわけですが、飲むタイミングを確認しておきましょう。ちなみに、パッケージには「1日6粒を目安にお召し上がりください。」としか書いてありません。
イヌリンは食前、食事30分前〜食事直前に飲むことで食後血糖値の上昇を緩やかにしてくれます。
食後に飲むと、ルックルックイヌリンプラスって効果なし？と勘違いしてしまう原因になるので、飲むタイミングは非常に重要です(^_^ ;)
あたし 私の場合は糖質を多めに食べる、お昼ご飯前と夕ご飯前に3粒づつ飲みました。
さて、実際にルックルックイヌリンプラスを飲んでどうだったか？というと、日に日に確かに数値が下がってきたんです。もともと有名なイヌリンを豊富に、しかもプラス成分も摂れるサプリなので、結果には満足できる形になりました。
血糖値が気になっている人は、試してみる価値あり。
私は非常に調子が良くなったのですが、私以外の口コミも気になってリサーチ、内容をまとめてみました。気になる人は是非参考にしてみてください。
ルックルックイヌリンプラスの口コミ・評判からわかること
悪 い口コミもある？良い口コミと悪い口コミ、両方をリサーチしてみました。
ルックルックイヌリンプラスの悪い口コミ
健康診断で血糖値120という出て、飲み始めました。また健康診断があったのですが、下がるどころか上がってしまったんです。私には効果ないのかな？
効果ない？という口コミも発見。えっ？って思いますよね（汗）。食後血糖値の上昇を抑えてくれるイヌリンを飲むのに、なぜか？
口コミの内容だけで原因の特定は難しいのですが、考えられる原因としては・・・
飲むタイミングが食前以外
継続して飲めていな い
上がりやすい食 事
その他、上がりやすい要素がある
上がりやすい要素を決して帳消しにできるわけではないので、大量に甘いものを食べたりすると、上手く結果が出ない場合があります。
購入して母にプレゼントしたのですが、軟便気味で飲むのをやめてしまいました。
食物繊維としての役割もあるので、基本的には腸内の環境を整えてくれます。しかし、多く摂りすぎると緩くなる可能性もありますね。
ルックルックイヌリンプラスの良い口コミ
ルックルックイヌリンプラスをサポート的に飲み始めました。食事療法をしながらですが、300→120まで下がったんです。安定しているので、続けてみようと思います。
入院するレベルの数値が下がりました。
1ヶ月ほどでA1cが一桁に。私には合っています。
治療もしながらこちらのサプリも一緒に。結果的にはかなり血糖値が下がりました。お薬とどちらの結果かはわかりませんが、良かったです。
劇的な変化はないですが、徐々に良くなっています。
初期の糖尿病でしたが、2ヶ月ほど続けて数値が良くなってきました。まだしばらく続けてみます。
良い口コミでは、具体的な数値の変化が見られた意見が沢山ありました。
1〜2ヶ月と、ある程度の期間は続けて変化があったという人が多いですね。
口コミ・評判からわかることまとめ
一つ一つ の口コミ・評判としては、悪い口コミ、良い口コミ、両方ありますが、気になるのはどちらが多いのか？ですよね。
一目瞭然なのが、楽天レビューです。
全体的な口コミは凄くいいので、試してみて良かったよ、という人が圧倒的なことがわかります。

Obama is frequently on the phone with billionaire CEO Warren Buffett : " One of my favorite people , " says Obama , " he 's just completely down - to - earth and as smart as they come .
" Buffett is a critic of the financial industry and of tax breaks for the rich - and he also happens to understand capital markets better than just about anyone .
Florida Governor Charlie Crist endorsed John McCain right before the Florida Republican primary .
His endorsement might have been a significant factor in McCain winning the Florida primary , and subsequently the Republican nomination .
Speculation began immediately thereafter that Crist might make a great running mate for McCain , given his popularity in Florida , and his potential ability to swing the crucial electoral state toward McCain during the general election .
One reason why Crist is popular is because there is a public perception that he really cares about environmental issues , much more so than the typical governor or politician ( Republican or Democrat ) .
As Crist might become McCain ’s running mate , it seems worthy of investigation as to whether or not the Governor ’s green credibility is rightly deserved– especially after Crist ’s reversal Tuesday on his position as to lifting the U.S. ban on drilling offshore for oil .
Now he says we should do it .
Here are some of the environmental highlights from Charlie Crist ’s first 2 years as governor of Florida :
By Kevin Connolly
BBC News , Washington
I have been taking a keen interest in television adverts for indigestion products lately .
Television viewers in the US are exposed to much advertising
This habit more or less coincided with my discovery of beef jerky , an American food whose classiness you can judge from the fact that it is mainly found in petrol stations .
You could make it yourself at home by cutting a tough , thin steak into tiny strips and leaving them on a sunny window ledge to dry when you went away for your summer holiday .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
That should give you the very essence of jerky - dry and rubbery at the same time , and chewy - like Bovril - flavoured lino .
I started off munching on slivers of it on long drives through America 's far horizons , but now I am perfectly capable of eating my own body weight of the stuff on a trip to the shops .
Advertising standards
As is often the case with addictions , I began dabbling in adverts for indigestion tablets and slowly found myself hooked on the darker , stronger material contained in commercials for prescription drugs .
America is one of only two countries in the world ( along with New Zealand ) which permit the advertising of drugs that are available solely through your doctor .
Prescription drugs are commonly advertised on television in the US
The insidious message is simple ; if your doctor is not offering you this drug , maybe you should be asking for it .
Americans do accept advertising in areas where it does not tend to appear elsewhere .
It is not uncommon here for a sports presenter to be required to break away from the main business in hand to draw your attention to the succulence of a sausage or the ruggedness of a truck .
Prescription drugs though are surely different .
After all , the whole point of them is that it is not considered safe to let us simply buy them over the counter .
They are so strong or so habit forming that it is up to the doctor to decide that we really need them .
Advertising subtly changes that relationship by sending us in to see the doctor filled with nameless dreads about the symptoms of diseases we might have , and a detailed knowledge of the drugs that might help us .
The TV spots in other words insidiously furnish us with the tools to torture ourselves .
On the occasions when I do lie awake at night these days the floppy , flabby , mis -shapen demons of my own future link hands and dance around my bed
I am happy enough for example , and secretly regard anyone who is happier as slightly mad - but who I am to say that the bottled sunshine of the prescription anti-depressant would not lift my mood a couple of notches further .
I sleep well enough too , but I certainly do not start the day with the radiant lustre of the woman in the sleeping pill advert .
She is perhaps the jolliest person in TV advert land 's world of impotence , flatulence and obesity .
On the occasions when I do lie awake at night these days the floppy , flabby , mis -shapen demons of my own future link hands and dance around my bed .
Do I suffer from the curiously named symptoms which would alert me to my serious illnesses ?
Straining .
Going Too Often .
Not going at all .
Going when you were not expecting to .
Incomplete emptying - which always puts me in mind of an inefficiently run fire drill in a public building , but which of course refers to an altogether different , trouser - dampening reality .
The biggest single market is in drugs that deal with erectile dysfunction .
My favourite features a group of men who gather together to play in a band .
Side effects
I think it is meant to show them looking relaxed and happy , but they are such good musicians you cannot help noting that impotence has left them with plenty of time on their hands to practise their instruments .
Television adverts for drugs in the US list possible side effects
The best part of the adverts tends to come towards the end when the law requires the pharmaceutical company to list the possible side effects of the various products .
Sometimes these are spelled out in a warm tone implying this is all a bit of a formality imposed by our fuss - budget of a government .
On other occasions they are rattled out at speeds normally only reached by horse racing commentators in the closing stages of a big race .
The symptoms include coughs and sneezes , runny noses and rashes but there is a more alarming end of the spectrum too where you are solemnly warned of the possibility - presumably small - of suffering a stroke , a heart attack or even death - the last and greatest side - effect of them all .
' Profoundly different ' I think about those adverts - and those side - effects - every time I open a fresh pack of dried beef using my gigantic , jerky - reinforced arms .
They are a daily reminder of the many ways in which America - superficially so similar to Western Europe - is really profoundly different .
Those adverts with their sure sense of how to play on our doubts and insecurities are a symptom of the restless energy of American capitalism and of the belief that it can apply to issues of health and happiness just as readily as it can apply to polish or pet food .
The downside of the system for me ?
Well , I have rampant , raging hypochondria these days to add to my chronic , jerky - induced indigestion .
And the upside ?
Well , there is bound to be something I can take for it .
If I can just manage to plant myself in front of the television until an advert for the tablets I am waiting for eventually pops up .

What are these ?
By Leo Babauta
I confess to being as prone to the distractions of the Internet as anyone else : I will start reading about something that interests me and disappear down the rabbit hole for hours ( even days ) at a time .
But my ability to focus on a single task has dramatically improved , and that one habit has changed my life .
While a few years ago I could n’t sit down to work on something without quickly switching to email or one of my favorite Internet forums or sites , today I can sit down and write .
I can clear away distractions , when I set my mind to it , and do one thing .
And that changes everything : you lose yourself in that task , become so immersed that you pour everything you have into the work , and it becomes a meditative , transformative experience .
Your happiness increases , stress goes down , and work improves .
I know that lots of people have trouble focusing one one task for very long , and so I thought I ’d share a few things that have worked for me .
Focus Best Practices
There is no one way to find focus , but what works for me is to clear everything away and create a little space of tranquil focus .
Some tips for doing that :
Close the browser and your email program .
If you need to work in the browser then make sure no tabs or windows are open other than the one you absolutely need .
Turn off all notifications .
Trying to focus while something is notifying you of an incoming email or tweet or Facebook update is impossible .
Turn off the Internet .
Shut off your connection , unplug your router , or best yet , go to a place where the is no Internet ( yes , those still exist ) .
This is the absolute best way to find focus .
Close all programs and windows other than what you need for this one task .
Have a very important task to do .
Not just “ check email ” but “ write chapter in my novel ” or “ write that kick - ass blog post I ’ve been planning ” or “ write that new Android app ” .
Clear your desk .
No need to spend all day on this — shove everything in a drawer or put it in a box to be sorted later .
Do n’t fiddle with this now .
In fact , do n’t fiddle with anything — do n’t worry about the perfect setup or perfect notebook for writing or the perfect anything .
Plug in the headphones .
If you have people around who might distract you , wearing headphones and playing some good , peaceful music is perfect .
Use a simple program .
For writing , I like plain text editors ( TextEdit , TextWrangler ) or writing programs that block everything out ( OmmWriter , WriteRoom ) .
No distractions .
Once you have this environment ( and you should n’t spend more than a few minutes setting it up ) , get going on your task .
Do nothing but that one task .
Do n’t switch to another task .
Having trouble doing that ?
Read on .
How to Increase Your Focus Abilities
If you ca n’t focus on one task for very long , do n’t worry .
That ’s normal .
Our brains have been trained by technology and society to switch tasks often .
One way we ’ve been trained is that switching to check email or blog updates or Facebook / Twitter is rewarding — we are rewarded with a little nugget of satisfaction in that someone has sent us a message ( social validation ! ) or we have something new and interesting to read ( shiny and bright ! ) .
Switching tasks becomes a positive feedback cycle that is hard to beat by single - tasking .
The way to beat that is to set up a positive feedback cycle for focusing .
Here ’s how :
Start small .
You only need to focus for one minute at first .
Clear everything away , pick your one important task , and just do it for one minute without switching .
This is hard to do in the beginning but if you consciously focus on focusing , you can do it .
It ’s just a minute .
Reward yourself .
The reward for focusing for one minute can be one minute ( or 30 seconds ) of checking whatever you want .
Email , Facebook , whatever .
Or get up and take a one - minute walk .
Stretch , drink some water , massage your neck , enjoy your small victory .
Empires are created with small victories .
Repeat .
Keep doing one minute focus , one minute reward ( or 1 minute to 30 seconds if you like ) for about half an hour ( 15 of each ) .
You ’re done .
Repeat that later in the day .
Rejoice in how much work you got done !
And notice how you ’ve set up a positive feedback cycle for focusing .
Increase in small steps .
Tomorrow , make it two minutes on , one minute off .
Repeat that for 30 minutes , do it later in the day too .
Feel free to go wild and do three focus sessions in a day if you like , but it ’s not necessary .
Keep taking baby steps .
I think you can see the pattern by now .
Make it three minutes on , one minute off on the third day , then 4:1 , then 5:1 .
When you get to 10 minutes , be crazy and take a 2 minute break .
When you get to 20 minutes , take a 3 minute break .
At 30 minutes of focus , you ’ve earned a 5 minute break .
And once you ’re at 30 minutes , you can stay there .
No need to become a monk .
Set up a positive feedback cycle for single - tasking focus and you ’ll reverse the years of training your mind has gotten to switch tasks .
You ’ll get more important work done , and it wo n’t seem hard .
You ’ll find that focus becomes a form of meditation .
It ’s a beautiful , beautiful thing , and you can thank me by sending me a craft beer from your hometown .
Ezra Pound in London , in 1918 .
T. S. Eliot called him “ the better craftsman . ”

Ezra Pound turns up five times in Peter Gay ’s big survey of the modern movement in literature and the arts , “ Modernism : The Lure of Heresy ” — once in connection with T. S. Eliot ’s “ The Waste Land ” ( which Pound edited ) , once as the author of an anti-Semitic sentiment ( one of many ) , and three times as the originator of the slogan “ Make It New ” ( which suits the theme of Gay ’s account ) .
Pound ’s poetry and criticism are not discussed ; no reader of Gay ’s book would have any idea of what his importance or influence as a writer might be .
Gay ’s is a commodious volume with a long reach , “ From Baudelaire to Beckett and Beyond ” ; still , a handful of passing references seems a sharp decline in market value for a writer who was once the hero of a book called “ The Pound Era . ”
Pound ’s aspirations for literature were grand .
He believed that bad writing destroyed civilizations and that good writing could save them , and although he was an élitist about what counted as art and who mattered as an artist , he thought that literature could enhance the appreciation of life for everyone .
He was vain and idiosyncratic , but he had no wish to be a prima donna .
No doubt Eliot , James Joyce , William Butler Yeats , Robert Frost , William Carlos Williams , H.D. , Ernest Hemingway , Ford Madox Ford , and Marianne Moore would have produced interesting and innovative work whether they had known Pound or not , but Pound ’s attention and interventions helped their writing and sped their careers .
He edited them , reviewed them , got them published in magazines he was associated with , and included them in anthologies he compiled ; he introduced them to editors , to publishers , and to patrons ; he gave them the benefit of his time , his learning , his money , and his old clothes .
“ A miracle of ebulliency , gusto , and help , ” Joyce called him .
It ’s true that he was flamboyant , immodest , opinionated , tactless , a pinwheel of affectation ; he made people crazy and he became crazy himself .
Gertrude Stein ’s description of him is frequently invoked : “ A village explainer , excellent if you were a village , but if you were not , not . ”
In his devotion to the modernist avant - garde , though , he was selfless .
“ A bombastic galleon , palpably bound to , or from , the Spanish Main , ” Wyndham Lewis wrote about meeting Pound .
“ Going on board , I discovered beneath its skull and cross- bones , intertwined with fleurs de lys and spattered with preposterous starspangled oddities , a heart of gold . ”
Pound ’s own work , on the other hand , has had a difficult reception .
The “ It ” in “ Make It New ” is the Old — what is valuable in the culture of the past .
A great deal of Pound ’s poetry therefore takes the form of translation , imitation , allusion , and quotation .
He is trying to breathe life into a line of artistic and intellectual accomplishment , but it is a line of his own invention — a “ tradition ” that includes , among others , John Adams , Confucius , Flaubert , the Provençal troubadours , and Benito Mussolini .
Not , prima facie , a canon .
This means that to understand what Pound is doing you often need to have read the same writers , studied the same languages , and learned the same history that Pound read , studied , and learned ( or rely on the commentary of a person who has ) .
This is especially the case with the work on which he spent fifty - four years and staked his reputation , “ The Cantos of Ezra Pound ” — “ a cryselephantine poem of immeasurable length , ” as he once described it .
So it is very easy for the average underprepared reader to get Pound wrong , and he desperately did not want to be misunderstood .
Opacity and ambiguity can be deliberate effects in modernist writing : sometimes the text goes dark , reference becomes uncertain , language aspires to the condition of music .
In Pound ’s case , though , any obscurity is unintentional .
Clarity is the essence of his aesthetic .
He sometimes had to struggle against his own technique to achieve it .
There is another problem with Pound , which is that he was a Fascist .
The term gets abused freely in discussions of modernist writers , a number of whom were reactionaries —
Gay calls these “ the anti-modern modernists ” — and some of whom were anti-Semites , but very few of whom were actually Fascists .
Pound is one of the very few .
His obsession with the Jews ( there are some anti-Semitic passages in his early prose , but nothing systematic ) dates from his interest in the views of the founder of the Social Credit movement , Major C. H. Douglas , around 1920 .
( Social Credit was an economic reform movement aimed at the elimination of debt — hence Pound ’s attacks on usury and on Jews as moneylenders and financiers of wars , a classic type of anti-Semitism . )
Pound ’s infatuation with Mussolini dates from a concert given by Olga Rudge , a violinist who was Pound ’s longtime mistress , at Mussolini ’s home , in 1927 , where he came up with the idea of enlisting Mussolini as a patron of the avant - garde .
Six years later , Pound had a private audience with Il Duce , at the Palazzo Venezia , in Rome , and presented him with a copy of “ A Draft of XXX Cantos , ” which Mussolini graciously acknowledged with the remark “ Ma questo è divertente ” ( “ How amusing ” ) .
Pound concluded that Mussolini had an intuitive grasp of the significance of his poetry .
In 1941 , Pound began delivering broadcasts from the Rome studios of Ente Italiana Audizione Radio , attacking the Jews , Roosevelt , and American intervention in the war .
The broadcasts continued through the Allied invasion of Italy , in 1943 .
In 1944 , he wrote two propagandistic cantos — which are known as the Italian Cantos , and which were for many years omitted from the New Directions edition of the complete “ Cantos ” — praising the Fascist fighting spirit .
In 1945 , he surrendered to American officials on a charge of treason and was imprisoned in an Army Disciplinary Training Center north of Pisa .
He was brought to the United States , but , thanks to the intercession of friends and of Dr. Winfred Overholser , the superintendent of St. Elizabeths Hospital , in Washington , D.C. , he was spared a trial , on psychiatric grounds ( although he never received a specific diagnosis ) .
He spent twelve years in St. Elizabeths , where he acquired a number of disciples , including John Kasper , a segregationist associated with the neo -Nazi George Lincoln Rockwell .
In 1958 , the indictment was dismissed and Pound returned to Italy .
When he walked off the boat , in Naples , he gave the Fascist salute .
Pound ’s politics are not incidental to his achievement .
Italian Fascism is integral to “ The Cantos , ” and the section called “ The Pisan Cantos , ” which Pound composed in the Army Disciplinary Training Center , at a time when he had every expectation of being executed , is , formally , an elegy occasioned by the death of Mussolini at the hands of Italian partisans ( “ Ben and la Clara a Milano / by the heels at Milano ” ) .
Like most classical elegies , it is as much about the poet as about the departed ; it is suffused with memories , and spiked with anger at the indifference of the world .
It won the Bollingen Prize for Poetry in 1949 , and although the award was ( and remains ) controversial , “ The Pisan Cantos ” is the finest thing that Pound ever wrote .
It ’s the one place in his work where his learning is fused with genuine personal feeling .
Parts of “ The Pisan Cantos ” have been read as a recantation :

TO THE LIST of President Bush 's many shortcomings , we can now add another failing .
Our poor president - no , make that our exceedingly poor president - is obviously irony impaired .
How else could he go to Furman University on Saturday and celebrate his time - tested - and now , time - graded and time - failed - theme of personal responsibility ?
Unless , that is , he intended to offer himself as a counter - example to the idealistic young collegians .
In his address , the president highlighted some important truths .
Like , say , this : " You have responsibilities to your fellow citizens , your country , your family , and yourself . "
And this : " A culture of responsibility means being accountable to your families and to yourself . "
His discourse on responsibility and accountability came just as the political world was aflutter over the divulgences , if an acknowledgement of something already well - established can be so described , from former Bush press secretary Scott McClellan .
Prominent among them is that the president and his team engaged in a propaganda campaign to sell the nation on war with Iraq .
That war has turned up neither the weapons of mass destruction the administration insisted were there nor operational ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda .
Still , the president continues to assert he was right in launching the invasion .
Ah , responsibility .
What 's more , this is a president whose administration spent years ignoring global warming , while muzzling government scientists and editing government reports to weaken asserted links between greenhouse gases and climate change .
In his second term , Bush has finally offered a halfhearted acknowledgment of the problem , but without embracing serious solutions .
That , obviously , will be left to the next president .
But here 's what took the commencement cake : Bush 's warning to graduates to avoid amassing too much debt .
" You can strengthen our country by showing fiscal discipline in your lives , " he said .
" It may sound funny coming from a visitor from Washington , D.C. , but it 's important to your futures and the future of our country . "
Although that quote suggests the president has some inkling that he's an unlikely messenger on this topic , it did n't keep him from offering this counsel : " My advice to you is not to dig a financial hole that you can't get out of .
Live within your means . "
What , exactly , can one say to that ?
Except this : " I guess it 's a case of do as I say and not as I do , " says Bob Bixby , executive director of the Concord Coalition , a nonpartisan deficit watchdog .
It is indeed .
Having inherited a budget in surplus and a declining national debt , this president pushed through a series of tax cuts and presided over spending increases that have left us awash in red ink .
Publicly held federal debt has gone from $ 3.4 trillion when Bush took office to $ 5.3 trillion .
Add in the trillions owed to government accounts like the Social Security Trust Fund , and our total national debt is now $ 9.4 trillion , up from $ 5.6 trillion in 2000 .
That 's more than $ 30,000 for every American citizen .
Meanwhile , since 2001 , long - term unfunded liabilities and commitments have ballooned from about $ 20 trillion to more than $ 50 trillion .
" We have gone from a point where we had current and projected budget surpluses to where we have large and growing deficits , " says former comptroller general David Walker , who led the Government Accountability Office from late 1998 until March of this year .
" And we have gone from a point where we were projected to pay off all the federal debt and have fiscal sustainability for 40 - plus years to a point where we have large and mounting debt burdens and the simulation model that is used by GAO to project fiscal sustainability crashes in about 40 years . "
It will take years to work our way out of the hole we 're now in .
A significant part of the sacrifice will fall on the young , who as taxpayers will have to help repay the debt rung up in this era , even as they build their own lives .
And make no mistake : Much of the blame for that burden lies with a president who prefers preaching responsibility to practicing it .

Brazilian UN peacekeepers kept the protesters back from the palace Crowds of demonstrators in Haiti have tried to storm the presidential palace in the capital Port - au - Prince as protests continue over food prices .
Witnesses say the protesters used metal bins to try to smash down the palace gates before UN troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse them .
Several people are reported to have been injured in the clashes .
At least five people have been killed in Haiti since the unrest began last week in the southern city of Les Cayes .
The demonstrators outside the presidential palace said the rising cost of living in Haiti meant they were struggling to feed themselves .
" We are hungry , " they shouted before attempting to smash open the palace gates .
In recent months , it has become common among Haiti 's poor to use the expression " grangou klowox " or " eating bleach " , to describe the daily hunger pains people face , because of the burning feeling in their stomachs .
' Gasoline and matches '
The protesters demanded the resignation of President Rene Preval , who came to power two years ago promising to restore peace to a country torn apart by fighting between rival armed gangs .
Protesters ran for cover as shots rang out near the palace Mr Preval is believed to have been inside the palace at the time .
" I compare this situation to having a bucket full of gasoline and having some people around with a box of matches , " Preval adviser Patrick Elie was quoted as saying by The Associated Press .
" As long as the two have a possibility to meet , you 're going to have trouble . "
Rising food prices are causing unrest around the globe but in Haiti , one of the poorest countries in the world , the protests threaten to destabilise an already fragile democracy .
UN envoy Hedi Annabi , who briefed the Security Council in New York on Tuesday , said Haiti 's progress was " extremely fragile , highly reversible , and made even more fragile by the current socio- economic environment " .
Violence in Haiti has often been linked to poverty with more than half the population surviving on less than a dollar a day .
Critics say both Mr Preval and the international community have focused too much on political stability and not enough on helping to alleviate poverty and now growing hunger .
The protesters are also focusing their anger on the 9,000 or so UN peacekeepers sent to Haiti in 2004 .
Their mission was to quell the chaos that followed the ousting of former President Jean - Bertrand Aristide , the country 's first democratically elected leader .
Are you in Haiti ?

What are these ?
An international team of astronomers using NASA ’s Swift satellite and the Japanese / U.S. Suzaku X-ray observatory has discovered a new class of active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) .
By now , you ’d think that astronomers would have found all the different classes of AGN — extraordinarily energetic cores of galaxies powered by accreting supermassive black holes .
AGN such as quasars , blazars , and Seyfert galaxies are among the most luminous objects in our Universe , often pouring out the energy of billions of stars from a region no larger than our solar system .
But by using Swift and Suzaku , the team has discovered that a relatively common class of AGN has escaped detection … until now .
These objects are so heavily shrouded in gas and dust that virtually no light gets out .
This illustration shows the different features of an active galactic nucleus ( AGN ) , and how our viewing angle determines what type of AGN we observe .
The extreme luminosity of an AGN is powered by a supermassive black hole at the center .
Some AGN have jets , while others do not .

" This is an important discovery because it will help us better understand why some supermassive black holes shine and others don’t , " says astronomer and team member Jack Tueller of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md .
Evidence for this new type of AGN began surfacing over the past two years .
Using Swift ’s Burst Alert Telescope ( BAT ) , a team led by Tueller has found several hundred relatively nearby AGNs that were previously missed because their visible and ultraviolet light was smothered by gas and dust .
The BAT was able to detect high - energy X - rays from these heavily blanketed AGNs because , unlike visible light , high - energy X - rays can punch through thick gas and dust .
To follow up on this discovery , Yoshihiro Ueda of Kyoto University , Japan , Tueller , and a team of Japanese and American astronomers targeted two of these AGNs with Suzaku .
They were hoping to determine whether these heavily obscured AGNs are basically the same type of objects as other AGN , or whether they are fundamentally different .
The AGNs reside in the galaxies ESO 005 - G004 and ESO 297- G018 , which are about 80 million and 350 million light - years from Earth , respectively .
Suzaku covers a broader range of X - ray energies than BAT , so astronomers expected Suzaku to see X - rays across a wide swath of the X - ray spectum .
But despite Suzaku ’s high sensitivity , it detected very few low - or medium - energy X - rays from these two AGN , which explains why previous X - ray AGN surveys missed them .
According to popular models , AGNs are surrounded by a donut - shaped ring of material , which partially obscures our view of the black hole .
Our viewing angle with respect to the donut determines what type of object we see .
But team member Richard Mushotzky , also at NASA Goddard , thinks these newly discovered AGN are completely surrounded by a shell of obscuring material .
" We can see visible light from other types of AGN because there is scattered light , " says Mushotzky .
" But in these two galaxies , all the light coming from the nucleus is totally blocked . "
Another possibility is that these AGN have little gas in their vicinity .
In other AGN , the gas scatters light at other wavelengths , which makes the AGN visible even if they are shrouded in obscuring material .
" Our results imply that there must be a large number of yet unrecognized obscured AGNs in the local universe , " says Ueda .
In fact , these objects might comprise about 20 percent of point sources comprising the X - ray background , a glow of X - ray radiation that pervades our Universe .
NASA ’s Chandra X-ray Observatory has found that this background is actually produced by huge numbers of AGNs , but Chandra was unable to identify the nature of all the sources .
By missing this new class , previous AGN surveys were heavily biased , and thus gave an incomplete picture of how supermassive black holes and their host galaxies have evolved over cosmic history .
" We think these black holes have played a crucial role in controlling the formation of galaxies , and they control the flow of matter into clusters , " says Tueller .
" You ca n’t understand the universe without understanding giant black holes and what they ’re doing .
To complete our understanding we must have an unbiased sample . "

DOES Barack Obama have a problem with the white working class ?
Despite the ubiquity of the term during this presidential campaign , it ’s hard to say what , exactly , “ working class ” means .
If you define class by education , which is polled more consistently than occupation or income , Mr. Obama certainly seems to have trouble with these crucial swing voters .
In almost every Democratic primary , he has lost white voters who did n’t graduate from college to Hillary Clinton .
But that does n’t mean those voters will snub him in the fall .
First , there is no relationship between how candidates perform among any particular group of voters in primaries and how they do with that segment in the general election .
In 1992 , Bill Clinton lost college - educated voters to Paul Tsongas in the early competitive primaries , but he went on to win that group in November by the largest margin any Democrat ever had .
Similarly , John Kerry lost young voters in the competitive primaries in 2004 before going on to win them by a record margin in the general election .
Second , Democrats running for president have been losing white , non-college - educated voters since before Mr. Obama was elected to the Illinois legislature .
Al Gore and Mr. Kerry each failed to win a majority of this bloc in the general election .
With these voters , the size of the losing margin is what matters .
Mr. Gore lost them by 17 percentage points while winning the national popular vote .
Mr. Kerry lost them by 23 points and the country by fewer than two and a half points .
The last Democrat to win white , non-college voters was Bill Clinton , who carried them by a single point in the three - way races in 1992 and 1996 .
Simply introduce a new global constant .
You could name it x and write something like x=1.23456 and refer to x throughout your code .
This has the advantage of being easy to implement .
Write all of your code in monadic style and make use of the reader monad .
This is intrusive in the sense that you may have to make many changes to your code to support it .
But it has the advantage that all of your functions now explicitly become functions of your global constant .

Hask[ x ]
≅HaskR≅Hask S .
Proposition 7.1
The category A[x ] of all polynomials in the indeterminate x:1->
A over the cartesian or cartesian closed category A is isomorphic to the Kleisli category A A =A S A of the cotriple ( S A , &epsilon A , δ A ) .
Suppose you have a Haskell program and you want to introduce a new global constant into your program .
There are at least two approaches you could take :
Now I ’m going to roughly sketch a more categorical view of both of these approaches .
So let ’s restrict ourselves to the subset of Haskell that corresponds to typed lambda calculus without general recursion so that we know all of our functions will be total and correspond to the mathematical notion of a function .
Then all of our functions become arrows in the category that we ’ll call Hask .
Firstly consider approach ( 1 ) .
Suppose we want to introduce a new constant , x , of type A . Category theory talks about arrows rather than elements of objects , so instead of introducing x of type A , introduce the function x:1->
A where 1 is the terminal object in Hask , normally called ( ) .
An element of A is the same thing as an element of 1 -> A , but in the latter case we have an arrow in the category Hask .
Before continuing , let me digress to talk about polynomials .
Suppose we have a ring ( with an identity ) R. We define R[x ] , where x is an indeterminate , to be the ring of polynomials in x .
Another way to describe that is to say that R[x ] is the smallest ring containing R and an indeterminate x , that makes no assumptions about x other than those required to make R[x ] a ring .
For example we know that ( 1+x ) ( 1 - x ) =1 - x , because that must hold in any ring .
Given a polynomial p in R[x ] we can think of it as a function ffrom R to R. f( a ) is the value we get when substituting the value of a for x in p.
So a polynomial in R[x ] is the same as a function from R to R that can be written in terms of elements of R , multiplication and addition .
We can do the same with category theory .
Given a categorywe can ask for the smallest category extendingand containing an indeterminate arrow x:1 ->
A. Just as with polynomials we have to allow all possible arrows that can be made by composing arrows ofwith x .
The resulting expressions for arrows will contain x as a free variable , just like the way x appears in polynomials .
In fact , by analogy we can call the resulting category , [x ] , the category of polynomials in x:1-> A .
In the special case =Hask , you can see that Hask[ x ] is the category of Haskell functions extended by a new constant of type x:1->A but assuming no equations other than those necessary to make Hask [ x ] a category .
Just as an arrow in Hask is a Haskell function , an arrow in Hask[ x ] is a Haskell function making use of an as yet undefined constant x.( I 've glossed over some subtleties .
Just as we need a suitable equivalence relation to ensure that ( 1+x ) ( 1 - x ) =1 - xin R[x ] , we need suitable equivalence relations in our category .
I 'll be showing you where to find the missing details later . )
Here 's the implementation of a function , h , making use of a constant x:( Note that I 'll be using Edward Kmett 's category - extras shortly so I need some imports )
Now consider the second approach .
The easiest thing is to just give an implementation of the above using the reader monad :
Note how , as is typical in monadic code , I have to plumb f ' and g' together usingso that 1.23456 is passed through f ' and g' .
Previously I 've described another way to think about the composition of monadic functions .
Usingwe can compose functions of type a->m b and b->m c to make a function of type a->m c .
The result is that given a monad we can form the Kleisli category of the monad .
The objects are the same as in Hask , but an arrow from a->b in the Kleisli category is an arrow of type a->m b in Hask .
It 's not hard to show this satisfies all of the axioms of a category .
When we program in the reader monad it 's a bit like we 've stopped using Hask and switched to the Kleisli category of the reader monad .
It 's not quite like that because we used functions like .
But in theory we could use lifted versions of those functions too , and then we'd be programming by composing things in the Kleisli category .
If we call the reader monad R then we can call the corresponding Kleisli category Hask .
( Strictly speaking that R needs a subscript telling is the type of the value we intend tofor . )
So here 's the important point : Hask[ x ] is the same category as Hask .
In both cases the arrows are things , which when supplied a value of the right type ( like 1.23456 ) , give arrows in Hask from their head object to their tail object .
But there 's another way to do this .
We can use the reader comonad :
In a similar way , we 're dealing with arrows of the form wa -> b and we can compose them using .
These arrows form the coKleisli category of the reader comonad , S , which we can write Hask .
So we must haveNow some back story .
Over 20 years ago I was intrigued by the idea that logic might form a category with logical ‘ and ’ and ‘ or ’ forming a product and coproduct .
I came across the book Introduction to Higher Order Categorical Logic by Lambek and Scott for ₤ 30.00 .
That ’s ₤ 60.00 at today 's prices , or about $ 120.00 .
On a student grant ?
What was I thinking ?
And as it bore no relation to anything I was studying at the time , I barely understood a word of it .
I was probably fairly applied at that point doing courses in stuff like solid state physics and electromagnetism as well as a bit of topology and algebra .
I doubt I 'd heard of lambda calculus though I could program in BASIC and APL .
So there it sat on my bookshelf for 22 years .
Periodically I ’d look at it , realise that I still did n’t understand enough of the prerequisites , and put it back on the shelf .
And then a month or so ago I picked it up again and realised that the first third or so of it could be interpreted as being about almost trivial Haskell programs .
For example , on page 62 wasThe language is a little different .
Lambek and Scott used the term cotriple instead of comonad and Kleisli category where I ’d say coKleisli category .
δ and ε are cojoin and coreturn .
And Lambek and Scott 's theorem applies to any cartesian closed category .
But after staring at this claim for a while it dawned on me that all it was really saying was this : here are two ways to introduce new constants into a category .
But there ’s no way I would have seen that without having practical experience of programming with monads .
Learning Haskell has finally paid off .
It ’s given me enough intuition about category theory for me to get some return on my ₤30.00 investment paid to Heffers all those years ago .
I expected to take this book to my deathbed , never having read it .
Anyway , for the details I left out above , especially the correct equivalence relation on Hask[x ] , you 'll just have to read the book yourself .
Also , note the similarity to the deduction theorem .
This theorem says that if we can prove B , assuming A , then we can deduce A implies B without making any assumptions .
It unifies two way to introduce a proposition A , either as a hypothesis , or as an antecedent in an implication .
In fact , the above theorem is just a categorical version of the deduction theorem .
Also note the connection with writing pointfree code .
In fact , the pointfree lambdabot plugin makes use good use of the reader monad to eliminate named parameters from functions .
I ’m amazed by seeing a book from 1986 that describes how to use a comonad to plumb a value through some code .
As far as I know , this predates the explicit use of the reader monad in a program , Wadler and Moggi ’s papers on monads , and certainly Haskell .
Of course monads and comonads existed in category theory well before this date , but not , as far as I know , for plumbing computer programs .
I ’d love to hear from anyone who knows more about the history these ideas .

" War all comes down to these little tiny stories about people 's lives that will never be the same . "
-- Eugene Richards
Looking back , I 'm certain the depiction of trauma and loss suffered by Iraq veterans , as documented by so many fine photographers , will be recognized as playing a critical role in galvanizing the American public against an otherwise fundamentally sanitized war .
At BAGnewsNotes , I 've looked at many difficult images over the past few years , including Todd Heisler 's essay , " Final Salute " ; " Nina Berman 's " Marine Wedding " photograph of Ty Ziegel and Renee Kline -- since divorced ; Andrew Lichtenstein's photo of a funeral rehearsal in Modesto ; and the haunting image by Barry Gutierrez just last week of Sgt. Ryan John Baum with his daughter , Leia , on his chest .
The photo above was taken by Eugene Richards as part of a series he is developing with The Nation Institute .
Sgt. José Pequeño suffered a devastating brain injury from a grenade tossed into his Humvee in March 2006 .
In his mother 's arms , I hardly recall a more visceral sensation of the senselessness of the Iraq campaign .
Given the angle , Pequeno 's brain injury draws an unavoidable analogy between war and the capacity for thought .
Ultimately , there is no rationalizing or comparing one devastating form of injury with another .
In Sgt. Pequeno 's case , however , the war has literally caused him to lose his mind .

Bubble Gum House brings the haters
Polarising pink
There ’s no sitting on the fence when it comes to this joint , you ’ll either love it or loathe it .
And by that we mean really love it or really loathe it .
Thirty - five years ago , on June 12 , 1970 , Pittsburgh Pirate and future Texas Rangers pitcher Dock Ellis found himself in the Los Angeles home of a childhood friend named Al Rambo .
Two days earlier , he'd flown with the Pirates to San Diego for a four - game series with the Padres .
He immediately rented a car and drove to L.A. to see Rambo and his girlfriend Mitzi .
The next 12 hours were a fog of conversation , screwdrivers , marijuana , and , for Ellis , amphetamines .
He went to sleep in the early morning , woke up sometime after noon and immediately took a dose of Purple Haze acid .
Ellis would frequently drop acid on off days and weekends ; he had a room in his basement christened " The Dungeon , " in which he'd lock himself and listen to Jimi Hendrix or Iron Butterfly " for days . "
A bit later , how long exactly he can't recall , he came across Mitzi flipping through a newspaper .
She scanned for a moment , then noticed something .
" Dock , " she said .
" You 're supposed to pitch today . "
Ellis focused his mind .
No. Friday .
He was n't pitching until Friday .
He was sure .
" Baby , " she replied .
" It is Friday .
You slept through Thursday . "
Ellis remained calm .
The game would start late .
Ample time for the acid to wear off .
Then it struck him : doubleheader .
The Pirates had a doubleheader .
And he was pitching the first game .
He had four hours to get to San Diego , warm up and pitch .
If something did n't happen in the interim , Dock Philip Ellis , age 25 , was about to enter a 50,000 - seat stadium and throw a very small ball , very hard , for a very long time , without the benefit of being able to , you know , feel the thing .
Which , it turns out , was one of the least crazy things that happened to him on that particular day .
The high - desert town of Victorville , California , is the last stop on the long road out of Los Angeles , and the place does little to embarrass the word " shithole . "
It 's best known as the home of five prisons , some reportedly very good crystal meth and a kick - ass Long John Silver 's ; its primary attraction to residents is that , unlike the small towns across the mountains in California 's central valley , its air does not always smell like burning tires and cowshit .
It is , in sum , about as far from major league baseball glory as one could get without a spaceship or a body bag .
And it 's the place that , for the past two years , Dock Ellis has called home .
On a recent Friday afternoon , Ellis , now 60 , stands outside his house , waiting for movers to arrive .
Ellis lives in an upscale subdivision of identical homes laid out on identical streets ; this weekend he 's moving to a larger house several blocks away .
Ellis is not a small man -- when he drove up in his wife 's tiny sports coupe , his knees looked like earrings -- and here , now , watching him pace around his front yard , a few flecks of gray are the only suggestion that Ellis ' " heavyball " could n't still kill a small animal .
( Well , plus the fact that he can't lift his arm over his head , having torn his rotator cuff lifting weights in 1993 .
There 's that . )
In conversation , he 's intelligent , funny and what former Rangers owner Brad Corbett calls " dangerously honest . "
Throughout his 12 - year career as a player , he was often labeled a different kind of dangerous .
Brash , gifted and impetuous , he would do almost anything to make a point he believed in .
When baseball brass complained about his haircut , he wore hair curlers on the field .
When a heckler called him nigger during a minor league game in Alabama , he entered the stands , sat among the hecklers and said , " What happened to all those niggers up here ?
All those niggers calling me nigger ? "
( In Ellis ' version of the story , he also has a gun in his pocket . )
When the Cincinnati Reds taunted the Pirates after beating them in the 1972 National League Championship Series , Ellis decided to motivate his team by hitting every single batter in the Reds ' lineup .
He hit the first three and walked two before he was pulled .
He had , in short , that certain combination of raw talent and insanity that very rarely creates Hall of Famers but almost always creates legends .
" Dock Ellis was without question the most intimidating pitcher of his era , " says former MVP and batting champ Dave Parker , who came into the majors on Ellis ' 1973 Pittsburgh Pirates .
" Bob Gibson is up there , too , obviously , but with Dock it was n't just his stuff .
It was his flamboyance , his perceived militancy and his fearlessness .
When he came and said he was gonna hit all those Reds , I thought , ' You ai n't gonna do nothing , man . '
Then he did it .
I gained a lot of respect for him right there .
Dock was and is one of my best friends -- I call him my baseball father -- but after I left the Pirates , he said he was gonna hit me in the face .
And every time I faced him , I was scared . "
Ellis grew up 97 miles southwest of Victorville , in a section of Los Angeles known colloquially as " the Neighborhood " - - a middle - class black suburb nestled between Gardena , Long Beach and Watts .
His childhood was , by all accounts , remarkable mostly in its normalcy :
His parents loved him , he got into trouble here and there , he excelled at sports and practical jokes .
" I met Dock on the front porch of a lady friend 's house in 1962 , " says Al Rambo , Ellis ' cohort the night before the LSD incident .
" He drove up in a 1959 four - door Chevy Impala with ' The Nut ' written on the rear windshield .
He walked up and told me he was a singer .
I asked him to sing , and he said he only did it for money .
" He 's still the person you call if you want to find somebody from the old Neighborhood .
Later , he liked to create this image that he was a gangbanger or something , but Dock never got into much trouble .
Except with the ladies . "
Ellis and Rambo soon began running around with a couple of other neighborhood athletes , calling themselves " The Sons . "
At 6 - foot - 4 , Ellis originally gained notice as a basketball player ; he once had 21 assists in a Gardena High game .
He refused to play for the baseball team -- one of the white players had called him " spearchucker " -- until , during his senior year , he was caught drinking wine in the bathroom .
Play baseball , he was told , or we 'll suspend you .
He played in four games and was named all - league .
Ellis ' true initiation to baseball took place under the tutelage of legendary pitcher Chet Brewer , a 20 - year veteran of the old Negro and Mexican leagues , a man who had played alongside Satchel Paige on the Kansas City Monarchs .
Brewer was a scout for the Pirates and the manager of L.A. 's Pittsburgh Pirate Rookies squad .
( In the days before the draft , such scouts were heavily relied upon to recruit players for rookie teams ; at one point , the talent on Brewer 's team was so impressive that Ellis was n't even their No. 1 pitcher -- and future Hall of Famer Eddie Murray was the bat boy . )
Almost immediately , several teams tried to sign Ellis to a proper minor league contract , but he and his friends had heard of rookie players signing with the Pirates for $ 60,000 , so he held out .
Then , a year out of high school , Ellis got arrested for stealing a car .
( Long story . )
After he got off with probation and a fine , Chet Brewer suggested that , at this point , he might consider signing anything with a dotted line .
And so , in 1964 , Ellis signed a one - year minor - league contract with the Pirates for $ 500 a month , plus a $ 2,500 signing bonus .
The Nut was going to The Show .
Here 's what Ellis remembers about the trip from Los Angeles to San Diego : not a goddamn thing .
Apparently he got to the airport , boarded one of the San Diego shuttles that left every half - hour , flew for 22 minutes and landed .
The first thing he recalls is sitting in a taxi , telling the driver to " get to the fucking stadium .
I got to play . "
Next thing , he 's sitting in the locker room .
5 p.m .
By that point , Ellis had enough experience with LSD to know that it would n't be wearing off anytime soon ; as a , uh , " precautionary measure , " he took somewhere between four and eight amphetamines and drank some water .
He walked to the railing at Jack Murphy Stadium where , each time he played in San Diego , a female acquaintance would bring him a handful of Benzedrine .
White Crosses .
He took a handful of those and went to the bullpen to warm up .
After that , it 's impressions , mostly .
The bullpen .
Throwing .
No idea how that felt , but he can remember being there .
Next : the dugout .
Sitting .
Looking up and seeing drizzle .
Not really how it looked or felt or any of that ; just hoping to shit the game would be canceled .
Just before 6:05 p.m. , the umpire emerged , wiped off home plate and did a quick and basically ceremonial examination of the drizzle situation and signaled to the Pirates ' bench .
The national anthem began .
" Damn .
Looks like I 'm gonna have to pitch . "
At this point , the thing in his hand felt , more or less , like a very heavy volleyball .
Much like rock music or God , baseball is forever being declared dead .
This scandal or that problem has tarnished the game forever ; this strike or that contract has permanently alienated the fans ; this player or that legend declares the sport has seen its best days .
Ellis hates that shit .
" When I played the game . "
" When I played the game . "
The ball is the same , is n't it ?
How about the bat ?
Still four bases ?
OK then .
Looking at tape of Ellis in his prime , what 's most immediately striking is how much bigger -- as in taller , naturally wider , fatter -- the players appear to be ; by contrast , a baseball game in today 's steroid era looks like a carnival of bloated red midgets .
The second - most striking thing is the economy of Ellis ' motion .
There 's no elaborate wind - up , no huge leg kick or head move .
He hides the ball until the last possible moment , then nonchalantly throws a brutal breaking ball .
After a few pitches , it 's easy to see how , even without the best pure stuff in the league , he became one of its premier pitchers .
In 1968 , after being called up from the minors in June , Ellis went 6 - 5 with a 2.51 ERA ; as quickly as the 1971 season , he was 19 - 9 with a 3.06 ERA and starting for the National League in the All - Star game .
He had the arm speed and leg strength , but he also relied heavily on strategy -- which consisted almost entirely of intimidation .
" It 's such an important aspect of the game , " he says .
" Like hitting batsmen .
All hitters know they 're gonna get hit .
They just do n't know when .
The kicker for the truly good hitters is , you cannot hit me as many times as I 'm gonna hit you .
They take that hit to get six hits .
But you gotta pop their ass so you can get an 0 for 4 on them one day .
Do n't get cocky now , motherfucker .
The challenge is on .
So let 's get it on .
Other guys might explain it differently , have different reasons , but that was mine .
" Right about the time I left , it changed .
You can't throw at anyone without getting thrown out of the game .
The announcers today say it ruins the game .
They never talk about the fights that Cincinnati and St. Louis got into 30 years ago .
Barry Bonds ?
I 'd hit him at least once a game .
' Cause he 's got all that shit on .
Yeah , let 's see that shit stop the ball from hurting him if I hit him on the motherfucking elbow or something .
I 'd hit him just to see , does it work ? "
It was also that 1971 All - Star game that first gained Ellis his reputation as a militant -- an image later etched in stone by the 1976 biography Dock Ellis in the Country of Baseball , which declared him " baseball 's Muhammad Ali . "
Before the game , Ellis let it be known that NL manager Sparky Anderson would never start him , because the announced AL starter , Vida Blue , was also black .
This launched the inevitable national sportswriters ' debate about how racism did n't exist in 1971 , and how dare he and why would he and so on and whatnot .
The flap had its intended effect : Anderson , grumblingly , started Ellis , and the pitcher soon became one of the most reviled players in the league , branded a troublemaker and miscreant .
Ellis was untroubled by the affair ; as with most things in which he believed , he openly declared he " did n't give a fuck what anybody thought . "
With possibly one exception : A few days after the All - Star game , Ellis received a letter in the mail .
" I read your comments in our paper the last few days , " it read , " and wanted you to know how much I appreciate your honesty .
The news media , while knowing full well you are right and honest , will use every means to get back at you .
Honors that should be yours will bypass you and the pressures will be great -- try not to be left alone .
There will be times when you ask yourself if it 's worth it all .
I can only say , Dock , it is .
Sincerely ,
Jackie Robinson "
What 's weird is that sometimes it felt like a balloon .
Sometimes it felt like a golf ball .
But he could always get it to the plate .
Getting it over the plate was another matter entirely .
Sometimes he could n't see the hitter .
Sometimes he could n't see the catcher .
But if he could see the hitter , he 'd guess where the catcher was .
And he had a great catcher back there .
Jerry May .
You could make mistakes with him , and he would compensate .
He 'd know if he called for a curveball , he could look at the follow - through of your arm and see if you were gonna hang it .
So he'd get ready to slide and block .
Also , he had this reflective tape on his fingers that was by far the easiest thing to see .
Ellis had no idea what the score was , and he knew he'd been wild -- he ended with eight walks , one hit batsman and the bases loaded at least twice -- but here it was , bottom of the seventh , and he was still in the game .
The hardest part was between innings .
He was sure his teammates knew something was up .
They had all been acting strange since the game began .
Solution : Do not look at teammates .
Do not look at scoreboard .
Must not make eye contact .
His spikes -- that 's what he concentrated on .
Pick up tongue depressor , scrape the mud , repeat .
Must .
Clean .
Spikes .
Sometime in the fifth or sixth , he sensed someone next to him .
Looking .
He turned .
It was rookie infielder Dave Cash .
" Dock , " Cash said .
" You 've got a no - hitter going . "
Cash , apparently unaware of the ( insanely well - known ) superstition that a pitcher never talks about a no- hitter until it 's complete for fear of jinxing it , was immediately piled upon by several outraged teammates .
Ellis , meanwhile , looked at the scoreboard .
Huh .
Yeah .
After the eighth , during which he'd watched outfielder Matty Alou snag an almost certain base hit , Ellis walked off the field and looked Cash straight in the eye .
" Still got my no - no ! " Ellis declared .
Ellis ' last good year as a pitcher came in 1977 , his first of two with the Rangers .
In the interim , his reputation as a wildman had grown exponentially .
There were the hair curlers ( which inspired a spread in Ebony about his hairstyles ) , the biography , the beaning of the Cincinnati Reds .
There was a July 1976 incident , after being traded to the Yankees before that season , in which Ellis decided to retaliate against Reggie Jackson for showboating after a brutal home run in the 1971 All - Star game -- and hit him in the face with a fastball .
Jackson was carried off the field on a stretcher ; four years later , he'd tell reporters that his face was still numb .
Ellis had been maced by security guards , threatened by his own managers and declared the most unpopular Pittsburgh Pirate ever .
Rangers owner Brad Corbett did n't care about any of it .
" I absolutely loved him , " says Corbett , who acquired Ellis from the A's in June 1977 .
" The biggest misperception about Dock is that he's this untamed , self - destructive wildman .
And part of that is true ; he was crazy , but in a good way .
He was fun .
He had a way of keeping people loose .
He was a practical joker .
He had character .
Everybody loves to talk about that LSD no -hitter , but come on .
Stuff like that was happening all the time .
Everybody was doing something .
One relief pitcher we traded for , I went to meet him in New York at Studio 54 .
And I walk in and look over and say to myself , ' Hmm .
Is that sugar ? '
" And of course , number one , he was a damn good pitcher and a terrific competitor .
In fact , at one point , we traded him to Cleveland , and I felt so bad about losing him that I called the trade off .
And by that point , he was at the end of his career , and his arm was fading .
It clearly was n't the right business decision , but I just could n't let Dock go . "
The Rangers ' 1977 starting rotation of Ellis ( who went 10 - 6 with a 2.90 ERA after he joined the team ) , Ferguson Jenkins , Doyle Alexander and Bert Blyleven remains the strongest starting four the club has ever had ; that team 's 94 wins , which placed it second behind Kansas City 's 102 , were the strongest whiff of the playoffs the Rangers would get until the AL West was pared down to four teams , making it easier for the Rangers to climb to the top of a very short pile .
But Corbett was right : Ellis ' arm was fading , his body haunted by a problem that , like racism , he had first experienced upon arriving in the majors .
One day early in his career , Ellis was lying on the dugout bench , " half - assed asleep and hungover , " and found out he was supposed to pitch .
An older player leaned over and handed Ellis a plastic cup .
" I said , ' What the hell is that ? ' "
Ellis recalls .
" He said , ' Juice . '
I drank it , and next thing I know , I was out there on the mound like [ Juan ] Marechal .
And I liked it . "
Ellis had just had his first experience with amphetamines ; by the time he arrived on the Pirates proper , Ellis was popping green Dexamyl pills before every game .
Eventually , he 'd need between 70 and 85 milligrams to get up for a start ; that would be somewhere between five and 12 pills , depending on what type he took .
And over the next 12 years , he would n't pitch a single major league game without them .
Not one .
" Doctors are n't gonna come out and say it , but it enhances your game , " Ellis says .
" The thing is , you get addicted to it .
You take half a pill and do great .
Then you take half three weeks later and do n't do good , so you say maybe I better take the other half .
' Cause I 'm not feeling the same way .
It got to the point where I had to take it just to be on the bench , when I 'm not pitching .
Just to stay awake .
" Why ?
Fear .
Fear of success and fear of failure . "
By his final year , 1979 , there was n't much cause for Ellis to fear success .
He bounced from the Rangers to the Mets , compiled a 4 - 12 record with a 5.98 ERA and made one last request to Pittsburgh General Manager " Pete " Peterson :
Trade me or let me die a Pirate .
He was granted his request and made three relief appearances with the Bucs .
When Corbett sold the Rangers before the 1980 season , Ellis made it official and retired .
By that point , he did n't care about baseball at all .
All he cared about was getting high .
Speed , cocaine , even scotch .
Which he hated .
" Then my son was born , " Ellis says .
" I was wearing a lot of jewelry at the time , and when I 'd hold him , I 'd grab his arms and whatnot .
Then I read these stories about parents who shake their kids and kill them .
I asked myself , I wonder how hard I 'm grabbing him .
Then I realized the truly fucked - up thing : that I had to ask myself at all .
That 's when I knew , something 's wrong with me .
I went to treatment the next day .
" I was in there sniffing pingpong balls , trying to get high .
A doctor came to me and asked me to list all the substances I 'd done in my life .
He looked at the paper and said , ' I have to classify you as suicidal . '
I said fuck you .
Suicidal .
He handed me back the paper and said , ' Anyone who 's doing that is trying to kill themselves . '
I looked at him and thought about that .
After a minute , I told him nobody will ever have to worry about me getting high ever again . "
This is the point of the story at which things are supposed to get ugly .
There should be backsliding , stories of long sweaty nights with " friends " whose last names you do n't know , possibly a homeless period or two .
None of it happened to Ellis .
After he quit baseball and cleaned up , he 's had basically no contact with the game -- he played a couple of seasons in a senior league and was briefly hired by George Steinbrenner ( " the only person in baseball who was n't afraid I 'd be the old Dock Ellis " ) as a minor league drug counselor -- but mostly he 's been eating Snickers and drinking Dr Pepper , working as a drug counselor .
He seems to genuinely miss the game , especially the fans , but he does n't seem devastated by it .
" You know , I 'm just clean and sober and going on about my business , " he says .
" But there 's gotta be a place for me in baseball .
I should be with baseball .
But that 's partly my fault .
I alienated myself .
I left baseball with the wrong impression about the people who ran the game .
' Cause I had that paranoia that everybody was out to get me . "
" It 's almost like Dock wanted people to think he was n't as smart as he is , " Dave Parker says .
" But the people he 's close to , we know . "
One day last month , Ellis walked into the Victor Valley penitentiary , where , for the past two years , he 's worked as a drug counselor .
He said he had a surprise for his class .
HBO Sports was doing a piece on him , and they 'd dug up an old black - and - white videotape of that June 1970 game against the Pirates .
To that point , Ellis swore that no tape of the game existed , and he'd never seen himself pitch high on LSD .
And this would be the first time he was watching it .
As the game enters the ninth , it gets to two outs , three balls and two strikes , and then the tape cuts straight to a postgame interview .
" I remember getting that last out , " Ellis says .
" And turning around and saying , ' A fucking no -hitter ! '
It did n't really hit me until the next morning , when I was less high , and I got a live phone call from CBS or ABC or something wanting to interview me .
They kept telling me to turn the TV down .
Too much feedback . "
The class looked at Ellis ' postgame interview and dissected his mannerisms , laughing at how obvious it seemed that he was high .
In a way , Ellis ending up on the straight and narrow in this small town , spending his days with criminals who are in the same boat he once was , not caring so much about baseball or his legacy -- he could n't have found a better confirmation of the faith that the Brad Corbetts and George Steinbrenners , the Al Rambos and the Dave Parkers placed in him when he was at his craziest : the belief that somewhere beneath the hair curlers and the fancy clothes and the fights and the clenched jaws was a man of true character .
The sport of baseball has , since his retirement , more or less shunned him because of who he was .
The irony , of course , is that Ellis ' one - time problems , which prevented him from being a truly great player , have since revealed him to be something more like a great person .
And baseball , like the rest of us , could use a few more of those .

There are many devices available today that are technically able to run BitTorrent , but the manufacturers choose to limit the usability of their devices .
TorrentFreak chats to the developer of TorrentRelay , a service that allows you to download torrents on the PS3 , iPhone and many other web - enabled devices .
So you have a brand new , super - powerful , web - enabled device that could easily run 3rd party software – if only the manufacturer had n’t spent millions locking the device down so it can’t .
Luckily , there are third party services that make it possible to put these gadgets to further use .
TorrentFreak spoke with Kevin Kowalewski of TorrentRelay , which is designed to bring BitTorrent functionality to platforms that do n’t support a native torrent client , such as the PlayStation 3 , Wii or iPhone .
As we had an iPhone to hand , we decided to give this system a go , choosing the easy mininova option ( detailed below ) and downloading a single .jpg image from a wallpaper pack .
In just a few seconds the image appeared in Safari as promised , but due to limitations in the current version of Safari , it was n’t directly possible to save the image .
I know there is an addon somewhere that already provides this functionality , if only I could find it … but the file transfer component worked fine .
TF : Please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your background .
KK : My name is Kevin Kowalewski and i’m a student at Seneca College ’s Computer Systems Technology program .
I ’ve always been interested in computers , Perl , PHP , Python etc and wanted to make a project over the summer .
TF : Could you give tell us a bit more about history about the project ?
KK : A lot of work needed to be done in reverse engineering the BitTorrent protocol – my original plans were to have it completely “ stream ” the download from peers into a browser .
Over time the project evolved , from this simple goal to download pieces in order and to get them to the browser , to the user friendly and stable code base you see today .
Mostly written in Perl , the TorrentRelay site aims to provide any user with the ability to download torrents .
Any browser that supports Javascript will do great and any other browser will still work !
Desktop browsers get the most enjoyment by unchecking the ‘ Load only when complete ’ check box but leaving Ajax support on .
TF : What technical challenges have you faced ?
KK :
There were many hurdles to overcome while on this project , Perl ’s handling of memory for one , interfacing with the core downloader , managing all these users requests in a timely manner and allowing it to seed as well .
TF : So how does the system work exactly ?
KK : The system itself is really straightforward .
Simply visit the TorrentRelay site and there you ’ll be presented with three ways to get your torrent :
1. ) The most common way is “ Browse and select ” , which allows you to choose a torrent from your local file system .
2 . ) The URL method which allows you to simply copy the URL of where the torrent is online .
3 . ) The third option , my personal favorite , is by Mininova ID .
Just jot down the short 7 digit code found on Mininova torrents , and hit ‘ Get ID ’ .
You can easily find the corresponding Mininova ID from the download link , just hover over it and you ’ll see it in the bottom of your browser .
Next you ’ll be presented with a list of the files within the torrent .
Leaving the “ Load only when complete ” checkbox ensures your browser wo n’t timeout when downloading .
The server will temporarily buffer the entire contents of the file prior to sending it to you .
On desktop browsers , unchecking this produces amazing results .
As the torrent downloads the data is sent to your ‘ Save as ’ dialog , improving overall download time to you .
Leaving the “ Ajax ” checkbox lets you see updates in real - time .
Most browsers ( including the PS3 ) support Ajax , so leaving it checked it recommended .
On smaller browsers ( like the Nokia N95 ) , un-checking this is a good idea .
The constant Ajax requests are too much for its browser to handle .
You ’ll get the same updates , just in a list style .
Just click on the file you want , opening it in a new tab ( or window ) is recommended .
Here you ’ll see your torrents progress .
As it downloads you ’ll get regular updates .
If you unchecked the ‘ Load only when complete ’ box , you ’ll get a save as shortly after it starts to download .
Otherwise you ’ll get the ‘ Save - as ’ when its complete .
TF : What are your plans for future development ?
KK : Hardware - wise , plans for the future include getting a new server !
The demand has been great and we ’re in the process of getting a new dual Xeon , if anyone could donate it would be great , since I ’m but a poor engineering student .
From a software perspective we ’re planning on allowing users to run and view their torrent progress side - by - side , in a nice list format .
Also , they ’d be able to come back later and use the same previously downloaded data again .
This way they can setup their torrents , close their browser and can come back at a later time to get them !
TF : Thanks for taking the time to talk with us and good luck with the rest of the project !
Stay with me here .
Michael O’Leary , Ryanair ’s fearless leader and king of publicity , has announced his plans for a transatlantic airline .
And yes , it will apparently include blowjobs .
His plan ?
A bunch of economy class seats that will sell for 10 euros or something really cheap like that as well as a business class that ’ll run you 4,000 to 5,000 euros .
Why would you pay that much ?
“ Beds and blowjobs . ” Now THAT ’s a value proposition .
Do n’t believe me ?
Watch for yourself ( sorry , but the video is blowjob free ) :
I ’m actually surprised that he gets that you need to have a premium cabin to make this work , but it ’s his spin on the product that makes this blogworthy .
Will it happen ?
Probably not , but he ’ll get all kinds of people to write about it .
Heck who knows if he ’ll ever get this thing off the ground at all , but who cares ?
Just watching his translator squirm is worth the post .
The Scenic Railway was the centrepiece of Dreamland
Up to 80 firefighters have been battling a blaze which severely damaged a listed rollercoaster at the former Dreamland amusement site in Kent .
Police said they were treating the fire , which broke out on Monday afternoon at the Scenic Railway at Margate , as suspicious .
Kent Fire and Rescue Service had 12 appliances at the scene and a pall of black smoke hung over the town .
Fire investigation officers will enter the site when it is declared safe .
BBC Radio Kent reporter David Linington said the wooden rollercoaster had collapsed .
" It is devastating , " said Thanet District Council leader Sandy Ezekiel .
" It is tragic - I used to go on it when I was a kid .
" To see it like this is heartbreaking . "
The Grade II listed rollercoaster is believed to be one of the oldest of its kind left in the world .
" It looks like a third of the scenic railway has been completely lost and all the carriages appear to have gone , if they were in the building next door which went up , " said Mr Ezekiel .
" When I arrived , the flames were 40 - 50 ft high from the top of the ride .
" The fire brigade did a tremendous job in bringing it under control very quickly .
The fire is now out and they are dampening down . "
The future of the Dreamland site , which opened in 1920 , is uncertain but campaigners and planners want it to become a heritage amusement park as part of a redevelopment scheme for Margate seafront .
Consciousness is undoubtedly one of the most complex and interesting phenomena in the universe .
Wrapping our minds around the concept of mind has vexed philosophers and scientists for centuries – perhaps because it is the task of the brain trying to understand itself .
This has led to many theories and bizarre beliefs about consciousness – that it is non-physical , that it is due to quantum weirdness , or that it requires new laws of nature to explain .
And yet modern philosophers and neuroscientists are increasingly of the opinion that perhaps it ’s not such a hard problem after all .
Perhaps the real trick is realizing that it ’s not even a problem at all .
Yesterday I wrote my most recent reply to Michael Egnor ’s rather lame attempt at defending what is called cartesian dualism – the notion that consciousness requires the addition of something non-physical .
Ironically he invoked the writings of David Chalmers to his cause , not realizing ( or not caring ) that Chalmers is a harsh critic of cartesian dualism and rather supports what he calls “ naturalistic dualism . ”
Chalmers believes that the “ something extra ” required to explain consciousness is a new law of nature , not a non-physical spiritus .
Today I will discuss Chalmers ’ proposed solution ( actually he points the way to a solution but acknowledges he does not yet have one ) and its major critic , Daniel Dennett .
The Problem of Subjectivity
At the core of the debate over consciousness is the nature of subjective experience .
Why is it that we have subjective experience , that we feel , and we have the sense that we exist ?
Why are n’t we , as David Chalmers asks , just “ zombies ” – carrying out all of the processes of life without experiencing it ?
Part of the enduring controversy over this question is that it intersects with a deeper question about the nature of science itself .
Can science rely upon subjective experience to understand nature ?
Or ( a related question ) can science formulate models of reality that include elements that cannot be objectively observed and tested ?
If we do n’t allow subjectivity , then how do we study the phenomenon of subjective experience itself ?
I admit this is a thorny problem .
Former Buddhist monk , B. Alan Wallace , has written a number of books and articles advocating , for this reason , the reintroduction of subjective experience into scientific thinking .
I disagree with him on this point , and also on the way in which he invokes quantum mechanics to support his form of dualism – but this is a topic of a future post ( perhaps later this week ) .
The question of whether or not science should restrict itself to the observable and testable has plagued the world of physics since the time of Einstein and the death of the classical model of nature .
In the classical world there was no doubt that what we observe about the world is the same as the way the world actually is .
Quantum mechanics put an end to this simplicity .
In the quantum world , elegant experiments have shown us that nature , at its fundamental level , is counterintuitive .
Matter exists simultaneously as both a wave and a particle , and the properties of matter can only be described statistically based upon probability – the Heisenberg uncertainty principle , that we can only know so much about the physical properties of matter , laid waste to classical determinism .
This lead to the great question – is quantum mechanics simply a system that accurately describes and predicts what we see during experiments , or does it describe the way nature actually is – and ( here ’s the really important bit ) is there a difference ?
Ironically , Albert Einstein revolutionized physics with relativity theory by being the first physicist to say that the variability of time and space is not just a system for explaining observation – it actually describes the way the universe works .
Prior to Einstein physicists invoked the ether – an unseen and unknown substance permeating all space and through which light propagated .
The ether was a fix to rescue classical physics from the observations of reality .
Einstein then , later in life , took the opposite position by resisting the notion that quantum mechanics actually described nature , as opposed to just our experiments .
( This is summarized by his famous quip , “ God does not play dice with the universe . ” )
Einstein wanted ( but failed ) to develop a unified field theory to explain what was really going on ( to rescue the classic world he helped destroy ) , while younger physicists , such as Max Born , argued that what we see is what we get – science must restrict itself to what can be tested and observed .
So What is Consciousness
This same type of dilemma that so vexed Einstein is now faced by philosophers and scientists trying to crack the consciousness nut .
Everyone ( outside of cartesian dualists ) seems to agree that neuroscience is making tremendous progress in explaining what Chalmers calls “ the easy problems ” of neuroscience – explaining observable , objective , measurable mental phenomena as brain states and function .
But neuroscience has not offered an explanation for the subjective experience of consciousness – the “ hard problem . ”
( Chalmers outlines his views in this paper published in 1995 . )
Chalmers believes that there is something more that is needed than a reductionist description of brain function .
He thinks there is a higher order natural process going on – an actual new law of nature as fundamental as electromagnetism – that explains how brain activity causes consciousness .
I think this is akin to Einstein ’s desire to find an underlying unifying theory of physics that would do away with all the apparent quantum weirdness .
Chalmers wants to find a “ grand unification theory ” of consciousness .
His imagined new law of nature is his ether of the mind .
Chalmers may ultimately be correct ( just as Einstein may ultimately turn out to have been correct – we may yet find some deeper reality underlying quantum mechanics ) .
I cannot think of any reason why Chalmers must be wrong – there may be some higher order process going on .
But at this point I find Chalmers ’ proposition as unnecessary as the ether .
Further , Chalmers also says that perhaps consciousness arises from some property of nature that science cannot discover , even in principle .
This gets back to the argument about the nature of science – do the methods of science tell us how nature is , or just that part of nature that science can test ?
I believe it must be the latter – untestable notions have no useful place in science .
Chalmers ’ untestable law of consciousness cannot lead anywhere .
Emergent Phenomenon
Perhaps the most direct challenge to Chalmers has come from philosophy Daniel Dennett .
He has raised a number of excellent points challenging Chalmers ’ contention of the hard problem .
Particularly revealing is the analogy to vitalism – the notion of a vital life force that separates animate from inanimate objects .
He writes :
The easy problems of life include those of explaining the following phenomena : reproduction , development , growth , metabolism , self - repair , immunological self - defense , . . . .
These are not all that easy , of course , and it may take another century or so to work out the fine points , but they are easy compared to the really hard problem : life itself .
We can imagine something that was capable of reproduction , development , growth , metabolism , self - repair and immunological self - defense , but that was n’t , you know , alive .
The residual mystery of life would be untouched by solutions to all the easy problems .
In fact , when I read your accounts of life , I am left feeling like the victim of a bait - and - switch .
This imaginary vitalist just does n’t see how the solution to all the easy problems amounts to a solution to the imagined hard problem .
Somehow this vitalist has got under the impression that being alive is something over and above all these subsidiary component phenomena .
I do n’t know what we can do about such a person beyond just patiently saying : your exercise in imagination has misfired ; you ca n’t imagine what you say you can , and just saying you can does n’t cut any ice .
( Dennett , 1991 , p.281-2 )
Therefore the vitalists of old claimed that a vital force was necessary to explain life .
Biologists then proceeded to explain all the components of life until nothing was left for vitalism to explain , except a vague sense that being alive is somehow a thing unto itself .
Dennett compares this to the dualists ( all dualists , including naturalistic dualists like Chalmers ) – if neuroscience can explain all of the cognitive phenomena that we can observe : memory , perceptive , communication , reflection , etc. , then perhaps it has explained consciousness as well as biology has explained life .
Then there would be no more need for a separate explanation for consciousness as there is for a vitalistic force to explain life .
In other words – life is what we collectively call a host of complex and organized chemical reactions resulting in the ability to use energy for growth and reproduction .
Life emerges from the component parts that make it up , but there is no extra thing that is life .
Likewise , perhaps consciousness is what emerges when the brain is actively engaged in its various functions .
When we are perceiving stimuli , keeping information in our working memory and manipulating it , carrying on an internal conversation with ourselves , etc. – all of these things add up to consciousness without the need for any extra added thing .
In this sense consciousness in an emergent phenomenon – not a new law of nature or a bit of mysterious magic .
While I admit it is difficult to fully comprehend this notion , I find it the most compelling of all the options .
Chalmers ’ primary objection comes down to – why do we experience anything ?
Why are n’t we zombies – carrying out all the functions we ascribe to consciousness without being conscious .
I think the simple answer is – what ’s the difference ?
What if carrying out all the functions of consciousness IS consciousness ?
Dennett explains it thusly :
What impresses me about my own consciousness , as I know it so intimately , is my delight in some features and dismay over others , my distraction and concentration , my unnamable sinking feelings of foreboding and my blithe disregard of some perceptual details , my obsessions and oversights , my ability to conjure up fantasies , my inability to hold more than a few items in consciousness at a time , my ability to be moved to tears by a vivid recollection of the death of a loved one , my inability to catch myself in the act of framing the words I sometimes say to myself , and so forth .
These are all “ merely ” the “ performance of functions ” or the manifestation of various complex dispositions to perform functions .
In the course of making an introspective catalogue of evidence , I would n’t know what I was thinking about if I could n’t identify them for myself by these functional differentia .
Subtract them away , and nothing is left beyond a weird conviction ( in some people ) that there is some ineffable residue of “ qualitative content ” bereft of all powers to move us , delight us , annoy us , remind us of anything .
I also add to this that there are different states of consciousness that correlate with different brain states – not just the function changes , but subjective consciousness changes as well .
For example – dreaming is a form of consciousness .
You are still yourself and you are aware and many of the components of consciousness are there , but it is also different .
One difference is that reality testing ( a specific cognitive function ) is not as active .
That is why often dreams make sense to you while you are dreaming but then to your awake consciousness it seems unreal .
Being inebriated is also an altered state of consciousness , as are all so - called encephalopathies where overall brain function is impaired .
In other words , if you change or impair the “ easy problem ” functional components of consciousness you also change consciousness – the simplest explanation for this is that consciousness emerges from those functional components .
Conclusion
Philosophers and scientists still struggle to put into words exactly what consciousness is , and it does defy easy conceptualization .
But I think the best explanation , and one that is consistent will all observable phenomena – both what we can objectively measure , and what we subjectively experience – is that consciousness is an emergent property of all that the brain does .
I do not think we need to invoke quantum weirdness , I do not think we need to appeal to unfalsifiable inherent laws of nature , nor non-physical causes .
At least that ’s what I think .
The members of JerkRag are having something of a shitty night .
It 's an unseasonably rain - drenched evening in May , and the setup for their third - ever gig has been marred by endless difficulties , including missing equipment and soundboard snafus .
They 've spent weeks practicing in anticipation of rocking the rafters of Tempe nightclub Suite 301 , but complications ( coupled with the downpour that 's kept a good chunk of their audience away ) have left them irritated .
But aggravation turns into aggressiveness as they furiously kick off their gig with Stone Temple Pilots ' " Sex Type Thing , " causing the crowd of around 40 fans and friends in attendance to holler in approval .
Info JerkRag Flicka's Baja Cantina JerkRag , and Ronin Meyer are scheduled to perform on Saturday , June 28 .
Drama like this is common to any new group taking baby steps into the local scene , but JerkRag is a different sort of band altogether .
Hell , they are n't even a " real " band , at least not in the traditional sense .
And while 28 - year - old guitarist Evan Dally ( a.k.a. " Brock McGraw " ) appears to be frenetically working a Fender Stratocaster and 26 - year - old percussionist Brian " The Czern " Czerniak seemingly bangs on an electronic drum kit , neither device is an actual instrument .
Moreover , the grinding grunge rhythms and thumping backbeat blasting through the club 's amplifiers have been pre-recorded .
If you 're suspecting a Milli Vanilli - style musical con job , an explanation is in order .
Dally and Czerniak are using plastic game controllers shaped like their respective instruments , as JerkRag is ( essentially ) a Rock Band band .
Their " performances " consist of expertly playing the blockbuster Xbox 360 and PlayStation rhythm game onstage at local nightspots while costumed in hair - metal sleaze - wear ( complete with mullet wigs ) and executing gonzo stage shenanigans .
In the grand spectrum of rock , JerkRag ranks somewhere between karaoke and tribute acts like the Atomic Punks .
If virtual bands like Gorillaz create original music , but their members are embodied by digital avatars , then JerkRag is somewhat the opposite , a real - life representation of virtual rockers .
It 's life imitating art imitating life , with enough simulacra and hyper- reality to fill a Jean Baudrillard tome .
" Our main goal is to entertain the fuck out of people who 've come to see us , " Czerniak says .
" I know it sounds funny because we 're a band that is n't playing real instruments , but we 're really good at the game and thought the idea of a wild Rock Band band would be funny . "
For the uninitiated , the ultra-popular game ( similar in design to the rival Guitar Hero series ) simulates the rock ' n ' roll experience , with up to four players matching the notes , beats , and vocals of classic and current pop / rock songs .
As notes and lyrics scroll down and across the screen , wanna - be Eric Claptons use the " fret buttons " and " strum bar " on guitar - shaped controllers , while skinbeaters hit drum pads , and vocalists match the pitch on a USB microphone .
Meanwhile , custom - designed rock star avatars perform for sold - out arenas in the background .
If players miss their cues too often , the game grinds to a halt and the crowd boos loudly .
Since its release in November , Rock Band ( like Guitar Hero before it ) has become popular at dozens of Valley nightspots , with patrons playing along to chart busters like Rush 's " Tom Sawyer " in a more social setting than their living rooms .
These venues , however , have never seen a group of Rock Band players as outrageous as JerkRag .
The band formed for a Rock Band competition in March at Axis / Radius in Scottsdale .
Shrum says they picked an outrageous - sounding name and bought heavy metal Halloween costumes .
After winning $ 100 bar credit for best outfits , they kept the momentum going by becoming a pseudo - band , but with all the trappings of a real band , including gigs , T - shirts , and even a mockumentary .
James Devine , the manager of Sandbar Mexican Grill in Scottsdale , was in attendance at the Axis / Radius night and booked JerkRag to perform a set in mid-April at his bar 's weekly Rock Band night on Wednesdays , which nearly 100 people attended .
JerkRag tries to play flawlessly to avoid having the game stop during their gigs , and having to endure boos — both real and virtual .
That 's why , says 29 - year - old Hogan Shrum ( a.k.a. " Vincent Storm " ) , they rehearse up to 12 hours a week ( in a garage , no less ) .
" That 's more than some real bands practice , " Shrum says .
" We want to be able to play and perform without having to look at the screen at all . "
That 's not the only way JerkRag parallels real groups .
There 's also the oh - so - common malady of band infighting .
" We 've gotten into some nasty fights in the garage while practicing , " Shrum says .
" I 've been busy working lately and have n't had enough time to devote to practice , and I get shit for it in a major way . "
All three members switch up instruments for variety , and play the game at the " expert " difficulty level ( except for vocals , as easier settings permit more vocal flourishes ) , because it requires the most effort on their part and shows they 're actually playing the game .
There 's a difference between them and some dude playing air guitar .
" We do n't want people to hear notes and not see us hitting a button or moving our fingers , because it'll look cheesy or tacky , " Czerniak says .
Currently , JerkRag 's set lists are limited to the nearly 200 songs available for the game , but they 're constantly expanding ( with new downloadable songs available weekly from game creator Harmonix through the Xbox Live and PlayStation Network online services ) .
Their repertoire stands to grow exponentially when Guitar Hero World Tour ( the latest edition in its franchise ) debuts in October .
The specs on the sequel indicate it 'll be very Rock Band - like , adding the same instruments to the mix .
Strum says they plan on incorporating both games ( and the related peripherals and song libraries ) into their shows .
" We 'll change instruments during the middle of a set , " he jokes .
" Maybe we 'll have a guitar tech , or a drum tech . "
While mashing buttons in time to the beats of songs like Metallica 's " Enter Sandman " wo n't exactly teach you how to play it on a real instrument , there are some instrument - playing skills that can be cribbed from the game , Hogan says .
" As a musician , it gives me more finger strength and control when I 'm playing a real guitar .
The only thing it does n't teach you are specific chords and finger - placements on the neck , " he says .
" You can also get some fundamentals on the drums , since the controller is sorta like using a five - piece kit . "
Since JerkRag 's gotten some fundamentals from the game ( and its members have some musical background ) , why not become a bona fide band ?
Czerniak says that they 're already happy with the attention they 've gotten thus far .
Plus , they 'd lose their hook .
" We get to act and live the role of rock stars , " he says .
" We 're taking full advantage of this situation for as long as people give us their attention .
I have the utmost respect for [ Phoenix ] bands like Vayden and Ronin Meyer , [ but ] what we are doing is something completely different . "
And how do they respond to anyone calling them fake ?
" Bullshit , " Dally says .
" To a degree , we 're playing the music and propelling the song forward .
The actual sound that 's coming out from the drums is generated by our actions .
When one of us is singing , it 's just us . "
Shrum explains further .
" Countless people have come up after we 've performed and said , ' You guys were n't playing instruments , ' and my response is , ' Did you have a good time ?
Did we rock it or what ? ' " he says .
" Besides , we do n't take ourselves too seriously . "
Illustrating this , he says , will be the work - in - progress mockumentary , Almost Infamous : The Story of JerkRag , being created by local filmmaker Amy Newman ( a former animator at Phoenix 's now - defunct Fox Animation Studios ) .
Shrum describes it as a quasi- improvisational , multi-part serial in the vein of This Is Spinal Tap ( natch ) .
They 'll release the mockumentary on DVD and online .
( One bit involves Czerniak trying out real instruments at Guitar Center , only to discover he can't shred as well as in Rock Band . )
" The plot is going to involve us as [ our ] characters taking ourselves completely too seriously , " Shrum says .
" There 's so much opportunity with the world of music and the nuances of rock bands that we could make [ fun of with ] segments at shows , sort of like Flight of the Conchords , if you will , about a Rock Band band that 's over the top and excessive . "
When confronted with the fact that VH1 ( sister company of Harmonix ) created a similar satire titled Rock Band Cometh : The Rock Band Band Story before the game 's release , Czerniak denies ripping it off , saying the network 's project was more of a parody of Behind the Music .
" People think everything we 're doing is funny — the shows , the mockumentary , everything — so we 're going to take JerkRag as far as we can go , " Czerniak says .
And how far is that ?
" Probably until the novelty wears off , " he says .
LOS ANGELES
WATER has always been an issue in California .
But drought conditions , not to mention worries about continued supplies of clean water , are turning water into a growth industry in California and elsewhere .
Big companies like General Electric , Siemens and Veolia Environnement of France have ambitious plans to bring water to developing countries and clean water everywhere .
But many small companies are finding niches and doing well these days , too .
Puretec Industrial Water , of Oxnard , Calif. , for example , “ grew 34 percent last year , ” said Jim Harris , the owner and president .
The company , with 90 employees , leaped to $ 18 million in revenue from $ 13.5 million in 2006 .
“ We have 4,000 customers , ” said Mr. Harris , “ but we have grown 15 percent or more every year since I started . ”
Puretec dates back to 1965 , when Mr. Harris started an industrial division of his father ’s and grandfather ’s water business .
They were franchisees of Culligan water softeners , a residential service that removed minerals from local water to make tap water taste better .

A Dutch storeowner is sick of shoplifting , so he decides to make a huge celebration of the 10,000th shoplifter , including even a parade !
Senator Barack Obama said Thursday that he was “ deeply disappointed ” for new controversial statements that a friend of his delivered from the pulpit of his Chicago church .
This time , the words were not from his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. , but rather from a Catholic priest who was mocking Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton .
During a guest appearance last Sunday at Trinity United Church of Christ , the Rev. Michael Pfleger delivered a blistering critique of Mrs. Clinton ’s candidacy .
Mr. Pfleger , a wellknown activist Chicago priest and a friend of Mr. Obama , said Mrs. Clinton felt entitled to the presidency and was stunned by “ a black man stealing my show . ”
The remarks from Mr. Pfleger first appeared on several blogs in Chicago on Thursday , accompanied by a You Tube video of his words to the congregation .
“ When Hillary was crying , and people said that was put on – I really do n’t believe it was put on , ” Mr. Pfleger said .
“ I really believe that she just always thought this is mine .
I ’m Bill ’s wife , I ’m white and this is mine .
I just gotta get up and step into the plate .
And then , out of nowhere , came ‘ Hey , I ’m Barack Obama . ’
And she said , ‘ Oh , damn .
Where did you come from ?
I ’m white .
I ’m entitled .
There ’s a black man stealing my show . ”
In his next breath , Mr. Pfleger wipes his face and mocks Mrs. Clinton ’s tears , saying : “ She was n’t the only one crying .
There was a whole lot of white people crying . ”
Before he stepped away from the pulpit of Mr. Obama ’s church that has been under intense scrutiny , he added : “ I ’m sorry .
I do n’t want to get you in any more trouble . ”
Mr. Obama , through a statement released to reporters , said he was “ deeply disappointed . ”
“ As I have traveled this country , I ’ve been impressed by not what divides us , but by all that that unites us , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ That is why I am deeply disappointed in Father Pfleger ’s divisive , backward - looking rhetoric , which does n’t reflect the country I see or the desire of people across America to come together in common cause . ”
Mr. Pfleger , who is the pastor of Saint Sabina Catholic Church in Chicago , a largely black congregation , said he regretted the words he preached last Sunday .
“ These words are inconsistent with Senator Obama ’s life and message , and I am deeply sorry if they offended Senator Clinton or anyone else who saw them , ” he said in a statement released to reporters by his church .
Mr. Obama was not present during the remarks on Sunday .
Since he began distancing himself from his longtime pastor about two months ago , he has not attended services at Trinity United Church of Christ on Chicago ’s South Side .
Howard Wolfson , a chief spokesman for Mrs. Clinton , said the remarks were unacceptable and called on Mr. Obama to more forcefully reject the comments .
“ Divisive and hateful language like that is totally counterproductive in our efforts to bring our party together and have no place at the pulpit or in our politics , ” Mr. Wolfson said Thursday evening .
“ We are disappointed that Senator Obama did n’t specifically reject Father ’s Pflegler ’s despicable comments about Senator Clinton , and assume he will do so . ”
Apple beat all comers in a Consumer Reports survey released Monday that rates the technical support offered by computer makers .
Apple topped the rankings for both laptop and desktop support , beating out Lenovo , Dell , Toshiba , Gateway , Sony and HP .
Consumer Reports based its ratings feedback from owners of more than 4,500 laptop computers and almost 5,600 desktop computers who contacted manufacturer tech support between September 2006 and January 2008 .
Computer owners were asked to rate their experience based on three criteria :
Whether the manufacturer solved their problem , how long they waited to talk with someone on the phone , and how knowledgeable the support staff were .
Apple received the highest ranking of “ Better ” in all three areas for both laptops and desktops — the only company to do so .
Consumer Reports rated customer satisfaction with tech support on a scale of 0 to 100 , with 100 being the most satisfied .
Apple scored an 83 in the laptop survey and an 81 on the desktop side .
A ranking over 80 means that respondents were very satisfied , according to Consumer Reports — Apple was the only manufacturer to top 80 in either category .
On the laptop side , Lenovo finished second with a score of 66 , followed by Dell ( 60 ) , Toshiba ( 55 ) , and Gateway ( 54 ) ; Sony ( 51 ) and HP ( 48 ) finished sixth and seventh , respectively .
For desktops , Apple ’s closest competitor was Dell , with a satisfaction score of 56 .
Gateway tallied a score 54 while HP and Compaq both tied with scores of 47 .
In particular , Apple ranked highly for the walk - in service that customers receive when visiting Apple ’s brick - and - mortar retail stores .
The staff manning the Genius Bars at Apple ’s retail store provided “ the best troubleshooting by far , ” according to the report , solving problems 90 percent of the time .
“ The only drawback is if you ’re living somewhere that there is n’t a store close by or if you ’re in a big city where the Genius Bar is likely to be really crowded , ” said Donna Tapellini , associate editor at Consumer Reports .
Still , Apple ’s strong showing would seem to validate the company ’s retail strategy of launching stores both in the U.S. and overseas .
Since opening the first Apple Stores seven years ago , the company ’s retail presence has grown to 208 stores worldwide .
“ It ’s one of those things that you ca n’t do with any other brand , ” said Michael Gartenberg , vice president and research director at Jupiter Research , a market - research firm .
“ Other PC manufacturers do n’t have a chain of stores where you can expect someone to help you with your purchase . ”
That ’s not to say that other PC manufacturers do n’t have retailers who ca n’t supply tech support , however .
In fact , Tapellini noted that Consumer Reports last year studied the efficacy of retailer support compared to manufacturer support and found that retailers managed it better .
“ Circuit City ’s Firedog , for example , the Geek Squad at Best Buy , ” she said .
“ But the independent computer retailers were even better . ”
The Consumer Reports study shows a little room for Apple to improve its support , particularly over the telephone .
Anyone can walk in to an Apple Store and get help from a Mac Genius regardless of how long they ’ve had their Mac , but Apple limits its telephone - based support to 90 days from the date of purchase , unless you purchase an AppleCare plan , which can run as high as $ 349 for a MacBook Pro .
“ They should n’t let their tech support get any lower quality than it is , ” Tapellini said .
“ Especially if they ’re only offering 90 days of free telephone tech support , they need to keep that quality up . ”
“ Apple should continue to build out the store infrastructure , ” Gartenberg added .
“ And they should continue to invest in customer training .
They ’re doing many of these things in the store at little or no cost .
Apple is becoming the Nordstrom of customer service in terms of technology .
“ In an age where technology gets more sophisticated and consumers need more help , this bodes well for Apple , ” said Gartenberg .
“ This underscores the effort that Apple makes to help its customers . ”

Is this a phenomenon of statistical cherry - picking or a true trend that should worry us ?
New York Observer – A Yoke for the White Collar
New York ’s college grads now hustle for jobs paying 1970s wages .
Meet their coping mechanism — massive debt !
A younger New Yorker could be forgiven for running up debt : Real wages for 20 - something professionals in New York have n’t changed since the early 1970s .
At the same time , the number of college grads competing for white - collar jobs has increased — as has the cost of everything from real estate to beer to MetroCards .
image from article : Nigel Holmes : Source : Gotham Gazette , June 19 , 2007
In 1970 , 19.5 percent of New Yorkers in their 20s had college degrees , according to the analysis .
By 2005 , that percentage had more than doubled .
By 2006 , roughly one in three New Yorkers 25 and older had at least a college degree , according to N.Y.U. ’s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy .
For younger college grads , the job market has become ever more competitive and the monetary rewards stagnant .
And yet they come .
Something does n’t seem right and I can’t put my finger on it .
The statistics seem a little cherry - picked , but I have suspicion that some important demographic trend is being neglected .
Sure , I can see where wages are stagnant , but as more college educated young people have moved to New York ?
Have shifts in immigration trends caused this ?
Or perhaps loss of manufacturing jobs that paid relatively well for young native New Yorkers ?
I think it ’s safe to say that many more college students have flocked to New York in the past decade , and many college students are taking longer to graduate .
Could part of it be that more 20 - somethings in New York are spending more time in the classroom and not yet earning money ?
Any thoughts ?

It has been called the retail apocalypse .
The rise of E - commerce and online shopping has threatened to destroy the brick - and - mortar stores which comprise the high street .
Consumers prefer to click than to get into their cars and drive down to the store .
As a result , a growing number of retail stores are closing .
For the remaining stores , staying relevant by providing an improved shopping experience is essential to survive .
How can this be accomplished ?
By adopting the leading retail technology to transform the brick - and - mortar store into a consumer ’s dream .
Let ’s discover together the top 10 retail technologies available .
1. Digital marketing
You need to connect your target consumer .
Nearly 78 % of the American population regularly uses the internet .
That makes the internet an important tool for reaching out to consumers for the majority of retailers .
There are several ways to connecting with your target consumer via digital marketing .
Over 41 % of businesses in the U.S. spend over $ 500,000 on digital marketing each year .
You could encourage your consumers to sign - up to a mailing list , in which they ’ll receive monthly newsletters .
Alternatively , you could invest money in digital ads to boost brand awareness .
2. Data Analytics
Do you really know your target consumer ?
Many businesses take advantage of data analytics to improve their understanding of their customers .
You can discover the demographics , interests , and behavior of your customers with this technology .
This information provides you with the knowledge of how to make decisions to improve the customer experience .
For example , if you know where your average customer is located , this determines where you open your next store .
Furthermore , with the rise of personalized and custom - based products and services , data analytics increases in importance for most retailers .
3. The Omnichannel Approach
Have you ever heard of the omnichannel approach to retail ?
This is the attempt to integrate your operations across multiple channels .
Therefore , the distinction between the online and in - store retail experience is eliminated .
For example , consumers want to be able to purchase a product online before picking it up in - store .
This is called ‘ click - and - collect ’ .
This approach encourages consumers to engage with the brand via multiple channels rather than a single avenue .
4. Artificial intelligence
Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) has been widely promoted across the business sector .
We already know that over a third of major businesses are adopting AI to improve the customer experience .
An example of this is the Amazon Go grocery store , which introduced the concept of cashier - less stores to the consumer .
This makes the consumer experience more convenient and unique for the customer .
In addition to AI systems , this involves barcode technology to scan each item as customers leave the store .
5. Voice Assistants
Voice Assistants are expected to grow by up to 1000 % by the year 2023 .
The competition for the consumer market over voice assistants is currently between Google Home , Amazon Echo , and Apple ’s Siri .
Such technology is not only to inquire about the weather tomorrow or to play your favorite music playlist .
You can purchase products and service via the device .
Forbes says that only 22 % of Amazon Echo and Google Home users report shopping via the technology .
However , you can expect this number to grow over the next few years .
It ’s not only directed at the consumer .
Employees can also benefit from the voice assistant technology in your retail store .
6. Augmented Reality
Do you know the difference between Augmented Reality ( AR ) and Virtual Reality ( VR ) ?
AR is when computer - generated information and objects are augmented onto the “ real - world ” environment .
By contrast , in VR the environment is also computer - generated .
Retailers are focused on how AR can improve the consumer experience .
You can sample products at home before you purchase them yourself .
This is especially helpful with clothes and make - up .
You can try digitally before you buy for real .
7. Virtual reality
A growing number of retail stores are starting to invest in VR technology with the hope of improving the customer experience and business operations .
You can design the layout of your brick - and - mortar store via VR before you go - ahead with the plan .
This allows you to better imagine how you want to arrange your products without investing the time and effort to implement .
8. Sensor Data
Sensor data could transform retail forever .
You can install small beacon sensors around your store , which connect with your consumers ’ phones .
If the consumer installs your brand ’s app , then they can receive special discounts and promotions during their visit to the store .
You can also collect data about your consumer via this technology .
This information can be used by your data analytics team to improve your understanding of your customer .
9. Facial Recognition
Another technology which can be adopted in order to better understand your customer is facial recognition technology .
This permits you to track your consumer ’s movements around the store .
This could inform how you design the layout of your store .
You can log demographic information about each consumer who enters your store .
This could determine how you design the packaging of your products , for example .
Furthermore , the next time the same consumer returned to your store at a later date , you can send special promotions .
10 . Cloud Storage Technology
How can you possibly manage your inventory , shipping details , and orders ?
Retailers are increasingly transferring such information onto the cloud .
This is a cost - effective method of storing this important data securing and efficiently .
Research shows that brick - and - mortars retailers continue to only invest 1.7 % of revenues into I.T. services .
This is significantly less than many other sectors , such as banking which invests 6 % per year .
You Need to Invest in Retail Technology
Now you know the top 10 types of retail technology which are transforming the industry .
There are no excuses for not investing in these technologies to develop your business .

Subject : [ ANN ] MacRuby 0.2
From : " Laurent Sansonetti " < laurent.sansonetti@ a . m

Hi , After 3 months of development , here comes the second release of MacRuby , 0.2 !
Check it out while it 's still hot !
MacRuby is a version of Ruby 1.9 , ported to run directly on top of Mac OS X core technologies such as the Objective - C common runtime and garbage collector , and the CoreFoundation framework .
While still a work in progress , it is the goal of MacRuby to enable the creation of full - fledged Mac OS X applications which do not sacrifice performance in order to enjoy the benefits of using Ruby .
You can learn more about MacRuby , and download a binary installer , from the website : http://ruby.macosforge.org
This is an important release , addressing many bugs , but also re-implementing parts of the runtime using the CoreFoundation framework .
In MacRuby 0.2 , all strings , arrays and hashes are now native Cocoa types , respectively NSString , NSArray and NSDictionary objects .
The entire String , Array and Hash interface was rewritten on top of the Cocoa equivalents , using the powerful CoreFoundation framework .
The previous implementation , inherited from MRI , is not used anymore .
The rationale behind this change is simple .
It is not necessary anymore to convert Ruby primitive types to Cocoa , or vice - versa .
For example , a String created in MacRuby can be passed as is , without conversion , to an underlying C or Objective -C API that expects an NSString .
And vice - versa , any method of the Ruby String class can be performed on an NSString that comes from Objective - C. Enjoy , Laurent

Congress 's biggest telecom disability rights advocate has introduced new legislation that would , among other provisions , extend close captioning to some Internet video .
Edward Markey 's ( D - MA ) " 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2008 " ( H.R. 6320 ) covers about a dozen areas .
The proposed law requires hearing - aid compatibility of all broadband telephone products and mandates a certain level of ease in accessing captions on TV with remote control devices .
But perhaps the most interesting and debated section of the bill will be its Internet video captioning requirements .
The law says that 18 months after its enactment , the Federal Communications Commission must set up regulations that include " an appropriate schedule of deadlines for the provision of closed captioning of video programming distributed to the public over the Internet . "
Three kinds of video would be affected by the law : preproduced material that has already been captioned for TV viewing , live programming , and video that is " generally considered to be comparable to programming provided by multichannel programming distributors . "
The legislation also includes a waiver provision .
The FCC could grant waivers to companies that petition " showing that the requirements contained in this section would result in an undue burden . "
User interface upgrades
Markey 's bill also requires manufacturers to boost the accessibility of remote video devices for people with disabilities .
In particular , future apps that project menus on TV screens will have to include audio input , " so that such menus or indicators are accessible to and usable by individuals who are blind or visually impaired . "
Remotes will also have to include a specific button that accesses closed captioning — rather than , as often happens now , bury the function in an options menu .
Whenever " closed captioning " or " video description " functions do appear in menus , they must appear on the top tier of the menu list .
These new functionalities must also be prescribed by the FCC within 18 months of the passage of the law .
Doubtless the agency will issue proceedings to solicit public comment on these changes .
Markey 's bill has strong support from practically all of the major disability - rights groups .
" As more and more TV programs embrace the Internet , people who are deaf or hard of hearing must not be left behind , " declared Rosaline Crawford , of the National Association of the Deaf .
" Captioning TV programs and video clips shown on the Internet is needed for the same reasons it is needed when shown on TV . ”
But Internet industry players wary of extending the authority of the FCC into cyberspace will probably view this legislation with suspicion .
The proposed law is cosponsored by Rep. Lois Capps ( D - CA ) , Barney Frank ( D - MA ) , Rep. Hilda Solis ( D - CA ) , and Heather Wilson ( R- NM ) .
The Massachusetts rep introduced it into the House Energy and Commerce Committee on June 19th .
So far neither Govtrack nor Thomas mention parallel legislation in the Senate .
The American Prospect 's Investigation Into The GOP ' Myth Of Voter Fraud To Purge The [ Voter ] Rolls Of Non-Republicans '
ALSO : The DoJ's John ' Minorities Die First ' Tanner Has Found a New Job ...

Guest Blogged by Alan Breslauer
Art Levine at The American Prospect has a new must read piece titled , “ The Republican War on Voting : Using the Department of Justice , friendly governors , and its usual propaganda outlets , the GOP has propagated the myth of voter fraud to purge the rolls of non-Republicans . ”
Here 's a small taste of it ...
" Sharrard 's cautionary tone was a response to the Republican Party 's ongoing nationwide campaign to suppress the low - income minority vote by propagating the myth of voter fraud .
Using various tactics --- including media smears , bogus lawsuits , restrictive new voting laws and policies , and flimsy prosecutions --- Republican operatives , election officials , and the GOP - controlled Justice Department have limited voting access and gone after voter - registration groups such as ACORN ... "
" Unfortunately , progressives have tended to pay more attention to Election Day dirty tricks and to electronic voting machines than to a more systemic threat : the Republican campaign to suppress the votes of low - income , young , and minority voters through restrictive legislation and rulings , all based on the mythic specter of voter fraud ... "
" Unfortunately , the public has n't heard just how nonexistent the voter fraud epidemic actually is .
While progressives have successfully challenged some of the most restrictive laws in court , they 're still playing catch - up when it comes to combating the glib sound bites of voter - fraud alarmists .
Republicans and the Bush Justice Department have cloaked their schemes under such noble - sounding concepts as " ballot integrity . "
The GOP 's vote - suppression playbook features everything from phony lawsuits to questionable investigations to authoritative - seeming reports , all with the aim of promoting restrictive laws . "
Levine also draws quite a bit ( and links to some ) of The BRAD BLOG 's years - long exposé coverage of high - ranking Republican vote - suppression cappo Mark F. " Thor " Hearne and his GOP front - group " American Center for Voting Rights " elsewhere in his detailed report .
In related news , John Tanner , the man in charge of the Justice Department 's efforts to disenfranchise millions of voters until he was forced to resign after The BRAD BLOG captured and exposed him making crazy offensive comments on video ( see below ) , has a new job , apparently .
Tanner is reportedly now a fellow with the Alabama Law Institute - which provides the Legislature with legal expertise in drafting and revising laws .
Paleontologists working in Antarctica have found fossilized burrows of tetrapods - land vertebrates with four legs or leglike appendages – dating from the Early Triassic epoch , about 245 million years ago .
The fossils were created when fine sand from an overflowing river poured into the animals ' burrows and hardened into casts of the open spaces .
The largest preserved piece is about 14 inches long , 6 inches wide and 3 inches deep .
No animal remains were found inside the burrow casts , but the hardened sediment in each burrow preserved a track made as the animals entered and exited .
In addition , scratch marks from the animals ' initial excavation were apparent in some places , said Christian Sidor , a University of Washington assistant professor of biology and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture at the UW .

" We 've got good evidence that these burrows were made by land - dwelling animals rather than crayfish , " said Sidor , who is lead author of a paper describing the find , which is being published in the June edition of The Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology .
Co-authors are Molly Miller , a geology professor at Vanderbilt University , and John Isbell , a geosciences professor at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee .
The work was funded by the National Science Foundation .
Fossils of tetrapod bones from later in the Triassic period have been found in a section of Antarctica called Victoria Land , but the fossil burrows predate those bone fossils by at least 15 million years , Sidor said .
The fossilized burrows were collected in 2003 and 2005 - 06 from the Fremouw Formation at Wahl Glacier and from the Lashly Formation at Allan Hills , both toward the outer edges of Antarctica .
Despite the absence of fossil bones , the burrows ' relatively small size prompted Sidor to speculate that their owners might have been small lizardlike reptiles called Procolophonids or an early mammal relative called Thrinaxodon .
Burrows , some containing tetrapod bones , have previously been excavated in South Africa , which is considered to be perhaps the world 's richest fossil depository , and those burrows are nearly identical to the fossils unearthed in Antarctica .
During the Triassic period , Antarctica and South Africa were connected as part of a supercontinent called Pangea .
Because even at that time Antarctica was substantially colder than South Africa , and because sea levels likely were higher than today , it is much rarer to find fossils there that date from as far back as the Early Triassic .
" Everywhere has a spotty fossil record , but Antarctica has an extremely spotty fossil record because it is difficult finding exposed rocks amid all the ice , " Sidor said .
At the time the burrows were dug , Antarctica would have been ice free .
However temperatures still would have been quite cold , since both areas where the burrows were found are within the Antarctic Circle and so experience at least one day a year of complete darkness .
" We have documented that tetrapods were burrowing , making dens in Antarctica , back in the Triassic , " Sidor said .
" There are lots of good reasons for burrowing at high latitudes , not the least of which is protection from the elements . "

This is a page from a book called Hypnerotomachia Poliphili .
Any guesses as to when it was published ?
The title , Latin text , yellowed paper , and lack of page numbers might tip you off that it was n’t exactly released yesterday .
Turns out that Hypnerotomachia Poliphili was published in 1499 , more than 500 years ago and only 44 years after Gutenberg published his famous Bible .
It belongs to a group of books collectively referred to as incunabula , books printed with a printing press using movable type before 1501 .
To contemporary eyes , the HP looks almost modern .
The text is very readable .
The typography , layout , and the way the text flows around the illustration ; none of it looks out of the ordinary .
When compared to other books of the time ( e.g. take a look at a page from the Gutenberg Bible ) , its modernity is downright eerie .
The most obvious difference is the absence of the blackletter typeface .
Blackletter was a popular choice because it resembled closely the handwritten script that preceded the printing press , and I imagine its use smoothed the transition to books printed by press .
HP dispensed with blackletter and instead used what came to be known as Bembo , a humanist typeface based on the handwriting of Renaissance - era Italian scholars .
From a MIT
Press e-book on the HP :
One of the features of the Hypnerotomachia that has attracted the attention of scholars has been its use of the famed Aldine “ Roman ” type font , invented by Nicholas Jenson but distilled into an abstract ideal by Francesco Biffi da Bologna , a jeweler who became Aldus ’s celebrated cutter .
This font — generally viewed as originating in the efforts of the humanist lovers of belles - lettres and renowned calligraphers such as Petrarch , Poggio Bracciolini , Niccolo Niccoli , Felice Feliciano , Leon Battista Alberti , and Luca Pacioli , to re-create the script of classical antiquity — appeared for the first time in Bembo ’s De Aetna .
Recut , it appeared in its second and perfected version in the Hypnerotomachia .
In that way , Hypnerotomachia Poliphili is both a throwback to Roman times and an indication of things to come .
The MIT Press site also notes a number of other significant aspects of the book .
As seen above , illustrations are integrated into the main text , allowing “ the eye to slip back and forth from textual description and corresponding visual representation with the greatest of ease ” .
In his 2006 book , Beautiful Evidence , Edward Tufte says :
Overall , the design of Hypnerotomachia tightly integrates the relevant text with the relevant image , a cognitive integration along with the celebrated optical integration .
Several pages in the book make use of the text itself to illustrate the shapes of wine goblets .
The HP also contained aspects of film , comics , and storyboarding … successive illustrations advanced action begun on previous pages :
All of which makes the following puzzling :
The Hypnerotomachia Poliphili is one of the most unreadable books ever published .
The first inkling of difficulty occurs at the moment one picks up the book and tries to utter its tongue - twisting , practically unpronounceable title .
The difficulty only heightens as one flips through the pages and tries to decipher the strange , baffling , inscrutable prose , replete with recondite references , teeming with tortuous terminology , choked with pulsating , prolix , plethoric passages .
Now in Tuscan , now in Latin , now in Greek — elsewhere in Hebrew , Arabic , Chaldean and hieroglyphs — the author has created a pandemonium of unruly sentences that demand the unrelenting skills of a prodigiously endowed polyglot in order to be understood .
It ’s fascinating that a book so readable , so beautifully printed , and so modern would also be so difficult to read .
If you ’d like to take a crack at it , scans of the entire book are available here and here .

Researchers at Children 's Hospital Boston are continuing to document the heart 's earliest origins .
Now , they have pinpointed a new , previously unrecognized group of stem cells that give rise to cardiomyocytes , or heart muscle cells .
These stem cells , located in the surface of the heart , or epicardium , advance the hope of being able to regenerate injured heart tissue .
This finding , published online by the journal Nature on June 22 , comes on the heels of parallel cardiac stem cell discoveries in 2006 , at both Children 's and Massachusetts General Hospital .
Then , the Children 's team found that a specific stem cell or progenitor , marked by expression of a gene called Nkx2 - 5 , forms many components of the heart : heart muscle cells , vascular smooth muscle cells , and the endothelial cells lining blood vessels in the heart 's left - sided chambers .
The team at MGH found a related progenitor , marked by expression of the Isl1 gene , that produces these same cell - types in the right - sided heart chambers .
Now , researchers at Children 's have shown that heart muscle cells can also be derived from a third type of cardiac progenitor , located within the epicardium and identifiable through its expression of a gene called Wt1 .
" There 's a lot of interest in finding places to obtain new cardiomyocytes , because in heart failure , you lose cardiomyocytes , so the only way to reverse heart failure is to make more of these cells , " said William Pu , MD , a pediatric cardiologist at Children 's who was the study 's senior investigator .
Although epicardial cells are known to give rise to smooth muscle and endothelial cells during coronary vessel formation , nobody previously thought that epicardial cells might turn into cardiomyocytes .
" I could n't believe it at first , myself , " said Bin Zhou , MD , a research fellow in Pu's laboratory and the study 's first author .
The results were independently corroborated by researchers from the University of California , San Diego .
Using a different genetic marker , Tbx18 , the UCSD team also showed that cardiomyocytes can be derived from the epicardium , and their study will be published in the same issue of Nature .

Pu and Zhou showed that a specific population of cells in the epicardium , marked by Wt1 expression , not only differentiated into cardiomyocytes , but also smooth muscle cells , endothelial cells and fibroblasts ( found in connective tissue ) .
" If you 're going to regenerate a tissue , you need to regenerate the whole tissue , not just the cardiomyocytes , " said Pu . " This progenitor population contains all the potential to regenerate multiple tissue types within the heart . "
In recent years , the scientific literature has described many progenitors for cardiomyocytes , Pu added , but the markers used frequently did not play a direct role in heart development .
For example , Sca - 1 and c-Kit are markers that most stem cells express throughout the body , with no cardiac or developmental specificity .
" I think our best chance of getting a cell to do what we want is to modify what it was designed to do , " Pu elaborated .
" Some of these other progenitors were isolated in the adult heart , but we do n't know what they do in the normal heart , and what they 're related to in the embryo .
However , we clearly know what progenitors expressing Wt1 , Nkx2 - 5 , and Isl1 do in the fetus : they can make fibroblasts , blood vessels , and cardiomyocytes .
Therefore we think we have a good shot , in the adult heart , of recapitulating these events . "
Pu considers his and Zhou 's discovery to be a fortunate accident .
They were trying , instead , to study a different gene , GATA4 , by deleting it in the epicardium .
" The tool we created for that experiment irreversibly marks the cells involved , so you can see where their descendants are headed in normal development , " Pu explained .
" Unexpectedly , we saw that these epicardial cells were becoming cardiomyocytes -- it was a lucky observation . "
Using an enzyme called Cre recombinase , Pu and Zhou labeled epicardial cells in live mouse embryos with red fluorescent protein ( RFP ) .
Each time the Wt1 gene in these cells was activated , RFP lit up .
Since the marker is inherited by descendants of the Wt1 - expressing cell , the researchers could identify these descendants by looking for RFP .

" If the marker shows up in a cardiomyocyte , then I know that cardiomyocyte came from the Cre-expressing progenitor , " said Pu .
At the moment , scientists are still trying to figure out whether and how the Wt1 - expressing progenitors relate to the progenitors reported in 2006 .
" What we think is that very early on , our particular progenitor expresses Nkx2 - 5 and Isl1 , but quickly loses expression of both and starts expressing Wt1 , " said Pu . " Think of a lineage hierarchy with Nkx2 - 5 and Isl1 at the top , and Wt1 as a branch .
These two lineages separate pretty early , before the heart is present in the embryo .
However , the Wt1 - expressing progenitor may retain some of the developmental capabilities of the progenitors expressing Nkx2 - 5 and Isl1 . "
Pu and Zhou now want to know whether the epicardium in an adult mouse could be induced to make cardiomyocytes .
" If so , obviously this would be much more translatable to human studies , " Pu said .
Other ongoing questions are whether this newly - discovered progenitor is truly multipotent ( able to turn into all other cell types ) , how multipotency is controlled , and whether this can be used therapeutically to benefit adults with heart failure .
The fact that the Wt1 - expressing progenitors can also differentiate into fibroblasts in the developing heart suggests that they can contribute to scar formation in the adult heart after injury , Pu added .
" But if we can turn the progenitors away from making scars , and instead turn them towards making cardiomyocytes , that would be pretty exciting . "
Put another way , Pu and Zhou would love to learn what controls a progenitor 's choice -- to become a fibroblast , a smooth muscle cell , or a cardiomyocyte -- and develop ways of " biasing progenitors to make the choice or choices we want , " says Pu .
" We still do n't know how we can manipulate these progenitors , and there 's no way to predict which ones will be useful .
But I think having more choices is good , because then hopefully one of them will work . "
The study was funded by the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health , USA , and by a charitable donation from E.P. Marram and K.K. Carpenter .
Before I begin , let me present the standard disclaimer : I am not a doctor , nor have I played one on television .
I 've never even dated a doctor .
If you 're ready to see a doctor about depression , you 've probably tried all of the techniques below and , more importantly , if you 're ready to see a doctor , you probably should .
Depression is not something to fuck around with .
It maims relationships and destroys futures .
It leads people to make irrational choices that have far - reaching consequences .
It can even kill you .
That said , my only qualifications in this area involve my willingness to share and your willingness to listen .
But you probably want to know more about the sordid details of my particular depression .
Well , fine .
If you can look at me and see a reasonably upbeat and centered individual , you may want to look again .
My mother 's family photo albums are full of images of me as a wee one , glum and obstinately protesting the fact that life must go on .
That sorry little kid turned into a sorry adolescent who relished frequent thoughts of suicide and then a sorry college student who found herself sinking deeper and deeper into feelings of worthlessness and shame .
But I 'm better now .
No really .
Yes , I 'm still regularly plagued by feelings of hopelessness , despair , and all that jazz .
I 'm sad a lot .
I still spend the odd hour here and there thinking how fortuitous it would be if I was hit by a car or contemplating ways to off myself .
And I 'm still paranoid about my own worth , intelligence , and what have you .
Still paranoid that there is a queue of lovely ladies waiting to steal my man 's heart because , hey , I 'm super yucky .
Still paranoid that I just plain suck .
BUT , I 've learned to control or at least diminish most of these feelings .
What leaves my family absolutely baffled is how I ended up with a blue streak a mile long .
My father , while spouting doom and gloom , remains one of the happiest and most satisfied men I 've ever met .
My mother routinely employs a technique known as compartmentalization , wherein she chooses to focus only on good things , and it 's worked for her thus far .
My grandparents , all wonderful and all happy , exist in various stages of both faith and denial , each operating to overshadow our dreary world .
I wo n't recommend denying that the world is an awful place or glossing over one 's problems , nor will I suggest that there is anything " wrong " or " unusual " about depression in general .
That 's just not my style .
In fact , I believe that depression is so prevalent ( at least in the States ) because society as a whole is operating in ways that contradict the human animal 's basic impulses ... but that 's another story for another day .
The advice that I will give you shortly is simple , all - natural , free , and , for me at least , effective .
What that means is that , over the course of my childhood , adolescence , and adulthood , I have gradually come to understand that doing such - and - such a thing tends to bring on dark feelings while such - and - such other thing tends to repel them .
Your mileage may , of course , vary .
On the whole , my suggestions may seem like the sissy 's way out when the world is full of adverts for tiny little wunderpills guaranteed to put a smile on your face and a spring in your step .
But part of my personal philosophy involves my not taking any medication I can live without .
I understand that some people simply cannot live without medication .
Nonetheless , the following advice may still help cancel out some of the pangs of sorrow that , for some of us , go hand in hand with being alive and it's good to get into the habit of doing 'em .
Caution !
Triggers !
What 's a trigger ?
Anything you can identify that will , with reasonable certainty , bring on feelings of depression .
Some people get depressed when their frustration levels increase while others get depressed when they start to lose contact with friends and family .
Make a list of the things that inspire depression and see how many of them are unavoidable .
You probably can't quit your job ( if you can , I 'm jealous ) and you may not be able to avoid driving in traffic , but you can think of new ways to make your work day less upsetting and even explore new routes to the office .
As for the triggers that are avoidable , avoid them .
I have discovered that listening to nothing but Nick Drake all day long while it 's raining will usually have me pretty low by the end of the day .
Likewise , I know that certain discussion topics are bound to get me down ( i.e. the futility of just about everything ) , so I do n't like to talk about them .
Do what you can to reduce exposure to triggers .
If , however , you find your life impacted by this avoidance , it may be time to chat with a professional .
Move Your Tush
The single most effective non-medicinal anti-depressant I have come across is exercise .
Getting your blood pumping can make you feel more alert , more in control , healthier , optimistic , confident , and calm .
The good feelings brought on by exercise last for hours and there are no side effects other than a kickin ' body and a functional cardiovascular system .
Exercise can be running , aerobics , dancing , lifting weights , walking , sex , or vigorous cleaning .
The method does n't much matter .
The only real catch is that it has to be regular exercise .
That means you 've got to do it just about every day for maximum effect .
If I skip a few days , that 's when all the bad thoughts start flooding back .
Let there be light !
A lot of people get depressed in the wintertime because they tend to , not at all purposefully , expose themselves to less sunlight .
I do n't blame them .
It 's damn cold out .
Nonetheless , getting out and about in the fresh air , even on a cloudy day , can really boost your mood .
This applies even in the spring and summer months .
People , I think , at least in the States , tend to spend too much time under fluorescent lights , in ventilated offices , and inside cars or trains or planes or busses or whatever .
There is something pleasantly depression defying about moving one 's legs and existing , for a brief time , in open air .
Maybe even get some trees involved .
If this sort of thing is utterly impossible , plenty of companies sell sun lamps that are supposed to trick your body into thinking you 've been outdoors .
Breaking Your Thinking Habit
Depression thrives on negative thinking .
It 's easy to get into what I call The Cycle , where a bad thought just pops up and suddenly cascades into about a thousand other bad thoughts that have nowhere left to go .
When this happens to me , I usually freeze up and find I can't do anything , so I get in bed and people are left wondering what they can do for me .
While it can feel like nothing will ever , ever be able to console you when this happens , the best thing your friends can do for you OR you can do for yourself is to find a distraction .
It usually has to be a pretty strong distraction and it does n't always need to be a pleasant one .
Someone poking me in an irritating fashion can sometimes be enough .
Maybe hearing or thinking of a series of bad jokes .
Try listening to something inane , like Radio Disney or one of those talk shows where rednecks throw chairs at one another .
Pet your dog .
Masturbate .
Do whatever it takes to help your brain snap out of the feedback loop of painful thoughts , even punching a pillow until you start to feel silly .
Sleeeeeeeep
I have bad dreams almost every night when my moods are at their lowest .
Though we do n't know the true function of dreams , they seem to be somewhat reflective of our deepest mental states .
While I 'd rather not have dreams about cockroaches being inside my mouth and nubile young girls telling me how great my man is at making them laugh , those dreams are probably serving some function .
Maybe a nightly garbage dump .
I do n't know .
What I do know is that getting a full eight or even nine hours of sleep each night can go a long way in the quest to ward off depression .
There is a distinct difference between the morning after a good night 's sleep and a too - short night 's sleep .
When you are rested , you are more aware and operate more smoothly , leading to less chance of experiencing serious frustration or annoyance with yourself , which can trigger feelings of depression .
Throw Your TV Out the Window
Televised news broadcasts are designed to produce an emotional surge in viewers .
Commercials are designed to tell you how inferior you and all of your choices are .
Sitcoms , while maybe not designed to be that way , tend to present the sort of lives we 're supposed to have , but that few people actually do .
I am not twenty - five , working my dream job , wearing designer clothing , and driving a Mercedes .
I do not live in a penthouse while getting paid waitress wages .
I am not a size two .
I have debt , use store brands , seldom buy new clothing , and have to scrimp to pay my phone bill .
I have enough to worry about without thinking about all the ways in which I do not measure up to some arbitrary level of income , beauty , talent , shirt whiteness , or fashion sense , or whether my hair is as shiny as it could be .
I do n't need to know how many people were murdered today or all of the new ways in which human beings can be cruel to one another as presented by the networks in LIVE , GRUESOME , LIVING COLOR .
Skip it .
Read a fantasy novel .
Paint a picture .
Escape reality all you want , but if you do n't want to invite depression in , nix the idiot box .
Clean Up , Cheer Up
One of my major triggers is clutter .
Sharing a small single room with my man in a four - bedroom apartment for months and months really had me sinking regularly into the depression pit .
I know that in order for my mind to focus on working , my desk has to be reasonably neat and that in order to sleep well , my bedroom has to be mostly uncluttered .
While not everyone is opposed to a little disorganization , messiness can sometimes have an effect on the subconscious .
If you 're space is a mess , your mind may be interpreting that in terms of your worth .
They say people with good self - esteem and good outlooks generally take better care of themselves .
This applies to neatness as well .
Tricking your brain into seeing yourself as a well - put - together individual who knows where everything is can positively affect your mood .
Do What You Like
No , it 's not anarchy now .
Life is hard .
It 's easy to let responsibilities carry us away while we ride their dismal wave , cheekily forgetting that we were ever more than a credit card bill , a paycheck , or an under - appreciated employee .
We spend a lot of time attempting to improve our performance at work , on the golf course , in the sack , behind the microphone , or on paper , and , in doing so , forget about spending any time doing the things we 're good at .
What 's nicer , spending all night trying and failing to beat the second - to - last level of the original Super Mario Bros .
or baking a great pecan pie ?
I 'm not saying you should n't challenge yourself , but do n't forget to set aside a few hours a week to use doing something you enjoy and are good at , even if it 's just reading a book to keep your frustration levels nice and low .
Stop !
In the name of tranquility
Okay , maybe you can't stop , but you can slow down .
The world - at - large is fast paced , but that does n't mean you have to be .
The more I have on my plate at any one time , the more depressed I become .
My logical mind may be trying to convince me that I 'll get it all done ( and it 's almost always right ) but my emotional brain is screaming that I am easily overwhelmed and I just can't handle it so I really should give up .
Not that I actually have a choice .
It 's finish such - and - such a story by noon or starve .
The easiest way to keep in step with your responsibilities , even when you 're really depressed , is to have a loose routine and to make daily To Do lists .
Having a routine means that I have more time to spend doing things I like and making lists means I almost never forget to do any of the things I 'm supposed to do .
Doing one or both of those will also keep you from getting mired , which itself can lead to negative cyclical thinking .
Drink less .
Drink more .
While evening plans based on spirituous liquors are generally a fun and rowdy good time , I can recall plenty of nights spent curled up on the bed , bawling and drunk , wishing my life would end then and there .
That 's the problem with drinking and depression .
Much like milk and OJ , they do n't mix well .
Getting drunk to forget may seem like a great idea , until you 're totally blitzed and realize that getting drunk just makes your problems seem that much more real .
If you 're already feeling low , drink in moderation or do n't drink at all .
As for smoking the herb , getting high is absolute poo poo if you 're depressed , even if you 're fine with it normally .
Better yet , drink more water .
Most bodies are at least semi-pleased when imbibing water .
Water makes your brain happy and your body happy , which is one step ( I 'm convinced ) on the road to making you happy .
And even if drinking plenty of water does n't do anything at all the alleviate your depression , at least it 's good for you .
Please note : lasting excessive or absent thirst can apparently both signify serious emotional trauma .
See a doctor .
Trim the Fat
While various research I found on the topic of fat ingestion and depression stated that eating a low fat diet can lead to increased feelings of depression , all of my personal experience has demonstrated that the flip side may also be valid .
I 'm not suggesting that you stop eating fat all together ( Cheese sticks reprezent ! ) but I would recommend cutting out a little fat here and there .
When there is too much fat in my diet , I know , because I get both constipated and depressed .
If nothing else , eat a vegetable now and again , because regularity will mean one less thing to get depressed about .
There is also the sugar - preservative - toxin triad that infects the highly processed foods that make up a large portion of most people 's diets .
While keeping your daily RDA of fat intact is a good move , cutting out the thirty - syllable ingredients from your diet is an even better one if you 're trying to curb depression .
Make your own sauces .
Bake from scratch .
Want a cheeseburger ?
Make it at home , with meat from a local butcher .
Your brain chemistry will thank you .
Be a Quitter
Everyone who lives within a hundred mile radius of semi-modern civilization knows by now that smoking is bad for you .
People outside of that area probably figure it out after a while .
Some people just do n't care .
According to research , depressed people are more susceptible to the apparent pleasures of smoking and one or more of the components in cigarette smoke act like anti-depressants .
But , at the same time , there is a growing stigma attached to smoking and many smokers feel frustrated because they are unable to quit .
Add to that the fact that smoking has a tendency to inspire hacking coughs , dry nasal passages , and generally lowered health levels , and you have a host of possible depression triggers .
Quitting , on the other hand , will make you feel really shitty for a few weeks , but better for years to come .
Plus , it makes all that exercise easier .
Give a little bit .
Yes , sometimes volunteering can make you more depressed , particularly if you ’re caught up in a cycle of negative thinking .
Then handing out rolls at the soup kitchen is not going to do much for you .
But in general , giving your time and energy to a worthy cause , particularly if it ’s something like Habitat for Humanity , where you see the immediate difference your efforts have made , will lift you out of a goodly portion of the funks you find yourself in .
Putting aside your own problems and seeing the world from someone else ’s perspective can help you see your own situation more clearly .
Depression has trouble thriving when you ’re busy helping others .
Do nothing at all .
This seems to be a challenge for many people .
I know it is for me .
A relaxing Saturday spent lazing in bed becomes an anxiety - ridden Sunday wherein I become obsessed with my having wasted hours upon hours .
Doing nothing , while seemingly counterintuitive , is a great goal to work towards .
You might try setting aside an hour each week in which you do nothing but relax in whatever way pleases you most .
In order for me to do this , I need to plan it , so I do n't feel like I 'm wasting time that could have been spent working or cleaning or painting or writing or answering e-mails or whatever , or else the depression kicks in quickly .
Sit back and watch the world go by like the old folks do .
They 're on to something .
Doing nothing also applies to problems .
Once in a while , it 's important to admit defeat or real helplessness , without feeling like you ’ve come undone .
Blame it on poor usability or just not reading the frickin ' manual , but it turns out that 95 percent of all returned gadgets actually work despite what customers may say or think .
That 's right -- of the $ 13.8 billion worth of returned products in 2007 , only 5 percent were because gadgets were truly broken .
According to Accenture , 68 percent of all returns work but are n't meeting customer expectations -- or they are simply too confusing to use .
The other 26 percent are returned due to straight - up buyer 's remorse ( AKA significant other budgetary freak - outs ) .
Accenture executive Terry Steger believes that the complexity of gadgets is to blame here , and not the fickle nature of American consumers who tend to give up on product setup within a few minutes .
We believe this is all actually due to the implicit nature of -- ooh , look at that shiny thing over there !
High stakes of Lebanon 's crisis
In pictures : Battle for Beirut Gunmen from the Shia group Hezbollah have seized most of western Beirut in a third day of fighting between opposition and government supporters .
The Western - backed governing coalition has described it as a " bloody coup " .
At least 11 people have been killed .
The gunmen , who also back Hezbollah 's Shia opposition allies , have forced the closure of pro-government media .
The US has restated its support for Lebanon 's government and says Hezbollah is killing innocent civilians .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Washington was committed to helping the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora .
" We will stand by the Lebanese government and peaceful citizens of Lebanon through this crisis and provide the support they need to weather this storm , " she said in a statement .
The opposition has said Hezbollah and its allies will maintain roadblocks around Beirut until there is a solution to the political crisis .
The fighting was sparked by a government move on Monday to shut down Hezbollah 's telecoms network .
Lebanon 's governing coalition said it was a coup aimed at restoring the influence of Syria and Iran .
" The armed and bloody coup which is being implemented aims to return Syria to Lebanon and extend Iran 's reach to the Mediterranean , " it said in a statement .
Civil war fears
The UN Security Council has urged the rival parties to stop fighting amid fears of civil war breaking out .

Analysts say the key to avoiding such a conflict this time may be the neutrality of the army , and its ability to withstand the sectarian tensions .
The Lebanese army command has warned its unity is at risk if the crisis in the capital drags on .
Syrian President Bashar al - Assad , whose country long dominated neighbouring Lebanon , said on Friday that the political crisis there was an " internal matter " .
Having withdrawn its army from the country in 2005 , Syria denies meddling in Lebanon 's internal politics .
But Damascus has been accused of involvement in the assassination over the past three years of several anti-Syrians , including Rafik Hariri , a former prime minister .
Lebanon has been without a president since late 2007 , amid deadlock between the ruling coalition and Hezbollah - led opposition over the make - up of the government .
As residents of west Beirut fled on Friday , the Italian government was reported to be drawing up an evacuation plan for any of its nationals wanting to leave the city .
Earlier , media offices owned by Saad Hariri , a leader of the governing coalition , were shut after being attacked by militants loyal to Hezbollah .
The army moved in after gunmen besieged TV station Future News and partially set fire to the offices of al - Mustaqbal newspaper .

Stewart : Despite denials , Bush aides actively managed harsh interrogations

Jon Stewart and ' The Daily Show ' lambasted , in the lively mix of satire and seriousness Stewart is famous for , President George W. Bush and key past and present members of his administration over their repeated assertions that the United States does n't use torture against its enemies .
It was revealed last week that both President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney authorized , supported , and knew of the use of torturous tactics such as waterboarding during interrogations of suspected terrorists .
One memorable montage of clips Stewart presented showed , in order , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , former White House Press Secretary Tony Snow , Vice President Cheney , President Bush , and former CIA Director George Tenet all saying , " We do n't torture . "
Quipped Stewart , " You may know that group as the non-profit organization ' People for the Ethical Treatment of Nobody . ' "
Stewart waved his fist and mock - thundered , " And we would 've gotten away with it too if it were n't for you meddling kids and your reporting ! "
UPDATE , 1:03 p.m.
The District Court judges in Washington who will hear the detainees ’ habeas challenges mandated by the Supreme Court will meet soon to decide how to proceed , that Court announced shortly after the Supreme Court ruled .
Chief Judge Royce C. Lamberth said “ I expect we ’ll call in the lawyers for both sides to see what suggestions they have for how we can approach our task most effectively and efficiently . ”
The press release can be read here .
— — — — ——
In a stunning blow to the Bush Administration in its war - on - terrorism policies , the Supreme Court ruled Thursday that foreign nationals held at Guantanamo Bay have a right to pursue habeas challenges to their detention .
The Court , dividing 5 - 4 , ruled that Congress had not validly taken away habeas rights .
If Congress wishes to suspend habeas , it must do so only as the Constitution allows — when the country faces rebellion or invasion .
The Court stressed that it was not ruling that the detainees are entitled to be released — that is , entitled to have writs issued to end their confinement .
That issue , it said , is left to the District Court judges who will be hearing the challenges .
The Court also said that “ we do not address whether the President has authority to detain ” individuals during the war on terrorism , and hold them at the U.S. Naval base in Cuba ; that , too , it said , is to be considered first by the District judges .
The Court also declared that detainees do not have to go through the special civilian court review process that Congress created in 2005 , since that is not an adequate substitute for habeas rights .
The Court refused to interpret the Detainee Treatment Act — as the Bush Administration had suggested — to include enough legal protection to make it an adequate replacement for habeas .
Congress , it concluded , unconstitutionally suspended the writ in enacting that Act .
The Court also found serious defects in the process that the Pentagon set up in 2004 to decide which prisoners are to be designated as “ enemy combatants ” — the status that leads to their continued confinement .
This process is the system of so - called Combatant Status Review Tribunals .
The procedures used by CSRTs , the Court said , “ fall well short of the procedures and adversarial mechanisms that would eliminate the need for habeas corpus review . ”
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy ’s opinion for the majority in Boumediene v. Bush ( 06 - 1195 ) and Al Odah v. U.S. ( 06 - 1196 ) was an almost rhapsodic review of the history of the Great Writ .
The Suspension Clause , he wrote , “ protects the rights of the detained by a means consistent with the essential design of the Constitution .
It ensures that , except during periods of formal suspension , the Judiciary will have a time - tested device , the writ , to maintain the ‘ delicate balance of governance ’ that is itself the surest safeguard of liberty . ”
Those who wrote the Constitution , he added , “ deemed the writ to be an essential mechanism in the separation - of - powers scheme . ”
Even though the two political branches — the President and Congress — had agreed to take away the detainees ’ habeas rights , Kennedy said those branches do not have “ the power to switch the Constitution on or off at will . ”
In a second ruling on habeas , the Court decided unanimously that U.S. citizens held by U.S. military forces in Iraq have a right to file habeas cases , because it does extend to them , but it went on to rule that federal judges do not have any authority to bar the transfer of those individuals to Iraqi authorites to face prosecution or punishment for crimes committed in that country in violation of Iraqi laws .

Nietzsche said that if a human being put his ear to the heart chamber of the world and heard the roar of existence , the “ innumerable shouts of pleasure and woe , ” he would surely break into pieces .
But a newspaper , pumping its inky current of despair , might serve as well .
On a single day , Thursday , May 15th , the Times contained the following .
The lead article was about the earthquake in China , now estimated to have killed more than fifty thousand people .
It was titled “ Tiny Bodies in a Morgue , and Unspeakable Grief in China , ” and was accompanied by a photograph of two parents sitting next to their dead child .
A story about the recent cyclone in Myanmar estimated the number of deaths at anywhere between 68,833 and 127,990 .
The journalist mentioned a man named Zaw Ayea , twenty - seven , who found his sister ’s body ; his mother and two younger brothers are missing .
He cannot speak : “ He stares straight ahead with a strangely placid expression on his face .
His friends say he has been in shock since the cyclone . ”
Christianity needs the concept of heaven simply to make sense of human suffering .

And the minor stories , on this day ?
At least ten people killed in a bomb attack west of Baghdad , in Abu Ghraib ; a policeman killed in a bomb attack in northern Spain ( probably ETA terrorists ) ; a possible missile strike on a Pakistani border village that killed about a dozen people ( this may well have been the work of an American drone ) ; and a piece about a radical Islamic cleric , resident in Italy but “ transferred , ” perhaps thanks to American help , by the process of “ extraordinary rendition , ” to a jail in Egypt , where he was allegedly tortured .
His wife told an Italian court , “ He was tied up like he was being crucified .
He was beat up , especially around his ears .
He was subjected to electroshocks to many body parts . ”
A large proportion of life involves our refusing to put our ear to the mundane heart chamber , lest we die from hearing “ the roar which lies on the other side of silence . ”
It is considered almost gauche to wave the flag of general suffering in other people ’s faces , as Dostoyevsky does repeatedly in his novels , most famously in “ The Brothers Karamazov , ” when the rebellious Ivan confronts his pious brother Alyosha with a list of degradations , some of which Dostoyevsky had got from real accounts —
Turkish soldiers tossing babies on their bayonets in front of the mothers , parents punishing their five - year - old girl for wetting her bed by locking her all night in a freezing outhouse and smearing her face with excrement .
For the lucky few , there is reason to hope that life will be a business of evenly rationed suffering : stern parents perhaps , a few humiliations at school , then a love affair or two gone wrong , maybe a marriage broken .
Our parents will die , and farther off , ideally deferred , will come our own steady demise .
Plenty of suffering for a life , certainly , but most of us subsist on the plausible expectation that fortune will draw a circle around that personal portion , and that the truly unbearable — murder , rape , dead children , torture , war — will remain outside the cordon .
Norman Rush , in his novel “ Mortals , ” calls this “ hellmouth ” : “ the opening up of the mouth of hell right in front of you , without warning , through no fault of your own . ”
Without warning , and yet always feared .
Job , whom God places into hellmouth to test him , knew that paradox : “ For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me , and that which I was afraid of is come unto me . ”
Theologians and philosophers talk about “ the problem of evil , ” and the hygienic phrase itself bespeaks a certain distance from extreme suffering , the view from a life inside the charmed circle .
They mean the classic difficulty of how we justify the existence of suffering and iniquity with belief in a God who created us , who loves us , and who providentially manages the world .
The term for this justification is “ theodicy , ” which nowadays seems a very old - fashioned exercise in turning around and around the stripped screw of theological scholastics .
Still , if polls are correct , about eighty per cent of Americans ought to be engaged in such antiquarianism .
Union University , in Jackson , Tennessee , might profit from intense classes in theodicy .
“ God protected this campus , ” one of the students there said , because no one was killed in the tornadoes that devastated parts of Tennessee on February 5th .
Since ordinary Tennesseans were killed elsewhere that night , the logic of such shamanism is that God either did not or could not protect those unfortunates from something that the state ’s governor once likened to “ the wrath of God . ”
Antique and abstract it may be , but thinking about theodicy still has the power to change lives .
I know this , because it was how I began to separate myself from the somewhat austere Christian environment I grew up in .
I remember the day , in my late teens , when I drew a line down the middle of a piece of paper , on one side of which I wrote my reasons for belief in God , on the other my reasons against .
I ca n’t remember the order of my negatives now , but the inefficacy of prayer was likely at the top .
Here was a demonstrable case of promises made ( if you have faith , you can move a mountain ) but not kept ( the mountain not only stays put but suddenly erupts and consumes a few villages ) .
During my teens , two members of my parents ’ congregation died of cancer , despite all the prayers offered up on their behalf .
When I looked at the congregants kneeling on cushions , their heads bent to touch the wooden pews , it seemed to me as if they were literally butting their heads against a palpable impossibility .
And this was years before I discovered Samuel Butler ’s image for the inutility of prayer in his novel “ The Way of All Flesh ” — the bee that has strayed into a drawing room and is buzzing against the wallpaper , trying to extract nectar from one of the painted roses .
Theodicy , or , rather , its failure , was the other major entry on my debit side .
I was trapped within the age - old conundrum : the world is full of pain and wickedness ;
God may be jealous but is also merciful and all - loving ( how much more so , if one believes that Christ incarnated him ) .
If he has the power to alleviate this suffering but does not , he is cruel ; if he cannot , he is weak .
I was n’t consoled by the standard responses .
Suffering is a mystery , I was told , as is God ’s absence in the face of suffering .
But this was what I was also told when prayers failed to make their mark : the old “ incomprehensibility ” routine .
It seemed to me that the Gospels , central to my family life , made some fairly specific promises and laid on us some fairly specific obligations ; yet that specificity could simply go on holiday whenever God himself seemed to have gone on holiday .
( “ God moves in mysterious ways . ” )
God “ suffers with us , ” I was told ; he feels our pain .
If Christ was God incarnate , then God suffered on the Cross .
He walks with us in our suffering .
This has been the great twentieth - century addition to the familiar arguments , which is perhaps unsurprising , amid so much carnage .
The Lacanian philosopher Slavoj Zizek argues , in his book “ On Belief , ” that when God abandoned Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane he abandoned himself .
Christianity , he asserts , returns at this moment to the story of Job , the man abandoned by God : “ It is Christ ( God ) himself who has to occupy the place of Job. . . .
Man ’s existence is living proof of God ’s self - limitation . ”
A God whose power has been so drastically limited , and who sounds so like us in our abjection , might be loved , but why should he be worshipped ?
Twenty - five years ago , as I hunched over my piece of paper with its vertical line , I decided that if God existed , which I strongly doubted , then this entity was neither describable nor cherishable but was a vaporous , quite possibly malign force at the horizon of the sayable .
Another attempted consolation is that God intended us to have free will , and free will requires the liberty to do bad as well as good .
If we were unable to err , our relation to God would be robotic , meaningless in its hapless obedience .
It is regrettable that Hitlers are allowed to exist ; but universal freedom is a higher good than the release from local pain .
This is still the best available response to the theodicy problem .
But even at sixteen I could see an enormous , iridescent flaw in this colorless argument : it is that the Bible is full of divine intervention , full of infringements of free will .
God hardens Pharaoh ’s heart , and brings plagues , and spares the firstborn of the Israelites ( while conveniently murdering the Egyptians ’ ) , and , if you accept the New Testament , anoints his son as a sacrificial lamb for the sins of the world .
We pray to him precisely because we believe in the power of such intervention .
But when we actually need his intervention — say , to put a stop to a few concentration camps — he has . . . gone on holiday again , leaving people to drone on about the paramount importance of unmolested “ free will . ”
They were at it again when the tsunami killed hundreds of thousands in 2004 .
The Archbishop of Canterbury , a distinguished theologian , wrote an article at the time , reminding his Anglican communion that such tragedies challenge faith .
But then he circled around a kind of physicist ’s version of the free - will argument when he cautioned that “ the world has to have a regular order and pattern of its own .
. . .
So there is something odd about expecting that God will constantly step in if things are getting dangerous . ”
Well , there would be something odd if you had never read the Bible .
But one of the repeated indices of God ’s power , as invoked in many of the Psalms , is his ability to control the waves — after all , the Psalmist knew that a great flood had consumed the world , at God ’s command , and that the Red Sea had been divinely parted .
How dangerous would things have to get before divine intervention was justified ?
To this , the Gospels can reply succinctly : not very .
For when the disciples were out on the Sea of Galilee , and things took a stormy turn , Jesus appeared , walked on water , and calmed the storm .
Perhaps the disciples just meant more to Jesus than a few hundred thousand Asians .
There is something adolescent about such complaint ; I can hear it like a boy ’s breaking voice in my own prose .
For anti-theodicy is permanent rebellion .
It is not quite atheism but wounded theism , condemned to argue ceaselessly against a God it is supposed not to believe in .
Bart D. Ehrman ’s new book , “ God ’s Problem ” ( HarperOne ; $ 25.95 ) , is highly adolescent in tone .
Its jabbing subtitle , “ How the Bible Fails to Answer Our Most Important Question — Why We Suffer , ” sounds as if it should be furiously triple - underlined on the dust jacket .
Ehrman has been the favorite academic of the new wave of atheism since his book “ Misquoting Jesus ” ( 2005 ) became an unlikely best - seller .
He is a professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina , and is obviously a fine teacher , because his books are naturally pedagogic .
“ Misquoting Jesus ” is a lucid , painstaking introduction to the unreliability of the Bible as a text , especially the New Testament .
It summarizes the scholarly consensus on passages like Jesus ’ defense of the adulteress , when Christ asked those without sin to cast the first stone at her .
Ehrman argues , along with most recent scholars , that this story is almost certainly not original to John ’s Gospel but “ probably a well - known story circulating in the oral tradition about Jesus , which at some point was added in the margin of a manuscript . ”
It is not found in the oldest manuscripts of John , and is written in a different style from the rest of the Gospel .
What warmed up Ehrman ’s reputation on the New Atheists ’ circuit , though , was probably not so much his diligent textual labors as what he revealed in the book ’s introduction .
Readers learned that he had been reared in a conservative family in Kansas , was “ born again ” in high school , attended the fundamentalist Moody Bible Institute , in Chicago , and then Wheaton College , Billy Graham ’s alma mater .
When he was at Princeton Theological Seminary , prolonged reflection on the textual status of the Gospels began to weaken his religious certitude .
But , in coyly declaring that the book was “ the end result of a long journey , ” he left readers to reach their own conclusions about his ultimate destination .
In his new work , there is no such reticence .
“ I no longer go to church , no longer believe , no longer consider myself a Christian , ” he announces on the third page .
“ The subject of this book is the reason why . ”
In a nutshell : “ I could no longer explain how there can be a good and all - powerful God actively involved with this world , given the state of things .
. . .
The problem of suffering became for me the problem of faith . ”
If he no longer believes , of course , suffering should not be a theological “ problem . ”
But the rebel is stuck , as Dostoyevsky knew well , in an aggrieved nostalgia for belief .
For the believer , theodicy is merely “ the problem of evil ” ; for the rebel , theodicy is also “ the problem of theodicy , ” and protest , even rage , is the loudest tone .
Throughout the book , Ehrman recounts gigantic tragedies — the influenza epidemic of 1918 , the Second World War , the Holocaust , the killing fields of Cambodia , the five people who die of malaria every minute — and then bawls in horror and hatred : “ How could God allow it to happen ? . . .
How could God allow this to happen to anyone , let alone his ‘ chosen people ’ ? ”
Later : “ It is hard to believe that God inflicts people with cancer , flu , or AIDS in order to make sure they praise him to the end .
Praise him for what ?
Mutilation and torture ?
For his great power to inflict pain and misery on innocent people ?
. . .
What kind of God is this ? ”
This full - throated anger is very far from the sterile laboratories of the professional theodicists , where white - coated philosophers quite often crush suffering down to the logician ’s granules of P and Q .
( “ Let P be the proposition that God is benevolent , and let Q be the existence of what Levinas calls useless suffering . ” )
But this entrapped invocation of a God who is not believed in but is nonetheless despised is what gives the book a rough power .
Ehrman rightly dislikes the philosophers of theodicy , calling their work obtuse and disconnected from life , but he also , in a revealing moment , distinguishes himself from “ recent agnostic or atheist authors . ”
Unlike them , he says , “ I do not think that every reasonable and reasonably intelligent person will in the end come to see things my way when it comes to the important issues in life . ”
He is too polite to say it , but one of the weaknesses of otherwise useful atheists like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris is that , lacking nostalgia for lost belief , they also lack the power to imagine why anyone would ever have professed it .
Awash in negative belief , Ehrman unabashedly fights his God , and wants to discover what the Bible has to say about suffering .
He is a lucid expositor , the weaknesses of his book being the aural clatter of the lecture room ( “ Still , most Jews did n’t buy it , and this was a major source of pain to Paul ” ) and its limited perspective .
He seldom connects Biblical passages with the larger philosophical or literary traditions .
You will find no Pierre Bayle or Rousseau or Schopenhauer here , and no Milton , or Hardy , or Camus .
The early Church Fathers are hardly mentioned .
There is almost a sense that Ehrman , fearing scholasticism , does not want to get sucked into the philosophical history of theodicy .
It is also true that , as Ehrman says , theodicy as such does not exist in the Bible .
Nowadays , theodicy always has a wary eye on the theological exit : this makes no sense , therefore I will have to reject the idea of God .
But there was no such exit before about 1700 , at the very earliest .
“ Ancient Jews and Christians never questioned whether God existed , ” Ehrman notes .
“ What they wanted to know was how to understand God and how to relate to him , given the state of the world . ”
So Ehrman concentrates on what you could call the first responders to hellmouth — the Prophets , the Psalmists , the Apocalypticists — and he is often illuminating .
He separates three large strands in the Biblical writings : the idea that suffering is a punishment for sinful behavior ; the idea that suffering is either ultimately redemptive or some kind of test of virtue ; and the idea that God will finally vanquish evil and establish his kingdom of peace and harmony .
We are probably most familiar with suffering as punishment , since it runs throughout the Hebrew Bible .
Creation almost begins with a curse , God ’s determination that women will give birth in pain as a result of Eve ’s disobedience .
The earth is then quickly condemned to the Flood , because God is unhappy with his sinful creation , and wants to start over again — what the English comedian Eddie Izzard calls the Etch A Sketch approach .
( Izzard , whose standup routines often circle around religion , is very funny , also , about the unjust deaths of all those animals .
What would constitute , say , a wicked giraffe ?
“ I will eat all the leaves on this tree .
I will eat more leaves than I should and then other giraffes may die . ” )
The Israelites , of course , are alternately rescued and abandoned by their jealous God , depending on the quality of their disobedience .
And the Prophets majestically harp on punishment as a consequence of sinfulness — the oppression of the poor , sexual deviance ( Amos ) , worship of false gods and idols ( Hosea ) .
Military defeat , captivity , and exile are the retributions for this alleged errancy .
This strain may be the least fashionable of all Biblical responses to suffering , except among evangelicals like Pat Robertson , who seemed perfectly happy to ascribe Ariel Sharon ’s stroke to his surrender of Gaza to the Palestinians .
But it widely persists in a slightly transferred form , as Ehrman points out .
Judaism was a religion of sacrifice , in which the proffered gifts were seen as an atonement for sin .
Punishment is bought off , effectively , by the garnishing of one ’s wages .
“ Because sin brings horrible judgment in the manifestation of God ’s wrath , this wrath needs to be averted , ” Ehrman writes .
“ It is averted by the proper sacrifice of an animal . ”
It is not entirely clear how this atonement worked .
“ Whatever the answer to the question of mechanics , the Israelite temple cult was focused on sacrifice as a way of restoring a lost relationship with God , broken by disobedience . ”
Eventually , this religion of atonement would offer the very largest sacrificial lamb , God ’s own son , as a scapegoat for the sins of the world .
As Ehrman puts it , “ a relatively simple formula ” undergirds Paul ’s salvationism : “ sin leads to punishment ; Christ took the punishment upon himself ; therefore , Christ ’s death can atone for the sins of others . ”
Ehrman might have added that Kierkegaard has it right when , in “ The Sickness Unto Death , ” he gloomily writes that Christianity “ begins with the doctrine of sin . ”

In the aftermath of the Democratic National Convention , the party 's nominee , Michael S. Dukakis , has expanded his lead among registered voters over Vice President Bush , the probable Republican nominee , according to a Gallup Poll .
This was among the findings of a national public opinion poll of 948 registered voters conducted late last week for Newsweek magazine by the Gallup Organization .
The telephone interviews took place on July 21 , which was the last night of the convention , and on the night after that .
Fifty - five percent of the 948 registered voters interviewed in the poll said they preferred to see Mr. Dukakis win the 1988 Presidential election , while 38 percent said they preferred to see Mr. Bush win .
The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points .
This represented a shift in Mr. Dukakis 's lead from the 47 percent to 41 percent advantage he held in the last pre-convention Gallup Poll , taken by telephone July 8 - 10 .
In that poll , 1,001 registered voters were interviewed .
Marking a sad International Children ’s Day , angry parents mourned their young offspring Sunday and children across China opened their piggy banks and held yard sales to help survivors of last month ’s devastating earthquake .
Some of the most enduring images from the magnitude 7.9 temblor that killed about 69,000 were the faces of China ’s young .
An estimated 7,000 children lost their lives and more than 16,000 were injured , most buried alive when their schools collapsed .
At Juyuan Middle School , where 900 children died , parents mourned the youngsters Sunday near the ruins and demanded that a “ blood debt ” be paid by people responsible for shoddy construction .
The central government has vowed to investigate building quality and set new standards for future schoolhouses .

With entire cities and villages wiped out and millions of survivors left homeless , many youngsters have had to resume classes in tents and temporary shelters .
Some have been flown to neighboring provinces to attend school , and will have to live apart from their parents .
Bearing gifts of school bags and emotional support , President Hu Jintao over the weekend visited some young quake victims attending classes in a tent .
“ Today you have to study in the tent , ” he told the students .
“ But I promise to help you build a new school .
You will have a better classroom . ”
Across the nation , Children ’s Day took on new meaning as urban youngsters more used to asking their parents to take them for a meal at a Western fast - food restaurant learned the value of charity work .
Fundraising efforts included donations of pencils from children in the poorest parts of the country .
Many schools organized mass letter - writing campaigns and made paper cranes symbolizing life and health to send to survivors .

“ My dear little pals , we ’re all members of one big family , even though we do n’t know each other and are miles apart , ” wrote one elementary school student from Shanghai , according to the official New China News Agency .
In quake - ravaged Sichuan province , two injured miners stranded for 19 days in the mountains after the May 12 quake were flown to safety after being spotted by paratroops .

This story is a supplement to the feature " Rubik 's Cube Inspired Puzzles Demonstrate Math 's " Simple Groups " " which was printed in the July 2008 issue of Scientific American .
Solving the authors ’ new puzzles builds on techniques developed for the study of mathematical entities called groups .
One essential technique from group theory is specifying a simple , unambiguous system for writing down the elements of the group and how they combine .
Writing It Down
Rubik ’s Cube represents a group whose elements are the moves — the twists you can make of each face of the cube — and whose combination rule might be called the “ and then ” operation : “ make one twist and then make another . ”
The mechanism depicted in the illustration at the right shows that no matter how the cube is scrambled , the small pieces , or cubies , at the center of each face do not move ( except to rotate about their centers ) .
So any move for solving the cube can be represented by the first letter of the color of the center cubie — Blue , Green , Orange , Red , Yellow or White — plus some way of stating how much of a twist the move involves .
By itself , each letter indicates that the corresponding face is to be turned 90 degrees clockwise — looking “ down ” on the face from outside the cube ( moves Y and B in the diagram below ) .
A superscript indicates other kinds of turns .
B2 turns the blue face 180 degrees ; Y–1 turns the yellow face 90 degrees counterclockwise ( below ) .
The orientation of the cube can be specified by the colors of the three visible center cubies in clockwise order , beginning with the top center cubie ; in all the images below , for instance , the orientation is OYB .
Hint : Order Counts
The sequence of moves is critical to solving the cube , so the notation must capture the differences .
The composite moves YB and BY do not take a given starting arrangement of the cubies to the same final configuration .
Solving the Cube
Classic permutation puzzles such as Rubik ’s Cube , whose object is to rearrange the pieces into some target configuration , can usually be solved by following a two - step strategy .
Step 1 :
By trial and error , select a short , random sequence of moves , such as YBY –1B–1 .
Repeat the random sequence several times .
Often that will lead to an arrangement in which only a few cubies have been moved — a helpful tool in solving the cube .
Here three repetitions , or ( YBY – 1 B – 1 ) 3 , switch two pairs of corner cubies : the pair bordering the blue and orange faces ( cubies labeled P and Q at the below ) and the pair bordering the yellow and red faces .
Step Two :
Modify and generalize the useful move you found .
For example , to interchange the pair of corner cubies bordering the red and white faces ( cubies labeled E and F on a “ virgin ” cube shown below , for clarity , in orientation GWR ) , look for a move that “ sets up ” your “ useful move . ”
Applying the short setup sequence W2O–1 moves corner cubies E and F into positions P and Q ( for clarity , the cube faces are reoriented from GWR to OYB ) .
You can now apply the useful move ( YBY – 1 B – 1 ) 3 , undo the setup sequence by making the opposite moves in reverse order , OW–2 , and restore the initial orientation of the cube faces , GWR .
The net effect is to interchange the two corner cubies E and F ( below ) .
A similar setup sequence can be found for moving any pair of corner cubies to one of the two pairs interchanged by ( YBY – 1 B – 1 ) 3 .
You can thus construct a custom move for inter­changing any pair of corner cubies .
Proceeding in the same way with other random sequences gives enough flexibility to solve the cube and any other classic permutation puzzle .
They took two knucklebones from a yak and put them at the temples of a man called Lungshar .
They were bound in place with a tourniquet , which was tightened until his eyeballs popped out .
That was the theory , at any rate .
But this was the ancient Tibetan punishment of blinding and it had been outlawed by the 13th Dalai Lama , so no one was quite sure how to do it .
The executioners proceeded on oral accounts handed down from those who had seen the penalty exacted in a previous age .
They did n't get it quite right and one of the eyes had to be gouged out with a knife before the sockets were cauterised with boiling oil .
It may have been an antique penalty , but poor old Lungshar 's punishment was meted out only a little over 70 years ago , in the run-up to the selection of the present Dalai Lama , the man believed by many to be the 14th reincarnation of each of the previous 13 Dalai Lamas .
Lunghsar was one of the group of politicians jockeying to dominate the regency of between 10 to 20 years , which occurs whenever a Dalai Lama – the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism and for centuries the temporal ruler of Tibet , and now leader of its government - in - exile – dies and a young child is named as his reincarnation .
Lunghsar was the one who lost the power struggle .
The top knot of his hair was undone , in symbolic humiliation , and the gruesome penalty exacted .
He lived for a year afterwards .
There is more to this than a piece of grim history .
For it is but one of countless examples of the sheer strangeness of the world from which the Dalai Lama emerges .
It is part of what fires our romantic imagination about the jet - setting religious leader so beloved of Hollywood celebrities , who can fill 50,000 - seat rock - star venues and whose speeches are played on the dance floors of London clubs , yet who is also a feudal monarch , a God-King , and the reincarnated Living Buddha .

There are other reasons , too , why he has become one of the most revered religious leaders of our age .
His high - profile visit to Britain next week – during which he will meet the Prime Minister at Lambeth Palace on Friday – will provide further evidence of his extraordinary ability to attract Western support for his cause ( see pages 8 - 9 ) .
Notably , though , that meeting with Mr Brown wo n't be at Number 10 , a decision no doubt influenced by political considerations .
Which begs the question : can the Dalai Lama ever succeed in his mission to free Tibet from a Beijing regime determined to destroy its character and absorb the country into the homogeneity that is the People 's Republic of China ?
Buddhism is now the fastest - growing Eastern religion in the West .
Movie stars such as Richard Gere travel three times a year to the Dalai Lama 's exile home in Dharamsala in northern India to sit in on the classes he gives there to followers .
What he offers , according to Pico Iyer , author of The Open Road , a study of the Dalai Lama over the past 30 years , is a " trans - Buddhist philosophy of kindness and responsibility " , which strikes a chord in a Western world uncertain about its own religious heritage but thirsty to find meaning in an increasingly materialist culture .
The Dalai Lama , a contradictory figure far from the " simple monk " of his own definition , has transformed a complex Buddhist metaphysic into sound bites .
Kindness , he says , helps the person who gives it .
Anger works against the person who feels it .
Violence breeds violence .
And the quality of means determine ends .
Such Buddhism is unthreatening to those brought up in a secular culture uneasy with the dogmas and duties of Judaism , Christianity or Islam .
Buddhism chimes well with a contemporary sense that there is no meaning to the universe beyond that which we confer on it .
Then there is the attraction of the Dalai Lama 's own character .
" He is genuinely gentle and humble , " said one of his Western followers .
" He really seems like a man in whom ego has been shrunk .
People feel humbled when they meet him . "
All that is reinforced by the man 's love of gardening , his doting on his Alsatian dog , and the gentle pragmatism of giving up being a vegetarian after falling ill with hepatitis B .
His legendary laugh and genial twinkle help him reach across boundaries – as does his globetrotting , which saw him tour 11 countries last year .
Not much notice is taken of his condemnatory views on homosexuality and divorce , nor his gentle insistence to foreigners that they should study their own religious traditions rather than seize upon a Buddhism they have not fully understood .
" If you can't make Christianity work you need to look into yourself to find out why , " he once told a Western enthusiast for things of the East .
To really understand the extraordinary draw of the Dalai Lama , one must understand his background .
This is the man who was born in a cowshed , the fifth of 16 children , in a small and poor mountain settlement in the remote Tibetan province of Amdo .
Yet one day , before he was even three , a party of monks journeyed to his home , having been led there by the arcs of rainbows .
They had been sent out by the Tibetan government to find the new incarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama , Thupten Gyatso , who had died in 1933 .
They had travelled to the north - east because the head of the dead Dalai Lama had mysteriously turned in that direction as his embalmed body was lying in state , indicating the region where he would take rebirth .
A senior monk had dreamt of a house with strange guttering near a three - storeyed monastery with a turquoise and gold roof .
When they found the place , they entered to find a toddler named Lhamo Thondup .
The monks ' leader , who was pretending to be their servant , spent the evening playing with the child .
Lhamo was offered a number of items which had belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama , along with several similar items that did not .
In every case , the infant chose the correct objects , announcing : " It 's mine .
It 's mine . "
Most striking was that he lingered over , but ultimately rejected , a walking stick which had once belonged to his illustrious predecessor but which the 13th Dalai Lama had given away .
The 14th Dalai Lama – the reincarnation of the Bodhisattva of Compassion – had been found .
But that was only the beginning .
At the age of four , renamed Tenzin Gyatso , he was taken to the cold dark Potala Palace in Lhasa , from which he wistfully watched the ordinary children of the capital playing in the streets below .
There he was put through an intense religious training , which concluded with an oral exam before 20,000 monks in March 1949 .
It was also where he was schooled in the hard lessons of international politics : that month Tibet was invaded by an army of Chinese Communists , who stated their intention to liberate this strategic and resource - rich area , almost the size of Western Europe , from the hands of imperialist aggressors – whatever that might mean .

For almost eight years the new young leader negotiated with Mao Tse Tung 's invaders , seeking to find a workable compromise .
At first there was a honeymoon period , in which the young man several times was invited to meet Chairman Mao , who – according to Alexander Norman 's new study of the lives of the Dalai Lamas , Holder of the White Lotus – mistook the young man 's enthusiasm for modernity for a rejection of his faith , and offered the friendly advice that " religion is poison " .
Even so , the Dalai Lama acquiesced in a Chinese 17 - point agreement legitimising Tibet 's incorporation into China , while guaranteeing no change to Tibet 's political , cultural and religious institutions .
But the smooth words were accompanied by continuing violence against Buddhist monasteries and civilians .
More than a million Tibetans – a sixth of the population – died during the 30 years following the Chinese occupation .
In March 1959 Tibetans took to the streets demanding an end toChinese rule .
Faced with the choice of kow - towing to the Chinese or joining a popular uprising in which many more would die , the Dalai Lama fled in secret through the snow - covered passes of the world 's highest mountain range to the Indian hill station of Dharamsala .
Though the Indian authorities were alarmed by the 80,000 other Tibetans who followed him , the rest of the world was captivated .
Such was the stuff of romantic fable .
Yet there is also something deeply modern about the man and his story .
It is there in his philosophy , in his politics and , sadly , in the persecution which is the continuing fate of his people .
Back home the Chinese crushed the 1959 revolt and thousands of protesters were killed .
In the years that followed the Dalai Lama ceaselessly campaigned for a non-violent solution .
Yet Tibet largely fell from the international spotlight .
As recently as the early - 1980s , according to Iyer , the Tibetan leader 's New York press conferences attracted barely a handful of people .
But then , in 1987 , the Tibetans again rose up against Chinese occupation , and this time foreign observers were present and the world began to pay heed .
It also noticed how , in the face of violence and repression , this exiled leader spoke always and only for tolerance and dialogue .
Within two years he had won the Nobel Peace Prize .
In his acceptance speech , he quoted Ghandi as his spiritual hero .
" I speak without a feeling of anger towards those who are responsible for the immense suffering of our people and destruction of our land , home and culture , " he said .
" They too are human beings who ... deserve our compassion . "
It was only then that the world began to perceive the Dalai Lama 's complexity .
True , he had been educated in Buddhist metaphysics , epistemology , logic and Sanskrit .
But from early on he was attuned to Western culture .
As a boy he was fascinated by things he found among the belongings of his predecessors in his vast 1,000 - roomed palace – a telescope , a cine - camera and illustrated books in English .
He took apart watches and put them back together .
He invited scientists and philosophers to his home to give him personal seminars .
The journey from Tibet to India was a journey from the medieval to the modern .
The Dalai Lama drew up a constitution for the Tibetan government - in - exile which brought his people democracy for the first time in their history ; he even provided a clause allowing for his own impeachment .
In his monasteries , monks began to learn modern science .
Women could study for doctoral degrees .
Children are educated in Tibetan to the age of 10 and thereafter in English .
Over the past 30 years the Dalai Lama has tried to blend the best of old Tibet with the best of the 20th - century West .
Not everyone is convinced : there are young radicals among Tibetan Buddhists who have become impatient with his line of compassion to all people , including the Chinese invaders .
Though he has accused them of committing " cultural genocide " , it has borne no fruit , they argue , over five decades .
His " middle way " of Tibet as part of the People 's Republic , but designated a " zone of peace " – with self - rule and an end to the mass movement of Han Chinese migrants into the area to swamp the native population – has been rejected by Beijing .
Instead China has cracked down more thoroughly .
Tibetans are saying more frequently that they can wait no longer : that this is the moment for a decisive act of defiance .
The Dalai Lama has been uncharacteristically firm in response : in the long term , dialogue is the only way , and any solution not owned by the Chinese is no solution at all .
When Tibetans turned to violent protest in Lhasa in March ( though nowhere near as violent as the Chinese security forces ) the Dalai Lama threatened to resign if violence worsened .
The angry young men who set fire to Chinese businesses in Lhasa may continue to ignore him , but the majority of Tibetans are cowed by this robust expression of authority ; nobody challenged him on how an incarnation could resign .
Instead he has used the Olympic flame 's progress across the world to persuade the international community to press the Chinese to re-open negotiations .
The first steps in a complex diplomatic gavotte have begun .
He has no illusions : a whole series of envoys to Beijing over the past 50 years have produced nothing .
Talks between the two sides broke down in 1993 and there was no dialogue for nearly a decade .
Earlier this month the two sides met in the Chinese city of Shenzhen , yet Beijing has not abandoned its fiery rhetoric : it calls him " a wolf in monk 's clothing " .
The Chinese doubt his good faith , believing that though he insists he does not want independence for Tibet , that is his real agenda .
They resent his campaign ahead of the Olympics , saying he is trying to undermine the Games , divide China and hold back its rise as a world power so " the country and people forever remain poor and weak " .
The two sides have agreed to meet again , but with the Chinese caveat that the Dalai Lama must " show sincerity , particularly in his actions " for the negotiations to continue .
These are the faultlines which provoke ambivalence to the Dalai Lama among Western politicians .
It is why Gordon Brown has been so reluctant to meet him .
It is one thing to bask in the glow of the Dalai Lama 's presence ; it is quite another to irritate the world 's emerging superpower .
Yet paradox seems not to trouble Tenzin Gyatso .
This is , after all , the man who claims to be addicted to newspapers , magazines and the BBC World Service , yet who rises at 4 am to spend the first four hours of every day in silent meditation .
He is a religious leader who warns against being needlessly distracted by religion .
He represents one of the world 's most underdeveloped and isolated countries , yet is a champion of globalism .
He is a man who is assailed from one side for being too expedient , and on the other for being too idealistic .
He is a man who , all his life , has tried to bring the ideal and the possible together and make from them a new reality .
No wonder everyone loves him – apart from the politicians .
The Chinese think a waiting game will see him off .
After all , when the Dalai Lama dies – he is now 72 – the monks will set off in search of his reincarnation .
The child they find will need long years of schooling during a regency that will give Beijing chances aplenty for mischief - making .
Tenzin Gyatso has a simple response : a 15th Dalai Lama , he says , will necessarily advance the programme of the 14th Dalai Lama .
It will be a long game indeed .
Rolling with Team Lama
Joshua Dugdale is the director of The Unwinking Gaze , the first fly - on - the - wall documentary to detail the day - to - day life of the Dalai Lama .
Dugdale and his crew have been given unprecedented access to the Tibetan leader and his entourage since 2004
The Dalai Lama gets up at 4 am .
He 'll have tea when he gets up , then breakfast after his meditation , which lasts for two to four hours .
Breakfast – usually toast , butter , jam and orange juice – must be on the table at the right time .
While he eats he may read The Times of India and the International Herald Tribune .
I do n't think the Dalai Lama has many close friends .
He may have things in common with other monks , but he 's still their boss .
He has an enormous capacity for empathy and loves to laugh , but among his own entourage , you see his more serious side .
His offices are based in the palace complex in Dharamsala in India ; his own private office is next to the plush ante-room where he receives guests , and is quite old - fashioned : a desk , with no computer , just a blotter and some pens .
But his team have computers , faxes , printers , the internet .
There are about half a dozen in this inner circle , including Tenzin Namdak Taklha , the Dalai Lama 's Lord Chamberlain figure .
The private office does its best to protect the Dalai Lama .
But it is n't the slickest operation , and has been accused of naivety .
All the Dalai Lama 's attendants are in awe of him .
They see to his everyday needs – serving meals , giving and accepting gifts and so on .
Tibetans come from across the Himalayas to see him so they can have a better rebirth in their next life .
When the Dalai Lama goes on tour , it 's relentless , meeting after meeting , arena after arena .
But he is very undemanding .
When I was with him on a trip to Liverpool , he stayed in a budget hotel , but never complained .
For a long trip , the entourage might be a dozen - strong , plus security ; for shorter trips , perhaps only four or five – and his brother Tenzin Choegyal and the Special Envoy , Lodi Gyari , also accompany him .
Gyari has been in the West for a long time , but used to be the head of the Tibetan Youth Congress , which is the independence - seeking organisation that the Chinese accuse of paramilitary activities .
He 's a controversial figure , but well respected in Washington , where he is based .
He acts as a gateway between the Dalai Lama and Tibet 's American supporters , and the Dalai Lama takes his advice on most global political issues , such as whether he should go to the Beijing Olympics .
The Prime Minister of the government in exile , Samdhong Rimpoche , is possibly a little more deferential to the Dalai Lama than he should be ; it 's awkward to have your spiritual mentor as your boss on a political level , too .
He 's a good administrator , but finds negotiating with the Chinese quite a challenge .
It 's a big step up from running the education system , his previous job .
He has only sporadic contact with the Dalai Lama .
They do n't meet every day .
The Dalai Lama is very hands - off – he wants to leave the politics to others .
He just steps in when he 's needed , although his word is final .

During the month of June , Turner Classic Movies , TCM , looks at Hollywood 's portrayal of Asians on the screen in a 35 - film festival that includes early depictions starring Anna May Wong to contemporary superstars such as Jackie Chan .
Four films I plan to watch are the post war films : Flower Drum Song , Sayonara , The Teahouse of the August Moon and The World of Suzie Wong .
Tuesday , June 17 The Legacy of World War II
8 p.m. Go for Broke ! ( 1951 )
9:45 p.m. Bad Day at Black Rock ( 1955 )
11:15 p.m. The Teahouse of the August Moon ( 1956 )
1:30 a.m. Walk Like a Dragon ( 1960 )
Thursday , June 19 Interracial & Intercultural Romance
8 p.m. Bridge to the Sun ( 1961 )
10 p.m. China Doll ( 1958 )
12 a.m. Sayonara ( 1957 )
2:30 a.m. The World of Suzie Wong ( 1960 )
During a discussion of the film schedule an individual makes the statement : " We are no longer that society " when commenting upon the success of some of the films made in the 60's .
A post WW II America , many of them vets and families of vets who served in the Pacific , enjoyed the glossy soap - opera plot of The World of Suzie Wong , a romantic fantasy concocted by Hollywood .
I was born soon after WW ll , and in the 50's was entertained by TV ( Howdy Doody was our nursery school and day care ) .
Protesting anything and everything in the 60's , then serving in Peace Corps in the 70's , meant I needed to be re-educated in the 80's ( compliments of some of the last of the government 's free money - scholarships ) , I finally made some money for myself in the 90's .
When I heard the statement : " We are no longer that society " I started to ponder the particulars of where society has been during my lifetime , and where does it stand today ?
This past weekend angry women were interviewed by the news services .
Many of them feel that their time has come and gone , their opportunity lost or squandered .
After his victory in Iowa Obama said : " You know , they said this day would never come .
They said our sights were set too high .
They said this country was too divided , too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose . "
Is the Obama campaign enough of a common purpose for society to come together ?
Will the angry women from this weekend 's TV sound bites turn around in the next few months and view the Democratic ticket as a common purpose ?
I do n't know if Obama has been a " divider " or a " unifier " for this country .
Part of me feels that he does n't have the substance to be one or the other .
Martin Luther King said : " Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter . "
People of all color and backgrounds rallied around and with the man who spoke of matters that pulled us out of our daily pigeon - holed existence .
I love the term " pigeon - holed .
In mathematics , the term is applied to the pigeon problem : " If you put 6 pigeons in 5 holes then at least one hole would have more than one pigeon . "
Our daily routines are often restrictive .
We often do n't take the time to think and we allow the media to position us in the box , the hole of least resistance .
I hope to use the opportunity presented by TCM to explore the social , economic and historical significance of the 60's and 70's .
The musical Flower Drum Song was successful ( as the novel had been ) , garnering six Tony Award nominations and spawning a London production , national tours and a 1961 musical film , but the musical and movie would fall out of favor as the civil rights era re-defined how minorities should be portrayed on film .
As I go through this project , I might better be able to understand " Why we are no longer that society " and begin to understand where this society is going and the impact of the Obama campaign .

Waldo County , situated in mid-coast Maine along scenic Penobscot Bay , has genuine New England character evidenced by working port towns and quaint rural villages .
Visitors are awed by the area 's unspoiled beauty .
From striking coastal views to sweeping mountain vistas , dramatic natural settings abound .
In addition great care has been taken to preserve and refurbish numerous historic landmarks , homes and buildings .
Consequently , the Maine of yesteryear is still found here .

I was a bit off colour .
More languid than I normally am first thing in the morning .
My head felt denser than usual , as if it had been filled overnight with sand .
But it was my turn to make the tea , so I rolled over and ... pffff .
One ear gone .
Then , as I sat up , I kept on going past the point of perpendicularity , like a Weeble .
The room swam .
The Ps and Fs in my ear grew louder .
I felt sick .
Sudden neurosensory hearing loss ( SNHL ) is called that because they can't think of anything better to call it .
This is because they do n't really know what it is .
What is known is its effect : hearing is taken away suddenly and the victim loses all sense of balance .
Any movement results in acute vertigo and vomiting .
You can lose vision , too .
The most likely causes are either viral or vascular , resulting in the denial of blood to important bits of neural kit .
Permanent damage is inflicted on the tiny hair cells or cilia in the inner ear , which are vital conductors of auditory information to the brain .
Once torched , they do n't grow back .
SNHL is really quite calamitous .
An hour after the first attack , when my wife and two children carried me deaf , blind , immobile , nauseous and incoherent into the doctor 's surgery , my GP 's first thought was that I had a brain tumour .
In hospital an MRI scan revealed nothing .
" Sit tight , " they said .
" But my hearing is my favourite sense .
I need ears for work .
Music is my great passion in life : I write about it and I do it a bit too .
I 'd rather lose an eye , a foot ... "
" We do n't guarantee that hearing will return , " the surgeon replied .
" But do n't worry .
It may . "
He then sidestepped his own sidestep .
" Anyway , lots of people live perfectly normal lives with only one ear . "
I emerged from hospital a week later , profoundly deaf in one ear , my brain refusing to let my ear go quietly .
Its reaction is to fill my head with noise .
Imagine the sound of pressurised air escaping from a central heating valve .
That 's the sound that fills the right hemisphere of my head round the clock .
Concealed within that hissy cloud there 's another layer of far subtler sounds .
In the dead of night , when my wife is breathing silently and there is no other sound going in my good ear , I can hear beneath the pfffff a strange polyphony of whistles and cries , like a drowning choir , accompanied by a tiny monkey playing a teeny pipe organ .
It can be quite soothing .
But if my wife suddenly exhales through her nose , or rustles the duvet by moving her head slightly , then all hell breaks loose .
I hear gasping cats and boiling kettles .
When two or more voices are joined together in amiable conversation , I hear trains entering underground stations .
Right now , sitting at my computer in an otherwise silent house , the minuscule hum of the machine is at a pitch somewhere between the central - heating pffff and the cat 's gasp .
This is not conventional tinnitus , but entirely reactive to input in the good ear .
It is the auditory equivalent of the illusion experienced by amputees - the feeling that the missing limb is still attached .
My brain is generating sound to compensate for the lack of auditory activity in my ear .
So where does that leave music ?
It leaves music pretty much nowhere .
Put it this way : I can hear music but I can't listen to it , not for pleasure .
What I can hear is monophonic , on the far side of whatever uproar happens to be filling my head .
Music is merely a sound .
It is not , for me , the same thing that it was for a good 40 of my 47 years , right up until the end of August .
I do n't know how you hear music .
I imagine that if you like music at all then it has , in your head , some kind of third dimension to it , a dimension suggesting space as well as surface , depth of field as well as texture .
Speaking for myself , I used to hear " buildings " ... three - dimensional forms of architectural substance and tension .
I did not " see " these buildings in the classic synaesthetic way so much as sense them .
These forms had " floors " , " walls " , " roofs " , " windows " , " cellars " .
They expressed volume .
Music to me has always been a handsome three - dimensional container , a vessel , as real in its way as a Scout hut or a cathedral or a ship , with an inside and an outside and subdivided internal spaces .
I 'm absolutely certain that this " architecture " had everything to do with why music has always exerted such a hold over me .
I think music was the structure in which I learned to contain and then examine emotion .
I 've always kept quiet about this architecture business , partly because it sounds pretentious and even slightly self - congratulatory ( you hear Amy Winehouse , I hear Apsley House ) , but also because I 'd never been entirely confident that " architecture " was what I really meant .
Maybe " hearing music architecturally " was just me being inarticulate .
But I am confident now .
" Architecturally " was precisely right .
What I hear now when I listen to music is a flat , two - dimensional representation .
Where I used to get buildings , I now only get architectural drawings .
I can interpret what the drawings show , but I do n't get the actual structure : I can't enter music and I can't perceive its inner spaces .
I 've never got much of an emotional hit from technical drawings .
Here is what really hurts : I no longer respond to music emotionally .
The celebrated neurologist and author Oliver Sacks has recently published a book , Musicophilia , all about the relationship between the brain and music .
In it he tells the story of a Dr Jorgensen who lost all hearing in one ear following an operation on a nerve .
He , like me , afterwards found music as flat and unengaging as a line drawing .
Dr Jorgensen did not get the tinnitus , however .
He enjoyed blissful silence in his duff ear .
Yet music for him remained steadfastly flat .
Jorgensen wrote to Sacks to tell his story and to pass on the interesting information that , counter to all logic , after about six months ' dogged listening , he fancied that his single ear was beginning to offer him a " pseudostereo effect " , giving him " ample compensation " for the loss of real stereo .
He speculated on the possibility of his brain doing a bit of surreptitious rewiring : " Hearing fibres might have crossed in the corpus callosum to receive input from my functioning left ear ... "
Sacks is doubtful about the extent of such rewiring , but goes on to ruminate on what might be expected of a brain in such circumstances , not least with regard to the brain 's capacity to register " space " in music as an active element in its emotional reach .
He talks about the " recruitment " of different brain areas not normally used for the purpose .
I began to do little experiments on myself .
I dared not listen to my favourite music for fear of what I might hear ( imagine : Miles Davis as a papery squiggle ) , but I kept up a steady drip of new and potentially interesting ( quiet ) music into my one good ear , on the off chance that something desirable might happen .
And on November 11 I tottered downstairs to watch the Remembrance Day broadcast at the Cenotaph .
I am always affected by the Cenotaph ritual , in particular the Guards ' stacked Nimrod , followed by When I Am Laid in Earth ( from Purcell 's Dido and Aeneas ) and Beethoven 's Funeral March : grey greatcoats , deep trombones , utter stillness .
Gets me every single time .
Every year I watch and wait for Nimrod 's unfailing impact on my metabolism , fascinated by the serpentine passage of emotion through my body , from its bed in the pit of my stomach , slow as a Guardsman 's dead march .
It 's an extraordinary sensation , made all the more so because of its complete and utter predictability .
So I switched on and sat there .
What if nothing happened ?
I need n't have worried .
David Dimbleby had only to intone , " And now , from Elgar 's Enigma Variations ... " and , before a single Guardsman had so much as licked his mouthpiece , I was a mess .
Yes , of course , I was snivelling for my lost cilia .
But also , quite clearly , my psyche was not going to run the risk of me being unable to feel a thing in the face of stick - on emotional music .
But that was n't the interesting thing .
What was really interesting was that , as I sat there shuddering and trickling , I began to hear the music better .
Melody , metre , a little bit of timbre , the puffiest cloud of harmony .
Yes , yes ... I began to sense the tiniest swelling of architectural form in my head .
You would n't have called it the Taj Mahal , but equally , this was no papery squiggle .
When it was over , I stuck the Purcell on my stereo .
I thought : if I 'm getting that much from the TV , what am I going to get from a good recording coming out of big speakers ?
I only got discomfort and bewilderment .
The music was close to unreadable .
It was certainly unbearable .
I turned it off and let the uproar in my head subside .
Oliver Sacks was in London a week or two later , talking about his book .
He kindly agreed to meet .
We sat in the foyer of his hotel and he listened , kindly and attentively , taking notes .
He seemed interested by the Cenotaph experience and my uncooked theory of music - as - emotional - petri- dish .
He then told me that he'd recently lost the sight in one eye and that it had broken his heart .
Sacks has maintained a lifelong fascination with , and experimental expertise in , the subject of stereoscopy .
He has tinkered with the science and the showmanship of seeing with two eyes since the 30s and has developed an almost metaphysical affection for the way stereoscopy makes the world lovable , as well as livable in .
He pointed a thumb out of the window of the breakfast bar and drew my attention to the thick , shifting foliage on the other side of the glass .
" Beforehand , " he said , " I would take active pleasure in the movements of tricky jungle surfaces , and the way we perceive depth and distinctiveness in the most complex visual environments .
But now , " he hesitated , obviously not wanting to labour the point , " everything 's rather flat . "
The Monophone and the Monoscope felt each other 's pain and agreed to correspond .
A few days later I tottered off to watch a preview of the Led Zeppelin concert film The Song Remains the Same , which was coming out on DVD with remastered sound .
It 's a daft film but I am fond of it , and it seemed an ideal opportunity to test a couple of things : the significance of familiarity in any emotional response to music , and whether there was anything in the vague feeling carried over from the Cenotaph that seeing the music helped with the process of hearing it .
( I know what you 're thinking : Led Zeppelin ?
Emotion ?
What kind of weirdo are you ?
But the fact is , I have always got a lot of emotional pleasure from Led Zeppelin , a pleasure that is , I suspect , not unakin to Sacks 's pleasure in the shifting of jungle foliage . )
Crash bang wallop .
I lasted three songs and had to leave the cinema clutching my head in a state of disorientation .
The reactive tinnitus took me close to the threshold of actual physical pain .
Great swaths of the music were simply unreadable .
Jimmy Page 's guitar , in particular , was a storm of detuned noise .
I sent an email to Daniel J Levitin , musician , neuroscientist and the author of This Is Your Brain on Music , to see what he thought .
I explained about the flatness , the absence of warmth and timbre .
This is what he said : " We do n't know much about those higher - order qualities .
I know about them as a recording engineer and producer , but not as a scientist .
I suspect that something has gone awry in the inner ear and so the cortex is n't getting all the information it 's accustomed to .
In the case of pitch , the brain can fill in the missing information , but with those higher - order properties not . "
So there it is .
I can make analytical " sense " of music most of the time because my brain can compensate for any loss of pitch , which is the very first quality that differentiates music from pneumatic drills and bickering children .
What my brain can't seem to do is fill in the timbre , warmth , texture and depth - what Levitin calls the higher - order qualities .
Does this mean that it is the higher - order qualities that generate the emotional response to music ?
Or is it just me ?
Does it merely mean that in order for me to be able to register music 's architectural dimension - and therefore have a special place in which to register emotion - I need warmth , timbre , texture and depth ?
This might explain why , if I listen hard to music in my new condition , I feel perfectly capable of making aesthetic judgments , even as I feel nothing much at all at the emotional level .
A week or two later I had a kindly letter from Oliver Sacks , enclosing a copy of a piece he wrote for the New Yorker , Stereo Sue , about a woman who had " acquired stereoscopy after almost half a century of being stereo - blind " .
It was , she said , " a constant source of delight " .
The neurological basis of Sue 's transformation was by no means clear , but the impact of it was abundantly so .
Stereo
Sue described to Sacks the effect of being " inside " a snowfall for the first time , because she was able now to see it shifting and flowing around her in three dimensions , as opposed to " looking in on it " , as she had done all her life .
" I watched the snow fall for several minutes , and , as I watched , I was overcome with a deep sense of joy . "
She might have been describing how I used to feel when I listened to John Coltrane or Marvin Gaye or the St Matthew Passion or , for that matter , Led Zeppelin .
I used to inhabit all of them , as they inhabited me , in three - dimensional space .
Now I only look in .
Sacks was particularly engaged by my Cenotaph episode .
" What you say about the power of emotion to restore a sense of depth and spaciousness ( to music ) is extremely interesting , " he wrote .
" You must have ( and will always have ) the memory of such spaciousness , and the power to evoke it in imagination - and ' imagination ' imagery is neurologically almost equivalent to perception .
One might expect that such a power , while not available ( or less available ) voluntarily , could occur spontaneously by association with emotion , a memory .
But you have to sort this out for yourself . "
He is currently reading a book entitled A Singular View : The Art of Seeing With One Eye .
So I know that the only way forward with this is to keep listening to music , even though it hurts .
The more I listen , the greater the chance of cortical adaptation , but also the greater the chance my memory has of helping me to rediscover the sensation of what music used to do .
After six months , a fair amount of adaptation has already taken place .
I decided to do away with my walking stick a couple of weeks ago and I now swank around slowly , like a cowboy without his horse , legs spread .
And I have begun to force myself to share space with other people while they talk .
It is n't easy , but it 's easier .
It feels like progress .
But music is still perceived flatly in a sliver of space on the far side of the noise in my head .
It kind of hurts .
I do find , though , that I am learning to " read " music in a different way .
It involves a lot of effort .
Music has always penetrated me effortlessly - that has been part of my pleasure in it .
Its power to get inside , to saturate , has been its greatest power .
And in response I have always been delighted to be the passive recipient .
But that does n't work any more .
I now have to fight to hear music : to resist the discomfort that arises from listening and to clear the space in my head for music to have some wriggle room - and of course , or so I fervently hope , for music one day to snap into three dimensions and give me my buildings back .

For a " fake news " anchor , Jon Stewart sure does a better job reporting actual news than the entire mainstream media combined .
I 'm sure Stewart would n't take offense when I say that that 's pretty sad .
When Paul G. Kaminski completed his graduate work in 1971 with degrees from M.I.T. and Stanford , he started building advanced airplanes for the Air Force .
By the time he stopped several decades later , he had played a pivotal role in producing a flock of new weapons , including radar - evading stealth aircraft .
If Mr. Kaminski were coming out of school today , chances are he would be going to work for the likes of Microsoft or Google .
Over the last decade , even as spending on new military projects has reached its highest level since the Reagan years , the Pentagon has increasingly been losing the people most skilled at managing them .
That brain drain , military experts like Mr. Kaminski say , is a big factor in a breakdown in engineering management that has made huge cost overruns and long delays the maddening norm .
Mr. Kaminski ’s generation of engineers , which was responsible for many of the most successful military projects of the 1970s and ’ 80s , is aging , and fewer of the nation ’s top young engineers , software developers and mathematicians are replacing them .
Instead , they are joining high - tech companies and other civilian firms that provide not just better pay than the military or its contractors , but also greater cachet  what one former defense industry engineer called “ geek credit . ”

UTF -8 : The Secret of Character Encoding
Filed under End- User
Return to the index
Character encoding and character sets are not that difficult to understand , but so many people blithely stumble through the worlds of programming without knowing what to actually do about it , or say " Ah , it 's a job for those internationalization experts . "
No , it is not !
This document will walk you through determining the encoding of your system and how you should handle this information .
It will stay away from excessive discussion on the internals of character encoding .
This document is not designed to be read in its entirety : it will slowly introduce concepts that build on each other : you need not get to the bottom to have learned something new .
However , I strongly recommend you read all the way to Why UTF - 8 ? , because at least at that point you'd have made a conscious decision not to migrate , which can be a rewarding ( but difficult ) task .
Asides
Text in this formatting is an aside , interesting tidbits for the curious but not strictly necessary material to do the tutorial .
If you read this text , you 'll come out with a greater understanding of the underlying issues .
Table of Contents
Finding the real encoding
In the beginning , there was ASCII , and things were simple .
But they were n't good , for no one could write in Cyrillic or Thai .
So there exploded a proliferation of character encodings to remedy the problem by extending the characters ASCII could express .
This ridiculously simplified version of the history of character encodings shows us that there are now many character encodings floating around .
A character encoding tells the computer how to interpret raw zeroes and ones into real characters .
It usually does this by pairing numbers with characters .
There are many different types of character encodings floating around , but the ones we deal most frequently with are ASCII , 8 - bit encodings , and Unicode - based encodings .
ASCII is a 7 - bit encoding based on the English alphabet .
is a 7 - bit encoding based on the English alphabet .
8 - bit encodings are extensions to ASCII that add a potpourri of useful , non-standard characters like é and æ .
They can only add 127 characters , so usually only support one script at a time .
When you see a page on the web , chances are it's encoded in one of these encodings .
are extensions to ASCII that add a potpourri of useful , non-standard characters like é and æ .
They can only add 127 characters , so usually only support one script at a time .
When you see a page on the web , chances are it's encoded in one of these encodings .
Unicode - based encodings implement the Unicode standard and include UTF - 8 , UTF - 16 and UTF - 32/ UCS - 4 .
They go beyond 8 - bits and support almost every language in the world .
UTF - 8 is gaining traction as the dominant international encoding of the web .
The first step of our journey is to find out what the encoding of your website is .
The most reliable way is to ask your browser :
Mozilla Firefox Tools > Page Info : Encoding Internet Explorer View >
Encoding : bulleted item is unofficial name
Internet Explorer wo n't give you the MIME ( i.e. useful / real ) name of the character encoding , so you 'll have to look it up using their description .
Some common ones :
IE 's Description Mime Name Windows Arabic ( Windows ) Windows - 1256 Baltic ( Windows ) Windows - 1257 Central European ( Windows ) Windows - 1250 Cyrillic ( Windows ) Windows - 1251 Greek ( Windows ) Windows - 1253 Hebrew ( Windows ) Windows - 1255 Thai ( Windows ) TIS - 620 Turkish ( Windows ) Windows - 1254 Vietnamese ( Windows ) Windows - 1258 Western European ( Windows ) Windows - 1252 ISO Arabic ( ISO ) ISO - 8859 -6 Baltic ( ISO ) ISO - 8859 - 4 Central European ( ISO ) ISO - 8859 - 2 Cyrillic ( ISO ) ISO - 8859 - 5 Estonian ( ISO ) ISO - 8859 - 13 Greek ( ISO ) ISO - 8859 -7 Hebrew ( ISO - Logical ) ISO - 8859-8-l Hebrew ( ISO - Visual ) ISO - 8859 - 8 Latin 9 ( ISO ) ISO - 8859 - 15 Turkish ( ISO ) ISO - 8859 -9 Western European ( ISO ) ISO - 8859 - 1 Other Chinese Simplified ( GB18030 ) GB18030 Chinese Simplified ( GB2312 ) GB2312 Chinese Simplified ( HZ ) HZ Chinese Traditional ( Big5 ) Big5 Japanese ( Shift - JIS ) Shift_JIS Japanese ( EUC ) EUC-JP Korean EUC-KR Unicode ( UTF - 8 ) UTF - 8
Internet Explorer does not recognize some of the more obscure character encodings , and having to lookup the real names with a table is a pain , so I recommend using Mozilla Firefox to find out your character encoding .
Finding the embedded encoding
At this point , you may be asking , " Did n't we already find out our encoding ? "
Well , as it turns out , there are multiple places where a web developer can specify a character encoding , and one such place is in a META tag :
< meta http-equiv= " Content - Type " content = " text / html ; charset=UTF - 8 " />
You 'll find this in the HEAD section of an HTML document .
The text to the right of charset= is the " claimed " encoding : the HTML claims to be this encoding , but whether or not this is actually the case depends on other factors .
For now , take note if your META tag claims that either :
The character encoding is the same as the one reported by the browser , The character encoding is different from the browser 's , or There is no META tag at all !
( horror , horror ! )
Fixing the encoding
The advice given here is for pages being served as vanilla text / html .
Different practices must be used for application / xml or application / xml+xhtml , see W3 C 's document on XHTML media types for more information .
If your META encoding and your real encoding match , savvy !
You can skip this section .
If they do n't ...
No embedded encoding
If this is the case , you 'll want to add in the appropriate META tag to your website .
It 's as simple as copy - pasting the code snippet above and replacing UTF - 8 with whatever is the mime name of your real encoding .
For all those skeptics out there , there is a very good reason why the character encoding should be explicitly stated .
When the browser is n't told what the character encoding of a text is , it has to guess : and sometimes the guess is wrong .
Hackers can manipulate this guess in order to slip XSS past filters and then fool the browser into executing it as active code .
A great example of this is the Google UTF - 7 exploit .
You might be able to get away with not specifying a character encoding with the META tag as long as your webserver sends the right Content - Type header , but why risk it ?
Besides , if the user downloads the HTML file , there is no longer any webserver to define the character encoding .
Embedded encoding disagrees
This is an extremely common mistake : another source is telling the browser what the character encoding is and is overriding the embedded encoding .
This source usually is the Content - Type HTTP header that the webserver ( i.e. Apache ) sends .
A usual Content - Type header sent with a page might look like this :
Content - Type : text / html ; charset=ISO -8859-1
Notice how there is a charset parameter : this is the webserver 's way of telling a browser what the character encoding is , much like the META tags we touched upon previously .
In fact , the META tag is designed as a substitute for the HTTP header for contexts where sending headers is impossible ( such as locally stored files without a webserver ) .
Thus the name http -equiv ( HTTP equivalent ) .
There are two ways to go about fixing this : changing the META tag to match the HTTP header , or changing the HTTP header to match the META tag .
How do we know which to do ?
It depends on the website 's content : after all , headers and tags are only ways of describing the actual characters on the web page .
If your website :
... only uses ASCII characters , Either way is fine , but I recommend switching both to UTF - 8 ( more on this later ) .
... uses special characters , and they display properly , Change the embedded encoding to the server encoding .
... uses special characters , but users often complain that they come out garbled , Change the server encoding to the embedded encoding .
Changing a META tag is easy : just swap out the old encoding for the new .
Changing the server ( HTTP header ) encoding , however , is slightly more difficult .
Changing the server encoding
PHP header ( ) function
The simplest way to handle this problem is to send the encoding yourself , via your programming language .
Since you 're using HTML Purifier , I 'll assume PHP , although it 's not too difficult to do similar things in other languages .
The appropriate code is :
... replacing UTF - 8 with whatever your embedded encoding is .
This code must come before any output , so be careful about stray whitespace in your application ( i.e. , any whitespace before output excluding whitespace within <? php ?> tags ) .
PHP ini directive
PHP also has a neat little ini directive that can save you a header call : default_charset .
Using this code :
... will also do the trick .
If PHP is running as an Apache module ( and not as FastCGI , consult phpinfo ( ) for details ) , you can even use htaccess to apply this property across many PHP files :
As with all INI directives , this can also go in your php.ini file .
Some hosting providers allow you to customize your own php.ini file , ask your support for details .
Use : default_charset = " utf - 8 "
Non-PHP
You may , for whatever reason , need to set the character encoding on non-PHP files , usually plain ol ' HTML files .
Doing this is more of a hit - or - miss process : depending on the software being used as a webserver and the configuration of that software , certain techniques may work , or may not work .
. htaccess
On Apache , you can use an .htaccess file to change the character encoding .
I 'll defer to W3C for the in - depth explanation , but it boils down to creating a file named .htaccess with the contents :
Where UTF - 8 is replaced with the character encoding you want to use and .html is a file extension that this will be applied to .
This character encoding will then be set for any file directly in or in the subdirectories of directory you place this file in .
If you 're feeling particularly courageous , you can use :
... which changes the character set Apache adds to any document that does n't have any Content - Type parameters .
This directive , which the default configuration file sets to iso - 8859 - 1 for security reasons , is probably why your headers mismatch with the META tag .
If you would prefer Apache not to be butting in on your character encodings , you can tell it not to send anything at all :
AddDefaultCharset Off
... making your internal charset declaration ( usually the META tags ) the sole source of character encoding information .
In these cases , it is especially important to make sure you have valid META tags on your pages and all the text before them is ASCII .
These directives can also be placed in httpd .conf file for Apache , but in most shared hosting situations you wo n't be able to edit this file .
File extensions
If you 're not allowed to use .htaccess files , you can often piggy - back off of Apache 's default AddCharset declarations to get your files in the proper extension .
Here are Apache 's default character set declarations :
Charset File extension(s ) ISO - 8859-1 .iso8859-1 .latin1 ISO -8859-2 .iso8859-2 .latin2 .cen ISO - 8859-3 .iso8859-3 .latin3 ISO -8859-4 .iso8859-4 .latin4 ISO -8859-5 .iso8859-5 .latin5 .cyr .iso-ru ISO - 8859-6 .iso8859-6 .latin6 .arb ISO - 8859-7 .iso8859-7 .latin7 .grk ISO - 8859-8 .iso8859-8 .latin8 .heb ISO - 8859-9 .iso8859-9 .latin9 .trk ISO - 2022 -JP .iso2022 -jp .jis ISO - 2022-KR .iso2022-kr .kis ISO - 2022-CN .iso2022-cn .cis Big5 .
Big5 .big5 .b5 WINDOWS - 1251 .cp-1251 .win-1251 CP866 .cp866 KOI8 -r .koi8 -r .koi8 - ru KOI8 - ru .koi8 -uk .ua ISO - 10646-UCS -2 .ucs2 ISO -10646-UCS -4 .ucs4 UTF - 8 .utf8 GB2312 .gb2312 .gb utf -7 .utf7 EUC -TW .euc-tw EUC -JP .euc -jp EUC-KR .euc - kr shift_jis .sjis
So , for example , a file named page .utf8.html or page.html.utf8 will probably be sent with the UTF - 8 charset attached , the difference being that if there is an AddCharset charset .html declaration , it will override the .utf8 extension in page.utf8.html ( precedence moves from right to left ) .
By default , Apache has no such declaration .
Microsoft IIS
If anyone can contribute information on how to configure Microsoft IIS to change character encodings , I 'd be grateful .
XML
META tags are the most common source of embedded encodings , but they can also come from somewhere else : XML Declarations .
They look like :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?>
... and are most often found in XML documents ( including XHTML ) .
For XHTML , this XML Declaration theoretically overrides the META tag .
In reality , this happens only when the XHTML is actually served as legit XML and not HTML , which is almost always never due to Internet Explorer 's lack of support for application / xhtml+xml ( even though doing so is often argued to be good practice and is required by the XHTML 1.1 specification ) .
For XML , however , this XML Declaration is extremely important .
Since most webservers are not configured to send charsets for .xml files , this is the only thing a parser has to go on .
Furthermore , the default for XML files is UTF - 8 , which often butts heads with more common ISO - 8859 - 1 encoding ( you see this in garbled RSS feeds ) .
In short , if you use XHTML and have gone through the trouble of adding the XML Declaration , make sure it jives with your META tags ( which should only be present if served in text / html ) and HTTP headers .
Inside the process
This section is not required reading , but may answer some of your questions on what 's going on in all this character encoding hocus pocus .
If you 're interested in moving on to the next phase , skip this section .
A logical question that follows all of our wheeling and dealing with multiple sources of character encodings is " Why are there so many options ? "
To answer this question , we have to turn back our definition of character encodings : they allow a program to interpret bytes into human - readable characters .
Thus , a chicken - egg problem : a character encoding is necessary to interpret the text of a document .
A META tag is in the text of a document .
The META tag gives the character encoding .
How can we determine the contents of a META tag , inside the text , if we do n't know it 's character encoding ?
And how do we figure out the character encoding , if we do n't know the contents of the META tag ?
Fortunately for us , the characters we need to write the META are in ASCII , which is pretty much universal over every character encoding that is in common use today .
So , all the web - browser has to do is parse all the way down until it gets to the Content - Type tag , extract the character encoding tag , then re-parse the document according to this new information .
Obviously this is complicated , so browsers prefer the simpler and more efficient solution : get the character encoding from a somewhere other than the document itself , i.e. the HTTP headers , much to the chagrin of HTML authors who can't set these headers .
Why UTF -8 ?
So , you 've gone through all the trouble of ensuring that your server and embedded characters all line up properly and are present .
Good job : at this point , you could quit and rest easy knowing that your pages are not vulnerable to character encoding style XSS attacks .
However , just as having a character encoding is better than having no character encoding at all , having UTF - 8 as your character encoding is better than having some other random character encoding , and the next step is to convert to UTF - 8 .
But why ?
Internationalization
Many software projects , at one point or another , suddenly realize that they should be supporting more than one language .
Even regular usage in one language sometimes requires the occasional special character that , without surprise , is not available in your character set .
Sometimes developers get around this by adding support for multiple encodings : when using Chinese , use Big5 , when using Japanese , use Shift - JIS , when using Greek , etc .
Other times , they use character references with great zeal .
UTF - 8 , however , obviates the need for any of these complicated measures .
After getting the system to use UTF - 8 and adjusting for sources that are outside the hand of the browser ( more on this later ) , UTF - 8 just works .
You can use it for any language , even many languages at once , you do n't have to worry about managing multiple encodings , you do n't have to use those user - unfriendly entities .
User-friendly
Websites encoded in Latin - 1 ( ISO - 8859 - 1 ) which occasionally need a special character outside of their scope often will use a character entity reference to achieve the desired effect .
For instance , θ can be written θ , regardless of the character encoding 's support of Greek letters .
This works nicely for limited use of special characters , but say you wanted this sentence of Chinese text : 激光 , 這兩個字是甚麼意思 .
The ampersand encoded version would look like this :
激光 , 這兩個字是甚麼意 思
Extremely inconvenient for those of us who actually know what character entities are , totally unintelligible to poor users who do n't !
Even the slightly more user - friendly , " intelligible " character entities like θ will leave users who are uninterested in learning HTML scratching their heads .
On the other hand , if they see θ in an edit box , they 'll know that it 's a special character , and treat it accordingly , even if they do n't know how to write that character themselves .
Wikipedia is a great case study for an application that originally used ISO - 8859 - 1 but switched to UTF - 8 when it became far to cumbersome to support foreign languages .
Bots will now actually go through articles and convert character entities to their corresponding real characters for the sake of user - friendliness and searchability .
See Meta 's page on special characters for more details .
Forms
While we 're on the tack of users , how do non-UTF - 8 web forms deal with characters that are outside of their character set ?
Rather than discuss what UTF - 8 does right , we 're going to show what could go wrong if you did n't use UTF - 8 and people tried to use characters outside of your character encoding .
The troubles are large , extensive , and extremely difficult to fix ( or , at least , difficult enough that if you had the time and resources to invest in doing the fix , you would be probably better off migrating to UTF - 8 ) .
There are two types of form submission : application / x- www - form - urlencoded which is used for GET and by default for POST , and multipart / form - data which may be used by POST , and is required when you want to upload files .
The following is a summarization of notes from FORM submission and i18n .
That document contains lots of useful information , but is written in a rambly manner , so here I try to get right to the point .
( Note : the original has disappeared off the web , so I am linking to the Web Archive copy . )
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
This is the Content - Type that GET requests must use , and POST requests use by default .
It involves the ubiquitous percent encoding format that looks something like : % C3%86 .
There is no official way of determining the character encoding of such a request , since the percent encoding operates on a byte level , so it is usually assumed that it is the same as the encoding the page containing the form was submitted in .
( RFC 3986 recommends that textual identifiers be translated to UTF - 8 ; however , browser compliance is spotty . )
You 'll run into very few problems if you only use characters in the character encoding you chose .
However , once you start adding characters outside of your encoding ( and this is a lot more common than you may think : take curly " smart " quotes from Microsoft as an example ) , a whole manner of strange things start to happen .
Depending on the browser you 're using , they might :
Replace the unsupported characters with useless question marks ,
Attempt to fix the characters ( example : smart quotes to regular quotes ) ,
Replace the character with a character entity reference , or
Send it anyway as a different character encoding mixed in with the original encoding ( usually Windows - 1252 rather than iso - 8859 - 1 or UTF - 8 interspersed in 8 - bit )
To properly guard against these behaviors , you 'd have to sniff out the browser agent , compile a database of different behaviors , and take appropriate conversion action against the string ( disregarding a spate of extremely mysterious , random and devastating bugs Internet Explorer manifests every once in a while ) .
Or you could use UTF - 8 and rest easy knowing that none of this could possibly happen since UTF - 8 supports every character .
multipart / form-data
Multipart form submission takes away a lot of the ambiguity that percent - encoding had : the server now can explicitly ask for certain encodings , and the client can explicitly tell the server during the form submission what encoding the fields are in .
There are two ways you go with this functionality : leave it unset and have the browser send in the same encoding as the page , or set it to UTF - 8 and then do another conversion server - side .
Each method has deficiencies , especially the former .
If you tell the browser to send the form in the same encoding as the page , you still have the trouble of what to do with characters that are outside of the character encoding 's range .
The behavior , once again , varies : Firefox 2.0 converts them to character entity references while Internet Explorer 7.0 mangles them beyond intelligibility .
For serious internationalization purposes , this is not an option .
The other possibility is to set Accept - Encoding to UTF - 8 , which begs the question :
Why are n't you using UTF - 8 for everything then ?
This route is more palatable , but there 's a notable caveat : your data will come in as UTF - 8 , so you will have to explicitly convert it into your favored local character encoding .
I object to this approach on idealogical grounds : you 're digging yourself deeper into the hole when you could have been converting to UTF - 8 instead .
And , of course , you can't use this method for GET requests .
Well supported
Almost every modern browser in the wild today has full UTF - 8 and Unicode support : the number of troublesome cases can be counted with the fingers of one hand , and these browsers usually have trouble with other character encodings too .
Problems users usually encounter stem from the lack of appropriate fonts to display the characters ( once again , this applies to all character encodings and HTML entities ) or Internet Explorer 's lack of intelligent font picking ( which can be worked around ) .
We will go into more detail about how to deal with edge cases in the browser world in the Migration section , but rest assured that converting to UTF - 8 , if done correctly , will not result in users hounding you about broken pages .
HTML Purifier
And finally , we get to HTML Purifier .
HTML Purifier is built to deal with UTF - 8 : any indications otherwise are the result of an encoder that converts text from your preferred encoding to UTF - 8 , and back again .
HTML Purifier never touches anything else , and leaves it up to the module iconv to do the dirty work .
This approach , however , is not perfect .
iconv is blithely unaware of HTML character entities .
HTML Purifier , in order to protect against sophisticated escaping schemes , normalizes all character and numeric entity references before processing the text .
This leads to one important ramification :
Any character that is not supported by the target character set , regardless of whether or not it is in the form of a character entity reference or a raw character , will be silently ignored .
Example of this principle at work : say you have θ in your HTML , but the output is in Latin - 1 ( which , understandably , does not understand Greek ) , the following process will occur ( assuming you 've set the encoding correctly using % Core.
Encoding ) :
The Encoder will transform the text from ISO 8859 - 1 to UTF - 8 ( note that theta is preserved here since it does n't actually use any non-ASCII characters ) : θ
will transform the text from ISO 8859 - 1 to UTF - 8 ( note that theta is preserved here since it does n't actually use any non-ASCII characters ) :
The EntityParser will transform all named and numeric character entities to their corresponding raw UTF - 8 equivalents : θ
will transform all named and numeric character entities to their corresponding raw UTF - 8 equivalents : HTML Purifier processes the code : θ
The Encoder now transforms the text back from UTF - 8 to ISO 8859 - 1 . Since Greek is not supported by ISO 8859 - 1 , it will be either ignored or replaced with a question mark : ?
This behaviour is quite unsatisfactory .
It is a deal - breaker for international applications , and it can be mildly annoying for the provincial soul who occasionally needs a special character .
Since 1.4.0 , HTML Purifier has provided a slightly more palatable workaround using % Core.EscapeNonASCIICharacters .
The process now looks like :
The Encoder transforms encoding to UTF - 8 : θ
transforms encoding to UTF - 8 : The EntityParser transforms entities : θ
transforms entities : HTML Purifier processes the code : θ
The Encoder replaces all non-ASCII characters with numeric entity reference : θ
replaces all non-ASCII characters with numeric entity reference :
For good measure , Encoder transforms encoding back to original ( which is strictly unnecessary for 99 % of encodings out there ) : θ ( remember , it 's all ASCII ! )
... which means that this is only good for an occasional foray into the land of Unicode characters , and is totally unacceptable for Chinese or Japanese texts .
The even bigger kicker is that , supposing the input encoding was actually ISO - 8859 - 7 , which does support theta , the character would get converted into a character entity reference anyway !
( The Encoder does not discriminate ) .
The current functionality is about where HTML Purifier will be for the rest of eternity .
HTML Purifier could attempt to preserve the original form of the character references so that they could be substituted back in , only the DOM extension kills them off irreversibly .
HTML Purifier could also attempt to be smart and only convert non-ASCII characters that were n't supported by the target encoding , but that would require reimplementing iconv with HTML awareness , something I will not do .
So there : either it 's UTF - 8 or crippled international support .
Your pick !
( and I 'm not being sarcastic here : some people could care less about other languages ) .
Migrate to UTF -8
So , you 've decided to bite the bullet , and want to migrate to UTF - 8 .
Note that this is not for the faint - hearted , and you should expect the process to take longer than you think it will take .
The general idea is that you convert all existing text to UTF - 8 , and then you set all the headers and META tags we discussed earlier to UTF - 8 .
There are many ways going about doing this : you could write a conversion script that runs through the database and re-encodes everything as UTF - 8 or you could do the conversion on the fly when someone reads the page .
The details depend on your system , but I will cover some of the more subtle points of migration that may trip you up .
Configuring your database
Most modern databases , the most prominent open - source ones being MySQL 4.1 + and PostgreSQL , support character encodings .
If you 're switching to UTF - 8 , logically speaking , you 'd want to make sure your database knows about the change too .
There are some caveats though :
Legit method
Standardization in terms of SQL syntax for specifying character encodings is notoriously spotty .
Refer to your respective database 's documentation on how to do this properly .
For MySQL , ALTER will magically perform the character encoding conversion for you .
However , you have to make sure that the text inside the column is what is says it is : if you had put Shift - JIS in an ISO 8859 - 1 column , MySQL will irreversibly mangle the text when you try to convert it to UTF - 8 .
You 'll have to convert it to a binary field , convert it to a Shift - JIS field ( the real encoding ) , and then finally to UTF - 8 .
Many a website had pages irreversibly mangled because they did n't realize that they'd been deluding themselves about the character encoding all along ; do n't become the next victim .
For PostgreSQL , there appears to be no direct way to change the encoding of a database ( as of 8.2 ) .
You will have to dump the data , and then reimport it into a new table .
Make sure that your client encoding is set properly : this is how PostgreSQL knows to perform an encoding conversion .
Many times , you will be also asked about the " collation " of the new column .
Collation is how a DBMS sorts text , like ordering B , C and A into A , B and C ( the problem gets surprisingly complicated when you get to languages like Thai and Japanese ) .
If in doubt , going with the default setting is usually a safe bet .
Once the conversion is all said and done , you still have to remember to set the client encoding ( your encoding ) properly on each database connection using SET NAMES ( which is standard SQL and is usually supported ) .
Binary
Due to the aforementioned compatibility issues , a more interoperable way of storing UTF - 8 text is to stuff it in a binary datatype .
CHAR becomes BINARY , VARCHAR becomes VARBINARY and TEXT becomes BLOB .
Doing so can save you some huge headaches :
The syntax for binary data types is very portable ,
MySQL 4.0 has no support for character encodings , so if you want to support it you have to use binary ,
MySQL , as of 5.1 , has no support for four byte UTF - 8 characters , which represent characters beyond the basic multilingual plane , and
You will never have to worry about your DBMS being too smart and attempting to convert your text when you do n't want it to .
MediaWiki , a very prominent international application , uses binary fields for storing their data because of point three .
There are drawbacks , of course :
Database tools like PHPMy Admin wo n't be able to offer you inline text editing , since it is declared as binary ,
It 's not semantically correct : it 's really text not binary ( lying to the database ) ,
Unless you use the not -very - portable wizardry mentioned above , you have to change the encoding yourself ( usually , you 'd do it on the fly ) , and
You will not have collation .
Choose based on your circumstances .
Text editor
For more flat - file oriented systems , you will often be tasked with converting reams of existing text and HTML files into UTF - 8 , as well as making sure that all new files uploaded are properly encoded .
Once again , I can only point vaguely in the right direction for converting your existing files : make sure you backup , make sure you use iconv( ) , and make sure you know what the original character encoding of the files is ( or are , depending on the tidiness of your system ) .
However , I can proffer more specific advice on the subject of text editors .
Many text editors have notoriously spotty Unicode support .
To find out how your editor is doing , you can check out this list or Wikipedia 's list .
I personally use Notepad ++ , which works like a charm when it comes to UTF - 8 .
Usually , you will have to explicitly tell the editor through some dialogue ( usually Save as or Format ) what encoding you want it to use .
An editor will often offer " Unicode " as a method of saving , which is ambiguous .
Make sure you know whether or not they really mean UTF - 8 or UTF - 16 ( which is another flavor of Unicode ) .
The two things to look out for are whether or not the editor supports font mixing ( multiple fonts in one document ) and whether or not it adds a BOM .
Font mixing is important because fonts rarely have support for every language known to mankind : in order to be flexible , an editor must be able to take a little from here and a little from there , otherwise all your Chinese characters will come as nice boxes .
We 'll discuss BOM below .
Byte Order Mark ( headers already sent ! )
The BOM , or Byte Order Mark , is a magical , invisible character placed at the beginning of UTF - 8 files to tell people what the encoding is and what the endianness of the text is .
It is also unnecessary .
Because it 's invisible , it often catches people by surprise when it starts doing things it should n't be doing .
For example , this PHP file :
BOM <? php header ( ' Location : index.php ' ) ; ?>
... will fail with the all too familiar Headers already sent PHP error .
And because the BOM is invisible , this culprit will go unnoticed .
My suggestion is to only use ASCII in PHP pages , but if you must , make sure the page is saved WITHOUT the BOM .
The headers the error is referring to are HTTP headers , which are sent to the browser before any HTML to tell it various information .
The moment any regular text ( and yes , a BOM counts as ordinary text ) is output , the headers must be sent , and you are not allowed to send anymore .
Thus , the error .
If you are reading in text files to insert into the middle of another page , it is strongly advised ( but not strictly necessary ) that you replace out the UTF - 8 byte sequence for BOM " \xEF\xBB\xBF " before inserting it in , via :
$ text = str_replace ( " \xEF\xBB\xBF " , '' , $ text ) ;
Fonts
Generally speaking , people who are having trouble with fonts fall into two categories :
Those who want to use an extremely obscure language for which there is very little support even among native speakers of the language , and
Those where the primary language of the text is well - supported but there are occasional characters that are n't supported .
Yes , there 's always a chance where an English user happens across a Sinhalese website and does n't have the right font .
But an English user who happens not to have the right fonts probably has no business reading Sinhalese anyway .
So we 'll deal with the other two edge cases .
Obscure scripts
If you run a Bengali website , you may get comments from users who would like to read your website but get heaps of question marks or other meaningless characters .
Fixing this problem requires the installation of a font or language pack which is often highly dependent on what the language is .
Here is an example of such a help file for the Bengali language ; I am sure there are others out there too .
You just have to point users to the appropriate help file .
Occasional use
A prime example of when you 'll see some very obscure Unicode characters embedded in what otherwise would be very bland ASCII are letters of the International Phonetic Alphabet ( IPA ) , use to designate pronunciations in a very standard manner ( you probably see them all the time in your dictionary ) .
Your average font probably wo n't have support for all of the IPA characters like ʘ ( bilabial click ) or ʒ ( voiced postalveolar fricative ) .
So what 's a poor browser to do ?
Font mix !
Smart browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer 7 will borrow glyphs from other fonts in order to make sure that all the characters display properly .
But what happens when the browser is n't smart and happens to be the most widely used browser in the entire world ?
Microsoft IE 6 is not smart enough to borrow from other fonts when a character is n't present , so more often than not you 'll be slapped with a nice big � .
To get things to work , MSIE 6 needs a little nudge .
You could configure it to use a different font to render the text , but you can achieve the same effect by selectively changing the font for blocks of special characters to known good Unicode fonts .
Fortunately , the folks over at Wikipedia have already done all the heavy lifting for you .
Get the CSS from the horses mouth here : Common.css , and search for " . IPA " There are also a smattering of other classes you can use for other purposes , check out this page for more details .
For you lazy ones , this should work :
. Unicode { font - family : Code2000 , " TITUS Cyberbit Basic " , " Doulos SIL " , " Chrysanthi Unicode " , " Bitstream Cyberbit " , " Bitstream CyberBase " , Thryomanes , Gentium , GentiumAlt , " Lucida Grande " , " Arial Unicode MS " , " Microsoft Sans Serif " , " Lucida Sans Unicode " ; font - family /**/:inherit ; /* resets fonts for everyone but IE6 */ }
The standard usage goes along the lines of < span class = " Unicode " > Crazy Unicode stuff here </ span > .
Characters in the Windows Glyph List usually do n't need to be fixed , but for anything else you probably want to play it safe .
Unless , of course , you do n't care about IE6 users .
Dealing with variable width in functions
When people claim that PHP6 will solve all our Unicode problems , they 're misinformed .
It will not fix any of the aforementioned troubles .
It will , however , fix the problem we are about to discuss : processing UTF - 8 text in PHP .
PHP ( as of PHP5 ) is blithely unaware of the existence of UTF - 8 ( with a few notable exceptions ) .
Sometimes , this will cause problems , other times , this wo n't .
So far , we 've avoided discussing the architecture of UTF - 8 , so , we must first ask , what is UTF - 8 ?
Yes , it supports Unicode , and yes , it is variable width .
Other traits :
Every character 's byte sequence is unique and will never be found inside the byte sequence of another character ,
UTF - 8 may use up to four bytes to encode a character ,
UTF - 8 text must be checked for well - formedness ,
Pure ASCII is also valid UTF - 8 , and
Binary sorting will sort UTF - 8 in the same order as Unicode .
Each of these traits affect different domains of text processing in different ways .
It is beyond the scope of this document to explain what precisely these implications are .
PHPWact provides a very good reference document on what to expect from each function , although coverage is spotty in some areas .
Their more general notes on character sets are also worth looking at for information on UTF - 8 .
Some rules of thumb when dealing with Unicode text :
Do not EVER use functions that : ... convert case ( strtolower , strtoupper , ucfirst , ucwords ) ... claim to be case - insensitive ( str_ireplace , stristr , strcasecmp )
Think twice before using functions that : ... count characters ( strlen will return bytes , not characters ; str_split and word_wrap may corrupt ) ... convert characters to entity references ( UTF - 8 does n't need entities ) ... do very complex string processing ( * printf )
Note : this list applies to UTF - 8 encoded text only : if you have a string that you are 100 % sure is ASCII , be my guest and use strtolower ( HTML Purifier uses this function . )
Regardless , always think in bytes , not characters .
If you use strpos ( ) to find the position of a character , it will be in bytes , but this usually wo n't matter since substr ( ) also operates with byte indices !
You 'll also need to make sure your UTF - 8 is well - formed and will probably need replacements for some of these functions .
I recommend using Harry Fuecks ' PHP UTF - 8 library , rather than use mb_string directly .

Several Chinese journalists have said in recent days that officials from the central government told their news organizations not to continue reporting on the issue of unsafe schools .
Here in Dujiangyan , the police and soldiers have cordoned off the sites of collapsed schools and are turning reporters away .
The protest on Tuesday morning took place outside a five - story courthouse on a wide boulevard in central Dujiangyan .
It was organized by parents who lost their children in the collapse of Juyuan Middle School , in a suburb .
Most of the school ’s 900 students were killed in a deluge of bricks and concrete , even though buildings around the school remained largely intact .
Rescue workers and soldiers scoured the rubble for days afterward , but few survivors were pulled out .
Calls seeking comment on Tuesday ’s protest , made to the courthouse , petition office and city government headquarters here , were not answered .
Government intimidation of the parents organizing the protest began as early as the previous night , Ms. Li , a participant in the protest , said in an interview .
Ms. Li , who lost a 14 - year - old daughter in the Juyuan collapse , agreed to speak on the condition that only her last name be used , for fear of government retribution .
Officials in Juyuan visited with seven leaders among the parents on Monday night and persuaded six of them not to attend the Tuesday rally , Ms. Li said .
The visits came after parents carried out a protest earlier that day demanding that Juyuan officials apologize for not pushing rescue workers to keep searching for the bodies of children classified as missing .
But the protest took place anyway .
It started at 8 a.m .
When the parents reached the courthouse , they were confronted by police officers in black caps and uniforms .
A handful of reporters who were on the scene were taken by the police into the courthouse against their will , according to Ms. Li and a firsthand account by a reporter for The Associated Press .

The WHOIS is here .
When you think of all the ways an astrophysicist might make life easier , you probably think of things like cold fusion and extraterrestrial colonization .
But Jason Steffen , a postdoctoral fellow at Fermilab Center for Particle Astrophysics , has more earthly aims .
He wants to make getting on an airplane less of a hassle .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
His idea :
Have 10 passengers at a time board in alternating rows .
He says it 's at least four times faster than what most airlines are doing because it lets everyone stow their luggage and take their seats without getting in one another 's way .
People get seated sooner , which means planes take off sooner .
And that means it will get a lot of attention from the airlines — planes only make money when they 're in the air , as they are able to take off and land more flights on a given day .
" It 's no secret that efficiency , productivity and high utilization are keys to any successful airline , " said Steve Lott of the International Air Transport Association , which represents 240 airlines .
" There will be many airlines and operational people interested in reading his study . "
An airliner typically spends 30 to 60 minutes or more on the ground , and airline executives spend a lot of time thinking about boarding efficiency because it's the best way to reduce that wasted time .
A 1998 Boeing study found that the boarding rate has fallen more than 50 percent since 1970 to as little as nine people per minute .
Steffen was boarding a flight out of Seattle at about that pace a few years ago .
As he crept down the jetway , he wondered why getting on a plane takes so damn long .
He mulled it over for 18 months and finally resolved to solve the problem or quit obsessing over it .
He wrote a program using C++ and a sampling algorithm to model boarding behavior and started crunching numbers .
His results will appear in the Journal of Air Transport Management , which is n't high on Steffen 's reading list , but is popular with airline bosses .
Modeling and common sense said filling a plane from front to back is the worst way to go because everyone 's waiting for the people in front of them to sit down .
That 's why most airlines fill planes from back to front .
But Steffen was surprised to find that such a method does n't save much time .
It fills the plane in a hurry , but no one 's got room to stash their stuff .
You spend 15 minutes standing in the aisle while the woman in 17A fumbles through her backpack for her headphones , the guy in 22D struggles to get his suitcase into the overhead bin and the kids in row 14 argue over the window seat .
That 's why it takes 25 minutes or more to fill a plane .
Give people enough room to get their bags stashed and you really speed things up .
So how much room do people need ?
Steffen 's simulations found that boarding is most efficient when you give them two rows of space to stash their stuff .
On a plane with 20 rows , that means having no more than 10 people boarding simultaneously ( a 40 - row plane can handle 20 people ) , filling every other row down one side of the plane — 1A , 3A , 5A and so on — then the other .
Try to get any more than that aboard and things start slowing down quickly .
" The most people I modeled was 240 people , " Steffen said , " and it was eight times faster than boarding from front to back and four to five times faster than back to front . "
That may be , but not everyone will want to hopscotch down the plane .
People traveling together usually sit together and want to board together , and an airline 's not going to risk ticking off customers no matter how much time it might save .
No problem , Steffen said .
Fill the even - numbered rows first , alternating from the left side of the plane to the right .
Repeat the process for the odd - numbered rows .
" It 's twice as slow as the optimal method , " he said , " but it 's twice as fast as the back - to - front method . "
Steffen is undoubtedly the first astrophysicist to study boarding efficiency , but US Airways and other airlines have made a science out of it .
They 've developed boarding schemes with names like " rotating zone " and " reverse pyramid , " often with good results .
But Steffen says his idea is two to three times faster than even these less conventional methods .
( US Airways officials could not be reached for comment . )
Lott is n't so sure .
The fastest way to fill a puddle - jumper with 19 seats may not work on a jumbo jet with room for 550 , and even the best algorithms can't simulate the behavior of several dozen hurried passengers struggling with suitcases , laptops , backpacks and kids .
" That said , " he added , " any airline that is continually trying to be more efficient would be open to proposals , whether they 're from inside the industry or outside the industry . "
Steffen is ready to show the industry what he 's found , and eager to do some real - world testing .
But no one in the industry has called .
He is n't surprised .
" When they come across a problem , " he said , " I do n't think their first thought is , Let 's go talk to an astrophysicist .
Oh look — here 's one that 's studied extra-solar planets .
He 's our guy ! "

Singulus Technologies mentioned that Blu-ray is being adopted much faster than DVD in its period , 11 years ago .
The statement came after the company received orders for producing 21 Blu-ray dual - layer machines only during this year 's first quarter .
" This means that the orders for Blu-ray in the first year of the dual layer technology already by far exceeded the volume at the start of the DVD eleven years ago with 17 machines , " commented Stefan Baustert , the Chief Financial Officer of Singulus Technologies .
The German producer of optical disk equipment and world 's only provider of such services as mastering , molding and replication states that there were additional orders of Blu-ray dual - player machines in this year 's first quarter and that for the first time the customers from the United States had accepted one of such machines .
It is worth mentioning that for several years there was a struggle between Blu-ray and HD - DVD formats .
The dispute came to an end when Hollywood studio Warner Bros. decided to work only with the Blu-ray format .

Digging Movie from Phoenix's Sol 18
The Surface Stereo Imager on NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander recorded the images combined into this movie of the lander 's Robotic Arm enlarging and combining the two trenches informally named " Dodo " ( left ) and " Goldilocks .
"
The 21 images in this sequence were taken over a period of about 2 hours during Phoenix 's Sol 18 ( June 13 , 2008 ) , or the 18th Martian day since landing .
The main purpose of the Sol 18 dig was to dig deeper for learning the depth of a hard underlying layer .
A bright layer , possibly ice , was increasingly exposed as the digging progressed .
Further digging and scraping in the combined Dodo - Goldilocks trench was planned for subsequent sols .
The combined trench is about 20 centimeters ( about 8 inches ) wide .
The depth at the end of the Sol 18 digging is 5 to 6 centimeters ( about 2 inches ) .
The Goldilocks trench was the source of soil samples " Baby Bear " and " Mama Bear , " which were collected on earlier sols and delivered to instruments on the lander deck .
The Dodo trench was originally dug for practice in collecting and depositing soil samples .
The Phoenix Mission is led by the University of Arizona , Tucson , on behalf of NASA .
Project management of the mission is by NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
Spacecraft development is by Lockheed Martin Space Systems , Denver .

Verdict
Click to enlargeIf there were a Survivor : The Mini-Notebook series , and each of the ultra - low - cost notebooks were incrementally eliminated , the MSI Wind NB would be the one left standing .
Unlike its competitors , the Wind NB offers the complete package , including an adult - size keyboard , a larger 10 - inch screen , and a very capable Atom processor .
This system 's solid performance , stellar 5 - plus hours of battery life , and $ 549.99 price make it the best all - around mini-notebook to date .
More on the MSI Wind NB
Complete MSI Wind Guide : News , Reviews , and Tips
Impressive Endurance
Thanks to its low - power processor and its six - cell battery , the Wind NB has a lot of steam ( a version of the Wind is available with a 3 - cell battery for $ 499.99 ) .
Right on target with MSI 's estimate , using Mobile Mark 2007 , we managed to get 5 hours and 30 minutes of juice out of the battery with the Wi-Fi turned off .
Wewere unableto run Mobile Mark 2007 withWi-Fion , but in untimed , casual use while writing this review , our reviewer noted that the system lasted " well overfour hours . "
Update : A few weeks after initial publication of this review , we got the MSI Wind back and installed a new Web surfing script that visits a series of popular Web sites with the browser cache turned off .
Using the Wi-Fi on surfing test , the Wind NB lasted an impressive 5:13 .
The original Wi-Fi on estimate of " well over four hours " should be discounted , because it wasbased on casual observations ( no one used a timing mechanism ) , not a timed test .
In all instances , it was a pleasure not to reach for the AC adapter ; we took the system to a Starbucks for an afternoon without fearing that we would need to recharge .
The Wind NB 's 802.11 b/g Wi-Fi connected easily to our WPA - protected access point .
From 15 feet away , the radio managed 14.5 Mbps , and 7.7 Mbps from 50 feet away .
By way of comparison , the HP Mini-Note ( running XP ) fared better zipping along at 16.7 Mbps at 15 feet and 10.6 Mbps at 50 feet .
Nevertheless ,
Web pages loaded quickly on our office network ; NYTimes.com loaded in 5 seconds , and we had no problem streaming video from Hulu.com .
An episode of Family Guy had minimal video pauses and audio skips .
Software and Warranty
The Wind NB comes preinstalled with Windows XP Home Edition , though a SUSE Linux version of the system will be available for $ 399 .
The system is also packaged with MSI 's webcam software .
MSI backs this mini-notebook with a one - year warranty but offers tech support only from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. ( PST ) Monday through Thursday , and 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. ( PST ) Friday .
Unfortunately , the call is n't toll - free .
It is also worth noting that , according to MSI , while the Wind NB can support up to 2GB of RAM , performing this upgrade yourself voids the warranty .
Atomic Performance
Click to enlargeThe MSI Wind NB is one of the first mini-notebooks powered by Intel 's Atom processor -- the smallest and lowest - power 45 - nanometer processor to date .
This 1.6 - GHz CPU , along with 1GB of RAM , helped the Wind NB outperform other systems in its class .
Programs loaded quickly even when we had several others running in the background .
We could listen to music , have a videoconference with a friend , surf the Web , and write this review in OpenOffice Writer all at the same time with no hang - ups .
Although the Wind NB forgoes a solid state drive for a 5,400 - rpm 80 GB hard disk , we were n't disappointed with its performance .
The system booted in a quick 34 seconds ( see for your yourself below ) and packs plenty more space than a solid state drive would for files and applications .
[ flq:dc5d382d2e394038a32835de7107abd1 ]
The Wind NB notched a 72 on MobileMark 2007 , which is better than the score of 39 that the Fujitsu LifeBook U810 notched ( powered by Intel 's 800 - MHz A110 processor ) .
In fact , the Wind NB is nearly as fast as some traditional ultraportable notebooks ; for example , the 11 - inchASUS U2E ( equipped with a 1.06 - GHz Intel Core 2 Duo ) turned in a MobileMark score of 98 .
We would n't recommend the Wind NB for 3D gamers , but this mini-notebook 's graphics performance is certainly better than the competition .
It garnered a 3DMark03 score of 606 , which is 226 points above the HP 2133 Mini-Note ( with Vista ) .
The system even handled the graphics - intensive Second Life - - whereas other mini-notebooks have n't been able to run the program .
When playing City of Heroes , we were able to clock a decent 15 frames per second , albeit at the lowest possible settings .
An Overclocking CPU with TurboDrive
The Wind NB includes a TurboDrive button ( activated by pressing Fn+F10 ) , which overclocks the system 's CPU by as much as 20 percent .
When the TurboDrive is turned on and the system is plugged in , an orange icon flashes in the corner of the screen and the power button changes from blue to orange .
Running a CPU Speed Professional test with the TurboDrive turned on , the CPU clocked in at 1.9 GHz .
When the system is running off its battery , the TurboDrive reduces the CPU 's clock speed around 50 percent and dims the screen to extend battery life ; the CPU clocked in at 1.1 GHz with this setting on .
When we overclocked it to 1.9 GHz , our 3DMark03 test jumped from 606 to 746 .
And when we tried our same multitasking ( video conferencing , listening to music , surfing the Web ) , we noticed smoother performance .
Second Life also paused less , and loading images in the 3D world 's distance took less time .
Roomy Keyboard , Small Touchpad
Click to enlarge
The Wind NB 's keyboard layout is pretty close to full size , and the matte keys offered a good amount of springy feedback when typing .
The HP Mini-Note offers slightly larger keys , especially the Shift and Enter keys , and the keys are treated with a protective coating to prevent wear and tear .
Nevertheless , touch typists should have no problems using the Wind NB for extended periods .
Measuring 2.0 x 1.7 inches , the trackpad on the Wind NB is disappointingly small , requiring more movement than we would like .
The mouse button , a single bar that serves as a left and right click control , is also less than ideal .
It lacks a divot to separate the buttons , feels mushy , and requires a firm press .
We would prefer two dedicated buttons with more tactile response , but this arrangement is still better than the vertically oriented touchpad buttons on the HP Mini-Note .
Large Display , Decent Speakers
Click to enlarge
The larger and roomier 10 - inch display found on the Wind NB breaks from the typical 7 - or 8.9 - inch mini-notebook mold .
The matte display with a native 1024 x 600 - pixel resolution is much easier on the eyes ;
Web pages fit to size on the screen and required no horizontal scrolling .
We were impressed when we watched The Big Lebowski on Hulu ; The Dude ( Jeff Bridges ) looked extremely clear , and we saw every detail of his shaggy , unkempt hair .
Vertical viewing angles were decent ; tilting the screen did n't cause much of a glare .
However , horizontal angles were poor ; watching the movie with another person was a struggle , so you may want to think twice about loading up the Wind NB with some flicks and handing it to the kids for road trips .
On the plus side , we did n't notice any motion blur , which is typical of other systems this size .
Click to enlarge
The integrated 1.3 - megapixel webcam worked well in a Skype video chat , and our caller was impressed with the quality compared with the HP Mini-Note 2133 and the Eee PC .
The microphone , which is located to the right of the webcam , picked up a bit of background noise , and our caller complained about not being able to hear us ; plugging in a headset solved the problem -- we spoke to a contact across the country for 20 minutes without a hiccup .
The speakers , located on the bottom of the system , produce a loud and steady sound ; we heard Lauryn Hill 's " If I Ruled The World " clearly from 7 feet away .
In order to achieve their diminutive size , weight , and price , most mini-notebooks come with compromises : the screen or keyboard is too small , the processor is too slow , or the battery life is too short .
That 's why the MSI Wind U100 is a breath of fresh air .
This 2.6 - pound system boasts a relatively large 10 - inch screen and a full - size keyboard and Intel 's zippy new 1.6 - GHz Atom processor ( overclockable with a touch of a button ) .
Plus , the MSI Wind NB lasts more than 5 hours on a charge .

Simple , Easy - to - Tote Design
The Wind NB sports a minimalist white design ( also available in black and pink ) with rounded edges .
Similar to the white ASUS Eee PC , this system 's lid features a low - luster finish that we are happy to report is resistant to fingerprint smudges .
Measuring 10.2 x 7.1 x 0.7 inches and weighing just under 3 pounds , the Wind NB 's footprint is a tad bulkier than theASUS Eee PC 900 as a result of its larger 10 - inch screen .
On the other hand , when we set it next to the very sleekLenovo IdeaPad U110 ( $ 1,899 ) , the Wind NB looked just a hair smaller , which really puts the size - to - price ratio in perspective .
The system easily fit in an oversized handbag and slim briefcase .
At 3.4 pounds with the AC adapter ( 2.6 without ) , it was hardly noticeable .
The right side of the Wind NB houses one USB port , a 4 - in - 1 memory card reader , mic and headphone jacks , a VGA port , and an Ethernet jack .
Two additional USB ports and the power jack line the left side .
Unlike theHP Mini-Note , the Wind NB lacks an ExpressCard slot for adding a mobile broadband modem card , but you can always use a compact USB modem .

New horizon : what we can expect as nature changes
Artificial life forms , robots that mimic natural processes , and even people who spend all day in front of the computer and rarely experience the real outdoors , may all fundamentally affect the quality of nature in Britain over the next 45 years .
According to 35 environmental scientists , drawn from the government as well as colleges and charities , a host of new threats and opportunities for UK biodiversity is gathering pace as technologies develop , social habits alter and the possibility of large - scale responses to phenomena like climate change grows .
The scientists have drawn up a list of 25 factors , including the rising demand for food and biofuels , thought to be having an immediate effect .
These , say the scientists , are already putting worse pressure on the habitats of birds and mammals .
Others factors , such as sea - level rise , extra fire risk and extreme weather events , are looming with climate change .
But many more challenges , identified in the " horizon - scanning " report , come from what now appears science fiction .
Environmental manipulation could be a quick - fix way to mitigate climate change , scientists say .
Putting trillions of lenses in orbit to deflect the sun 's energy , building giant mirrors in space , fertilising oceans with iron filings and laying reflective covers on deserts , have all been suggested , says the paper in the British Ecological Society 's Journal of Applied Ecology .
The paper 's authors do not try to judge the ideas or even predict any follow - up .
However , they say the public reaction to GM food , in particular , has taught them to look ahead to what society is likely to consider important .
Bill Sutherland , lead author and chair in conservation biology at Cambridge University , said studies were needed in emerging areas .
" We need to have the science ready before policies are made and products are on the market ... the necessary science was not done before the introduction of biofuels .
In terms of the environmental consequences and societal concerns , we should have thought of all these things before . "
High on the list of new technologies that may profoundly affect nature are revolutionary nanotechnology processes involving minute particles .
These also have biological properties and the scientists think it will be a huge challenge to predict their impact .
One potentially positive development could be large - scale restoration of habitats to encourage wildlife seen as iconic .
In a Dutch experiment , a 13,800 - acre reserve was created with populations of animals that were common in medieval times .
The paper says comparable schemes are likely to occur in places such as East Anglia and the Scottish Highlands where creatures such as the lynx might be introduced .
The paper 's authors are concerned about new pathogens , from overseas or developed through biotechnology .
" A series of fungal pathogens have devastated north American forests .
One has recently appeared in the UK and could have similar impacts on native woodlands , " says the paper .
" New pathogens [ affecting ] people and livestock are likely to become established in the UK in future as climate change allows them to survive .
But this could increase the use of insecticides .
If , for instance , malaria established itself in Britain because of climate change , widespread drainage of wetlands and ponds could be recommended . "
Other human factors are also acknowledged .
Were bird flu or rabies to get established in British wildlife , the authors say , public attitudes to biodiversity might alter profoundly .
" This could lead to reduced political and financial support for conservation , and higher rates of killing wildlife . "
Equally , while the internet informs , there is a danger that sedentary lives will erode engagement with nature and care for the environment .
" Young people spend about half the time outdoors compared to 20 years ago .
This leads to a fall in knowledge of biodiversity . "
Key issues
· Politics : policies may be unable to keep pace with the environmental changes of the future
· Extreme weather : local wildlife extinctions are likely
· More food demand : habitat loss and intensification of farming
· New genetically modified pathogens : likely reduction of
critical species
· Sea level rise : some new habitats , but great damage from salt
· River flow : climate change will greatly alter river ecology
· More biofuels : possibly more pesticides , loss of habitat
· Increased fire risk : some new habitats , but big potential impact
· Invasions : alien species can move in from abroad
· Nanotechnologies : can help with pollution cleanup but could be toxic
· Artificial lifeforms and bio-robots : possibly invasive
· Renewable energy : new safe havens , but also damage possible
· Internet : no substitute for people experiencing nature for themselves
Warren Buffett is quoted saying that his favorite holding period for a stock is " forever " .
I 'm not ready to go quite that far - and in practice neither does he - but I do subscribe to a long term investing philosophy generally .
For example , I bought my first MSFT shares back in the early 90's .
Like most holders that decade , I did very well .
Then came this one , which has been an absolute disaster .
It 's sobering to realize that during Ballmer 's term as CEO , MSFT has underperformed almost all of its top tech peers ( including AAPL , IBM , HPQ , SAP , INTC , CSCO , SYMC , NOK , ORCL , ADBE , RIMM , QCOM , Ebay , and AMZN ) , and badly lagged the major averages .
We may even see our third plunge to test the 2000 lows during his watch .
Unbelievable .
There may be another major technology CEO with an equivalent or worse track record who is still in power , but a name does n't come readily to mind .
Indeed , it ’s instructive to note the four companies who did n’t make my list above : DELL , YHOO , Sony and Sun .
In other words , four well - publicized flameouts / turnaround stories ( depending on your perspective ) , all of which have new CEOs .
Go figure .
That performance record would be embarrassing enough on its own , but it comes in spite of going through an unprecedented amount of our cash on buybacks ( nearly $ 43 billion worth in just the past three fiscal years ) and other schemes that were supposed to drive the stock .
It 's also despite spending more on R&D than virtually anyone in the industry , and more than GOOG and AAPL combined ( nearly $ 20 billion in the past three fiscal years alone ) .
Meanwhile MSFT 's senior leadership have collectively been paid billions over this period , while leading the industry in insider selling every year ( net of purchases , almost 350 million shares sold over just the past 5 years ) .
You are expected to be patient and wait for returns over the " long term " ( still undefined , but has already exceeded 10 years - think Jim Carrey in Ace Ventura and “ If I am not back in 5 minutes …. just wait longer ” . ) , but they want their return up front .
Against that backdrop , it should come as no surprise that a shareholder was recently driven to write about " Microsoft - A Decade of Gross Corporate Negligence and Destroyed Shareholder Value . "
It ’s a good read , and kudos to Bishop for publishing it – that probably did n’t earn him any brownie points with management .
FakeSteveJobs ( aka Dan Lyons of Forbes ) also said something worth reading here :
There 's something really scary in the voices here .
It 's in the tone .
You know what I 'm hearing ?
It 's disgust .
Nobody comes out and says it , but these guys are fed up with Microsoft .
They 're not even angry .
They 're just fed up .
They 've had it .
They stuck by the company during the DOJ trial and the antitrust mess , because hey , what investor does n't love a monopoly .
The guys on Wall Street do n't care if you lie , or cheat , or bully your rivals -- as long as you 're winning , and making money , and as long as the stock keeps going up .
What they wo n't stand for is fuck - ups .
Incompetence .
Mistakes .
And the Borg has been nothing but fuck - ups for what -- three years ?
Listening to these investor dudes talk I 'm reminded of a time in the late 1980s when Wall Street guys began ranting about Digital Equipment Corp .
For years DEC had been their darling .
Ken Olsen walked on water .
But suddenly Ken Olsen was a doofus , an idiot .
The company which once had been so powerful and so admired almost overnight came to be seen as a loser that could n't adapt and change .
His site is offered as humor , obviously , but he often weaves in good insight .
That ’s an example , imo .
Certainly , there has been another major negative sentiment shift since the YHOO offer and the latest quarterly results .
I 've been a shareholder for a long time and I have never seen the stock as weak as it has been these past months .
Down some ~ 14 % more than the market on the year , fifth worst DOW 30 performer YTD , and trading at [ just ] 14.8 x forward earnings .
Looking at the chart , the uptrend line from February has been obliterated , and major support has been broken as well .
We ’re seeing a little relative strength these past few days , but even that looks tenuous .
Some readers may be surprised that I was initially a Ballmer supporter .
Not for CEO necessarily ( I felt that he and Gates should have resigned after losing the DOJ case ) , but generally .
I admired his tenacity and positive outlook .
I still do .
I 'm even happy to give him credit operationally where it 's deserved .
For example , a good job has been done against traditional competitors in legacy markets ( with the exception of Apple ) .
On balance , after a rocky start and some noteworthy exceptions ( e.g. Firefox ) , he has done a decent job of responding to the newer threat posed by free and open source software .
Broadening MSFT 's worldwide presence with foreign R&D centers is another positive on his watch , though the company is still too Redmond - centric .
The addition of ERP / CRM made sense , though it ’s been botched badly imo .
Maybe in the fullness of MSFT - time ( i.e. decades ) it will live up to its potential .
Gaming , well … I guess you could credibly say that it has been the only source of “ cool ” .
It has also contributed to revenue growth , which overall has been solid under Ballmer ( though the company was n’t exactly on life - support when he took over ) .
On the personal side , I respect him for not bailing on his shares to the degree that say Bill has ( the latter will be out of the stock completely within 10 years based on his current pace of selling ) .
And I admire his work ethic .
He may well be the world 's hardest - working billionaire .
Also , the most passionate .
My concern is whether or not the company has been effective under his leadership .
Rightly or wrongly , the buck stops with the CEO .
And when I look at the totality of MSFT ’s performance under his reign , it 's not a pretty picture .
In fact , it 's an epic fail .
There are too many issues to mention , but let ’s review some of the real lowlights :
Losing the DOJ and EU cases , which has resulted in $ 10 B ’s in fines and ( more importantly ) permanently damaged MSFT 's reputation .
Failing to aggressively leverage MSFT 's cash horde buying promising companies at the bottom of the dotbomb for pennies on the dollar ( btw , not 20:20 hindsight on my part – I posted that MSFT should do this in real - time back then ) .
The Longhorn clusterf !*k .
The long - term damage of which continues to this day , will never be fully quantifiable , really began the process of confidence erosion in both the management team and company more generally , and may prove to be a decisive turning point from which the company never recovers .
Allowing Xbox to dig a $ 6B hole in the ground .
The " emerging bets " which collectively have been a bust .
Allowing IE to stagnate after risking the company and paying $ B ’s in fines primarily to beat Netscape and become the browser leader .
The major opportunities that were missed while leadership was otherwise preoccupied / distracted ( Search , Advertising , Web 2.0 / SaaS , etc. ) .
Losing digital media to AAPL .
The financially - retarded one - time dividend and the ongoing stock buyback games .
The sorry performance of the stock ( which has resulted in part from all of the above ) .
Current management tell us that the company is “ stronger and better positioned today ” than it was in 2000 .
They may even believe that , but the market clearly does n't .
And available facts support an alternate conclusion .
Some examples :
1 ) " Vista is a success " .
Reality :
Management can claim it “ sold ” 150 M licenses and call that “ success ” .
But in virtually every other way – versus expectations , given a ridiculous 5 year gestation period and reported $ 5 - $ 6 B price tag , media reaction , corporate adoption , FPP retail sales , the company ’s own expectations , and most important the competitive need – it ’s a disappointment .
Leadership are also blasé about the future implications that this underwhelming release may represent .
I ’m not .
How many who have downgraded to XP - a significant number by all reports – will be harder to sell to next time ?
How many have switched or will consider switching to a competitor as a result ?
How many OEMs are pissed off and will now embrace other options like Acer is doing with Linux , or make comments like this from Intel ’s Ottelini ?
And what about current impact ?
Windows marketshare , while still above 90 % , has fallen to its lowest level ever .
And others , particularly AAPL , have been steadily gaining share .
More importantly , MSFT has arguably ceded undisputed technical leadership in desktop OSes - the core of what the company does - to Apple .
It pretty hard to underscore how much of a strategic blunder that is .
The hope here is that Windows 7 will be the must - have product that Vista was n’t , and the company is busy touting that promise regardless .
While I ’m optimistic that Sinofsky will prove more effective than his predecessor , and actually support the cone - of - silence approach he ’s getting crucified for in the media currently , he does n’t have carte blanche to make major changes - or five years to do it in - like Allchin did .
I ’ve long argued that MSFT needs to dump some backwards compatibility and come to market with a leaner OS to have any chance of keeping up with OS X and Linux .
It should have been done with Vista , at least for a consumer version which could act as a showcase for innovation ( assuming any was forthcoming ) .
But that ’s not in the cards on this iteration .
So Sinofsky is going to have to focus on a few new killer features , addressing some of the major issues that still plague the Vista code base on which it will be riding , and perhaps work on the fit and finish that was so sloppy in Vista ( inexcusable given the development timeframe ) .
Bottom line ?
“ Success ” for Windows 7 will be stopping share erosion at whatever level it has dropped to by then .
See two additional pieces here :
“ The inescapable conclusion ” of the survey , he writes , is that “ support for Vista has been battered across all enterprise sizes and corporate constituencies . ”
He finds that “ the Vista cycle looks likely to be materially less robust than indicated in our prior survey . ”
Until now , I 've been advising Vista fence - sitters to wait for Windows 7 .
However , last week 's " big reveal , " in which Microsoft finally confessed that Windows 7 will be nothing more than " Vista warmed over , " has forced me to reconsider my position .
I 'm now more convinced than ever that Windows is doomed - at least on the enterprise desktop .
2 ) " We have a solid strategy in Online " .
Reality :
MSFT 's Online efforts have been a disaster .
Indeed , the company 's performance has been the worst of the four major players - and they all managed to turn a profit versus lose billions .
It has become clear the plan has n't worked -- which is the main reason Microsoft tried to buy its way into competitiveness by acquiring Yahoo , a deal that died May 3 , when Microsoft withdrew its bid for the Internet company .
WSJ May 17 , 2008
More bad news here :
3 ) " We are winning this generation of gaming " .
Reality :
Xbox , while more successful than Online on a comparative basis , has been a financial sinkhole of epic proportions .
More than twenty billion dollars “ invested ” over nearly a decade , not to mention countless amounts of management ’s time and “ talent ” , for what ?
If it was n’t for creative accounting this fiscal , Xbox would still be unprofitable some 6 - 7 years and $ 6B - $ 7B in losses later .
Speaking of the warranty charge that was retroactively buried into a previous fiscal , here ’s a report on what was really to blame .
Short form : to save perhaps $ 10 M ’s , MSFT designed the graphics chip in - house rather than using an outside expert – eventually resulting in the $ 1B + warranty / recall charge .
Smart .
And remember that hasty and breathless PR release a few weeks ago about being “ first to reach 10 M units in the US ” and this metric historically determining the winner ?
Well , that was because Nintendo was set to reach that figure and surpass MSFT a few weeks later .
Bottom line , in all likelihood MSFT will finish this console round dead last of three :
4 ) " We can reach 40 % share in smartphones " .
Reality :
Microsoft has been pursuing mobile in some form or other for nearly a decade .
The result ?
A distant 3rd to 5th place depending on whose figures you use .
And while there has been better success in the smartphone sub-segment , Apple has surpassed MSFT there in less than one year , at least for North America ( MSFT still holds a lead worldwide , though I will be surprised if that holds up through 2010 ) .
And with the $ 500M Danger acquisition , we can assume that Mobile would join the stable of unprofitable MSFT “ investments ” if costs actually got apportioned properly .
Unfortunately they do n’t ( gotta love those inter - group transfers and that convenient “ Corporate Activity ” slop bucket for everything else ) , and MSFT does n’t break out the detail for Mobile anymore regardless ( or ERP / CRM ) .
More here :
Considering this set of competitors , I do n't think Microsoft has a snowball 's chance in hell of reaching 40 % of the global market for smartphones .
Not in four years , not ever .
5 ) “ We have the best browser ”
Reality :
I ’m not sure what leadership means by best .
Fastest ?
Not on most benchmarks I ’ve seen .
Most standard ?
No , although the team is at least trying to catch up .
Smallest / fastest install ?
Um , no .
Best mobile experience ?
Not according to most reviewers .
While I ’m on it , how did AAPL get to market with a better mobile browser than Microsoft , the browser leader ?
Additionally , why has n’t Microsoft bought and incorporated IE7 Pro – the must have add - on for IE ?
Right now , the average IE user has to do without this functionality or , if they hear about IE7 Pro and go to download it , they get prompted to select GOOG as their search engine .
Brilliant .
Meanwhile , Firefox closes in on 20 % share .
6 ) “ Zune is succeeding ”
Reality :
Okay , you get the picture .
I wo n’t go into detail on all of the rest like IPTV ( 10 years , $ 10B invested , still no material return ) , etc .
What do you think current perception of MSFT would be like if :
Vista had been the must - have upgrade it should have been ?
The company had embraced the internet and led the move to SaaS versus resisting both ?
Online had managed to at least turn a profit , if not hold share ?
Xbox was leading this round of gaming and was actually profitable versus just creatively so ?
Windows Mobile had generated even half the excitement that the iPhone has ?
Do you think that maybe the annual P/E chart would n’t show this clear downtrend , which keeps negating the positive impact on share price that otherwise might be expected from what little earnings gains have occurred ?:
Meanwhile , look at some other critically important metrics :
Efficiency :
Back in 2000 , MSFT was one of the industry leaders in both revenue and profit per employee .
Now look .
While it ’s still above average in income , revenue per employee is actually below the S&P average .
Compare that to AAPL , who matches the S&P figure for revenue / employee – and they do n’t have the leverage of the OEM model that MSFT does .
Brand :
When you trail IBM , you know you have a problem .
Marketing :
As I ’ve noted before , Microsoft ’s marketing is an embarrassment .
Their PR is too , but that ’s another matter .
Perhaps the most glaring example of this is the failure to respond to Apple ’s PC / Mac TV ads , something that Gates denied is having a negative impact as recently as the D conference a few weeks ago .
Huh ?
Earth to Bill , come in .
This is the same company that wants to be a leader in advertising , right ?
And the one spending $ 300 million to makeover its image ?
" Nobody messes with anyone in the tech industry the way Apple has messed with Microsoft , " says Enderle .
" It 's the first time I 've ever seen a major national campaign that disparages a competitor , and the competitor just sits back and takes it .
If somebody tried to do that to Oracle , you would n't be able to find the body . "
Help may be on the way , but why did it take so long ?
Why has the company allowed AAPL to effectively define MSFT ’s own brand in a negative fashion ?
Why was it Lenovo , not MSFT , who came up with a smart counter ad ?
How come MSFT ’s Vista marketing team has n’t been able to come up with something compelling like this ( albeit a little rough ) , even though Robert McLaws was able to do so by simply offering readers of his blog a chance to win a PC ?
Conclusion :
Like many , I have been holding out hope that MSFT would gets its act together .
In the first two fiscal quarters that looked like it might be happening .
But then the wheels came off the wagon and it ’s been down hill ever since .
I ’m not just talking about the ill - advised and poorly handled YHOO bid .
I think a lot of folks , myself included , reassessed after Q3 and wondered how others ( AAPL , GOOG , less so HPQ , etc. ) have been able to sustain successive growth and earnings surprises for years in some cases on the back of modest R&D expenditures and new product / service offerings , and yet the largest R&D spend and product line up in MSFT 's history was n't able to deliver even three consecutive quarters of the same .
As a stock , MSFT is done - stick a fork in it .
And not just past and present , which has seen the terrible performance mentioned and is the reason , for example , that the QQQQ underweights MSFT in favor of overweighting AAPL and others ( despite its mandate to track the index ) .
I mean moving forward .
If you want dividends , there are far better plays .
And if want equity appreciation instead , make a list of MSFT ’s top competitors , throw a dart at it , and invest in whoever you hit .
More rationally , buy the index or one of the technology - specific ETFs .
Either way , you ’ll likely do much better over the next 5 years and have less volatility .
As a company , MSFT will obviously continue on for some time .
But I will be surprised if 3 - 5 years from now ( maximum ) , growth in the cash cows has n’t come to a screeching halt and the company has n’t been forced to layoff at least 10 % of its employees .
All of this assumes Ballmer is still at the helm of course , which sadly is a good bet :
Do n’t misunderstand , he is n’t the source of all that ’s wrong .
But he is the enabler that allows it to continue ( with the acquiescence of our do nothing Board of Directors ) .
So under a Ballmer - led administration , expect more of the same .
Specifically , a general lack of accountability and urgency within the senior management ranks , a myopic strategic focus on protecting the cash cows while paradoxically paying inadequate attention to the actual products themselves , a related failure to spot new trends and get out in front of them ( invariably resulting in a desperate , expensive , and often unsuccessful attempt to play catch up later ) , a staggering annual R&D spend that produces lots of research papers but a shockingly small number of promising technologies and even fewer successful new products , variable execution that runs from great to poor but is on average weak , a marketing effort that is simply atrocious , a bunch of very expensive " investments " that have best - case paybacks measured in decades and appear to be almost totally focused on driving revenue not income , and of course the ever - present maniacal focus on the latest competitor du jour , whose market the company currently covets or feels threatened by .
Meanwhile , OSS , AAPL , and others , will continue chipping away at the legacy cash cows , gaining share and driving down margins even where share is retained .
So in addition to continued PE compression , there ’s a good chance that “ E ” itself may start to decline as well .
So it 's time for me to listen to the fat lady who has been singing for years now , and finally pull the plug .
I can't keep waiting another 11 years for MSFT 's leadership to deliver the returns that say AAPL's have in just the past 12 months , despite struggling ( and that 's on top of 2000 + % this decade ) .
I 'm also increasingly concerned that under this leadership team the long - term flatline will eventually be resolved to the downside versus the up , with all the implications for additional shareholder value destruction that implies .
As one pundit summarized it :
In short , I think the market sees Microsoft losing its grip on computer users and having nothing to take its place when those users start leaving .
Jack 's right that they have n't started leaving in droves yet , but the market is a forward looking mechanism and senses that at Microsoft there 's a greater chance of ramping down than ramping up .
So with that , I announce the end of my MSFTextrememakeover blogging career .
The timing seems right as this is my 100th post .
Good luck to all those who continue to hold MSFT .
I also wish the very best to MSFT 's employees , especially folks like Mini-Microsoft , Dare Obasanjo , and others who have pushed for change from the bottom up at some considerable risk to their careers .
Ditto folks on product teams like Live Writer , etc. who somehow managed to get something great out the door despite the obvious organizational dysfunction .
Finally , thanks to media folks like Todd Bishop , David Hunter , and others who cited me from time to time and got others to read my input for whatever it was worth - which apparently was n't much .
Anyway , best wishes to all .
Extreme out .

Kenny Chesney and John Rich Give Local Bands a Break
Music reality shows like Nashville Star , Gone Country , Can you Duet and GAC Star are popular right now .
According to country music starsandthere is room for a couple more and they 're just the two guys to make it happen .
Kenny is calling his show The Big Star Competition .
Local bands will try out to open for Chesney 's show .
Kenny is taking the local approach and looking for opening acts to perform during his 2008 Poets & Pirates Tour .
There will be several talent contests where bands can audition .
The finale will put one of those bands in a tour bus for a week and they will open at his shows in St. Louis , Indianapolis and Tulsa .
The winner will also get $ 25,000 and a chance to audition for Sony BMG Nashville executives .
John Rich has a different idea with his show Get Rich , a talent search held at the Nashville club 12th & Porter .
John is partnering up with Charlie Pennachio to look over submissions and choose 10 acts to perform monthly in front of a panel of judges .
Each monthly winner will get $ 300 and a chance to be on the next month 's show .
Rich had this to say :
Anytime I see an artist out there struggling and I can do something to help them , why would n't I do that ?
The bigger the business gets , the better it is for everybody .
I take personal satisfaction in knowing that I had a hand in helping other people 's careers . "
It sounds like a golden opportunity for some small town bands to get a shot at the big time .
This phenomenon seems to be widespread .
Many non- vegetarians have formed their own opinions about what is " not meat , " usually assuming chicken and fish are somehow suitable for vegetarians .
However , I found myself in a related but altogether stranger situation at one point .
My friend Scott knew that I had had a bad day ; I had slept through a test that morning and then somehow lost a contact lens , so he made it his mission to cheer me up .
" Pizza , Kool - Aid , and movies , " he declared , and I made my way to his little apartment .
I was surprised , then , to hear him on the phone ordering only a pizza with pepperoni .
After he asked for pepperoni , he hesitated and then asked the order - taker to hold for a moment .
" Do you like pepperoni ? " he asked , not seeing anything wrong with this .
I gave him a look and said , " I'm a vegetarian , you ASSHOLE , " and he replied " Oh , right " and went back to the phone .
" I 'm sorry , " he told the order - taker .
" Could I change the pepperoni to sausage instead ?
Thanks . "
I listened , thinking maybe he would order a separate pizza for me but just too disbelieving to inform him that sausage was also inappropriate .
He did not order anything else , just thanked the order - taker and hung up .
When he got off the phone , I gave him the strangest look I 've probably ever attained in my life , and said , " Um , did you hear what I said ? "
" What you said when ? "
" Just now , while you were on the phone , regarding the pepperoni . "
" YES , you said ' I 'm a vegetarian , you asshole , ' so that 's why I had them take OFF the pepperoni and put SAUSAGE instead ! "
( Exasperated ) " Sausage is MEAT ! "
( Oh - my - god - you 're - stupid look ) " No it ISN'T . "
At this point it was impossible not to break out into hysterical laughter .
He continued .
" Sausage is a plant , it 's a vegetable !
I 've seen it in those tube things , those are definitely vegetables . "
" NO , Scott , those are pig guts .
That 's even the same animal pepperoni comes from . "
After contradicting me a few times , he realized I was actually SERIOUS about sausage being meat , and began apologizing profusely .
I pretty much just drank Kool - Aid that night , but I think my night was brightened up better than if pizza had actually been acquired .
In other news , I told many of his friends about this incident and he still has not managed to live it down .
Why Does Erlang Have Weird Syntax ?
I ’ve heard the argument many times .
People “ do n’t like Erlang ’s syntax so [ they ] do n’t like Erlang . ”
I , for instance , did n’t understand the block terminator syntax when I was first learning Erlang , so I asked Yariv Sadan about it :
Erlang syntax came from Prolog .
The ‘ end ’ keyword is used to end code blocks that are contained inside the body of a function , and the ‘.’ symbol is used to close top - level function definitions .
— Yariv Sadan
But what is the purpose of such a strange syntax ?
Is Erlang ’s syntax really that weird or is it the single - assignment semantics which people do n’t like ?
Erlang ’s SAS derives from the functional programming paradigm which begs the real question : “ Why is Erlang a functional language ? ”
The answer in a nutshell :
To attain more language features , like message passing in Erlang ’s case , the language incurs some overhead so efficiency gains must be made to compensate .
It ’s the same concept behind data structures :
In order to know more about data , semantic restrictions can be imposed .
In this case , the data is the program source itself and the imposed restriction is data immutability .
Erlang ’s data immutability can be split into two levels : intra-process variable immutability and inter-process data isolation .
Why Does n’t Erlang Have Share Data ?
Concurrency is obviously the justification for Erlang ’s isolation memory model , with the alternative being locking to synchronize destructive shared data operations .
Lock complexity makes scaling hard because locks are n’t composable and are unassociated with the shared data .
If data isolation is enforced between concurrent components ( what Erlang calls processes ) , composibility can be maintained because destructive shared data modifications do not occur .
Composability , or building instructions with instructions , is an inherent concept of programming and it ’s why sequential programs are desirable .
This example excerpt from an older java.lang .
StringBuffer class illustrates a common locking misconception .
The author wanted to compose the length and getChars calls into one atomic operation to ensure critical data would n’t be modified between them .
The author attempted to compose the calls by wrapping them in a synchronized method which locks this , not sb .
Unfortunately , another thread could still modify sb in between the calls .
public final class StringBuffer { public synchronized StringBuffer append ( StringBuffer sb ) { int len = sb.length ( ) ; ... // other threads may change sb.length ( ) , ... // so len does not reflect the length of sb sb.getChars ( 0 , len , value , count ) ; ... } public synchronized int length ( ) { ... } public synchronized void getChars ( ... ) { ... } ... }
Software transactions and message passing are fundamentally better synchronization abstractions than locks because of , among other things , composibility and accuracy , at the cost of greater overhead .
STM can be built from message passing and I consider both to be acceptable replacements for lock based synchronization .
Why Does Erlang Have Data Immutability ?
It seems that intra-process data isolation would be enough for a clean synchronization scheme , yet this is not entirely true .
The immutable shared data model can be made even more complete when applied at the local sequential data level to achieve even more benefits :
Immutability efficiency gains compensate for message passing overhead .
Immutability of data can , in many cases , lead to execution efficiency in allowing the compiler to make assumptions that are unsafe in an imperative language .
— Wikipedia
To reiterate what I said earlier , the restriction of data immutability allows the compiler to know more about the program and as a result , regain some efficiency .
Immutability simplifies type policies for message passing .
In Scala , [ an OOP language with message passing , ] you can send between actors pointers to mutable objects .
This is the classic recipe for race conditions , and it leaves you just where you started : having to ensure synchronized access to shared memory .
— Yariv Sadan
To expand on the type policy issue a bit more , it ’s simpler to make all data immutable , both local and shared .
This reduces the need for special cases intended to disallow sending pointers , or data structures containing pointers , through message passing .
This congruency keeps message passing at the core of Erlang ’s semantic focus .
Immutability makes Garbage Collection simpler , faster , and soft real - time .
The generational [ Erlang ] collector is simpler than in some languages , because there ’s no way to have an older generation pointing to data in a younger generation ( remember , you ca n’t destructively modify a list or tuple in Erlang ) .
— James Hague Again , more restrictions means different ways of efficiency gains .
Downsides to Erlang ’s Non-destructive Memory Model
Many common algorithms are designed with destructive memory in mind .
As a result , Erlang does n’t have some of the same types of data structures and libraries as imperative languages .
This , combined with the confusion of learning a completely new programming paradigm , can be a large deterrent for learning functional languages .
But what libraries Erlang lacks is largely made up for by an extensive actor based library platform .
Virtually all “ big ” Erlang libraries use Erlang ’s features concurrency and fault tolerance .
In the Erlang ecosystem , you can get web servers , database connection pools , XMPP servers , database servers , all of which use Erlang ’s lightweight concurrency , fault tolerance , etc .
— Yariv Sadan
Erlang is clearly a domain specific language , focusing on problems that can be solved with parallelism .
Erlang ’s libraries favor this same domain and Erlang holds its own against even C in the targeted many - thread / process arena .
Note : the “ thread - ring ” test on the last line of the chart :
An Erlang web server was also compared to Apache as another more practical comparison ( again , intentionally a problem in Erlang ’s domain ) .
“ Apache dies at about 4,000 parallel sessions .
Yaws is still functioning at over 80,000 parallel connections . ”
So , Erlang may be hard to use because of its lack of conventional libraries or its different syntax , but as I ’ve hopefully shown , the differences were chosen by design with good reason .
Erlang is clearly one of the strongest languages in its parallelism domain and after a little over 20 years , is a very mature language .

Everything I 've ever wanted to know , I 've learned from scifi movies — especially when it comes to surviving the end of days .
Be it a vengeful Mother Nature , plague , monsters , animal packs or the undead , any kind of doomsday , I 'll be ready for .
The key is to follow the steps of past scifi characters ( or learn from their mistakes . )

Never Go Through A Tunnel
It seems like a quick and easy way out , but dark and scary passageways usually house bad things that you do n't want to bother with in the middle of fleeing for your life .
It 's simple : tunnels=death , for at least one person in the group .
This is a tried and true fact of apocalyptic movies .
Take for example the idiot drivers who decided to take the tunnel in Independence Day , toasted via fire ball ( except for the ones who had that dog , but more on that later ) .
Also who could forget the night vision moments in Cloverfield walking through New York 's subway system .
Avoid tunnels at all costs .

Do Not Join A Theme Gang
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
With the world ending , there will be many sad sacks who will try and recreate a Mad Max road warrior gang .
Resist the urge to join anything theme - oriented .
Basic rule of thumb : if you look like an idiot with a face tattoo or a fool running around in Medieval garb , you 're going to get the sharp end of the death stick .
Doomsday spelled this out pretty clearly : everyone who looked ridiculous got a ridiculous ending .
Motorcycle gangs count too , do n't forget even Romero's Dawn of the Dead leather riders got their just rewards for their hideous outfits and bad attitudes .
Stick to the rag - tag refugee look , or lone wolf army motif .
If you have to join a gang , stay in the back and never do anything you might later regret — like eat people .
Do Not Go Back For Loved Ones

If the world is ending , you may feel the need to find love ones that are in Princeton , a New York Library or a high rise apartment .
This is a bad idea .
Let go of your emotions and assume that everyone else in the world is dead , or trying to steal your food supplies .
Going after loved ones almost always means your own death or the death of someone in the group .
Look at it this way , it your loved one has survived and you meet up with them , bonus for you .
But most likely they died from the plague , zombies , earthquake flood or whatever .
Never Be The First
I can't believe this even has to be said but no , do not go exploring in rooms , attic , caves , hallways or apartments where you are the first one in the door .
My favorite character from Resident Evil Extinction , L.J. , got bit by a zombie lady because he was checking out all the rooms to make sure it was safe .
Let someone else do this , get a job as a medic or cook .
There is no need for you to be first to go anywhere — let someone else do the exploring .
If they find something really good , you can kill them and take it anyway .
Bring Your Pet

If you do n't have a pet , I suggest you go to the pet store and steal one , looter style , or take care of your dead neighbors ' .
You may need this pet to help you keep your sanity or sacrifice its life for you , like in I Am Legend .
Either way , animals are good luck when the chips are down for humans .
You never know when a pair of love birds will come in handy to calm down a flock of murderous seagulls and crows .
The same rule sometimes applies to children , but you will have to feed them considerably more .

Never trust the government , especially when the world is ending .
It 's a terrible idea , they would rather nuke the whole place than deal with people .
If you see the military , run the other way or hide .
Do not do what they say .
The friendly people of Hollywood followed the advice of the government from Right At Your Door , and what happened to them ?
Same with the people of Raccoon City , from Resident Evil Apocalypse .
Granted an ex-military person hell - bent on sticking it to the man can be a wonderful asset during the end of the world , just be sure to know the difference between the two .
Do n't Barricade Yourself In
It always seems like a good idea , but 9 times out of 10 whatever you 're trying to keep out gets in and now you 're trapped .
Think of the mess it caused for the cute little family in the beginning of28 Weeks Later and Shaun of the Dead .
I say build a sky city in the trees .

Apache上 でRuby on Railsアプリケーションを動かす ／Passenger ( mod_rails for Apache ) の利用
この文書は内容が古くなっています。 インストール ページで新しい文書を探してください。
Redmine等 のRuby on Railsアプリケーション を" Phusion Passenger ( mod_rails for Apache ) " : http://www.modrails.com/ を利用してApache上で稼働させる手順を説明します。
運用の簡素化、複数インスタンスを並列稼働させることによるレスポンスの改善が期待できます。
インストールの流れは次の通り。
gem install passenger passenger - install - apache2 - module httpd.confの変更
Railsアプリケーションを実行するためのApacheモジュールです。
Apache単独でRailsアプリケーションを実行可能です。Apacheのモジュールとして実装されており、別途デーモンを起動する必要がありません。tcpポートも使いません。
Railsアプリケーションのデプロイが簡単になります。ファイルをアップロードするだけ。ほぼPHP感覚です。
サーバのメモリを節約できます。Railsインスタンスは必要なタイミングで生成します。また、一定時間アクセスがなければインスタンスを終了させます。
Apacheを起動すれば即Railsアプリケーションを利用できます。Railsアプリケーション用の起動スクリプトは不要です。
tcpポートを消費しません。複数のRailsアプリケーション動かすときも、ポート番号がぶつからないように気を使う必要がありません。
サーバのメモリを有効利用できます。Passengerは必要に応じてインスタンスを生成し一定時間アクセスがなければ終了させるので、メモリを有効に使えます。
一定時間アクセスが無 いRailsインスタンスを終了させるということは、時々アプリケーションの再起動が行うのと同様の効果があります。アプリケーションによっては安定性向上が期待できます。
gemでインストールできます。
gem install passenger
passenger -install -apache2-moduleを実行し、Apacheモジュールのビルドとインストールを行います。

Compiling and installing Apache 2 module …
cd /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-1.0.1
rake clean apache2
( in /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-1.0.1 )
（中略）
The Apache 2 module was successfully installed .
Please edit your Apache configuration file , and add these lines :
LoadModule passenger_module
/usr / lib/ruby / gems/1.8/gems/passenger-1.0.1/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so RailsSpawnServer
/usr / lib/ruby / gems/1.8/gems/passenger-1.0.1/bin/passenger-spawn-server
RailsRuby /usr/ bin/ruby1.8
After you restart Apache , you are ready to deploy any number of Ruby on Rails
applications on Apache , without any further Ruby on Rails - specific
configuration !
Press ENTER to continue .
ビルドに成功すると 、Passengerを組み込むためのhttpd.confの設定が表示されるのでコピーしておく。
Enterキーを押して次へ進む。virtualhostの設定のサンプルが表示される。
--------------------------------------------
Deploying a Ruby on Rails application : an example Suppose you have a Ruby on Rails application in / somewhere .
Add a virtual host to your Apache configuration file , and set its DocumentRoot to / somewhere / public , like this : < VirtualHost *:80 > ServerName www.yourhost.com DocumentRoot / somewhere / public </ VirtualHost >
And that 's it !

passenger - install -apache2-moduleの最終段階の画面
で" Please edit your Apache configuration file , and add these lines : " という指示とともにhttpd.confに追加すべき設定内容が表示されますので、httpd.confを修正します。
httpd.conf :
LoadModule passenger_module
/usr / lib/ruby / gems/1.8/gems/passenger-1.0.1/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
RailsSpawnServer
/usr / lib/ruby / gems/1.8/gems/passenger-1.0.1/bin/passenger-spawn-server
RailsRuby /usr / bin/ruby1.8
Passengerを組み込んだApacheではDocumentRootを$RAILS_ROOT/publicに設定すれば、自動的にRailsアプリケーションが認識されます。
例えば、ネームベースバーチャルホスト"redmine.example.jp"
で、/var/lib/rails/redmineにインストールされたRedmineを動かすには次のようにします。
httpd.conf :
< VirtualHost *:80 >
ServerName redmine.example.jp
DocumentRoot / var / lib/ rails / redmine / public
以上で設定は完了です 。Apacheを再起動してください。
Apacheを起動すれば、Railsアプリケーションも利用可能な状態になります。
二つの方法があります。
1. Apacheを再起動
Apacheを再起動することにより、全てのRailsアプリケーションが再起動されます。
2. $ RAILS_ROOT/tmp/restart.txtというファイルを作成
例え ばRailsアプリケーションが/var/lib/rails/redmineにインストールされている場合、/var/lib/rails/redmine/tmp/restart.txtというファイルを作成してください。中身は空でかまいません。restart.txtを作成した後の最初のリクエストの際に、PassengerがRailsアプリケーションを再起動します。再起動が完了するとrestart.txtは削除されます。
この方法は次のメリットがあります。
Apacheそのものの再起動を行わないため、同じApacheで提供している他のサービスに影響を与えません。
サービスの中断がありません。
ファイルを設置するだけなので、シェルアクセスが提供されていなくてもFTPなどでファイルを転送すれば再起動することができます。
特定 のRailsアプリケーションのみを再起動することができます。
サーバ環境や利用頻度にあわせて以下のパラメータの調整を行ってください。
いずれもhttpd.conf中で設定します。なお、これらはApache全体に対する設定であり、バーチャルホストごとの指定はできません。
RailsMaxPoolSize
Apacheサーバ上で生成するRailsのインスタンス数を設定します。
デフォルト値は20ですが、メモリが少ない環境では減らすことを検討してください。アクセスが集中した際にメモリが不足して極端にレスポンスが悪化する恐れがあります。" Passenger Users Guide " : http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide.html
では、メモリ256MBのVPS環境では2、2GBのメモリを搭載したサーバでは30が推奨されています。
RailsPoolIdleTime
Railsインスタンスへのリクエストがこの設定値以上の時間無かった場合に、インスタンスを終了させます。
デフォルト値は120(秒)です。この値が小さすぎると、インスタンスの生成・終了が頻繁に行われることになりレスポンスが悪化します。逆に大きすぎると必要以上に長時間メモリを占有されてしまいます。Passenger
Users Guideでは、ユーザーのwebサイト上の平均滞在時間の2倍を推奨しています。例えば1回のRedmine上での平均的な作業時間が5分の場合、推奨設定値は600(秒)です。
Railsアプリケーションのディレクトリ($ RAILS_ROOT )および$ RAILS_ROOT以下のファイル・ディレクトリのオーナーは、root以外としてください。
Passengerでは、root権限でRailsアプリケーションを動かすことはできません。Railsアプリケーションが動作するユーザーは$RAILS_ROOT/config/environment.rbのオーナーとなりますが、environment.rbがrootの場合はnobodyユーザーで動作します。このとき、オーナーがrootである$RAILS_ROOT/logディレクトリや$RAILS_ROOT/tmpディレクトリに書き込みができず、アプリケーションが動作しないことがあります。

Until next time :)
Giovanni Lanaro was born in Los Angeles , grew up in La Puente , attended Cal State Fullerton , and coaches and trains at Mt. San Antonio College .
Yet , when the torch is lighted during opening ceremonies this summer at the Beijing Olympics , the world ’s sixth - ranked pole vaulter will be with Mexico , not the United States .
“ I will always compete for Mexico , ” said Lanaro , whose mother was born there .
“ I will never compete for any other country . ”
He is hardly alone in choosing to compete for the land of his heritage over the place of his birth -- a growing practice in recent years as the Mexican American population has surged past 28 million , swelling the eligible talent pool that Mexican sports officials have tapped occasionally .
Five of the nine boxers on Mexico ’s national team are from the U.S. , as are a wrestler , a women ’s basketball player and two members of last summer ’s Pan American Games water polo team .
“ My whole family ’s proud .
What ’s wrong with being proud about competing for Mexico ? ” said Lanaro , who has cleared 19 feet this year and is Mexico ’s best hope for a track and field medal in Beijing .
“ I do n’t see anything wrong with it . ”
Others are critical , however , with those in the U.S. arguing that American athletes who compete for Mexico are turning their back on the country that trained them in exchange for an easier path to the Olympics .
And in Mexico , some coaches and athletes have grown tired of “ foreigners ” taking opportunities away from locals .
“ In my opinion , yes , it ’s controversial , a little unethical , ” said German Silva , a two - time Olympian and now a top Mexican distance - running coach .
But it is legal .
In fact , top athletes crossing borders to enhance their Olympic prospects are part of a well - established pattern that involves many nations and events .
Four years ago at Athens , Americans of Greek descent took the field for the host nation ’s baseball team , a Chinese - born table tennis player competed for the United States and a Jamaican woman sprinted for Slovenia .
“ Freedom of choice is one of the values our country stands for , ” said Darryl Seibel , chief communications officer of the U.S. Olympic Committee .
“ And we ’re not going to stand in the way of someone who wants to compete for another country . ”
The U.S. has also benefited from foreign - born athletes changing allegiances : 1,500 - meter runner Bernard Lagat and marathoner Khalid Khannouchi were born in Africa , yet now hold U.S. records .
And national gymnastics champions Nastia Liukin and Alexander Artemev are from the former Soviet Union .
The U.S. rules are stricter than most , though , requiring that Olympians hold American citizenship .
Mexico , reflecting the practice of many nations , welcomes athletes who may have been born or reared elsewhere but are of Mexican descent .
That has opened the door for Lanaro and fellow vaulter Robison Pratt , who was born in Saudi Arabia to a family with ties to Mexico dating to before the Mexican Revolution .
Although Pratt ’s first language is English , he has a degree from Brigham Young University , he lives in Chino Hills and distant cousin Mitt Romney campaigned for the Republican presidential nomination , Pratt wore a Mexican uniform at the 2000 Sydney Games .
“ I could have gone either direction , ” said Pratt , who will miss the Beijing Games because of a knee injury .
“ I ’m comfortable with both cultures .
I ’m comfortable with both languages .
I ’m comfortable with a Mexican uniform on . ”
The government ministry that oversees international sports in Mexico has tried to straddle the controversy , alternately reaching out to Mexican American athletes , then bowing to internal pressure by going mum on the subject while allowing individual sports federations to do their own recruiting .
“ There still is some resistance by some of the authorities to Mexican Americans , ” said Elbert Pratt , Robison ’s father and a track coach at Monterrey Tech , one of Mexico ’s leading universities .
“ But my position is , if they ’re Mexican citizens or their parents were Mexican citizens , they have a constitutional right .
They have the same right as anybody . ”
In an example of this friction , Pratt recruited DePaul University shot putter Frank Guzman in 2003 to try out for Mexico ’s Pan American Games team .
To qualify , Guzman had to compete in a meet in Mexico .
But three athletes must take part in a competition to make it legal , and a Mexican shot putter whose spot on the team was threatened by Guzman organized a boycott of the meet to deny the American a chance .
Pratt eventually rounded up two local teenagers and , after a delay of more than an hour , Guzman threw , breaking the Mexican record by 9 feet .
“ The guy ’s point was , ‘ I ’ve been working for years , and now this guy shows up and just wins it , ’ ” Pratt said about the athlete who organized the boycott .
“ Hey , Guzman had been working for years too .
This is n’t about who has the most right to go because of the number of years they ’ve worked .
This is about who is the very best . ”
Lanaro also got a cold shoulder when Pratt invited him to compete for Mexico .
But since shattering the national record and representing Mexico in four world championships , two Pan - Am Games and the Athens Olympics , that resistance has faded .
“ They all know we live [ in the United States ] and we have better resources than what they do , ” Lanaro said .
“ But the bottom line is , I compete for that country .
Whether I ’m here , there , it does n’t matter .
I represent the country . ”
Lanaro says most of the criticism he gets now comes from people in the U.S .
“ It ’s all stupid .
It ’s ridiculous , ” said Lanaro , who contacted the Mexican team with help from his girlfriend , a high jumper from Culiacan .
“ I ’m not sitting here in the United States of America waving around a Mexican flag .
If I am proud competing for my country , people need to respect that . ”
Lanaro , whose marks are good enough to make him a contender for the U.S. Olympic team , concedes the fact that not having to negotiate a cutthroat qualifying meet to go to Beijing makes competing for Mexico appealing .
But he insists that had little to do with his decision .
“ I never thought I ’d be this good , first off .
I never thought I ’d reach this level , ” said Lanaro , whose best vault in high school was just 11 feet , 6 inches .
“ And when I did , I said well , I ’d like to compete for Mexico .
So I did . ”
There ’s no disputing that the border crossings have helped raised the level of sport in Mexico .
“ If you bring in people with other experiences and perhaps people that are more developed and further along in their sport , it ’s definitely going to add , ” said Larry Langowski , a former wrestler at Northwestern who became part of the Mexican team four years ago after asking local officials if there was a place he could train while visiting relatives in Mexico City .
“ You want the best talent .
Bringing in the best breeds better people . ”
But although some national programs -- such as women ’s soccer and boxing -- aggressively seek U.S. residents for their teams , it typically falls to the athlete to make the first move .
Basketball player Jennifer Arriola Vucovich , who joined the Mexican national team after playing in college at Texas Pan American , was n’t recruited until she enrolled at Monterrey Tech to pursue a master ’s degree in biotechnology three years ago .
“ To participate in the U.S. national team , I would have to dedicate most of my time to just training and playing basketball , ” said Vucovich , who was born in Arizona to parents from Sonora , Mexico .
She said being on Mexico ’s team allows her to have time for studying and her sport “ without having to choose one or the other . ”
Mexico may again be moving toward organized recruiting of U.S. - born athletes .
Langowski brought up the idea when he and other Mexican Olympians met with President Felipe Calderon recently .
He said he found the president and First Lady Margarita Zavala receptive .
“ It ’s going to keep happening , ” said Lanaro , who is an assistant coach at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut , where he vaulted after graduating from West Covina High .
“ There are a lot of people coming to the U.S. and a lot of kids will be born in the U.S. , and a lot of people will still go and compete for other countries . ”

The US news media likes to pretend that Americans supported Bush 's fraudulent , unprovoked attack on Iraq 10 years ago .
They 're " shocked " to now discover that there " may " have been some " misstatement " of facts by the Bush administration at the time .
Good story .
Too bad it 's total bullshit .
Over 30 % of Americans - even in the midst of Nazi - like war hysteria drummed up by media outlets like Clear Channel - were firmly opposed to the invasion before it took place .
Furthermore , millions in the US and around the world took to the streets in protest of the pending atrocity .
We all knew Bush could not be trusted to tell the truth and that his family has a long record of selling out the country to make a buck .
This is only news to the venal morons who report the news in the US .
Over 1,000,000 Iraqi civilians dead as a direct result of the invasion to date .
When Brillat - Savarin said that “ the discovery of a new dish confers more happiness on humanity than the discovery of a new star ” he perhaps had n’t spent much of his time near the deep fryer .
This dish confers on humanity nothing but moral decline .

I present to you french fry coated bacon on a stick .
Originally I was planning on making a French fry coated , bacon - wrapped hot dog , but thought that the inclusion of the hotdog was largely pointless .
Why not just head straight for the bacon ?
Front .
Back : French fries attached to the bacon with thick corndog batter .
No food styling tricks , apart from using a fondue fork instead of an actual stick .
I did n’t have a suitable wooden skewer on hand .
Tasted .
I feel ill and so very , very dirty .
If you ’re keen to replicate , do so at your own risk .
Follow the french fry coated hot dog recipe , omit the hot dog and substitute with a thick slice of homemade bacon

The location of the burrow
Long before the age of the dinosaurs , something was constructing tunnels in Antarctica .
A burrow has been discovered in the ancient flood plain of a broad Antarctic river only a few million years after a mass extinction ended the Permian period .

The tunnel was preserved when a flood washed sand into it , forming a cast 35 centimetres deep and 16 cm wide – and even preserving claw marks scratched into the walls during excavation .
Palaeontologist Christian Sidor of the University of Washington thinks the den belonged to Thrinaxodon , a small badger - like reptile closely related to mammals .
A second candidate is a lizard - like reptile called Procolophon .
Bones of both animals have been found in Antarctica and in South Africa .
Winter slumber
Fossils show that insects and plants prospered all over late - Permian Antarctica , but the oldest known fossils of four - legged animals come from sites in the Transantarctic Mountains where Sidor found the burrow .
Four - legged animals had spread over other continents tens of millions of years earlier , but were late to arrive in Antarctica , which was part of the vast supercontinent of Pangea , and like today was near the south pole .
The 245 - million - year - old structure is the oldest known evidence of quadrupeds in Antarctica , and shows that , like some contemporary animals , they liked to settle down for a long winter ’s nap .
Extreme environment
In the late Permian , Antarctica had a more moderate climate than that encountered today , but it was still a pretty extreme environment .
“ Temperatures within a burrow remain much more constant than outside , ” says study co-author Molly Miller of Vanderbilt University in Nashville , Tennessee , US .
So the dark of polar midwinter would have been a perfect time to snuggle deep in the burrow for a long nap .
While the find is exciting , even older fossils may be hidden under the ice that now covers most of the continent , Sidor says .

The quality of pollen a plant produces is closely tied to its sexual habits , ecologists have discovered .
As well as helping explain the evolution of such intimate relationships between plants and pollinators , the study -- one of the first of its kind and published online in the British Ecological Society 's journal Functional Ecology -- also helps explain the recent dramatic decline in certain bumblebee species found in the shrinking areas of species - rich chalk grasslands and hay meadows across Northern Europe .
Relationships between plants and pollinators have fascinated ecologists since Darwin 's day .
While ecologists have long known that pollinators such as honeybees and bumblebees are often faithful to certain flowers , and have done much work on the role of nectar as a food source , very little is known about how pollen quality affects these relationships .
Working on Salisbury Plain , the largest area of unimproved chalk grassland in north west Europe , ecologists from the universities of Plymouth , Stirling and Poitiers in France collected pollen from 23 different flowering plant species , 13 of which are only pollinated by insects while the other 10 species can either pollinate themselves or be insect pollinated .
They analysed the pollen for protein content and , in the second part of the study , recorded bumblebee foraging behaviour .
They found that without exception , plants that rely solely on insects for pollination produce the highest quality pollen , packing 65 % more protein into their pollen than plant species that do not have to rely on insect pollinators .
They also discovered that bumblebees prefer to visit plants with the most protein - rich pollen .
According to the lead author of the study , Dr Mick Hanley of the University of Plymouth : " Bumblebees appear to fine - tune their foraging behaviour to select plants offering the most rewarding pollen .
Although there is some debate about how they can tell the difference , it is possible they are using volatile compounds . "
By helping understand the advantages and disadvantages of plant - pollinator relationships where particular plants rely on particular insects to reproduce , and those insects rely on the same plants for food , the results could help ecologists conserve certain bumblebee species and the species - rich chalk grassland and hay meadow communities in which they live , all of which are becoming increasingly rare .
" For the plant , relying on a small group of insects such as bumblebees as pollinators is very beneficial because it ensures efficient pollen transfer .
Bumblebees quickly learn to visit the most rewarding flowers , so providing protein - rich pollen is one way plants can encourage bumblebees to be faithful .
But this close relationship has many potential pitfalls , because if the pollinators are lost , the flowers may not be able to reproduce , and this may be what we are seeing in the hay meadows , chalk grasslands and bumblebees species throughout Northern Europe , " Hanley says .

Last summer I found myself with a dozen pumpkins and no plans for what to do with them .
I ended up giving some away , and using the rest for porch decorations .
After a couple of hard freezes , they were ready for the compost heap from which they sprouted about a year ago .
I retrieved some seeds ( a messy job after the pumpkins go soft ) because I have real plans for them this year .
I 'm going to experiment with geometric pumpkins !
The first time you see square watermelons , your instinct may shout " Photoshop ! "  but they are really square .
Not a genetic variant , these are made the old - fashioned way .
They are grown in boxes , and take the cubic shape gradually as they grow .
It 's a labor - intensive process , but the end result fits nicely in a refrigerator , and wastes no space in the truck .
And they wo n't roll around !
They 've been growing them in Japan for years , because space is at a premium .
The watermelons are at premium prices , too .
To achieve such results , you have to have a proper box , made of tempered glass or durable plastic .
Transparent boxes are best , or else you wo n't know exactly when to harvest , or even worse , waste your equipment on a rotten fruit !
K-mac
Plastics sells boxes especially designed to grow watermelons in , complete with proper drainage .
Keep reading for even stranger shapes
If you can grow cubic watermelons , why not other shapes ?
The next phase would be pyramid - shaped watermelons .
And if you can grow pyramids , why not face - shaped watermelons ?
It 's been done .
The idea can be carried over to other types of garden produce .
Have you ever heard of a cubecumber ?
The shape is even more impressive when you slice them for unsuspecting guests .
You can order a kit that helps you to grow your own square tomatoes .
Grow Big Strange and Nasty Plants has five projects for kids , with a giant pumpkin project and an insect - eating plant as well as a cube tomato kit .
You can also buy molds for your garden .
Vegiforms offers two - piece plastic molds with faces on them .
The garden elf shape and the " pickle puss "  shape work with eggplants , zucchini , and other roundish vegetables .
The diamond and heart shapes are longer , and produce the shape when you slice the cucumber or squash .
There 's even a mold in the shape of an ear of corn , so you can disguise one vegetable as another !
Square pumpkins have been done .
John Muller won the " most beautiful pumpkin "  award for his box - shaped pumpkin in 2005 .
The greenhouse at Disney EPCOT in Florida grows vegetables in the shape of ( what else ) Mickey Mouse .
This photo , supposedly of " miraculous "  roots that were pulled from the ground in the shape of two people , has been making the rounds for quite some time , most recently at the Daily Mail .
Skeptics say they could n't have grown that way , that they must 've been carved .
But the filament roots seem real .
Once you know how it 's done , it seems simple ( but is n't ) .
With the right mold ( possibly dolls ) , the real miracle is getting the roots to grow so large !
I saw instructions at one time about getting a pumpkin to grow inside a square milk carton , but it seems you would have to support the outside to keep the plastic from bending .
Hmm .
I may experiment with getting a tomato to grow in the shape of the inside of a jar first .
However I decide to do it , rest assured I will take pictures for you !
Update : I tried molding pumpkins .
Here are the results .
NEW YORK ( Hollywood Reporter ) -
For those ready to move past the endless stream of dark dramas from fall 2007 , get ready for a new barrage -- from the 1960s , the 1940s and the 1780s .

Studios are preparing to unleash a hailstorm of period movies -- in broad terms , films set in an era other than the current -- in the fall , at times turning the multiplex circa 2008 into a veritable cinematic museum .
The films range from large studio productions ( Clint Eastwood ’s 1920s missing - child drama “ Changeling ” and Baz Luhrmann ’s World War II epic “ Australia ” ) to specialty releases ( the mid-century Southern tale “ The Secret Life of Bees ” and the 1960s Catholic - school drama “ Doubt ” ) .
They veer from costume dramas ( the 18th century Keira Knightley quill - and - wig extravaganza “ The Duchess ” ) to political sagas ( Ron Howard ’s “ Frost / Nixon ” ) to 1950s family dramas ( the Sam Mendes - Leonardo DiCaprio collaboration “ Revolutionary Road ” ) to biopics ( Gus Van Sant ’s “ Milk ” ) to yet more WWII throwbacks ( Ed Zwick ’s “ Defiance , ” Mikael Hafstrom ’s “ Shanghai ” and Spike Lee ’s “ Miracle at St. Anna ” ) .
“ It seems like Hollywood is merging with the History Channel , ” media critic Robert Thompson noted wryly .
Studios have a long tradition of producing movies set in previous eras , from epics like “ Ben - Hur ” to intimate stories like “ The Ice Storm . ”
But the latest wave of period movies is notable for several reasons .
These movies are coming all at once -- scores of pictures crammed into a period of just 10 or 12 weeks .
The stakes and expectations for these movies also are higher because the overall number of fall specialty releases is expected to be down by as much as 25 percent from the nearly 70 titles released last year .
And , maybe most critical , these period films are being released at a moment when questions linger from last season about whether the audience can find enough to identify with in fall releases .
That combination is enough to make some executives nervous .
“ It ’s a lot of period movies , and it ’s going to be a question of who ’ll be able to connect , ” said one high - ranking arthouse - studio executive releasing a period film .
Nonetheless , development executives point to reasons why historical is suddenly fashionable despite the risks .
In a time when summer releases have trumped fall movies on spectacle , they say , it ’s a chance for films to chisel out a new niche .
Boxoffice Mojo president Brandon Gray suggests that period pictures are in effect the fall ’s answer to the summer tentpole .
“ A movie set in period can be a selling point because it transports you to another world without being a fantasy or relying on big special effects , ” he said .
Period movies can also allow a story to be told in ways that contemporary - set movies ca n’t tell them .
“ In a period movie you can strip out modern American irony and ambiguity and get away with it , ” Thompson said .
“ A contemporary movie that has absolutes would seems old - fashioned .
But if you set it during a previous time , you can make it credible . ”
Last year , such movies as “ Michael Clayton , ” “ Rendition ” and “ In the Valley of Elah ” took on current issues through a contemporary lens .
This crop looks at equally large themes -- the corruption of power ( “ Changeling ” ) , the innocent victims of war ( “ Australia , ” “ St. Anna , ” “ Defiance ” ) and the slipperiness of truth ( “ Doubt , ” “ Frost / Nixon ” ) -- but uses the distancing mechanism of period .
But for all the advantages , will consumers bite on stories that often take place before many of them were born ?
Executives acknowledge that these movies come with challenges .
“ The situations wo n’t be as relatable , so you need to find something relatable that transcends the era , ” said Fox co-president of theatrical marketing Pam Levine , whose company will try to turn “ Australia ” -- in which Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman cross the Australian outback during a pre-WWII Japanese bombing raid -- into a wide play .
Marketing veteran Terry Press , who worked on such period films as “ Gladiator ” and “ Seabiscuit , ” also sees a fine line .
“ You do n’t want to confuse period with old - fashioned ( in your marketing ) .
That ’s the quickest way to lose a big part of the audience . ”
For a “ Gladiator ” spot , DreamWorks cut footage from the film with NFL highlights to give it a modern feel .
Miramax , which undertook a similar promotion for “ Gangs of New York ” under the Weinsteins six years ago , will try to bridge the historical and modern in “ Brideshead Revisited , ” the class - themed WWII movie based on the Evelyn Waugh novel .
“ We want to show people that the issues of class and being an outsider are still very relatable today , ” Miramax marketing chief Jason Cassidy said .
No matter how the material gets played , though , there might be a commercial ceiling .
One development executive points out that “ American audiences like occasional period movies , but they do want them every weekend ? ”

This Sunday , the Swedish Left Party voted in favor of a motion calling for the legalization of sharing copyrighted files for personal use .
The party , which currently holds 22 seats in the Swedish parliament , sees piracy as something positive , much like public libraries .
At the party ’s congress this weekend , party members had to vote on a motion that would legalize the uploading and downloading of copyrighted material for personal use , as long as it is not for commercial purposes .
“ To many of us in the Left Party , file sharing is something positive in the same obvious way that public libraries are , ” the motion read , going on to describe the general opinion on file sharing in Sweden .
In addition , the motion stated that the various measures taken for trying to stop file sharing , such as big brother - like surveillance , or arbitrary sentences against individuals , are unacceptable .
The Pirate Bay , the main reason why piracy is such a hot topic in Sweden , was also mentioned in the motion .
“ The farce that is the ongoing legal procedures against The Pirate Bay also shows how legal security is in risk of being compromised by those trying to enforce the current ban on file sharing , ” it read .
The motion concluded that legalizing piracy is the solution , and that the Left Party should take a stand for opening the possibilities to make copies for personal use .
The congress was split on the issue , and debate was heated before the vote on Sunday , but when the vote was taken it fell in favour of the motion legalizing file sharing .
“ We obviously want to be the cultural workers ’ party in the future , but legislation which makes the majority of the adult population criminals must be changed , ” Elise Norberg Pilhem of the party ’s board said .
Today , only a few hours after The Left Party ’s new stance on file sharing , another initiative in the same direction was presented from across the aisle .
The Swedish Center Party – the third largest party in Sweden , currently in government with four cabinet ministers , has called for an improvement in current copyright legislation .
Earlier this year the party had no success in convincing their colleagues in the government coalition to legalize non-commercial file sharing .
Today , the party demands a complete oversight of the copyright legislation , and the appointment of a commission to investigate how a new copyright law could be constructed .
We now see a younger generation questioning copyright more and more , and with that there will be demands for updated copyright legislation .
We need a legislation that is accepted by as many as possible , says Annie Johansson , the Center Party ’s spokesperson on copyright .
It looks like things are changing for the better in Sweden .
From sweatshop to High Street : children sew sequins on to a Primark night vest
Primark is rightly being exposed over the use of child labour in the finishing of cheap clothes .
But as evidence against retailers stacks up , shoppers are kidding themselves if they do n't shoulder some of the blame , says Dan McDougall .
The key question behind sweatshop investigations into major corporations like Monday night 's Panorama special on Primark is abundantly clear : do consumers , the UK shoppers who spend billions in the High Street , truly care where their £ 4 hand - finished blouse comes from ?
The answer , to the shops at least , is yes .
And it is reflected in the growth of ethical sourcing policies led by firms like Marks and Spencer .
A decade ago the duties of a corporation were almost exclusively focused on one thing : profit .
Now , though , corporate social responsibility appears to be in the ascendant .
Episodes such as the Enron boardroom scandal and exposés of retailers ' reliance on child labour , like the one I carried out into Gap Inc last year , have forced companies to be more open and honest .
They do this because they believe the consumer cares about where his morning coffee comes from or the shirt he puts on his back before going to work .
" Transparency " has become the watchword , and the mere mention of sweatshops now makes clothing manufacturers such as Primark or The Gap anxious .
Transparency is what Gap displayed in response to revelations about their production process and what Primark claims it is trying to do by firing three of its key Indian suppliers in the run up to tonight 's Panorama documentary .
To its credit , Gap admitted the problem , sought to fix it and promised to radically re-examine the working practices of its Indian contractors .
But increasingly it is consumers , and not the corporations , who have the biggest role to play in the fight against exploitation .
" The public has a major role to play in the fight against child labour , " says Bhuwan Ribhu , of the New Delhi - based Global March Against Child Labour , which leads the campaign against under - age working in the sub-continent .
" They need to learn more about who makes the products they buy , and support organisations with programmes to stop child labour .
Raise funds , join campaigns and talk to friends to make more people aware of the seriousness of the issue . "
" What happened with Gap and now with Primark should be a key indicator to all consumers .
The sad reality is many major retail firms know , but do n't dare to admit , what outsourcing to India means .
Employing cheap labour without successful auditing and investigation of your contractors inevitably means children will be used somewhere along the chain . "
Shopper - turned - inquisitor
This may not be what shoppers want to hear , Mr Ribhu concedes , " as they pull off fresh clothes from clean racks in stores " .
Shoppers give the impression they 're not bothered , says Siegle " But consumers in the UK should be thinking this : why am I only paying £ 4 for a hand embroidered top ?
This item looks handmade .
Who made it for such little cost ?
Is this top stained with a child 's suffering and sweat ?
That 's what shoppers need to first ask themselves and then go to their favourite stores and ask for assurances that it is not the case . "
Journalist Lucy Siegle , a leading authority on consumer ethics , believes UK shoppers have a conscience but are somehow fooled into believing goods are ethically sourced .
" Most consumers would be horrified if they found out that anything they owned had been made in sweatshop conditions or through child labour , or both , " says Siegle , who writes , as I do , for the Observer .
" It is simply not true to say that they do n't care . "
However , it seems people forget those thoughts when they go clothes shopping , she believes .
" There is a disconnect between what people care about and how they stock their wardrobes .
Why ?
The value retailers have sold themselves as democratisers of fashion .
Ostensibly the consumer is taught to think we 've never had it so good - really fashionable clothes , so cheap as to be disposable . "
Blocking uncertainty " Collusion between the High Street retailers , the consumer and the glossy mags with all their ' dress for less ' features means that has anaesthetised most of us from the murky , circuitous supply routes of international fashion and the demands [ this puts ] on garment workers in say India or Bangladesh . "
Gap admitted its problem and has sought to fix it " Until this magic spell is broken , the consumer will keep shopping and giving the impression that they 're not bothered .
The knock - on effects of this - for consumers - are that our wardrobes are bursting with redundant fast fashion ( two million tonnes of textiles are dumped in the UK every year ) , without us knowing anything about its origins ; there 's nothing on the label apart from washing instructions .
We continue to block uncertainty out of their minds . "
Lucy , like many experts in the field , believes the BBC 's investigation into Primark should now act as a watermark ; a line in the sand for both retailers and customers : " We 've had 12 years of excuses from retailers and manufacturers , this now has to change .
It is a massive consumer issue .
" We need to know the real trade - off .
If retailers say they can provide clothes for nothing without abusing basic human rights and exploiting workers , we should start asking for some real proof of these rather strange economics . "
But if shoppers are slowly starting to wake up to the horrors of child labour , developing world suppliers are more determined than ever to keep the prying eyes of foreigners away from their units .
My experience in reporting such stories in India , Pakistan , Bangladesh and Sri Lanka shows they are even willing to resort to violence .
Whilst carrying out an undercover investigation for the Observer last year I was badly beaten in a sweatshop in the lawless Haryana State border area of northern India pursuing the story .
But I got off lightly compared to the fate of some others , says Bhuwan Ribhu .
" We have lost a number of activists , murdered in the course of their duties , others have been dragged in chains behind cars and had threats made against their families .
A lot of money is at stake here and life becomes cheap in such a desperate and greed - filled environment .
Remember , above all , the money that is creating this desperation comes directly from the wallets of Western consumers . "
Dan McDougall is a foreign correspondent with the Observer .
Panorama 's Primark :
On the Rack is broadcast on BBC One on Monday 23 June , at 2100 BST .
Or catch up using the BBC iPlayer .
Update September 2011 : This article has been amended after the BBC Trust upheld a complaint from Primark about this programme .
Below is a selection of your comments :
It is really quite simple .
Any goods that are produced outside the EU should have to prove that they were made to standards at least equal to the minimum employment conditions ( that is conditions not necessarily wages ) specified and regulated to EU conditions BEFORE they are given an import licence .
That way EU jobs are not exported to sweat shops which should then cease to exists .
This helps every level of the procedure and encourages those third world employers who do provide decent conditions of employment .
Bill Green
So what guidance do we have when it comes to shopping for clothes if reputable concerns like Gap and Primark have been found to use unethical labour ?
There is Fair Trade clothing around , and its best to find " end- to - end " fair Trade manufacture not just Fair Trade Cotton .
Otherwise , the only way is to ask for an assurance from your supplier .
Peter , Cheshire , UK
Of course there is the intelligent vocal consumer , but we are overwhelmed by the masses who simply buy what fashion or their peer group tell them to !
If people are so uneducated as to buy and feed themselves much of the muck that supermarkets call food , how are they going to be persuaded to make an informed decision about labour conditions 5,000 miles away .
Especially when it means paying £ 10 rather than £ 2 !
Simon Mallett , UK Lenham I , for one , am very troubled by this story .
I do not care to buy any product made by abused people or people who were n't paid a fair wage .
Please note these garments are easily identifiable - the fabric has not been pre-shrunk !
It is labelled " Cold water wash only " because the employees were not instructed / paid to wash the fabric first .
It shrinks multiple sizes the first time it is washed .
Lilly , NYC , USA I do not support child labour but we should be able to consider other point of view , ( ie allowing children to work under certain guidelines ) and if it is not against the norm or law of the host home country , nor stop the child from going to school , I will be reluctant to call it child labour .
It indeed might be a life skill for the child not just in economics , but in practical skills ( imagine the neat pattern on the piece of clothe ) , what about the extra income for school uniform or the stipend for the family .
Again , let 's not all jump on the bandwagon of criticism , using our own yardstick to measure other economies .
Emmanuel Feyisetan , Gravesend , Kent
It is something that all companies should aspire to , Marks and Spencer 's has always treated suppliers and staff with respect .
Unfortunately being forced to move their manufacturing abroad because customers just want cheap items for the High Street , someone always has to pay .
Consumers have a big part in playing to give people in the Third world a better life .
Please everyone shop ethically .
Gordon , Glasgow I do n't really mind if children make the clothes I wear .
They should get paid the same as the adults or better give the jobs to their mums , dads , aunties and uncles at the reasonable wages to bring up their families .
Or even better , bring the jobs back into this country to our textile industry .

How to get the most out of your tank DAVID ELLISON'S CONSUMER WATCH
In these times of record gasoline prices , the consumer is in constant search of ways to save at the pump .
Unfortunately , there is yet another worry at the pump .
Customers should be on the lookout for any that do not dispense the proper amount fuel , thus cheating buyers out of their hard - earned money .
State and federal officials want consumers to be aware that regulations require all gasoline pumps to start dispensing fuel as soon as the price starts rolling .
Sometimes the numbers start moving before the gasoline .
Bryan Black , a spokesman with the Texas Department of Agriculture , which regulates gasoline pumps in the state , calls this " pump jumping . "
" You grab the nozzle and before you squeeze the trigger , the pump jumps .
You have paid 3 or 4 cents already , " he said .
Jason Toews , cofounder of houstongasprices.com and gasbuddy.com , said a pump 's check valve can malfunction , causing it to dispense less gas .
" You may be shortchanged by ounces or sometimes at least a gallon , " he said .
" If you run into a defective pump , you can easily lose a couple of dollars . "
Monitor the pump
Toews said , however , most of the time the retailer can lose money by having a tank dispense too much fuel .
Black said state inspectors find it usually is a 50 - 50 split between customers and the retailers losing money .
He recommends customers look at the pump to make sure it is in good condition , including checking to see if there is a cut in the hose that is dripping fuel .
Black said the department sends inspectors to stations every four years , or when it gets a complaint .
He said consumers can call the department at 800-835-5832 if they spot a bad pump .
One also can visit the department 's Web site , www.agr.state.tx.us, to report stations with problems .
Drive friendly and save
If avoiding faulty pumps is n't saving you enough money , here are some helpful tips to get better gas mileage .
One popular tip is to keep your tires properly inflated and vehicle maintained .
Also , do n't overfill the vehicle because the gasoline can slosh out of the tank .
Philip Reed , the senior consumer advice editor at Edmonds.com , said those work , but the savings border on insignificant .
He said most cities have a variety of gasoline prices in different areas , so commuters should search along their routes for the cheapest prices .
Another tip is to not use the much - higher premium gasoline unless it is required , not recommended .
Reed said premium fuel is for performance , not fuel economy .
Reed does suggest proper vehicle maintenance , but the most significant savings come from changing your driving habits .
He said Edmonds , which recently tested some common gas - saving tips , determined that there is potential for major savings if a person stops aggressive - driving habits .
Using cruise control can amount to a 14 percent savings and avoiding excessive idling can save up to 19 percent .
On the debate over air conditioner on - windows up vs. the AC off - windows down , the study says there is no measurable difference unless you have the sun roof open , too .
You can find more details on the tests on Edmonds.com .
Also , the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency have a fuel economy Web site : fuelecon omy.gov .
Among tips to be found there : Drive the speed limit .
According to the site , " Gas mileage usually decreases rapidly at speeds above 60 mph .
" As a rule of thumb , you can assume that each 5 mph you drive over 60 mph is like paying an additional $ 0.20 per gallon for gas . "
That savings is based on a gasoline price of $ 3.51 a gallon .
The government Web site also recommends motorists use overdrive gears .
Doing so makes the car 's engine speed go down , saving gas and reducing engine wear .

A dealer reports : " Ford just re-released ' Employee Pricing ' on their Ford Trucks ( plus up to $ 3500 cash back ) .
GM just released up to $ 4000 additional owner loyalty bonus cash on their trucks and SUVs ( in addition to the up to $ 2000 already on the hood ) .
Normally , these incentives give the dealer enough cash to throw at trade - ins to at least make a deal possible .
Not profitable .
And not painless for the customer .
Merely do - able .
Well , it ai n't enough .
In our meetings with manufacturer marketing teams and dealer advisory committees ( where the smell of fear is palpable ) , the stories from the field are apocalyptic .
One salesman stood up .
' I had a customer with a two - year - old Expedition .
Crazily - enough , he wanted a new F - 150 .
I tried everything , every trick in the book , and I could n't put a deal together .
And he was my BROTHER !'
( Read : I was taking a loss , he was taking a loss , and the numbers were cutting us both so bad we could n't deal ) .
Another meeting , another dealer .
' I brought a year - old GMC Denali to auction .
Priced it at rough wholesale book , minus seven grand .
I was prepared to accept any offer up to 10 grand behind rough wholesale book .
I was taking to take a tremendous beating to unload it .
And it did n't sell .
Did n't get an offer of any kind . '
( Read :
You can't give 'em away .

Scientists for the first time have identified long - term changes in mice brains that may shed light on why addicts get hooked on drugs — in this case methamphetamines — and have such a tough time kicking the habit .
The findings , reported in the journal Neuron , could set the stage for new ways to block cravings — and help addicts dry out .
Researchers , using fluorescent tracer dye , discovered that mice given methamphetamines for 10 days ( roughly equivalent to a human using it for two years ) had suppressed activity in a certain area of their brains .
Much to their surprise , normal function did not return even when the drug was stopped , but did when they administered a single dose of it again after the mice had been in withdrawal .
Study co-author Nigel Bamford , a pediatric neurologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine , says that if similar changes occur in humans , it will indicate that an effective way to fight addiction may be to design therapies that target the affected area — the striatum , a forebrain region that controls movement but also has been linked to habit - forming behavior .
Previous research has shown that the drug stimulates nerve cells in the midbrain to release dopamine into the synapses ( connections between neurons ) in the striatum .
Dopamine ( which is connected to reward processing , motivation and attention ) is one of the brain 's primary neurotransmitters , the chemical messengers by which one neuron triggers its neighbor to fire a nerve impulse .
In this case , Bamford says , the excess dopamine affected the flow of information from the cortex ( the brain 's central processing unit ) to the striatum .
Specifically , it appeared to partially block nerve cells in the cortex from releasing glutamate , another neurotransmitter , which is responsible for excitation .
" Dopamine provides a filtering effect that may help you concentrate on the novel object or pleasurable stimulus , " Bamford says .
Too much could explain addictive or compulsive behavior , because it would help a user ignore other things and focus a lot of attention on one particular goal .
Researchers found that chronic use of the drug kept the brain in this state of " chronic depression , " in essence suppressing the neural terminals controlling the flow of signals between the cortex and striatium — even after a long period of several weeks .
But normal activity resumed after the drug was reintroduced .
Bamford believes the key lies in other neurons found in the striatum , which release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine that , he says , acts like a " memory switch " .
When dopamine is released by meth use , it lessens acetylcholine levels in the striatum ; continued drug use reduces it to as low as 10 percent .
This decrease , in turn , affects glutamate levels , which also drop perilously low , thereby resulting in the chronic depression of information flow in the brain .
When methamphetamine is administered after a period of withdrawal , however , the dopamine released by the midbrain neurons has the opposite effect on the acetylcholine cells , prompting them to release the chemical into the striatum .
This , in turn , stimulates the production of glutamate , somehow causing the system to reset itself to a pre-addictive state .
Bamford says that if researchers can pinpoint the resetting mechanism , it would enable them to design nonaddictive drugs to trigger it .
" The identification of this quite complicated mechanism gives you different opportunities to address the root of the problem so the synapse can be renormalized without the use of the psychostimulant , " he says .
" A better target would be to determine how these [ acetylcholine neurons ] are learning to stay depressed and work directly with those . "

Do pictures like this make you green with envy ?
There has been much talk among personal financers this year about gardening .
Frugal Dad and Being Frugal built their square foot gardens and have actually begun planting in them .
A four foot square may still be too big for your yard if you live in a townhouse or an apartment but do n’t give up .
Even in a tiny space like a balcony or a patio , you can still grow your own vegetables .
The variety of vegetables that can be grown in a container is growing yearly .
Some of the vegetables listed below you may have never eaten or you may have had the canned variety and not liked them .
Fresh vegetables have a whole different taste than canned especially when you have grown them yourself .
Keep an open mind and try a few new ones every year .
Vegetables for Containers
Beets – I hated beets for years until a friend convinced me to try fresh ones last year .
Fresh beets have a whole different taste than pickled ones .
These can be grown in as little space as a cake pan and are better picked small and tender , about the size of a silver dollar .
Spinach – Fresh spinach is good both cooked and raw and it is another vegetable that can be grown in a small container .
The leaves are best picked young and tender .
One of the best things about spinach is that it does n’t have to grow fruit so it does n’t need a large container to support it .
This is a cool weather plant and does not like hot summer days .
Leaf Lettuce – Like spinach , leaf lettuce can be grown in a small container and does n’t need hot summer days to mature .
Pick when leaves are young and tender .
Start pots at different times so you have a continuous supply .
There is also a variety of miniature head lettuce that can be container grown .
Patio Tomatoes –
They are coming up with more and more types of tomatoes that are suited to container growing .
Traditional tomatoes take a huge amount of dirt and grow to be 3 or 4 feet tall and wide if not supported .
Patio tomatoes are more compact and were bred to retain a small size and be grown in a pot .
Here is a variety of cherry tomatoes that can be grown in a container .
Radishes – Like beets , radishes do n’t need a huge pot to grow and mature fairly quickly .
These are fun to grow and make a great addition to any salad .
Green Peppers –
These take a fairly good size pot and are definitely warm weather plants but they are not difficult to grow .
They can be used in a variety of dishes and freeze well .
If you are feeling a bit experimental , there is a new variety of mini peppers that you can buy .
They are small and colorful .
Green Beans –
While I would normally not recommend growing green beans in a container , they have come up with several varieties of dwarf green beans that are recommended and actually as you can plant 16 green bean plants in a square foot I would imagine these would do fairly well in a container .
Squash – Again , while squash is not something you would normally consider a container plant , new varieties are very compatible .
This mild summer Patty Pan squash is only 2 ft high and 2 ft wide .
It may be too big for an apartment but then maybe not .
Eggplant – Eggplant is a mainstay in Mediterranean cooking .
It ’s compact size makes it an ideal choice for container growing .
Garlic Chives –
This is one of my favorites .
It ’s a beautiful flower and every part of the plant is edible .
Swiss Chard –
This link is to a rainbow variety that will perk up any spot .
Fresh Swiss Chard has a sweet buttery flavor that is delicious .
The grocery store variety loses SO much of the flavor that it barely resembles the garden variety .
Try it fresh and sauted in a bit of olive oil with a hint of garlic .
A pot of Herbs – You can mix and match herbs in a container .
Basil , thyme , sage , tarragon , rosemary will all grow fine .
My choices to put together would be basil , thyme and sage .
Basil is an upright annual plant while sage is kind of sprawly .
Thyme is a low grower so the three together make an interesting potted arrangement .
All but basil are perennial .
Tomorrow I will be covering some of the different containers that are good for container vegetable gardening including instructions on how to make your own self watering container and some ideas for turning any container into self watering .
Contest
If you have gotten this far then you must be fairly interested in growing your own vegetables .

Posted Fri Feb 6 , 2009
G rowing up in an Antipodean society proud of its rich variety of expletives , I never heard the word bollocks .
It was only on arrival in England that I understood its magisterial power .
All classes used it .
Judges grunted it ; an editor of the Daily Mirror used it as noun , adjective and verb .
Certainly , the resonance of a double vowel saw off its closest American contender .
It had authority .
A high official with the Gilbertian title of Lord West of Spithead used it to great effect on 27 January .
The former admiral , who is security adviser to Gordon Brown , was referring to Tony Blair 's famous assertion that invading countries and killing innocent people did not increase the threat of terrorism at home .
" That was clearly bollocks , " said his lordship , who warned of the perceived " linkage between the US , Israel and the UK " in the horrors inflicted on Gaza and the effect on the recruitment of terrorists in Britain .
In other words , he was stating the obvious : that state terrorism begets individual or group terrorism at source .
Just as Blair was the prime mover of the London bombings of 7 July 2005 , so Brown , having pursued the same cynical crusades in Muslim countries and having armed and disported himself before the criminal regime in Tel Aviv , will share responsibility for related atrocities at home .
There is a lot of bollocks about at the moment .
The BBC 's explanation for banning an appeal on behalf of the stricken people of Gaza is a vivid example .
Mark Thompson , the director general , cited the BBC 's legal requirement to be " impartial … because Gaza is a major ongoing news story in which humanitarian issues … are both at the heart of the story and contentious . "
In a letter to Thomson , David Bracewell , illuminated the deceit behind this .
He pointed to previous BBC appeals for the Disasters Emergency Committee that were not only made in the midst of " an ongoing news story " in which humanitarian issues were " contentious , " but demonstrated how the BBC took sides .
In 1999 , at the height of the illegal NATO bombing of Serbia and Kosovo , the TV presenter Jill Dando made an appeal on behalf of Kosovar refugees .
The BBC web page for that appeal was linked to numerous articles meant to support the gravity of the humanitarian issue .
These included quotations from Blair himself , such as " This will be a daily pounding until [ Slobodan Milosevic ] comes into line with the terms that NATO has laid down . "
There was no significant balance of view from the Yugoslav side , and not a single mention that the flight of Kosovar refugees began only after NATO had started bombing .
Similarly , in an appeal for the victims of the civil war in the Congo , the BBC favored the regime of Joseph Kabila without referring to the Amnesty , Human Rights Watch and other reports accusing his forces of atrocities .
In contrast , the rebel leader Nkunda was " accused of committing atrocities " and was ordained the BBC 's bad guy .
Kabila , who represented western interests , was clearly the good guy – just like NATO in the Balkans and Israel in the Middle East .
While Mark Thompson and his satraps richly deserve the Lord West of Spithead Bollocks Blue Ribbon , that honor goes to the cheer squad of President Barack Obama , whose cult - like obeisance goes on and on .
On 23 January , the Guardian 's front page declared , " Obama shuts network of CIA ' ghost prisons . ' "
The " wholesale deconstruction [ sic ] of George Bush 's war on terror , " said the report , had been ordered by the new president who would be " shutting down the CIA 's secret prison network , banning torture and rendition …. "
The bollocks quotient on this was so high that it read like the press release it was , citing " officials briefing reporters at the White House yesterday . "
Obama 's orders , according to a group of 16 retired generals and admirals who attended a presidential signing ceremony , " would restore America 's moral standing in the world . "
What moral standing ?
It never ceases to astonish that experienced reporters can transmit PR stunts like this , bearing in mind the moving belt of lies from the same source under only nominally different management .
Far from " deconstructing [ sic ] the war on terror , " Obama is clearly pursuing it with the same vigor , ideological backing and deception as the previous administration .
George W. Bush 's first war , in Afghanistan , and last war , in Pakistan , are now Obama 's wars – with thousands more US troops to be deployed , more bombing and more slaughter of civilians .
On 22 January , the day he described Afghanistan and Pakistan as " the central front in our enduring struggle against terrorism and extremism , " 22 Afghan civilians died beneath Obama 's bombs in a hamlet populated mainly by shepherds and which , by all accounts , had not laid eyes on the Taliban .
Women and children were among the dead , which is normal .
Far from " shutting down the CIA 's secret prison network , " Obama 's executive orders actually give the CIA authority to carry out renditions , abductions and transfers of prisoners in secret without the threat of legal obstruction .
As the Los Angeles Times disclosed , " current and former intelligence officials said the rendition program might be poised to play an expanded role . "
A semantic sleight of hand is that " long term prisons " are changed to " short term prisons " ; and while Americans are now banned from directly torturing people , foreigners working for the US are not .
This means that America 's numerous " covert actions " will operate as they did under previous presidents , with proxy regimes , such as Augusto Pinochet 's in Chile , doing the dirtiest work .
Bush 's open support for torture , and Donald Rumsfeld 's extraordinary personal overseeing of certain torture techniques , upset many in America 's " secret army " of subversive military and intelligence operators as it exposed how the system worked .
Obama 's nominee for director of national intelligence , Admiral Dennis Blair , has said the Army Field Manual may include new forms of " harsh interrogation , " which will be kept secret .
Obama has chosen not to stop any of this .
Neither do his ballyhooed executive orders put an end to Bush 's assault on constitutional and international law .
He has retained Bush 's " right " to imprison anyone , without trial or charges .
No " ghost prisoners " are being released or are due to be tried before a civilian court .
His nominee for attorney general , Eric Holder , has endorsed an extension of Bush 's totalitarian USA PATRIOT Act , which allows federal agents to demand Americans ' library and bookshop records .
The man of " change , " is changing little .
That ought to be front page news from Washington .
The Lord West of Spithead Bollocks Prize ( Runner - up ) is shared .
On 28 January , a national Greenpeace advertisement opposing a third runway at London 's Heathrow airport summed up the almost willful naivety that has obstructed informed analysis of the Obama administration .
" Fortunately , " declared Greenpeace beneath a God - like picture of Obama , " the White House has a new occupant , and he has asked us all to roll back the specter of a warming planet . "
This was followed by Obama 's rhetorical flourish about " putting off unpleasant decisions . "
In fact , Obama has made no commitment to curtail America 's infamous responsibility for the causes of global warming .
As with Bush and most modern era presidents , it is oil , not stemming carbon emissions , that informs the new administration .
Obama 's national security adviser , General Jim Jones , a former NATO supreme commander , made his name planning US military control over the exploitation of oil and gas reserves from the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea to the Gulf of Guinea in Africa .
Sharing the Bollocks Runner - up Prize is the Observer , which on 25 January published a major news report headlined , " How Obama set the tone for a new US revolution . "
This was reminiscent of the Observer almost a dozen years ago when liberalism 's other great white hope , Tony Blair , came to power .
" Goodbye Xenophobia " was the Observer 's post-election front page in 1997 and " The Foreign Office says Hello World , remember us . "
The government , said the breathless text , would push for " new worldwide rules on human rights and the environment " and implement " tough new limits " on arms sales .
The opposite happened .
Last year , Britain was the biggest arms dealer in the world ; currently it is second only to the United States .
In the Blair mold , the Obama White House " sprang into action " with its " radical plans . "
The new president 's first phone call was to that Palestinian quisling , the unelected and deeply unpopular Mohammed Abbas .
There was a " hot pace " and a " new era , " in which a notorious name from an ancien regime , Richard Holbrooke , was dispatched to Pakistan .
In 1978 , Holbrooke betrayed a promise to normalize relations with the Vietnamese on the eve of a vicious embargo that ruined the lives of countless Vietnamese children .
Under Obama , the " sense of a new era abroad , " declared the Observer , " was reinforced by the confirmation of Hillary Clinton as secretary of state . "
Clinton has threatened to " entirely obliterate Iran " on behalf of Israel .
What the childish fawning over Obama obscures is the dark power assembled under cover of America 's first " post - racial president . "
Apart from the US , the world 's most dangerous state is demonstrably Israel , having recently killed and maimed some 4,000 people in Gaza with impunity .
On 10 February , a bellicose Israeli electorate is likely to put Binyamin Netanyahu into power .
Netanyahu is a fanatic 's fanatic who has made clear his intention of attacking Iran .
In the Wall Street Journal on 24 January , he described Iran as the " terrorist mother base " and justified the murder of civilians in Gaza because " Israel cannot accept an Iranian terror base ( Gaza ) next to its major cities . "
On 31 January , unaware he was being filmed , Israel 's ambassador in Australia described the massacres in Gaza as a " pre-introduction " – dress rehearsal – for an attack on Iran .
For Netanyahu , the reassuring news is that Obama 's administration is the most Zionist in living memory – a truth that has struggled to be told from beneath the soggy layers of Obama - love .
Not a single member of Obama 's team demurred from Obama 's support for Israel 's barbaric actions in Gaza .
Obama himself likened the safety of his two young daughters with that of Israeli children while making not a single reference to the thousands of Palestinian children killed with American weapons – a violation of both international and US law .
He did , however , demand that the people of Gaza be denied " smuggled " small arms with which to defend themselves against the world 's fourth largest military power .
And he paid tribute to the Arab dictatorships , such as Egypt , which are bribed by the US Treasury to help the US and Israel enforce policies described by the United Nations Rapporteur , Richard Falk , a Jew , as " genocidal . "
It is time the Obama lovers grew up .
It is time those paid to keep the record straight gave us the opportunity to debate informatively .
In the 21st century , people power remains a huge and exciting and largely untapped force for change , but it is nothing without truth .
" In the time of universal deceit , " wrote George Orwell , " telling the truth is a revolutionary act . "
Teenagers and young adults across Europe drink and take drugs as part of deliberate sexual strategies .
New findings reveal that a third of 16 - 35 year old males and a quarter of females surveyed are drinking alcohol to increase their chances of sex , while cocaine , ecstasy and cannabis are intentionally used to enhance sexual arousal or prolong sex .
The study was conducted by researchers in public health and social sciences from across Europe .
More than 1300 people aged between 16 and 35 and who routinely socialise in nightlife settings completed anonymous questionnaires .
Virtually all of the survey participants had drunk alcohol with most having had their first drink when 14 or 15 years old .
Three quarters of the respondents had tried or used cannabis , while around 30 percent had at least tried ecstasy or cocaine .
Overall , alcohol was most likely to be used to facilitate a sexual encounter , while cocaine and cannabis were more likely to be utilised to enhance sexual sensations and arousal .
Despite these perceived sexual " benefits " , drunkenness and drug use were strongly associated with an increase in risk taking behaviour and feeling regretful about having sex while under the influence of alcohol or drugs .
Thus , participants who had been drunk in the past four weeks were more likely to have had five or more partners , sex without a condom and to have regretted sex after drink or drugs in the past 12 months .
Cannabis , cocaine or ecstasy use was linked to similar consequences .
" Trends in recent decades have resulted in recreational drug use and binge drinking becoming routine features of European nightlife , " says lead author Mark Bellis , from Liverpool John Moores University .
" Millions of young Europeans now take drugs and drink in ways which alter their sexual decisions and increase their chances of unsafe sex or sex that is later regretted .
Yet despite the negative consequences , we found many are deliberately taking these substances to achieve quite specific sexual effects . "
Individuals were significantly more likely to have had sex under 16 years if they had used alcohol , cannabis , cocaine or ecstasy before that age .
Girls in particular were as much as four times as likely to have had sex before the age of 16 if they drank alcohol or used cannabis under 16 .
" Sexual activity accompanied by substance use is not just incidental , but often sexually motivated , " says co-author , consultant psychiatrist Amador Calafat .
" Interventions addressing sexual health are often developed , managed and implemented independently from those addressing substance use , and vice versa .
However , young people often see alcohol , drugs and sex all as part of the same social experience and addressing these issues requires an equally joined up approach . "
A new beta of Apple 's iPhone Software v2.0 Update released privately to a select group of enterprise partners this week adds a few new preferences and the beginnings of geo-tagging support for the handset 's Camera app .
People familiar with the release , reportedly labeled build 5A292g , say location - aware services such as " Maps " and " Camera " now ask the user 's permission before transmitting data used to identify their current geographical location .
The addition as it applies to the Camera application is interesting in that it suggests
Apple is actively working on adding support for geo- tagging photographs , those people say .
Essentially , geo - tagging is the process of adding geographical identification metadata to media files such as latitude and longitude coordinates — or even names of places — so that those files can later be referenced , searched , and grouped based on their origin .
In addition , Apple is also reported to have added a toggle under the iPhone 's general preference pane that will allow users to enable / disable Location Services on a system - wide basis .
Although the new beta prompts users for permission to use Location Services in the Camera application , those people familiar with the software say it appears that location metadata is not yet embedded in new photographs .
i Phone Software 2.0 is due next month alongside the company 's much - anticipated next - generation iPhone that will boast support for so - called 3G networks .
However , it will also be made available for existing iPhone owners .
Here 's 5 reasons coal is not clean , also known as the " Top 5 Clean Coal Myths . "
Also just so happen to serve as 5 darn good reasons Obama has to drop the clean coal platform .
Myth # 1 : " America has more than 200 years of available coal reserves . "
The United States is the ‘ Saudi Arabia ’ of coal .
As author Jeff Goodell reveals in his book " Big Coal , " the claim that the U.S. has 200 or 250 years of coal left is " based on old studies that have n't been updated since the '70s .
Those studies themselves were based on studies from the ' 20s and ' 30s . "
Goodell points out that " we 've been mining coal in this country for 150 years -- all the simple , high - quality , easy - to - get stuff is gone .
What 's left is buried beneath towns and national parks , or places that are difficult , expensive and dangerous to mine . "
The situation is likely far worse than the rosy picture the coal industry paints claiming centuries of abundant supply .
Richard Heinberg , author of " Peak Everything , " cites an Energy Watch Group report to support his claim that U.S. coal production has already peaked :
" This forecast for a near - term peak in U.S. coal extraction flies in the face of frequently repeated statements that the nation has 200 years ’ worth of coal reserves at current levels of consumption . "
MYTH # 2 : We can capture carbon emissions from coal and bury them underground
Burying the carbon produced from the burning of coal , so called Carbon Capture and Sequestration ( CCS ) , is n't as simple as the coal industry would have us think .
New Scientist magazine recently provided a good overview of CCS technology .
It quotes a Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) study called The Future of Coal , which concludes that , " the first commercial CCS plant wo n't be on stream until 2030 at the earliest . "
Oil - giant Shell " does n't foresee CCS being in widespread use until 2050 . "
In May , 2008 Greenpeace International released a comprehensive , in - depth report called " False Hope : Why Carbon capture and storage wo n't save the climate , " detailing the fallacies of Carbon Capture and Storage ( CCS ) .
" Carbon capture and storage is a scam .
It is the ultimate coal industry pipe dream , " said the report ’s author , Emily Rochon , climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace International .
" Governments and businesses need to reduce their emissions — not search for excuses to keep burning coal . "
MYTH #3 : Since 1970 , emissions from coal power plants are down 35 percent , the air is cleaner and yet coal use tripled during that period .
The coal industry is correct that emissions from coal plants are down 35 percent since 1970 .
But the claim that the air is cleaner is only true from a 1970s perspective - for those pollutants which were regulated under the Clean Air Act and related statutes – chiefly sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide , the two main components of smog .
But since coal use has more than tripled since 1970 , total pollution from coal plants has increased .
Mercury emissions from coal plants continue to climb , and since 1990 , carbon dioxide emissions – the prime driver of global warming - rose 27 percent from coal plants alone .
According to the American Lung Association ( ALA ) , 24,000 people a year still die prematurely from pollution emitted at coal - fired power plants , in addition to a litany of other health effects that injure and impede hundreds of thousands of Americans .
The ALA found that power plant pollution is responsible for 38,000 heart attacks , 12,000 hospital admissions and an additional 550,000 asthma attacks every year .
MYTH # 4 : There ’s more mercury from " natural sources " than the coal industry releases , so there ’s no reason to focus on reducing coal - related mercury emissions
Coal ’s defenders often point to the " 200,000 tons of mercury that already exist in the soils and seas of the planet " to downplay the idea that we should be concerned about the 48 tons of mercury that coal - fired plants emit per year .
But the fact that mercury exists in buried soils does n’t mean that it has always contaminated the aquatic food chain and the hydrologic system .
In fact , the mercury bound in soils and geological strata largely stays put .
Mercury levels in fish and humans have risen sharply in the past 200 years , concurrent with the burning of enormous quantities of coal which releases mercury into the atmosphere and contaminates our air and water .
In fact , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) reports that the amount of mercury in the atmosphere is estimated to have increased by 200 % to 500 % since the beginning of the industrial revolution , when coal use skyrocketed .
The US Department of Energy ( DOE ) projects that mercury emissions will continue to rise .
This mercury quickly enters the aquatic food chain , transforming into methylmercury which is blamed for a litany of neurological impacts in infants and young children during their most vulnerable periods of brain and nervous system development .
MYTH #5 : Coal mining creates jobs
Despite coal industry claims that coal mining creates lots of jobs , the truth is that coal mining employment has been declining for decades , due to increased use of machinery instead of manpower .
In West Virginia alone , coal mining employment has plummeted from 126,000 miners in 1948 ( who produced 168 million tons of coal ) , to just 15,000 miners employed in 2005 ( who , with the help of machinery , produced 128 million tons of coal ) .
A Democratic superdelegate from New Jersey said this week he is worried that unifying the party behind Barack Obama may be difficult because the Clinton camp " has engaged in some very divisive tactics and rhetoric it should not have . "
U.S. Rep. Rob Andrews , who supported Hillary Clinton throughout the primary season , disclosed he received a phone call shortly before the April 22 Pennsylvania primary from a top member of Clinton 's organization and that the caller explicitly discussed a strategy of winning over Jewish voters by exploiting tensions between Jews and African - Americans .
" There have been signals coming out of the Clinton campaign that have racial overtones that indeed disturb me , " Andrews said at his campaign headquarters in Cherry Hill Tuesday night after he lost his bid for the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination .
" Frankly , I had a private conversation with a high - ranking person in the campaign ... that used a racial line of argument that I found very disconcerting .
It was extremely disconcerting given the rank of this person .
It was very disturbing . "
Andrews said the phone call came after he angered the Clinton camp by making some positive comments about Obama .
He would not disclose the caller 's name because of the private nature of the conversation .
The Obama camp declined to comment .
Clinton 's campaign issued an angry response to Andrews , who once was charged with lobbying other members of Congress to support her .
" Comments like these , coming so soon after Congressman Andrews ' crushing defeat , are sad and divisive , " said Clinton 's chief national spokesman , Phil Singer .
Andrews stood by his statements and said : " I would hope that all Democrats can put this divisiveness behind them .
I 'm glad the Clinton campaign is finally about to change its tone . "
He said he made his comments only after his primary loss to Sen.
Frank Lautenberg because " I did n't want people to think I was trying to win over Obama supporters in the primary . "
Some Obama supporters , as well as neutral Democrats such as Rep. James E. Clyburn of South Carolina , had complained during the campaign that Clinton surrogates injected racial overtones into the contest .
Former president Bill Clinton was criticized for downplaying Obama 's win in South Carolina by comparing it to the ultimately unsuccessful 1988 campaign of the Rev. Jesse Jackson .
Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro gave up an honorary post in the Clinton campaign after saying in an interview that Obama would not have made it so far if he were white .
Andrews has joined other New Jersey Clinton delegates this week in saying he looks forward to uniting the delegation behind the presumptive nominee .
New Jersey 's Feb. 5 primary allotted a majority of its 107 pledged delegates to Clinton , and 12 of the state 's 20 superdelegates endorsed her , but state party leaders say they are not worried about getting on the same page for the campaign against the Republicans ' presumptive nominee , Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
During an interview on MSNBC Thursday morning , Gov. Jon Corzine , who was the leader of New Jersey 's Clinton supporters , pivoted toward Obama , saying he " absolutely " will fight for the senator from Illinois .
" It 's time for Democrats to unite around Barack Obama and move forward , " said Corzine , who last year was the first sitting governor to come out for Clinton .
" We 're all going to get behind Barack and go full throttle . "
McCain , who has been able to attract followers outside of traditional Republican strongholds , is pursuing middle - of - the road Democrats much the way Ronald Reagan did a generation ago and is looking to be competitive in moderate states like New Jersey .
He is returning to the state for a town hall - style meeting next Friday at Burlington County College and will be opening a Garden State headquarters .
" It 's very clear that John McCain is putting New Jersey in play , " said state Sen. Bill Baroni ( R - Mercer ) , who is chairing the Republican 's effort in the state .
" Everything that we can do to show the political world that John McCain is competing in New Jersey we are doing . "

Our epoch needs a new name .
You 're familiar with , say , the Jurassic ?
It started 200 million years ago and ended 55 million years later , give or take .
For the past 12,000 years , we 've been living in the Holocene .
But in 2000 , the Nobel Prize - winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen pitched a new name for our times : the Anthropocene , the epoch affected by people .
He dated it to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s — in other words , when we started messing things up .
William Ruddiman , a retired climatologist at the University of Virginia , likes the name Anthropocene , too .
But he thinks it started much , much earlier — as far back as 6,000 BC , when human beings first discovered agriculture .
That 's when we started razing forests and burning lots of wood , pumping enough carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere to alter the world 's climate .
What 's the difference ?
Scientists still argue — though not as much as deniers would have you believe — about the extent to which climate change is the result of human activity .
And they still argue — quite a lot , actually — about how quickly the climate shifts in response to new conditions .
As I understand Ruddiman , we humans may have been screwing up the climate for far longer than anyone thought .
But that 's good — because if we could change things then , we should certainly be able to change them now .
The gist of Ruddiman 's argument is that 8,000 years ago , carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere began their sharpest increase in 350,000 years — a CO 2 spike that correlates with the origins of agriculture .
Then , 5,000 years ago , methane levels jumped — at roughly the same moment humans started growing rice in paddies ( organic matter decomposing in water emits methane ) .
By 2,000 years ago , agriculture and forest - clearing had added as much as 140 billion tons of CO 2 to the air , enough to stave off what would likely have been another ice age .
Since then , the climate has wiggled back and forth between warm and cold .
Around AD 800 , things got weirdly hot ; Antarctic ice cores show atmospheric CO 2 peaking then at 285 parts per million .
Around 1300 , CO 2 levels started dropping , and by 1600 that number had decreased to as low as 275 ppm .
According to Ruddiman , humans caused that nosedive , too — by dying in large numbers :
In the 14th century , about one - third of Europe 's population died in the Black Plague , and around the same time , some 50 million Native Americans were being wiped out by European germs .
The much - reduced surviving population burned less wood and coal , grew less food , and even allowed wooded areas to grow back .
Today things are heating up again .
Atmospheric CO 2 concentrations have been on the steep incline of an exponential growth curve since 1800 .
Today they 're at roughly 380 ppm .
How high will temperatures rise as a result of so much carbon ?
We do n't know .
But the more you mess up the climate , the more feedback effects there are and the more chaotic it gets , until eventually we reach tipping points , when various important climatic systems —
Arctic summer sea ice , for example , or the Indian summer monsoon — suddenly disappear or change dramatically .
But I see hope in Ruddiman 's conclusions .
If humans have been changing the climate for eight millennia , that means we can keep right on doing it .
We can steer the climate back on course .
( I should add that Ruddiman 's hypothesis is controversial , and he himself interprets his findings much more conservatively . )
So what do we do ?
You already know the drill : Make machines more energy efficient .
Use less fossil fuel .
Sequester CO 2 .
Protect rain forests .
Develop alternative energy sources like wind and solar power .
Build more nuclear plants .
Maybe even change the planet through geoengineering , the once far - out idea that the greenhouse effect can be reversed by , say , releasing fleets of mirrors or sulfur particles into the atmosphere .
Ruddiman suggests we focus on reducing the concentrations of methane , a more potent greenhouse gas than CO 2 , by trapping emissions from landfills and changing the fertilizer used by rice farmers .
The point is , exhorting corporations and governments to act now is n't just ringing a rhetorical bell :
We can rescue the globe 's climatic system as abruptly as we can push it over the edge .
And no matter what we call our current epoch , it would be nice if we kept the planet healthy enough to let us live to see the next one .

" Method of this project : literary montage .
I need n't say anything .
Merely show . " -- Walter Benjamin
Gossip scoundrels TMZ have released probably one of the most entertaining videos you 'll ever see in your whole entire life , as Phoenix Sun center Shaquille O'Neal revisits his Shaq - Fu roots and burns Kobe Bryant with an impromptu free - style at a New York City club .
Here 's the report :
Shaquille O'Neal took the mic at a NYC club last night , unleashing a freestyle verbal assault directed at his arch - enemy Kobe Bryant — blaming his former teammate for ruining his marriage and imploring him to " Tell me how my ass tastes . "
After spending several verses shredding Kobe apart for losing in the NBA playoffs , Shaq drops the line , " I 'm a horse , Kobe ratted me out , that 's why I 'm getting divorced . "
The line most likely references a comment Kobe made during his infamous 2003 rape case , when he told Colorado police that he " Should have done what Shaq does ...
Shaq would pay his women not to say anything . "
The two became famously bitter rivals after the incident .
Calls to Kobe 's reps were not returned .
The red supergiant underwent five stages in the life cycle of a star .
The yellowish regions represent visible images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope , over which are the blue ultraviolet images taken with GALEX .
Since GALEX does n't have Hubble 's spatial resolution , the blue blobs show up as blurry and larger than reality .
Like acosmic Grim Reaper , a blast of ultraviolet light signals the violent death ofthe universe 's most massive stars .
Now astronomers have viewed this heavenlyharbinger for the first time .
" Astronomershave been dreaming about seeing the first light from the violent death of astar for over 30 years , " said lead researcher Kevin Schawinksi of the University of Oxford .
" Our observations open up an entirely new avenue for studying the final stages in the lives of massive stars and the physics ofsupernovae . "
Schawinksiand his colleagues detected the ultraviolet signal of a hefty star on the vergeof explosion , which they detail in the June 13 issue of the journal Science .
Usually , when astronomers see a supernova , the star has already been destroyed .
" It 'svery hard to tell much about precisely the kind of star that actually diedthere , " Schawinski told SPACE.com .
" The really cool thingabout our observations is this light traveling ahead of the shock wave traveledthrough the star before it was destroyed . "
He added , " It 's telling us about the properties , the conditions , of the star at themoment it died , but before the shock wave actually disrupted it . "
Doomedstar
When amassive star , weighing at least 10 suns , runs out of nuclear fuel , it cancollapse under its own weight , triggering an explosion called a supernova .
Theexplosion sends the stellar gutsspewing away at 20 million mph ( 10,000 km / sec ) in a fireball that 's abillion times brighter than the sun , the researchers say .
It 's thisfireball that scientists observe .
What they have n't seen until now are thefinal moments of the doomed star just before the visible explosion .
For thepast 30 years or so , theorists have predicted a surge of ultraviolet lightshould come before the actual visibleexplosion .
There areseveral problems for actually seeing this phenomenon .
" By the time you seethe supernova , it 's already days or weeks in the past , " Schawinski said .
"
If you see a supernova you 'd have to go back in time .
You 'd have to bealready looking at the position . "
The otherissue is the fact that Earth 's atmosphere absorbs ultraviolet light , and soyou'd need a space telescope to actually be able to view the death beacon .
Thespace telescope GALEX , which orbits Earth about every 98.6 minutes and views theuniverse in ultraviolet , was the answer .
With GALEX , researchers recently got front - row seats to the pre-show of what they suspectwas a red supergiant star measuring somewhere between 500 and 1,000 solar radiion the verge of explosion .
A redsupergiant is a hefty star nearing the end of its life that can swell to100 times its original size before exploding .
Schawinskiand his colleagues looked at GALEX images taken at the positions of supernovaepreviously identified with optical telescopes in Hawaii .
" We founda new source at the location of one supernova , suddenly outshining its galaxy hostin the UV , " said Mark Sullivan of the University of Oxford .
" Itappeared a couple of weeks before the optical discovery of the supernova andmarked the first stage in the death of the star . "
Thefinal hours
The UV peakrepresented a unique phase in the formation of the supernova SNLS - 04D2dc , justbefore the shock wave from its collapsed core reached the star 's surface toviolently eject its shell of hot gas .
During ared supergiant 's final hours , a shock wave whizzes outward with the relatedradiation moving even faster and heating up the star 's surface .
The temperatureat the surface ramps up from a few thousand degrees Celsius to several hundredthousand degrees .
Just before the shock wave catches up and reaches the surface ( triggering a supernova ) , the star is producing the same total luminosity as athousand billion suns , the researchers say .
Once theshock wave catches up , it plows through the outer parts of the star , accelerating several suns ' worth of material outward .
The surface of thestar explodes .
A few days later , supernova hunters will spot the brightvisible light of the explosion .
Schawinskidescribes the observations as looking inside of a semi- transparent star as it 'sdying .
" Wesaw the whole thing .
We saw the radiative precursor , this UV light , movingahead [ of the shock wave ] , " Schawinski said .
" We saw that arrive andthen the point at which the shock wave comes to the surface and destroys thestar .
In a sense we could see the shock move inside the star because the lightfrom the shock was moving ahead of it . "
The new UVpeak findings , the astrophysicists say , will shed light on deathly details oncehidden beneath a star 's outer cloak .
" Thisis a whole new avenue into studying the late stages of massive stars , " said Oxford researcher Christian Wolf .
" Most of what we know today isbased on computer simulations .
But as always when you test theory againstobservations for the first few times , we may be in for surprises . "
Jackie Chan , dubious mascots and tearful volleyball coaches : everything you need to know about this summer 's Games
A is for air pollution
Readings in late May registered Beijing 's air as ' hazardous ' ( only one further level on the scale exists ) .
On a bad day , smog can cut visibility to 300 m - which would make it difficult to see from one end of the Bird 's Nest stadium to the other .
Athletes are concerned about the effect on their health , with Haile Gebrselassie refusing to run the marathon and the Australian team forbidden to march in the opening ceremony .
Team GB 's plan has been confused : James Bond - like ' anti-pollution mouthpieces ' were unveiled in January , but the team have flip - flopped as to whether to wear them and risk offending the hosts .
B is for British women
Ignoring a horrible 1996 Games , British sportswomen have been on the rise .
Could this summer be the first in which they gather more than the men ?
Denise Lewis thinks so .
' Who will medal in Beijing ?
Female competitors , ' she told us in May .
C is for Coughlin
' I like my wine , I like my butter , ' says the long - armed , milkmaid - pretty Natalie Coughlin - as if her life as the greatest American female swimmer ever was mostly about sensory pleasure .
More precisely , as she sips lemonade over lunch in a San Francisco suburb , she 's talking about the city 's farmers ' market .
' Hog Island Oyster Company ? ' she says , grinning wide with her big , perfect teeth .
' I 'm completely obsessed with that .
[ Chef ] Alice Waters , too - I mean totally obsessed .'
It 's not as if the 25 - year - old is n't obsessed with swimming , too .
She is an odds - on favourite for multiple golds at the Olympics and , for the sheer range of events she dominates , is one of the most versatile swimmers ever - male or female .
During her freshman year at swimming powerhouse University of California , Berkeley , Coughlin won five national titles , broke two American records , and took gold at the 2001 world championships .
A shoulder injury kept her out of the Sydney Olympics , but she continued to rack up university and national records until the 2004 Games in Athens , from which she returned with the most impressive medal haul of any American woman swimmer yet - two gold , two silver , and one bronze .
She currently holds four world records and is the first woman to break a minute in the 100 metres backstroke .
( She has broken her own world record in the event twice , most recently in February . )
Observers generally credit Coughlin with a near - supernatural feel for the water , which she demonstrated during a recent morning workout by slipping underwater , straightening her body over the bottom of the UC Berkeley pool , starting her flutter kick from a dead stop , and submarining faster than most people can freestyle on the water 's surface .
Coughlin dismisses the water - feel business as something every elite swimmer shares .
The only talent she 'll admit to is responding well to coaching - along with knowing how to focus during a workout .
' Almost like OCD , ' she says , laughing , ' I can focus on my whole body for two hours , just constantly going up and down and evaluating what is going on . '
After Athens , Coughlin flew home to a measure of celebrity almost unheard of for a swimmer : flight attendants announced her presence on planes , crowds ogled her at baggage claim , and there was the obligatory appearance on Letterman .
But the more she talks about her life - about spending a few hours a day in the pool , walking her dog , and cooking elaborate meals for her boyfriend ( a former collegiate swimmer ) - the more that life sounds borderline normal , though with more Pilates and a lot of peeing in paper cups for the drug - testers .
Beijing , however , should be Coughlin 's greatest challenge yet .
It 's not just because she will face her first serious competition in the backstroke in the form of France 's Laure Manaudou and Zimbabwe 's Kirsty Coventry ; it 's also because Beijing restaurants are famous for their quick - fried mutton tripe .
Daniel Duane
D is for drugs
Here are the little helpers most likely to be found in cheaters ' bloodstreams :
Anabolic steroids
Types of synthetic testosterone that increases muscle and strength .
Normally injected .
Most used by Weightlifters , sprinters , throwers .
Risk of detection High - even for the ' designer ' drug THG .
EPO Erythropoietin , a hormone that increases the number of red blood cells , getting more oxygen to your muscles .
Normally injected .
Most used by Cyclists , sprinters .
Risk of detection Relatively high .
Human growth hormone Artificial version of a protein that stimulates cell production ; increases muscle mass and aids recovery .
Injected or taken in capsule form .
Most used by Swimmers , although its use is thought to be widespread .
Risk of detection Low .
Only shows up in a complicated blood test , and is mainly used in the off - season .
E is for Elis Lapenmal
... and the other Olympic underdogs .
Lapenmal is a 100 m wild - card entrant from the South Pacific island state of Vanuatu with a personal best of 13.10sec , although at least he has the right training facilities - Palestinian swimmer Hamza Abdu practises in a half - size pool .
If IOC president Jacques Rogge had his way , they would n't compete - but Sydney would not have been the same without the brave , inept swim from Eric ' The Eel ' Moussambani , the hero from Equatorial Guinea .
F is for floppers
Plant legs , wait for contact , hurl self backwards and slide with bemused expression on face .
This is flopping - the basketball equivalent of diving in football - and the NBA is so worried about its increased influence in games that it is planning a system of fines from next season .
Before then , flopping is likely to have a part to play in the Olympics , with a handful of the NBA 's biggest offenders in competition .
Top of the list is Argentina 's Manu Ginóbili , whose exaggerated crumples for the San Antonio Spurs enrage rival fans .
In Beijing , Ginóbili will face off against frequent floppers such as Andrei Kirilenko of Russia and Dwayne Wade of the USA .
Should Brazil qualify this month , they will be joined by Anderson Varejão , the master of the backward flail .
G is for Gorillaz
The duo behind the cartoon - fronted band , Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett , have produced the soundtrack and title sequence for the BBC's Olympic coverage .
In the two - minute animation , three colourful characters will journey to Beijing - Monkey , Pigsy and Sandy , inspired by the cult Seventies TV show Monkey .
' The key aim was to try to bring the Olympics to newer and younger audiences , ' said a BBC spokesperson , failing to mention whether that other character - the kid with the sceptre who kept saying ' No violence , Monkey ! ' - would feature too .
H is for hostesses
Take a moment to acknowledge all that arduous training when Olympians are awarded their medals - not only by the athletes , but also the red- suited ' victory ceremony hostesses ' who will present flowers to the winners .
Selected after a long series of auditions , the hostesses have spent months learning to smile , walk and bow according to strict rules .
Good posture has been ensured by a drill requiring the hostesses to stand with a book on their heads while clutching a sheet of paper between their knees .
Smiles , which must reveal ' only six to eight teeth ' , were strengthened by marathon sessions of chopstick - biting .
' By the end of the class , our lips were numb , ' said one hostess , ' but after several days , the smile came naturally . '
I is for Irving Saladino
He failed to qualify for the Olympics in 2004 , but the Panamanian long jumper has re-emerged as a favourite for Beijing after winning last year 's world championships .
Most excitingly , he leapt further than anyone for 14 years with a jump of 8.73 m in May .
American Mike Powell 's 8.95 m record has stood for 17 long years - could we finally see it broken this summer ?
' On the right day , in the right atmosphere , then it 's possible to break the world record , ' Saladino insists .
J is for Jackie Chan
As well as being an official ambassador of the Olympics ( and owner of a Segway dealership that will provide a fleet of the upright devices for use at the Games ) , kung - fu star Chan has also recorded one of the tournament 's official songs .
' We Are Ready ! ' is an unflinching celebration of Beijing 's Olympic preparation that stays just this side of sinister , with lyrics such as : ' Waiting day after day / The feelings continue to surge / Building the biggest performing stage / In a bold and generous era . '
See it on YouTube .
K is for Kathrin Boron
The German Steve Redgrave : Boron , a 38 - year - old Deutsche Bank employee , will compete for her fifth consecutive rowing gold at Beijing in the quadruple sculls .
L is for Leander and Mahesh
Doubles partners Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi ( winners of three grand slam titles ) have n't been on speaking terms for more than two years , and have conducted a public spat in the newspapers for the past three months .
But now , because they are ' true patriots ' , according to the All India Tennis Association , they will play together in Beijing .
Can the hasty alliance last ?
M is for mascots
Waldi , multicoloured dachshund , symbol of the Munich Games in 1972 , and the first official Olympic mascot , does n't know how easy he had it .
In recent years , few of them have escaped public wrath .
Beijing 2008
Mascots
Five of them : fish , panda , bird , Olympic flame and Tibetan antelope ( uh - oh ) .
Reaction
The last one was interpreted by some as an effort to claim more Chinese authority over Tibet .
The mascots ' group name , the ' friendlies ' , was abandoned , apparently , because it sounded too similar to ' friendless ' and ' friend lies ' .
Athens 2004
Mascots Athena and Phevos , based on terracotta dolls .
Reaction Likened to condoms and post - nuclear mutants by Greek pundits , and described as ' a national catastrophe ' .
Sydney 2000
Mascots
Olly , a generous kookaburra ; Syd , an energetic platypus ; and Milly , a ' techno wiz' anteater .
Reaction
So unpopular they inspired unofficial rivals ( see P for protests ) .
Atlanta 1996
Mascot Izzy , ' the first mascot designed by a computer ' .
Reaction ' No national or regional meaning , ' said the New York Times , ' nothing whatsoever to do with Atlanta or the South or anyplace else . '
The name is derived from the most common response to the thing , ' What is it ?'
Barcelona 1992
Mascot Cobi , a cubist , suit - wearing sheepdog .
Reaction
The last Olympic mascot that can be called a success : Cobi got his own TV show .
N is for new disciplines
In the particular lexicon of the Olympics , there are sports , within which there are disciplines , within which there are events .
This year 's Games will have no new sports , but one new discipline : BMX , an eye - catching addition to the cycling programme - sorry , sport , sport !
- that is intended , in part , to recapture the young , shaggy - haired audience lost to extreme sports tournaments such as the X Games .
Lip - studded Cheshire girl Shanaze Reade is emerging as the discipline 's new star .
After winning the world championships in June by quite a distance , and triumphing at a test event on the Olympic track last August , 19 - year - old ' Speedy Readey ' will go to Beijing as the favourite to win the inaugural gold .
Away from cycling , new events have been scattered across the Olympic spectrum , notably a women 's 3,000 m steeplechase in athletics and men's and women 's 10 km in swimming .
Women 's team foil and team sabre events have been added to fencing , while doubles table tennis has been axed to make way for a new three - person team event , a Ryder Cup - style combo of doubles and singles matches .
O is for Olympic village
A centrepiece of the 160 - acre Olympic village is the ' Casual Dining Hall ' - open 24 hours a day for ' massive servings of western food and buffets ' , provided by American caterers Aramark .
Around 16,000 Olympians and 7,000 Paralympians will be fed a choice of 800 dishes , including Moroccan lemon chicken and Senegalese stew .
Under rules designed to police drug-use - and to protect sponsorship agreements - athletes are not allowed to bring their own food into the village ; the Americans have already announced that they will feed their team elsewhere .
To entertain the athletes during long periods of down - time , the village will have a library , a DVD room and sports facilities , including table tennis and a place to play ' sand arc ball ' ( a cross between shuffleboard and snooker ) .
Chinese Taiji boxing and other performances will be staged in the central Flag Raising Square .
All rooms will be equipped with broadband , and MTV China will be broadcast on the village 's private television network ( programmes to include 100 MTV Ways to Rock the Olympic Games ) .
Village residents will sleep in two - and three - person rooms in beds that are 6ft 7in long ; basketball giants such as 7ft 6in Yao Ming will have special extenders added .
Tap water in athletes ' rooms will be drinkable , but the Australian team have been instructed by their dietician not to drink it .
' They should only drink bottled water , ' Dr Fiona Pelly said , warning also that there could be problems ' eating salads or fruit or anything that is washed in the water supply ' .
The Aussies are also smarting after being refused permission to bring in jars of Vegemite .
Athletes will travel to and from venues in a fleet of 50 lithium - battery - powered buses - but it is unclear whether any will make it into the city itself .
In May , market - research firm Access Asia reported that the chances of athletes being allowed out of the village to explore were ' minimal ' , dubbing the compound ' Stalag Beijing ' .
P is for protests
Podium protests against China 's human - rights record are a likelihood this summer .
Athletes planning to make a statement may want to look to these memorable stands for tips .
The silent gesture
200 m runners Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised clenched , gloved fists on the winners ' podium in 1968 ( a gesture in support of the civil - rights movement ) and were expelled from the US Olympic team .
' I felt it was time for the young black American male to stand up for his cause , ' Smith told The Observer this year .
Caslavska 's averted gaze
Czechoslovakian gymnast Vera Caslavska made a subtler ( no less brave ) podium protest at the ' 68 Games .
After coming equal first in the floor exercises with a competitor from the USSR , Caslavska cast her eyes down for the duration of the Soviet national anthem - an act of protest against the country 's invasion of her homeland two months earlier .
After the Games , she was punished by being denied employment and permission to travel ; it was not until the Soviet Union fell that her gesture was nationally recognised .
Fatso and the Aussies
The official animal mascots of the Sydney Games were so unpopular in Australia that a comedy TV show was moved to create an alternative : ' Fatso the Fat - Arsed Wombat ' .
He was such a hit that swimmers Michael Klim , Grant Hackett and Susie O'Neill took Fatso on to the podium with them , upsetting the Games ' organisers .
' I did n't understand its significance , ' Klim said of his protest .
' I just thought it was a wombat ... yeah , with a big arse . '
Q is for queue - jumping
... and other undesirable Chinese habits that have been targeted by the government .
It is part of a general campaign to clean up the behaviour of the locals before the tourists arrive , and has included a poster and text - message drive to discourage shoving , swearing and belching , as well as a monthly ' Queueing Day ' that asked locals to ' voluntarily wait in line , be polite and put others first ' .
Male taxi drivers have been told not to shave their heads or grow beards , while female cabbies have been instructed not to wear earrings or adopt ' too fancy ' hairstyles .
The biggest clampdown , however , has been on spitting , declared the city 's worst habit by the Capital Ethics Development Office .
There are some signs of success : a recent report showed that public hocking is down by 2.4 per cent .
R is for Reese Hoffa
World champion shot - putter Hoffa ( also a Rubik 's Cube expert ) has a unique celebration : ' the turkey trot ' , in which the American jogs a victory lap while nibbling on a giant turkey leg .
S is for Speedo and the swimsuit war
Speedo's LZR Racer has lived up to billing as ' the world 's fastest swim suit ' - athletes wearing the hi-tech outfit have set 38 new world records ( out of 42 ) since its February launch .
Chaos has followed : sponsorship contracts have been broken , coaches have complained of ' technological doping ' , and Speedo 's rivals have rushed to create their own competitive outfits in time for Beijing .
Here are the major players .
Speedo LZR Racer
The new benchmark in swimsuit technology , with a ' compression zone ' around the torso that counters muscle vibration , Speedo's is the suit to beat .
See it on Michael Phelps , among others .
Arena R-evolution +
The Italian firm's new seamless suit has calmed the fears of France 's 400 m Olympic champion Laure Manaudou , who burst into tears after losing to a Speedo - clad rival in April .
Mizuno Swim
So unpopular with the Japanese team that they have been allowed to break their contract and choose their own suits ; 100 m breaststroke champ Kosuke Kitajima went straight to Speedo .
Adidas
Members of the Adidas - sponsored German team - which includes Britta Steffen - begged to switch to the LZR Racer in April , but were appeased by the company 's new suit after tests in June .
T is for timekeeping
At the ancient Olympics , the Greeks measured seconds using ropes attached to wooden beams .
Things have moved on a bit - this year 's equipment , provided by Omega , will be the most exact so far , thanks to such new technologies as micro- lightweight transponders in every athlete 's bib , and the Scan 'O'Vision Star photo - finish camera , which takes more than 2,000 images each second ( the starting pistol is recorded visually because races can be won by margins smaller than the time taken for its sound to cover the distance ) .
A false start registers if the footpad underneath an athlete 's shoe registers the slightest change in pressure within 0.1sec of the gun , because it is physically impossible to react in less time .
Omega have also introduced GPS technology to monitor the positions of canoeists , sailors and rowers , while the scoreboards will display results in English and Chinese characters .
U is for Ueta
Tatsuya Ueta is possibly our favourite non-athlete heading to Beijing .
Japan 's men's volleyball coach was reduced to tears when his team qualified for their first Olympic appearance for 16 years .
When Ueta first met the team in 2005 , the players were in such a slump that , according to the coach , they smoked , ' did n't eat breakfast ' and ' did n't even say hello ' .
Now ?
' I 'll say it straight , ' said a wet - eyed Ueta in June , ' we 'll be aiming for a medal in Beijing . '
V is for Victory Spike
At 93 grams , each Nike Zoom Victory Spike weighs less than a half - eaten chocolate bar and is the lightest running spike ever produced .
The secret of the shoe , which could be worn in Beijing by Chinese hurdler Liu Xiang , lies in the attractive red-and - black crisscross design - ' flywire ' supports , modelled on the chords of a suspension bridge , that keep the thing together without the need for any excess material .
An everyday - wear version without the spikes , available for £ 85 , is titled the Nike Zoom Victory Plus .
W is for the Water Cube
The venue for Beijing 's swimming and diving events looks pretty average from the inside : couple of pools , couple of diving boards .
Until you look at the walls and ceiling , made of futuristic air - filled pillows that appear almost translucent and heat the building when it 's sunny .
From the outside the building is even more impressive : a blue - glowing cube that looks like a giant blob of bath bubbles , trimmed to shape with the help of a set square .
We 'll have one in London for 2012 , please .
X is for Xinhua News
China 's state - sponsored news agency is often criticised for its blinkered take on world events , but it has been the source of some wonderful Olympic stories .
Take , for example , a news release last November saying that white mice were to be co-opted as poison testers in the Olympic village ( salad , rice , milk and other foods were to be fed to the rodents 24 hours before reaching the mouths of visiting athletes ) .
Or the announcement , last month , that an official Chinese cheer , featuring the double thumbs - up , ' will be popularised among spectators in the weeks leading up to the Olympics ' .
Or golden ' Chinglish ' headlines such as ' Immigrators embrace Beijing Olympic torch with enthusiasm ' .
We could go on .
Y is for Yelena Isinbayeva
The reigning Olympic , world and European champion ; the only woman to pole - vault more than five metres ; breaker of 21 world records ( most of them her own ) .
The Russian is a tyrant with a fibreglass stick , and , after Carolina Klüft 's decision not to compete in the heptathlon , is likely to be as flawless as any female athlete competing in Beijing .
Another gold for her collection is a virtual certainty , with American Jenn Stuczynski , her closest rival , lodged around the 4.9 m mark .
Sometimes , a lack of serious competition makes for boring sport .
But when an athlete is this good ...
Z is for Zara Phillips
... and the other world - class athetes who wo n't be competing in Beijing .
From the British camp , Jessica Ennis and Mark Lewis - Francis are definitely out , while Paula Radcliffe and Nicola Sanders face a struggle to be fit in time ; Phillips was ruled out by a leg injury to her horse , Toytown .
Elsewhere , Australian swimmer Nick D'Arcy will almost certainly miss out , having been dropped following an alleged drunken bar fight , while America 's gold - medal gymnast Paul Hamm is a doubt after missing the US Olympic trials with a broken hand ( he has since petitioned for inclusion ) .
Bulgaria 's Milen Dobrev will definitely be unable to defend his weightlifting gold due to a back injury .
Tennis players Andy Roddick , Richard Gasquet and 2000 silver medallist Tommy Haas are preserving themselves for the US Open ; while Everton footballer Joseph Yobo will miss Beijing after Nigeria 's team secretary forgot to include his name on the squad list .

Prime Minister Gordon Brown has confirmed that Britain is to send more troops to Afghanistan in order to keep pressure on the Taleban .
The announcement comes after talks between Gordon Brown and US President Bush in London .
Nick Robinson reports .
I ’ve been digging through the 44 page State of the Nation ’s Housing report put out by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University .
The report is chock full of excellent data yet once again they miss on a few of their forecasts .
I ’ll get to the data in the current report later but let us look at what the center director Nicolas Retsinas had to say less than two years ago in September of 2006 .
The reason it is important to dig deep into this forecasting is that so much credence is placed on these reports from many people in our country .
“ September 24 , 2006
The Providence Sunday Journal
HOUSING BUST AHEAD . ”
The headline hints of catastrophe : a dot - com repeat , a bubble bursting , an economic apocalypse .
Cassandra , though , can stop wailing : the expected price corrections mark a slowing in the rate of increase — not a precipitous decline .
This will not spark a chain reaction that will devastate home owners , builders , and communities .
Contradicting another gloomy seer , Chicken Little , the sky is not falling .
Let me alleviate some fears .
Fear One : Prices will plummet .
From the start , the much - vaunted housing “ boom ” was an uneven phenomenon , driven by a strong demand for housing , coupled with constrained supply , particularly on the two coasts .
In much of the nation , housing prices rose modestly ; in a few areas , prices did not budge .
In those overheated markets — often fueled by immigration — prices were rising by as much as 20 percent a year .
But even with soaring demand and limited supply , that escalation was not sustainable .
Even with too - good - to - be - true mortgages , people cannot afford to buy homes that cost five times their income .
So in those overheated markets , moderation is expected .
Moderation means that prices will stop rising at meteoric rates :
The home owner who expected a double - digit profit after one year will be disappointed .
A home will once again be more of a domicile , rather than an investment .
In some regions , prices will flatten , rising around the inflation rate , which is the historic average .
The fundamentals behind high prices — strong demand ( more households will form in the next decade than in the last ) and constrained supply — persist . ”
How can someone point out so many right things yet be so wrong ?
First , there is a clear acknowledgment that coastal areas will moderate .
There is also an acknowledgment that some people cannot afford homes without “ too - good - to - be- true - mortgages ” and incomes may be a problem .
How is this dispelling the myth or the fear that prices will plummet ?
A lot of what is said is the exact reason prices have fallen !
This is the problem with this type of analysis because nowhere in this explanation is there a reason for why housing prices will not fall .
In fact , we are given many reasons for it to decline .
And by the way , we now know that across the board this is a national housing bubble bursting .
Talk about being massively wrong .
Let us see what he has to say about the next fear :
“ Fear Two : The economy will collapse .
Housing now represents over 20 percent of the gross domestic product ( compared with 18 percent from the manufacturing sector ) .
For most families , the investment in a home constitutes de facto savings : the build - up of equity is in the trillions of dollars .
And home owners have tapped into that equity , using their homes as ATM machines for refinancing and home - equity loans .
Consequently , we are “ well housed . ”
Indeed , two bathrooms , air conditioning , garages — the amenities our grandparents called luxuries — are standard .
All this activity has fueled consumer spending .
A Cassandra fear is that as home prices moderate , the moderation will show up in the gross domestic product .
Yet , again , moderation is not a free - fall .
The housing market will adjust slowly , with fewer sales and starts .
History tells us that housing booms are not eternal — that most end — enabling incomes to catch up with prices .
Furthermore , builders have been building to meet demand .
In regions where the number of households is growing , so is the need for housing .
That demand will not slake .
So the incentives for developers remain strong .
We will see more construction over the next decade than over the last — and the last decade set a record . ”
Again , the fact that he mentions that homes were used as ATMs to fuel the boom is another point for a housing bust and also , an economic slowdown .
This is the type of analysis put out by this guy during the housing heyday that it is important to publicly put this stuff out now since I see many citing the 2008 Harvard study as a source to go for .
Good data in the report but again , we see conclusions that simply do not make sense .
This guy and David Lereah for example were cheerleaders during the housing boom .
Only in this case , there is proof that he does understand the exact reasons for why housing would completely bust yet arrives at some conclusion that is n’t backed up with data .
In fact , everything in the report that supposedly was n’t going to happen occurred exactly as he stated .
Housing is collapsing and it is taking the economy down with it .
Now you would think that one would acknowledge such bad forecasting but let us look at what is put out this week :
“( INMAN )
For now , center director Nicolas Retsinas said mortgage rates have “ barely responded ” to aggressive easing by the Federal Reserve .
While the supply of for - sale vacant units continues to grow , tighter underwriting standards have locked many would - be home buyers out of the market .
And with home prices falling in most metropolitan areas , homeowners are remaining on the sidelines , he said .
“ At some point demand will bounce back , ” Retsinas said in a press release announcing the release of the report .
“ Historically , housing markets recover only after the economy has entered a recession and a combination of falling mortgage interest rates and house prices have improved housing affordability .
It is difficult to judge how far away from these conditions we may be .
It will take longer this time to rebound given the unusually high levels of foreclosures and constrained credit markets . ”
Bwahaha !
I think the majority of the public would categorize a recession as a “ bad ” economic thing – something that in 2006 was not going to happen .
So now , the implication is housing prices collapsing and the oncoming recession are good because they will increase affordability .
Was n’t that fear number 1 and 2 that supposedly were only part of the tin foil hat housing bear crew ?
Talk about never having to say you were absolutely wrong .
Mea culpa not welcome here .
The reason I bring this up is that we are seeing the exact same social phenomenon that occurred during the Great Depression .
Folks kept listening to so - called experts even after the market was pummeling people into the ground .
The benefit this time is information is quickly and easily disseminated .
You can easily verify what people said a few years ago , measure it up to public data , and reach your own conclusions to who is right .
This reminds me of mortgage brokers who swindled people into crappy loans who are now “ foreclosure specialist ” helping people from losing their homes because of , crappy mortgages .
Surely you can see the circle stupidity in that ?
Or what about letting major banks have a say in the mortgage bailout legislation ?
Are these really the folks we should be looking to for advice on getting out of this ditch ?
A ditch which was dug out with their own shovel of incompetence .
2008 State of Housing – Los Angeles Style
The overall report is still overly optimistic about housing .
After all , this is the same center that completely missed the housing bust .
By the way folks , it is busting .
We can debate the semantics of it but homes being off 14.1 percent nationwide and 30 percent off in California is a bust in my book .
Now unless they quantify a bust by being off by 25 percent nationwide and 50 percent off in California we may be a few years away from that .
Given the current trend and what is currently going on in our economy , the above is very likely .
So let us take a look at some points in the new 2008 article :
“ Although subprime loans and new types of mortgages have been linked to a temporary increase in homeownership , the run-up in homeownership rates predates the proliferation of such loans .
In fact , the largest homeownership gains occurred before 2001 when the subprime share was still small and price appreciation was only starting to take off .
Several factors contributed to the surge in homeownership between 1994 and 2000 .
First , mortgage rates had started to decline in the 1980s and stood at much lower levels by the end of the 1991 recession .
Second , the economy had entered a period of unusually vigorous and broad - based growth , with strong increases in incomes across the board .
Third , home prices in some markets had fallen in the wake of the 1991 recession , improving affordability for many buyers .
Fourth , federal regulators had stepped up pressure on financial institutions to meet the mortgage needs of low - income communities and minority borrowers .
And fifth , the prime mortgage market had begun to rely on automated underwriting and statistical models of loan performance , enabling lenders to relax downpayment and debt - to - income requirements while maintaining about the same expected default rates .
Lenders were thus able to identify a broader range of borrowers that qualified for prime credit .
The expansion of mortgage credit in the 1990s was therefore accomplished with traditional products and without adding much to risk .
The growth in mortgage credit after 2003 , in contrast , came largely from gains in much riskier subprime , interest - only , and payment - option loans .
These novel mortgage products provided only a temporary lift to homeownership .
Indeed , the national homeownership rate peaked in 2004 and has since retreated below its 2003 level . ”
Once again we see the same logic that was used in 2006 .
Many of the reasons given here are exactly why we are facing a housing bust .
First , we are told that the homeownership rate increased even before the subprime bonanza .
Yet we are then given 5 reasons for the easy lax lending mortgage environment we have lived in .
Incomes did not increase strongly during this time .
That is why credit eased to keep consumption up !
Plus , the technology bust of the early part of the decade wiped out much of that pseudo wealth .
The “ stepped up pressure ” by regulators to increase homeownerships in lower income communities was a big sack of mortgage crap .
This is where most of the egregious mortgage fraud occurred and all those housing gains are now gone including many hopes and dreams from people in these areas .
Again we are led to believe by the implication that homeownership rates actually increased for legitimate reasons but this again is false .
The next year with the Alt - A pay option ARM implosion we will once again prove this Harvard report wrong .
They are still under the impression that this mortgage mess is in the 9th inning .
But immigration will save the day !
“ With many housing markets in a tailspin , the underpinnings of long - term demand have come into question .
But unless the economy enters a sharp , prolonged recession that dampens immigration or slows household formations , the current housing cycle in and of itself is unlikely to diminish the long - run growth of households .
The propensity for Americans to form households is driven largely by the age distribution of the population , slowly changing social norms , and the pace of immigration .
In the decade ahead , the aging of the echo boomers into young adulthood , the longer life expectancies of the baby boomers , and projected annual immigration of 1.2 million all favor an increase in net household formations .
Meanwhile , the impacts of recent social trends are likely to be minimal .
Although deferred first marriages , high divorce rates , and low remarriage rates will continue to make single - person households the fastest - growing household type , these trends have started to level off .
Assuming that age - specific household formations remain
about constant , changes in the number and age distribution of the adult population should lift household growth from 12.6 million in 1995 - 2005 to 14.4 million in 2010 - 2020 .
With their high levels of immigration and high rates of natural increase , Hispanics and Asians will contribute significantly to household growth .
Minorities are expected to account for more than two thirds of the net increase in households over the next decade , with the foreign born alone contributing at least one - third of the gains .
Because minorities have lower average incomes and wealth , some have argued that their growing presence in housing markets will be a drag on home prices and rents .
But when the minority share of households increased from 20.2 percent in 1990 to 29.2 percent in 2007 , rents and house prices still rose ahead of household incomes .
While their low incomes may force them to spend less on non-housing items as housing costs rise , minority households will nevertheless provide broad demand support to housing markets in the years ahead . ”
Again , great data yet how can they reach such wrong conclusions ?
First , they tell us that immigration growth from minority groups is going to increase in the future .
Yet they also explain that many of these people will be in the lower income brackets .
So how does this bode well for higher home prices ?
If anything , this is a case that there will be a higher demand for affordable housing which is still strongly lacking in this country and is almost non-existent in California .
And again , why use the gains of the housing bubble as a comparison measure ?
If anything , that should be a caveat as to why prices are still inflated .
Americans are also having less children and getting married later .
The 1950s picket white fence archetype home is no longer a reality for many .
We now live in a dual income society where fuel costs make it highly expensive for most middle class Americans to live out in the boondocks and commute to work .
Many are choosing to be single .
And as highlighted by the Great Depression , many folks delay getting married and forming households when times are tight .
Aside from this Pollyanna view we are in a recession and this psychology pushes people from buying homes .
They also tell us that the baby boomers will be retiring soon in mass numbers .
Many will retire to smaller homes or retire out of the country .
This will only add more inventory to an oversaturated market .
Keep in mind that the first baby boomers are already retiring just in lieu with the massive rise in foreclosures and over abundance of housing inventory .
Good data yet most of the implications point to less households forming in the sense that people will not buy a home .
That is until prices come in line with incomes .
Let us end with another section in the report :
“ With credit markets in such disarray , the for - sale housing inventory at record levels , and only small declines in interest rates , emerging from today ’s housing slump could take some time .
Although demand fundamentals should support average annual completions
of more than 1.9 million units over the next decade ( including single - family and multifamily units plus manufactured homes ) , the housing market must first work off the one million or more excess units that were vacant and for sale or temporarily taken off the market at the beginning of 2008 .
This could trim underlying demand to an average of 1.8 million new units annually in the decade ahead .
If the economy slips into a severe recession , the prolonged contraction could drive down the sustainable level of housing demand by slowing the loss of older units , forcing more households to double up , and reducing sales of second homes .
But in the case of a mild
downturn , which most economists expect , the fundamentals of demand are likely to drive a strong rebound in housing once prices bottom out and the economy begins to recover . ”
Oh !
Have to throw in that little caveat eh ?
Well most economists did n’t see this housing bubble coming and most economists do n’t work for Harvard .

Now that Obama and McCain are on the cusp of choosing Vice Presidents , maybe it 's time to take a look at 10 of the most memorable backup plans , and what they might want to avoid .
1. Chester Arthur was Canadian !
[ Garfield 's VP ] Chester Arthur took office under the thickest cloud of suspicion .
As a lieutenant in Senator Roscoe Conkling 's political machine , Arthur held one of the most lucrative positions in government — collector for the port of New York .
For seven years , Arthur raked in approximately $ 40,000 annually ( about $ 700,000 today ) , running a corrupt spoils system for thousands of payroll employees .
With so much money and power , Arthur developed an affinity for fancy clothes and earned the nickname " the Gentleman Boss . " 
But his luck did n't last .
President Rutherford
Hayes eventually stepped in and fired him from the post .
Even with the kickback scandal and claims that he'd been born in Canada ( which should 've disqualified him for the vice presidency ) , Arthur still managed to get elected on James Garfield 's 1880 ticket .
After Garfield passed away 199 days into his presidency , Arthur did n't hesitate to sign the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act .
Much to the chagrin of Conkling , the Act revamped civil service by effectively killing the same patronage system that made Arthur very , very rich .
In cleaning up civil service , Arthur also cleaned up his reputation , and he exited the White House a hero .
2. William Rufus de Vane King was ( Pretty Definitely ) Gay
[ Franklin Pierce 's VP ] William R. King was sworn into office in Cuba , becoming the only executive officer to take the oath on foreign soil .
King had gone to Cuba to recuperate from tuberculosis and severe alcoholism , but it did n't work .
He died in 1853 after being vice president for just 25 days .
That might not be the most memorable thing about King , though .
It 's widely rumored that the former VP was homosexual .
Further still , he 's suspected of being James Buchanan 's lover .
Neither King nor Buchanan ever married , and they lived together in Washington for 15 years before Buchanan became president .
Of course , King 's predilection for wearing scarves and wigs only fanned the rumors .
President Andrew Jackson used to call him " Miss Nancy , "  and Aaron Brown , a fellow Southern Democrat , dubbed him " Aunt Fancy . " 
3. Henry Wallace Diverted funds to his Guru
[ FDR 's 2nd VP ]
Henry Wallace was a dedicated devotee of Eastern mysticism .
While serving as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture in the 1930s , he allegedly sent his guru to Mongolia under the pretense of collecting grasses that could withstand drought .
In reality , Wallace was diverting funds to help his guru hunt for evidence that Christ had visited Asia .
But it was n't Wallace 's spiritual beliefs that landed him America 's No. 2 job .
Wallace was a big Franklin Roosevelt fan and supported his entire platform , which is why Roosevelt handpicked him as his third - term running mate in 1940 .
Wallace was n't popular with the Democratic Party , but when Roosevelt made it clear he would n't run without him , the party acquiesced .
As vice president , Wallace made many international goodwill trips .
Most famously , he traveled to the Soviet Union , where he experienced a political transformation that resulted in him becoming an avowed Soviet apologist .
His communist leanings did nothing for his image , especially once he became secretary of commerce under President Truman .
In 1948 , Wallace unsuccessfully ran for president on the Progressive Party ticket , espousing views that sounded shockingly Marxist .
He even described corporations as " midget Hitlers "  attempting to crush the labor class .
But nobody can say Wallace did n't know how to own up to his mistakes .
In 1952 , he recanted his support of the Soviet Union in a magazine article called " Where I was Wrong . " 
By then , however , his political career was over .
Wallace spent the rest of his life conducting agricultural experiments on his farm in New York .

4. Richard M. Johnson's 3 black mistresses
[ Van Buren 's VP ] Despite his credentials as a war hero and a Kentucky senator , Vice President Richard M. Johnson was never accepted in Washington .
Perhaps that 's because he dressed like a farmhand , cursed like a sailor , and made no secret of his three black mistresses , who were also his slaves .
The first mistress bore him two daughters before she passed away ; the second tried to run off with a Native American chief , but Johnson captured and resold her ; and the third was the second one 's sister .
Johnson attempted to introduce this third mistress into polite society , but the couple was n't well - received .
With the support of Andrew Jackson , Johnson landed the vice presidency under Martin Van Buren in 1836 .
After four years of public relations disasters , Jackson withdrew his support .
Nonetheless , Van Buren kept Johnson on his ticket , and the two lost their re-election bid in 1840 .
5. Aaron Burr was a Cassanova
[ Jefferson 's VP ]
No story on vice presidents would be complete without Aaron Burr — best known for shooting and killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel in 1804 .
After the incident , Burr went back to presiding over the Senate .
From there , he plotted a treasonous conspiracy to become emperor of the western United States and Mexico .
The plan could have worked , but one of Burr 's co-conspirators ratted him out .
He was tried in 1807 before the Supreme Court , which found him not guilty , mainly because he had n't actually committed the treason yet .
A free man , Burr turned his sights on Florida .
He went to France and tried to convince Napoleon Bonaparte to help him conquer the swampland , but that plan foundered , too .
Although his political high jinks often failed , Burr consistently found success with the ladies .
After his wife died in 1794 , Burr remained a bachelor for 40 years , making the acquaintance of several eligible socialites .
He enjoyed flirtations with Philadelphia debutantes , as well as a widow named Dolley Payne Todd — later known as Dolley Madison , wife of James Madison .
At age 76 , Burr married a wealthy widow of ill - repute and plundered her fortune .
Citing numerous infidelities on his part , she filed for divorce and was actually granted it .
Unfortunately for her , it came through on the day Burr died .
6. John Tyler borrowed cash to get to his inauguration
[ Harrison's VP ]
When President Harrison succumbed to pneumonia in 1841 after only a month in office , John Tyler became the first vice president to take the Oval Office as the result of a president 's death .
Understandably , he was totally unprepared for the job .
Like previous VPs , Tyler had expected to carry the title without responsibilities .
He 'd actually taken such a lax approach to the position that he was enjoying life on his Virginia farm when a messenger brought news of Harrison 's demise .
Tyler had to borrow money from a neighbor to catch the riverboat back to Washington .
As president , Tyler 's administration was largely unremarkable , except that he annexed the Republic of Texas and became the first president to have Congress override his veto .
Tyler was also the first president to receive no official state recognition of his death .
Why ?
By the time of his passing in 1862 , he was an official in the Confederacy .
7. Andrew Johnson took the oath Sloshed
[ Lincoln 's VP ]
Andrew Johnson took his 1865 vice - presidential oath drunk as a skunk and belligerent as hell .
Having grown up dirt poor , Johnson felt the aristocracy in Washington had abused his kinfolk .
Glassy - eyed and smelling of whiskey , he reminded Congress , the Supreme Court , the Cabinet , and pretty much everyone within hearing distance that they owed their positions to " plebeians "  such as himself , then kissed the Bible and staggered away .
Needless to say , his address was poorly received .
The New York World opined , " To think that one frail life stands between this insolent , clownish creature and the presidency !
May God bless and spare Abraham Lincoln ! " 
Unfortunately , God did n't .
The South surrendered six days before Lincoln 's assassination , leaving Johnson to handle Reconstruction — a job he bungled so completely that Congress moved to impeach him .
Johnson avoided being booted out of office by just one vote .
8. John Breckenridge Hid Out in Cuba
[ Buchanan's VP ]
By all accounts , John C. Breckenridge was a Kentucky gentleman in the grandest sense .
He had an impressive career as a lawyer and a representative in the Kentucky House .
More notably , at age 36 , he became the youngest vice president in history .
But , like Aaron Burr , things took a turn for Breckenridge when he was charged with treason .
In September 1861 , only a few months after his vice presidential term had ended , Union and Confederate forces invaded his home state of Kentucky .
Breckenridge cast his lot with the Confederates , and the federal government promptly indicted him .
Breckenridge headed south and became Jefferson Davis ' secretary of war .
But when the Confederacy surrendered in 1865 , Breckenridge was forced to go on the lam .
He hid for the next two months in Georgia and Florida before escaping to Cuba .
Breckinridge , his wife , and their children spent the next four years in exile , wandering through Canada , England , Europe , and the Middle East , until President Andrew Johnson issued a General Amnesty Proclamation on Christmas in 1868 .
The following March , Breckenridge returned to the country with his family , but his name was n't officially cleared until 1958 , when a Kentucky circuit court judge dismissed his indictment .
9. Nelson Rockefeller tore down that wall
[ Ford 's VP ] Nelson Rockefeller , as his name suggests , was really , really rich .
After a brief stint managing his family 's property and running oil companies , he turned to public service by taking a job in the State Department .
Rockefeller quickly gained a reputation as a rather strong - willed person .
In 1933 , he commissioned Mexican artist Diego Rivera to paint a large - scale mural in the lobby of the RCA Building at Rockefeller Center .
The mural featured a likeness of Vladimir Lenin , and the overt reference to communism offended Rockefeller .
He asked Rivera to change it to a face of an unknown man , and the artist refused .
In response , Rockefeller had the whole mural torn down and carted out in pieces .
Rockefeller was equally dissatisfied with his gig as vice president .
He refused to run with Ford on the Republican ticket in 1976 .
10 . Spiro Agnew , the Archie Bunker of the White House
[ Nixon 's VP ] Spiro Agnew , who preferred to be called Ted , was a seemingly safe choice for Richard Nixon 's running mate in 1968 — mainly because he faded easily into the background .
But once in office , Agnew thrust himself into the limelight .
By delivering a series of divisive speeches defending the Vietnam War and attacking peaceniks , Agnew became the crotchety Archie Bunker of the White House .
He lambasted his enemies , peppering his rants with phrases such as " supercilious sophisticates , "  " vicars of vacillation , "  and " pusillanimous pussyfooting . " 
Still , much of the country loved him , especially as he remained unsullied by the Watergate scandal .
When word got out that the Justice Department was investigating him for extortion and bribery , Agnew vehemently denied the charges .
In September of 1973 , Agnew spoke at the National Federation of Republican Women in front of thousands of screaming fans , many bearing " Spiro is our Hero "  signs .
He swore to them , " I will not resign if indicted ! " 
Two weeks later , however , he did just that .
Agnew agreed to a plea bargain that involved leaving his post as vice president and paying $ 150,000 in back taxes .
A former lawyer , Agnew was disbarred and took up writing to pay off his debts .
In 1976 , he penned The Canfield Decision , a tale of a vice president who becomes involved with militant Zionists and is consumed by his own ambition .
In 1980 , he covered some of the same ground in his autobiography , Go Quietly " ¦ Or Else .
For our latest mission , we turned a little league baseball game in Hermosa Beach , California into a major league event .
Enjoy the video below and then go behind the scenes with our mission report and photos .
In order to pull this mission off we worked with the commissioner of the Hermosa Beach Little League .
The commissioner provided us with the names , numbers , and batting order of all of the players for both teams .
He told us the 2 PM game between the Mudcats and the Lugnuts would be ideal for our mission , and allowed us to arrive early to set up all of our equipment .
He was the only person involved with the league who knew what was going to happen .
The players , coaches , and parents were kept completely in the dark .
The league ’s games are six innings , and we planned our mission to unfold slowly , heightening with each passing inning .
As the game started , the only unusual thing anyone could notice was a large truck parked just pass the outfield wall ( housing our jumbotron to be revealed later . )
All of the cameras remained hidden away .
Agent Fair screams for her favorite lugnut
In the bottom of the first inning , our agents started to arrive .
We told everyone to wear either red or black , the team colors for the Mudcats and Lugnuts .
The commissioner gave us baseball caps for both teams , which we passed out to our agents .
In a typical game , the stands are completely empty as the player ’s parents sit in lawn chairs right next to the field .
By the end of the first inning all of our agents were in the stands cheering like crazy for the teams .
Agents Sessler , Newell , and Blumenthal
Three agents played the role of crazy shirtless dudes , painting “ Mudcats ” across their bare chests .
These fans were particularly vocal in getting chants together .
The players started looking back at the crowd with puzzled expressions .
A few in the dugout peered around the corner to see what was going on .
The game was in progress , so they had no choice but to keep playing and decide to figure it out later .
Agent Mercer vends peanuts
At the top of the 2nd inning , vendors started appearing in the crowd , “ selling ” peanuts and popcorn to the fans and parents .
( They were free . )
Agent Cicci gives out programs
The commissioner also got us “ baseball card ” photos of each of the players .
Using these photos we were able to put together a full color program of the day ’s game .
Agent Cicci walked through the audience handing out the programs .
Excited parents kept asking him who he was and how he had put the program together , but he just shrugged and said , “ I just work for the field .
It ’s a big game today . ”
At the top of the 3rd inning , things really started to change as we revealed that NBC Sports was covering the game live , with the unveiling of our huge jumbotron in the outfield .
The jumbotron rose mechanically from the truck
The Mudcat dugout reacts to the jumbotron
We collaborated with NBC Sports on this mission , and they took care of renting the jumbotron and hiring legendary sportscaster Jim Gray to call the game .
Jim ran the play - by - play and I served as his color man .
The two of us sat in a booth at the back of the stands , and we were able to make announcements on the field ’s PA system .
It was tons of fun watching the players react as the jumbotron rose in the outfield .
The game had to momentarily stop as everyone settled down .
“ It ’s a beautiful day for baseball ! ”
The jumbotron broadcast live footage from the game , including instant replays , and we projected photos of each player as he came up to bat .
In the next inning , mascots for both teams arrived .
We were n’t able to find “ mudcat ” or “ lugnut ” costumes , so we just went with random animals that fit the teams colors .
The “ Nutty ” Chicken
The “ Muddy ” Bear
The younger brothers and sisters of the players on the field had a great time interacting with our mascots , although some Lugnut fans got a little violent with the Mudcat bear , chasing and hitting him repeatedly .
For our final touch , we worked with NBC Sports to get the Goodyear blimp to fly over the game and film the action from above .
As it turned out , the blimp ’s home base was just a few miles from Hermosa Beach , and they were able to fly over us on their way to another game .
It was an unusually foggy afternoon , and we were terrified that the blimp would n’t be seen .
They ended up flying in extra low to avoid the fog .
The blimp has an LED screen on the bottom of it , and we had them project , “ Go Mudcats !
Go Lugnuts !
Welcome to the big league ! ”
The crowd cheered for the blimp and parents started walking around asking our fake fans what was going on .
Our agents insisted the game was being broadcast live on NBC and that they were just big fans of the Mudcats and Lugnuts .
The parents could n’t get an answer as to why it was happening , so they just sat back and enjoyed the fun .
A few parents mentioned they wished they were home so they could see it live on TV .
When the game was over , our fans sought out autographs from the players .
The day ended with a press conference with both teams .
Agents Thorn and Dippold played journalists and grilled the players .
A few days later , I got an email from a parent ( who must have found Improv Everywhere via Google search ) :
I believe you guys are behind the “ Hermosa Beach Little League ” taping that took place Saturday , March 10th , 2007 .
The parents will be talking about this for a long time … the kids even longer .
My son was a pitcher on the Lugnuts .
We had a long / tough season last year .
Saturday made up for everything .
I want to sincerely thank you for making Saturday so unbelievable .
It was like a birthday , Christmas , and New Years Eve captured in a few amazing hours .
Thanks a million for a once in a lifetime opportunity .
Mission Accomplished .

It 's 100 years since SOS came into force across the world as the standard signal for ships in distress .
But times have changed in the rescue business .
Before the advent of radio if your ship got into trouble on some far off stretch of roiling sea , that trouble was not easy to get out of .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Communication off the ship could only be achieved with other ships within distance , using either lights , flags or flares .
If you were in dense fog or in a howling gale far out at sea , and you started taking on water , the first communication most sailors would make was heaven - wards .
At the tail end of the 19th Century , radio changed that .
It 's easy to forget today , but in the early days of radio there was no voice .
It was too easy for someone to hear the C and the Q and not the D and ignore it completely and that happened on more than one occasion

On the failings of CQD If you wanted to say you were in trouble , if you wanted to say anything in fact , you had to do it through morse code .
The code had been born after the advent of the telegraph and when the telegraph went " wireless " it continued in the new format .
" In the early days when they were sending a radio signal there was no way of modulating .
The only thing you could do was turn a transmitter on or off , " says Carlos Eavis , amateur radio manager of the Radio Society of Great Britain .
Calling signals
Wireless telegraphy - or radio as we prefer to style it now - had its biggest early impact on maritime communication .
Ships had been working out ways to communicate with other ships for centuries , but radio opened up the possibility of reliable communication with ships that were out of sight for the first time .
And the most important of all calls that a ship 's radio operator could make was a distress signal indicating the vessel was in danger of sinking .
But if your ship got into trouble on its Atlantic crossing in the early years of the 20th Century you would n't necessarily have signalled SOS .
Before SOS there was CQD .
In early radio morse was the only way to communicate
The story is told in Karl Barslaag 's 1935 book SOS to the Rescue .
British radio operators on ships tended to have come straight from work on land - based telegraph and brought their signals with them .
CQ was a general call to demand attention from all stations , preceding a time signal or other announcement .
The Marconi company , the dominant power in early radio , suggested this signal be appended with a D to work as a distress signal .
It did n't stand , as many have imagined , for " Come Quick Danger " , merely indicating " attention , distress " .
But there was a problem .
Dash - dot - dash - dot , dash - dash - dot - dash , dash - dot - dot was not the easiest combination to pick up .
" It was too easy for someone to hear the C and the Q and not the D and ignore it completely and that happened on more than one occasion , " says Mr Eavis .
Intense politics
At a conference in Berlin in 1906 the international wireless telegraphy community got together to try to agree something that would be both internationally acceptable , and impossible to mistake .
The Italians were using SSSDDD , but it was the German suggestion of SOE - dot - dot - dot , dash - dash - dash , dot - that caught the imagination .
But it was felt that it suffered from the same problem as CQD .
The E , being one dot , could easily be missed .
THE CONTENDERS Marconi : CQD Italians : SSSDDD Germans : SOE / SOS
Eventually the conference plumped for - dot - dot - dot , dash - dash - dash , dot - dot - dot - a signal that is hard to mistake for anything else in the world of morse .
" SOS is very simple you are not going to hear that at any other time , " Mr Eavis says .
But it need n't have been SOS of course .
Being broadcast without a pause , the combination of dots and dashes could also have been read as IJS , SMB , or VTB .
SOS won the day , coming into effect on 1 July 1908 .
Since then it has stormed into popular culture , littered a thousand newspaper headlines and prompted numerous " backronyms " .
According to who you believed it was Save Our Souls , or Sinking Of Ship , or Send Out Succour or Save Our Ship .
" None of which is correct , " says Mr Eavis .
" It does n't stand for anything .
It 's simply non -stop , there are no spaces . "
It is believed the first ship to have sent out an SOS signal was the American steamer Arapahoe in 1909 .
When the Titanic was sinking in 1912 , its operator first sent out CQD and then SOS , alternating .
CQD persisted , particularly among British operators , for many years .
Standardising of rescue But SOS was a landmark in global communication .
In the intensely political world of early radio , the technological powers - that - be had been able to agree on something that would save lives , instead of going their own way .
The 1906 conference in Germany was also a landmark for agreeing - against the vested interests of firms like Marconi - that communication should be possible between all stations using all systems .
And the legacy of the internationally co-ordinated attempt to save lives by standardising the way rescue was requested has been developed over the last century .
But the humble SOS morse signal has lost its dominance .
" The days of morse have long gone , " says Humberside Coastguard watch manager Andrew Mahood .
Instead , the Coastguard in the UK deal with half a dozen main avenues of distress call from on board vessels : VHF radio call : Use channel 16 and start broadcast with " mayday , mayday , mayday " .
Then give details of identity , position and situation .
Other users will keep channel clear and hasten to the location .

Call to 999 , or the European - wide emergency number 112 , or text message to someone who contacts Coastguard Distress flare
But all hope is not lost for the SOS .
Even Mr Mahood - who has not dealt with a morse SOS for eight years - concedes there are times when dot - dot - dot , dash - dash - dash , dot - dot - dot might be the only way .
" Morse still can be used if a person's on a boat and the radio's not working , then they will use the good old Mk I torch . "
It is certainly no more far - fetched than those who text for help .
" We had a distress call from the Singapore straits , " says Mr Mahood .
" A woman texted her boyfriend who was in Yorkshire who sent us an e-mail we then got in touch with the Singaporean coastguard . "
And in Hardy Boys - style survival situations where you 've crashed in the Andes and you need to improvise a transmitter , morse SOS will be your salvation .
But for the most part the art of morse communication and the heritage of the SOS , is carried on by the amateur radio community in Britain , the US and elsewhere , still scanning the airwaves Send us your comments using the form below .
Your audio file sent S O S as three separate characters .
It needs to be ...---... not ... --- ...
We were always told that it should be written with a bar over the top to show that it was to be sent as a single " symbol " and not as three characters .
This is also true of CQ - which you did send correctly .
I presume from this " error " you were using a morse generator rather than sending it by hand .
Laurie Climo , Taunton
As a ships Radio Officer of 20 years , I can confirm what Laurie Climo stated above : SOS is NOT sent as separate characters S O S - as per the sound file , but as one character ...---...
As confirmed by my 1975 edition of the Post Office Handbook for Radio Operators published by HMSO for the then Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications .
Clive S Carver , Hawarden , Flintshire , UK Interestingly enough , in Greek , SOS is the inner stem of the verb " to save " .
Athos Athanasiou , London Having been trained in marine radio and spending 15 years in both seagoing and shore based roles I found this article to be of some interest .
SOS is n't a TLA it 's a signal ; the meaning of which is " I require IMMEDIATE assistance " - normally followed by the position of the vessel in distress and ( time permitting ) further details to assist rescue efforts .
The formation of Morse code characters is n't a simply series of dots and dashes strung together , a Morse character has a distinct rhythm and it's the rhythm that 's read and not the dots and dashes ( let 's not forget that Morse was sent by hand and read by humans - it was n't normally machine generated , apart from broadcast messages such as weather forecasts ) nor was it read by machine .
There were a number of two and three character combinations - SOS was a distinctive signal which brought all radio traffic to an abrupt halt , with the additional effect of raising the hairs on the back of one 's neck .
John Clayton , St Neots UK Keep SOS .
Someone , unseen , trapped in debris and unable to shout , might just be able to tap out SOS with hand or foot on something loudly enough to indicate that someone is there and alive .

The CQD signal was probably further confused because the " Attention All Stations " CQ signal was frequently followed by the letters D E meaning " this is " ( followed by the call sign of the transmitting station ) .
If the call sign of the transmitting station were a combination of Cs Qs and Ds , that would really confuse things : CQ CQ CQ DE CQDE .
Alan , Brazil Even in these days of text messaging , morse code lives on ; the Nokia default text alert (...--... ) is morse for SMS .
Rob , Sheffield , UK
As the marine GMDSS system is now active , distress calling on VHF channel 16 is obsolete , and may not get a response - shipping no longer maintains a mandatory listening watch on channel 16 , and coastguards stopped keeping a headphone watch in Feb 2005 , although they do still keep a loudspeaker watch .
Bottom line is that , if you go to sea in any sort of leisure craft , although not yet mandatory , it 's much safer to have a modern DSC - enabled VHF set coupled to a GPS satellite navigation system .
Assistance is then just the press of a button away .
( And please do n't just rely on a mobile phone , there 's not much of a signal once you 're away from the land . )
John the Boat , Southampton
As a radio amateur , I can also tell you that continuous wave ( CW ) Morse code is the most efficient way of sending information - it puts the most power into the smallest bandwidth , and , as a result , is most easily received in the presence of noise ( the human ear and brain is remarkably good at pulling patterns out of noise ) .
Morse code also requires the simplest transmitter and receiver .
Other , more modern , means of radio communication can carry much more information , faster , and with error correction , but Morse is like a hammer ... a good , basic tool that should always be in the bottom of your toolbox , because you never know when it might come in handy .
Peter Simpson , KA1AXY , Holliston , MA USA
At least this generation will remember SOS , ... --- ... has been hammered into us .
It can be flashed with a lamp , written on a wet beach and used in a multitude of other ways .
It 's simple and as a backup when all the fancy electronics fail will attract the necessary attention and response .
Dave Hogg , Alcudia Spain
My mobile phone can issue an SOS signal in morse code via the built in camera light .
I 've always found this strangely comforting , although have not had to use it yet in the distinctly urban environment of West Yorkshire .

What are these ?
Wikileaks has the full text of a memo concerning the dread Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , a draft treaty that does away with those pesky public trade - negotiations at the United Nations ( with participation from citizens ' groups and public interest groups ) in favor of secret , closed - door meetings where entertainment industry giants get to give marching orders to governments in private .
It 's some pretty crazy reading — among other things , ACTA will outlaw P2P ( even when used to share works that are legally available , like my books ) , and crack down on things like region - free DVD players .
All of this is taking place out of the public eye , presumably with the intention of presenting it as a fait accompli just as the ink is drying on the treaty .
Honestly , it 's becoming clearer and clearer that the entertainment industry is an existential threat to the idea of free speech , open tools , and an open communications network .
Who is really behind ACTA ?
Follow the money : Rep. Howard Berman ( D - CA ) [ 4 ]

Virgin Media — the UK 's largest cable - modem provider — has decided that it will spy on its users to protect the record industry .
It is sending out letters to thousands of customers warning them that infringement has been detected on their network connections ( Virgin customers who leave their WiFi open — as I did , when I had their cable - modem service — will be collateral damage in this fight ) .
Virgin is under no obligation to do this .
The law is clear that they bear no liability for downloading on their network , nor do they have any duty to spy on users or send out warnings .
This is entirely off their own bat , and will come straight out of the company 's bottom line .
Of course , the British record industry is ecstatic and sees this as the first step in getting a law passed that will require every ISP to spy on every Internet user in the country and cut off infringers .
The campaign is a joint venture between Virgin Media and the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) , which represents the major record labels .
The BPI ultimately wants internet companies to implement a " three strikes and out " rule to warn and ultimately disconnect the estimated 6.5 million customers whose accounts are used for regular criminal activity .
Oh sure — you download a couple - three songs and we 'll come along and cut off the one wire that delivers freedom of speech , freedom of the press and freedom of assembly .

Hacker testifies News Corp unit hired him
SANTA ANA , California ( Reuters ) - A computer hacker testified on Wednesday that a News Corp ( NWSa.N ) unit hired him to develop pirating software , but denied using it to penetrate the security system of a rival satellite television service .
Christopher Tarnovsky -- who said his first payment was $ 20,000 in cash hidden in electronic devices mailed from Canada -- testified in a corporate - spying lawsuit brought against News Corp 's NDS Group ( NNDS.O ) by DISH Network Corp ( DISH.O ) .
The trial could result in hundreds of millions of dollars in damage awards .
NDS , which provides security technology to a global satellite network that includes satellite TV service DirecTV , denies the claims , saying it was only engaged in reverse engineering -- looking at a technology product to determine how it works , a standard in the electronics industry .
After an introduction by plaintiff 's attorney Chad Hagan as one of the " two best hackers in the world , " Tarnovsky told the court that he was paid on a regular basis by Harper Collins , a publishing arm of News Corp , for 10 years .
Tarnovsky said one of his first projects was to develop a pirating program to make DirectTV more secure .
But lawyers for DISH Network claim Tarnovsky 's mission was to hack into DISH 's satellite network , steal the security code , then flood the market with pirated smart cards costing DISH $ 900 million in lost revenue and system - repair costs .
Smart cards enable satellite TV converter boxes to bring in premium channels .
The suit was brought by EchoStar Communications , which later split into two companies , DISH and EchoStar Corp , with DISH being the primary plaintiff .
" I never got money for reprogramming Echostar cards , " Tarnovsky said .
" Someone is trying to set me up . "
DISH attorney Chad Hagan asked , " This is all a big conspiracy ? "
" Yes , " Tarnovsky answered .
He conceded that he constructed a device called " the stinger " that could communicate with any smart card in the world .
Another hacker , Tony Dionisi , testified on Tuesday that Tarnovsky bragged about creating " the stinger " and that he knew of another hacker and NDS employee who reprogrammed 50 EchoStar smart cards with the device .
The trial is expected to last another two to three weeks .
It is being heard in southern California because both Tarnovsky and NDS are located there .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China announced a surprise increase of about 18 percent in retail gasoline and diesel prices effective from Friday , state media said .
It will be the first rise in fuel prices in eight months , a move that threatens to stoke already decade - high inflation .
Prices for gasoline and diesel prices will rise by 1,000 yuan ( $ 145.5 ) per tonne each .
Oil prices fell $ 3 a barrel on Thursday on the news on worries that demand from the world ’s second - largest oil consumer would be hit .
China has been one of the main factors driving oil prices to a record near $ 140 .
China last raised pump fuel prices in November .
The move in November took many market watchers by surprise as Beijing has repeatedly vowed to rule out “ near - term ” price increases to battle high inflation and avoid social unrest barely two months away from the Beijing Olympics .
China also raised jet fuel prices by 1,500 yuan per tonne .
The official Xinhua news agency reported that China will also raise some electricity tariffs from July 1 .
The average electricity tariff would go up by 0.025 yuan / kwh , though exemptions will be granted to urban and rural residents along with some farmers and fertilizer producers , the report said , citing the National Development and Reform Commission .
“ Global crude prices have been rising sharply and Chinese domestic fuel prices have lagged behind .
The price difference has highlighted the contradiction between demand and supply , ” said state television , also quoting the National Development and Reform Commission .

A group of university professors is weighing in on the Jammie Thomas case , telling the trial judge he erred when instructing jurors that having an open share folder filled with copyrighted music amounts to infringement – even absent proof that somebody else downloaded songs .
A Duluth , Minnesota jury in October subsequently dinged Thomas $ 222,000 for " making available " 24 unauthorized songs in what was the Recording Industry Association of America 's first and only case against a file sharer to go to trial .
Last month , however , the judge presiding over the case , Michael Davis , suggested he should not have told jurors that Thomas was liable simply for having an open share folder on the Kazaa network .
The judge invited briefing by the RIAA , Thomas ' lawyers and the public at large .
A hearing is set for August .
So far , only a group of ten copyright scholars weighed in , telling Davis that actual distribution to the public must be shown .
Such a requirement , however , is technologically infeasible .
The professors reviewed for the judge the text of the Copyright Act , which allows up to $ 150,000 in damages per violation .
The act says a copyright holder has the exclusive right " to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership , or by rental , lease , or lending . "
The professors argue :
" The plain language of the statutory text , as confirmed by other courts and leading commentators , compels but one conclusion : that merely making a work available to the public , whether over the internet or otherwise , by itself does not constitute a distribution .
More precisely , because a defendant ' distributes ' in violation of § 106 ( 3 ) only when she actually transfers to the public the possession or ownership of copies or phonorecords of a work , no distribution is effected merely by making a work available for distribution on a peer - to - peer network . "
To nab an infringer , investigators for the RIAA log into Kazaa , for example , peer into share folders , make screen shots , capture the IP address , and also download some music as well .
( An Arizona judge last month ruled in a different case that the RIAA must prove distribution , but that the RIAA 's agents ' downloads copied from the defendant 's share folder counted against the defendant .
That issue is being appealed on grounds that the RIAA authorized the downloading , so no unauthorized distribution took place . )
The " making available " issue , combined with whether the RIAA 's downloads can be used to prove distribution , are important questions of law whose ultimate answers promise to change the course of the RIAA 's litigation machine , with more than 20,000 copyright infringement lawsuits filed so far .
Just a handful of judges have said actual distribution is required .
Most lawsuits settle for a few thousand dollars without the question being litigated .
The U.S. Supreme Court has not squarely addressed the issue and only one judge said RIAA downloads count as distribution .
( It should be noted that having an open share folder of child pornography counts as criminally distributing child porn , regardless if others download it . )
Still , even if judge Davis sides with the professors and Thomas , that does n't mean the mother of two wins .
Thomas Cotter , a University of Minnesota intellectual property scholar and one of the brief 's backers , agreed that the judge could decide to leave the verdict intact because the 24 downloads the RIAA made from Thomas ' share folder count against her .
Still , Cotter does n't think that 's the right decision .
" A download that is authorized by somebody acting on behalf of the copyright owner should n't count for infringement , " he said .
" There 's so many different ways this case can play out . "
Other scenarios include a retrial in which the RIAA can use its downloads against Thomas , a dismissal and an out - of - court settlement .
A 12 - member jury spent five minutes before concluding Thomas was liable .

PLANO , Texas --
A convicted steroids dealer who recently met with NFL security officials and gave them names of players he said bought steroids from him has been found dead in his home .
Early Thursday morning , Plano police made a welfare check and found 35 - year - old David Jacobs and 30 - year - old Amanda Jo Earhart - Savell dead .
Both had been shot .
Officer Rick McDonald , a police spokesman , said the officers were making a welfare check after relatives of Earhart - Savell expressed concern about her whereabouts .
According to the Dallas Morning News , which first reported the story , Jacobs and Earhart - Savell had been in an on - again , off - again relationship , and at one point were engaged to be married .
Heather Bowden , also a spokeswoman for the Plano police , told the New York Times in a telephone interview , " At this point , it is a homicide investigation , and we have no reason to believe otherwise . "
Jacobs was sentenced to three years of probation and fined $ 25,000 on May 1 after pleading guilty last year in federal court in Dallas to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute anabolic steroids .
According to ESPN the Magazine senior writer Shaun Assael , who had been in contact with Jacobs throughout May , Jacobs was reticent and nervous about the information he had and the people it implicated .
When explaining why he did not want to go public , Jacobs said : " The kinds of people I know about could put a bullet in the back of my head . "
Jacobs 's father , also named David , of Jasper , Ga. , told The Times in a telephone interview that he received a call from an anonymous person , who told Jacobs to call the Plano police .
Jacobs said police were unable to tell him much about what might have transpired .
David Jacobs , seen after pleading guilty to steroid charges in 2007 , recently met with NFL officials -- and according to his lawyer , gave them the names of players who had received drugs he had made .
He was found dead on Thursday .

" I spoke with David through a text message about three or four days ago , and he said he was fine , " Jacobs told The Times .
" He has been trying to rebuild his life .
He got crossed with some bad things and made some bad choices .
At this point , I am just beside myself . "
The Morning News reported it had spoken with Jacobs frequently and exchanged e-mails with him as recently as last weekend .
Jacobs had sought to rebuild his nutritional supplement business , but he was experiencing financial problems and having trouble getting his old client base to work with him , according to the report .
On May 21 , Jacobs met with NFL security officials in the Dallas area and gave them names of players he said bought steroids from him , according to Hank Hockeimer , his lawyer .
Hockeimer told the newspaper on Thursday he had not yet been briefed about the situation at Jacobs ' house .
The NFL requested the meeting after Jacobs was sentenced to three years of probation on May 1 for a single count of conspiracy to distribute anabolic steroids .
He had cooperated with federal authorities since his arrest last year .
" We offer our sympathy to the families of David Jacobs and Amanda Jo Earhart - Savell , " the league said in a statement .
" As we have previously confirmed , our security representatives interviewed David Jacobs on two occasions .
We are reviewing the information to determine if there is documented evidence establishing any violations of our program and will follow up on any other information that is provided .
" It is premature to comment on any specific player at this time .
Anyone found to have violated our policies will be subject to discipline , including suspension .
We will continue to be responsive to any needs of law enforcement on this matter . "
Neighbors who were still gathered at the scene about 12 hours after officers arrived said they became aware of Jacobs through television news reports , but did n't know him well .
They said they did n't see any suspicious activity or hear any gunshots .
One neighbor who reached out to Jacobs after his guilty plea by asking him to warn children about the dangers of drugs said she did n't believe police when they told her he was dead .
" Knowing somebody died this way , it 's hard to take , " Yeharerwerk Gashaw said .
" I was shocked . "
By his own account , Jacobs was a prolific salesman , moving 1,000 bottles of anabolic steroids a month and an equal number of growth hormone kits that he obtained illicitly from China .
Hockeimer had said that league officials seemed " genuinely interested " in what Jacobs had to say , as well as in canceled checks and e-mails that he provided .
Jacobs has publicly acknowledged that he dealt primarily with two NFL players and earlier identified one of them as offensive lineman Matt Lehr .
Last month , Jacobs told the Morning News that Lehr purchased tens of thousands of dollars of steroids and growth hormone from the spring of 2006 to the spring of 2007 .
He also told the paper that Lehr agreed to have boxes of raw steroid powder from China shipped directly to his Georgia home .
Lehr served a four - game suspension while a member of the Atlanta Falcons in October 2006 after he tested positive for a banned substance .
He spent last season with Tampa Bay and was acquired by the Saints in the offseason .
Lehr 's attorney , Paul Coggins , has said the player has n't used banned substances since he was suspended and has since passed NFL drug tests .
The attorney has also said Jacobs ' allegations are retaliation because Lehr would n't pay Jacobs ' legal fees .
After his sentencing , Jacobs told The New York Times that he hoped to tell league officials about " loopholes in their program . "
He also said he 'd advised about 10 players to use finasteride , a drug to treat balding , because it masks steroid use .
Information from ESPN the Magazine senior writer Shaun Assael and The Associated Press was used in this report .

( NewsTarget ) I am angry !
On January 24th , 2008 , United States Department of ( USDA ) Agriculture Secretary Chuck Conner announced the availability of $ 74.5 million in emergency funding to combat the light brown apple moth ( LBAM ) infestation in California ( 1 ) .
This announcement comes in conjunction with the release of the California Department of Agriculture 's ( CDFA ) expanded aerial spray zone , which includes the entire cities of San Francisco , Oakland , Berkley and many others .
Following is a link to a recently published proposal of spray boundaries , the yellow lines indicating the proposed spray zones ( www.hopefortruth.com/lbam_2008.jpg ) .
More than two million people who live in these and other targeted cities are scheduled to be exposed this spring or summer to chemicals that that have never been tested on humans or animals before .
When I learned that Santa Cruz , my previous hometown was to be aerially sprayed , I was in a state of shock .
This was followed by a long period of disbelief .
Larry Hawkins , a spokesman for USDA , which is working with CDFA on the moth eradication , said the East Bay Area will be included in future treatments .
So we have a federal agency , the USDA , telling millions of people that they will be sprayed .
This announcement comes without any democratic process .
Apparently the CDFA or the USDA , or both , decided that the previous chemical formula 's used , Checkmate LBAM-F and Checkmate OLR - F were not good enough , which really points to the fact that the past two aerial sprays in Monterey , and the one in Santa Cruz County , were a waste of time and money , in addition to the severe health reactions experienced by thousands of people from chemical exposure .
These chemicals have not undergone thorough safety evaluations , and do not just simply evaporate , but are designed to hang in the air 30 - 90 days or more .
Such chemical applications are of most concern to pregnant women , in which even a minute dosage of a disrupting chemical can cause grave harm to the fetus .
This is over and above the real concern for people who are trying to live a chemical - free lifestyle and who wo n't be able to escape the hundreds of square miles of densely populated areas to be sprayed , or for those who are sensitive to chemicals , or who are in poor health .
The chemicals sprayed are a plastic encapsulated microtechnology ; the microscopic plastic dust , once sprayed , deeply enters the mouth , eyes , skin and lungs .
Even after 90 days and several rains , some people in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties are still experiencing symptoms of spray poisoning .
When they leave the counties , their symptoms many times abate .
This aerial program is a real sword through the heart of democracy and decency .
The government has really gone too far and it must be stopped now .
I must inform you that through a freedom of information request , a local newspaper has learned that the CDFA has hired media spin doctor extraordinaire Porter Novelli at the tune of almost $ 500,000 tax payer dollars to convince the public that it is okay for the state to dump chemicals all over them , their gardens , their pets , and their neighbors .
The state of California is in a budget crisis , and this is one example that explains why .
Here the state is using tax payer dollars to lie to and mislead the public , to try to convince the public that the state should be spending millions of dollars of resources on polluting the air , sea , and land with chemicals that the public in general does not want .
Since a majority of spray funding is coming from the federal arm , know your tax paying dollars are going to a government sponsored large scale crime .
If you are not familiar with this heinous program , let me bring you up to date .
In the beginning of last year , a taxonomist identified the presence of a non native moth species ( LBAM ) in the San Francisco Bay Area , California .
The moth may have been present in California for a long time , nobody knows for sure as detailed studies were never attempted .
The entrance of the moth was likely due to lax boundaries from plant goods imported from New Zealand or Australia ; in other words , it is the USDA 's fault and responsibility for having allowed the moth in .
In Hawaii , the moth has existed for the past hundred years without doing any harm to the local ecosystem , and without the need for the government to try to stop the moth .
In fact it is considered harmless or benign to the environment , the moth does not transmit diseases or harm humans or animals in any way .
Originally , the USDA announced that the moth might cause $ 100 million in crop damage if allowed to multiply .
This estimate of 100 million was based on a single worst year of estimated LBAM damage from over a decade ago in Australia .
Australian crop damage figures have little meaning in California , as the climate is different and the moth damage in Australia varies from year to year ; it is relatively minor in any case .
Even if this $ 100 million crop loss did come true , one has to consider that $ 90 million has now been ear marked to contain the moth , primarily the funds are for aerial spraying chemicals on cities which contain people , and not crops like apples , oranges and grapes .
It is unanimous from pest control experts ( except the ones employed by the government ) that the apple moth cannot be eradicated , but can only be controlled .
Thus this makes the entire aerial experiment an expression of a collective evil .
Many of the targeted cities are not reasonably close to any type of apple , orange or grape vineyards .
To this day , there has been zero dollars of reported crop damage as a direct result from the LBAM presence in California .
Clearly something fishy is going .
Federal and state governments are adamant with their efforts to douse everybody with chemicals for a relatively minute amount of moths .
Additional funds have gone to the CDFA 's public relations campaign , which among other things , involves travel money and putting up the CDFA 's senior officials , like the outlaw leader Secretary A.G. Kawamura in nice hotels , and paying for their meals at restaurants and their travel expenses as they go around the state and lie to people about the need for and safety of this moth spray program .
No money has been earmarked to pay for medical costs or even research to determine if people are getting sick .
This is because the CDFA simply assumes that this product is safe .
They base their safety assumption on a bogus " consensus document " that was created by the Department of Pesticide Review only after several aerial sprays .
The document contains little evidence , and a lot of opinions .
What is of grave concern is the decision to spray never - before tested pesticides on people , and in cities , funded and supported by the USDA and EPA , which CDFA is carrying out .
Let me repeat this because just this fact is so shocking it is hard to comprehend .
People in California are being subjected to biochemical , microscopic moth warfare .
The reported microcapsule size of the aerial mating disrupter is as small as 10 microns and averages 25 - 35 microns in size for an undeployed moth spray .
This size is coming dangerously close to micro-sized particles that are used to evade the body 's defensive systems for biological weapons , those are reported to be 3 - 4 microns in size .
Even with horrible tracking methodologies , and blatant lies to the public to fool people about the danger of the aerial spray , 643 illnesses were documented ( www.1hope.org/SPRAYCOMPLES.PDF ) from Monterey and Santa Cruz counties in the 2007 aerial spray campaigns .
It makes sense that people would get sick because these minute particles can easily get absorbed deep within the body .
So the effect of a small amount of chemical can be magnified many times .
But you know , that assertion is hypothetical , because nobody has ever done any legitimate testing to see whether the chemicals in the microcapsules could affect human health .
These 643 reports represent a fraction of the real injuries , the actual spray has caused thousands to be poisoned from this biochemical formulation .
See my related article ( www.newstarget.com/022434.html ) .
Despite these reports which include 330 official illness claims filed with the CDFA , the CDFA states the following lies on their website , " Pheromones are extremely safe , " and " Public safety is the primary concern . "
The statement that pheromones are safe is a lie .
Sure , pheromones can be safe when used responsibly , for example a benign moth trap in an apple orchard that contains pheromones to attract the moths .
But when you create a microscopic biodegradable ball of volatile chemicals , and then place within it a synthetic moth pheromone , which itself is described as an explosive chemical , you have more of a drug which can interact and create changes within the human body , than a pesticide .
Furthermore , no thorough investigation has been done of these 330 official illness complaints , and some of these people have not yet recovered .
One must realize that any documentation regarding the safety of pheromones reported is from non-aerial applications , such as a moth sticky trap that is scented with pheromones and stuck on a tree , or a pheromone laced twist tie applied to apple orchards or vineyards .
The last aerial application was reported to contain 10 - 20 % of the " safe " pheromone , and 80 - 90 % " other ingredients " .
These safety assertions also do not relate to the method of application .
A sticky trap laced with pheromone is a different entity than a microscopic ball that is designed to biodegrade with pheromone encapsulated within it .
Several of the Checkmate ingredients have yet to be disclosed to the public under trade secret laws .
The newly tested chemicals , which are scheduled for either the spring or summer time to be sprayed on millions , similarly will not be disclosed to the public .
We do not even know what this stuff is ?
How can the government say the chemicals are safe , and then hide the ingredients from scrutiny ?
If these chemicals are so safe why not tell us honestly what it is ?
Clearly the intention of the CDFA , USDA , and EPA , is to cover up the real nature of this biochemical assault .
They are trying to hide what they do from the public 's eye .
They do not want you to know the truth .
The truth is people get sick .
Not everybody gets sick from the moth spray , but many people do .
Its effects can be strong and violent .
The deepest concern is regarding the distribution method of the pheromone .
The pheromone is encapsulated in a miniature and highly volatile plastic ball .
According to a recent UC Davis study paid for by the CDFA , the microcapsules from an unsprayed batch of Checkmate LBAM -F ranged in size from 10 to 190 microns .
Over time , these particles can average 25 - 35 microns in size , shrink and degrade into more dangerous sizes , which fall under the category of particle pollution .
Miniature particles between 2.5-10 microns in size , especially from pesticides , are known to cause both short term and long term health effects , including decreased overall life span .
Again , nobody as yet knows how small the degraded microcapsules are , or how this will effect people in the short and long term , because no such testing exists .
In essence , people have been subjected to a biological and chemical experiment .
This is insane !
The CDFA reports that they want their newest moth weapon deployed this spring and summer , to be even longer lasting , which to me means that the microcapsules will be even more dangerous , possibly indefinitely sticking in the environment , and irritating people 's sensitive ducts and glands ; like the eye's and the nose , much like allergies from pollen .
In each aerial application , billions of these volatile balls are launched into the environment , sprayed by planes contracted through Dynamic Aviation ( http://www.dynamicaviation.com/home.htm ) , which has other specialties beyond aerial application of pesticides .
They also do " Intelligence , Surveillance and Reconnaissance . "
The spraying is conducted at a height of between 500 - 800 feet and residents in the sprayed area report feeling like they are in a war zone .
Once in contact with residential neighborhoods , parks , and playgrounds , the balls slowly disintegrate over time releasing pheromones designed to confuse the moth 's mating patterns .
Typically a drug takes many years for the Food and Drug Administration to approve for safety for humans .
Under an emergency declaration , the EPA can exclude new chemicals from rigorous testing .
These laws were designed for agricultural emergencies and are being violently misused because they are planning on spraying large urban populations and not apple orchards .
The EPA and USDA have flagrantly crossed legal and ethical boundaries by applying laws designed for agricultural fields to densely inhabited city centers .
Further , consider that the testing of these chemicals is not done to make sure that it is safe for humans , as the safety is merely an untested assumption .
As an example , it took several months after the first aerial spray of Monterey County for the CDFA to pay the University of California Davis to see if the Checkmate formula was toxic to certain very small ocean insects .
It took several months for this first test of the Checkmate formula , already sprayed on well over two hundred thousand people , to be conducted .
The testing being conducted in New Zealand is not to ensure safety for humans , but to see if the mating habits of the moths are disrupted .
This spraying is approved by the EPA despite the fact that there are specific laws to prohibit chemical testing on pregnant women and children ( http://www.epa.gov/oppfead1/guidance/human-t... ) .
" EPA 's rules make it clear that all pregnant women , all nursing women , and all children are excluded from all studies involving intentional exposure that are intended for submission under the pesticide laws . "
If the EPA cannot test pesticides on pregnant women , nursing women , and children , then under what jurisdiction and authority can they simply expose pregnant women , nursing women and children with untested pesticides ?
How many more children do we need to see poisoned by these indefensible government actions until we wake up and say , ENOUGH !
How many more of our friends , relatives and neighbors do we need to see develop chronic health conditions due to exposure to aerially sprayed chemicals until we take effective action to stop this insanity ?
How much longer are we going to allow the government that is created for the people , to represent the people , to break its own laws and poison its own people and then disregard any reported health concerns ?
To see this insanity clearly let 's examine the moth population .
In San Francisco County , 3,501 moths total have been trapped and killed .
The entire city of San Francisco , whose population is 744,041 , is in the proposed spray boundaries .
About 744,000 people are to be exposed to unsafe microencapsulated pheromones , for several years , to try to control the mating habits in a city which had a total of 3,501 moths found over the past 8 months .
This is really a needle in the haystack approach to pest control .
Keep in mind , each moth found , is a moth that has been trapped and exterminated ( www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_i... ) .
In Alameda County , 431 months have been found in the past 8 months out of 2,327 traps .
The moth population in Alameda County is thus sparse at best .
Just look out your window .
Imagine how many insects are in the tree , the yard , or the local park .
I have seen more than 431 ants crawl into my kitchen on a rainy day .
So in a giant area of 141 square miles , and the tens or hundreds of millions of insects in that zone , to try to eradicate such a minuscule pest by just spraying chemicals everywhere is ridiculous and unsafe .
The proposed spray map for Alameda County includes densely populated cities of the east bay area : cities such as Richmond , Albany , Berkley , Emeryville , Piedmont , and Oakland .
In this area , well over one million people reside .
The plan is to expose more than one million people in these cities , over a multi - year period to chemicals meant to hang in the air , in order to try to stop the mating habits of any remaining moths , which if there are any at all , could not be more than a few hundred .
The 431 moths that were found there in the past eight months are now dead .
These 431 months are the government 's excuse , for a multi-million dollar civil rights incursion . *
Share this information with your friends and neighbors . *
Do n't be fooled when the CDFA says that the " pheromone " is safe .
I have been poisoned myself by these microcapsules , and so has my family , it is a terrible feeling .
Ask for test results to show it is safe for humans , you 'll see they have none . *
Demand accountability .
Ask your local California representative why they are continuing to allow the state to spray chemicals on people , even though the state has laws , like the state constitution right to personal safety , and legislative laws such as the California Environmental Quality Act , meant to stop this .
Your state representative can amend or modify the LBAM law that went into affect that gave the CDFA the unanimous green light to eradicate the apple moth .
Surely your representative does not support aerial spraying ?
Each county has to have their local agricultural commissioner or someone to that effect sign a permit to allow the state to spray .
Stop these people from signing the permit !* State and Federal representatives can also design an independent committee to come up with non-biased recommendations .
The CDFA created such a working group , but they strangely seem to believe that aerial spraying people to stop moths from mating is a good idea .
* Gather your local city council members ' support .
Use local resources to conduct research , and file lawsuits against the state . *
Ideally the city attorneys and mayors should file legal suits against CDFA and the EPA and the USDA for polluting the air and water , for violating state and federal laws , and for poisoning children . *
Contact your US Senate and House Representatives , and ask them to stop funding for the aerial spray program , and to declassify this tiny moth from class A pest .
Ask them to strengthen protections so that populations cannot be aerially sprayed unless there is grave and immediate danger to public health . *
Additional Note :
If the aerial spray does occur , take samples .
Put a turkey baster - sized aluminum tray in your back yard .
Put the tray out on the night prior to the aerial spray , and another on the night of the aerial spray .
Seal each tray well .
Each city should organize its own tests of the chemicals , including tests for biological agents , contaminants , radioactive substances , and a microscope analysis to see how big the microcapsules are , and to see if the microcapsules contain miniature microcapsules .
Analysis ideally should also include a detailed chemical profile of the substance sprayed , since the government wo n't tell us .
Finally , the way I see it , it is a crime to poison children and our fellow people who live in California .
Just because the people who are polluting and poisoning the air with chemicals work for the government , should not make them immune to criminal liability and prosecution .
Unfortunately , no city officials , yet , have the decency and standards to attack this matter as it is , a crime .
Crimes require criminal investigations , and criminal charges .
People can be alarmed , and if cities take equitable action , we do not need to be afraid .
For example , we pay taxes so we can have a fire and police department to protect ourselves from crime .
Why not use the police force to protect residents from government sponsored crimes ?
The media creates a false fear about some hypothetical terrorist releasing chemical weapons in the United States .
Meanwhile , the US government is doing something very similar , releasing potentially deadly chemicals on its population , for no good reason .
The LBAM infestation is a monumental hoax ( Yes there are LBAMs , the hoax is that the only solution is to spray chemicals on cities ) .
I pray for grace for everyone , so that people in the proposed spray zones remain safe from harm , and that those who are inspired to take action to stop this be inspired to act effectively , with humility , strength and compassion .
In Santa Cruz and Monterey , local residents have started the California Alliance to Stop the Spray .
( CASS )
This alliance is developing evidence and documentation to stop the aerial spraying for the Light Brown Apple Moth .
Just because this alliance is formed , does not mean the moth spray will be stopped .
Each area needs to form their own groups , and work together to defeat the real pest , the state and federal governments who are performing illegal operations .

They want to here our stories , As a final addendum , many people have written to me about mosquito fogging , about chemtrails , and about large scale chemical sprayings which occur in the United States unmonitored in more rural areas .
While my article does not address these concerns , this article shows that people are sick and tired of being exposed needlessly to chemicals .
Your concern about chemical exposure is vital .

Automatic Generation of Peephole Superoptimizers , Sorav Bansal and Alex Aiken , ASPLOS 2006 .
Peephole optimizers are typically constructed using human - written pattern matching rules , an approach that requires expertise and time , as well as being less than systematic at exploiting all opportunities for optimization .
We explore fully automatic construction of peephole optimizers using brute force superoptimization .
While the optimizations discovered by our automatic system may be less general than human - written counterparts , our approach has the potential to automatically learn a database of thousands to millions of optimizations , in contrast to the hundreds found in current peephole optimizers .
We show experimentally that our optimizer is able to exploit performance opportunities not found by existing compilers ; in particular , we show speedups from 1.7 to a factor of 10 on some compute intensive kernels over a conventional optimizing compiler .
It 's always fun to see a method that ought to be intractable rendered tractable through a combination of cleverness and strategically applied brute force .
I found their performance measurements suggestive but perplexing .
Their results on their kernels are really astoundingly good , which they claim that is because they make use of the x86's SIMD instructions .
But there is very little change in the SPEC benchmarks , and they subsequently suggest that their peephole optimizer catches many things that other compilers get via dataflow optimization .
As a result , I do n't feel like I have a clear picture of what their optimizer does and does n't do , or where it does and does n't overlaps with existing optimizations .
But they definitely have enough to convince me that this is worth further study , so I really hope Bonsal and Aiken publish some more about this -- a tech report or journal paper with more systematic measurements and in - depth analysis would be really illuminating .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- The U.S. Supreme Court , in a fractured ruling , said punitive damages are allowed in a lawsuit over the 1989 Valdez oil spill but that lower courts should reduce the $ 2.5 billion award .
Justice David Souter , in the court 's majority opinion , said the punitive damages award should be brought into line with $ 287 million in compensatory damages awarded against Exxon in the lawsuit .
" The award here should be limited to an amount equal to compensatory damages , " Souter wrote .
The high court otherwise split evenly 4 - 4 on an important maritime law question in the case but concluded that federal environmental laws do n't bar punitive damages against the oil giant .
The Exxon Valdez spilled millions of gallons of oil into Alaska 's Prince William Sound almost 19 years ago in one of the largest environmental accidents in U.S. history .
The company has paid over $ 3.4 billion in remediation , fines , compensation and other costs .
The case before the court was brought separately by a class of 32,677 fishermen and other interests that had business disrupted by the oil spill .
The case has been in litigation for 13 years , a timeframe in which the plaintiffs allege 20 % of those eligible for damages have died .
Exxon Mobil had attacked the award on several fronts , arguing that maritime law does n't allow punitive damages awards and that the federal Clean Water Act , which guided more than $ 900 million in sanctions and fines related to the spill , also bars the punitive damages award .
Neither argument appeared likely to prevail in the eventual Supreme Court ruling .
The lawsuit before the court began in 1994 , almost five years after the Valdez supertanker dumped 258,000 barrels of oil into the Prince William Sound .
After a lengthy trial , a jury awarded those harmed by the spill $ 287 million in compensatory damages and $ 5 billion in punitive damages .
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco first ruled in the case in 2001 when it upheld damages against Exxon Mobil but ordered the trial court to reduce the award .
A second appeal to the Ninth Circuit was decided in 2006 that upheld the $ 2.5 billion in punitive damages .
The case is Exxon Shipping Co. and Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Baker , 07-219 .

The deciphering of the human genome has prompted a number of entrepreneurs to cash in on people ’s genetic concerns .
They offer DNA testing to look for aberrant genes associated with the risk of developing various diseases , especially cancer .
Such testing , when done reliably , might encourage some people to take charge of their health and make better plans for the future .
But some professional genetics counselors say this approach to determining cancer risk is fraught with hazards , not the least of which is a false warning of a serious risk that does not exist .
“ This kind of testing is premature , ” said Dr. Kenneth Offit , chief of clinical genetics at Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center .
“ Some companies are selling research tests for mutations that carry a low risk of causing cancer , leading people to worry needlessly or be falsely reassured . ”
Another problem , he said , is the prescription offered after the tests .
“ Other companies are telling people what kind of foods to eat and what to put on their skin based on their genes , ” Dr. Offit said .
“ Testing for known cancer genes is legitimate , but often the prescription given for a ‘ gene makeover ’ is not .
Regulation of these labs is sorely needed .
And people facing real hereditary cancer risks require intensive professional counseling .
June 30 , 2008  --
A suburban Houston homeowner was cleared by a grand jury Monday for shooting to death two men he suspected of burglarizing his neighbor 's home .
Joe Horn , 61 , shot the two men last November after he saw them crawling out the windows of a neighbor 's house in Pasadena , a Houston suburb .
Horn , a retired grandfather , called 911 and told the dispatcher he had a shotgun and was going to kill them .
The dispatcher pleaded with him not to go outside , but Horn confronted the men with a 12 - gauge shotgun and shot both in the back .
" The message we 're trying to send today is the criminal justice system works , " Harris County District Attorney Kenneth Magidson told reporters at the courthouse .
Horn 's attorney , Tom Lambright , has said his client believed the two men had broken into his neighbor 's home and that he shot them only when they came into his yard and threatened him .
The two suspected burglars , Hernando Riascos Torres , 38 , and Diego Ortiz , 30 , were unemployed illegal immigrants from Colombia .
Torres was deported to Colombia in 1999 after a 1994 cocaine - related conviction .
The incident touched off protests from civil rights activists who said the shooting was racially motivated and that Horn took the law into his own hands .
Horn 's supporters defended his actions , saying he was protecting himself and being a good neighbor to a homeowner who was out of town .
" I understand the concerns of some in the community regarding Mr. Horn 's conduct , " Magidson said .
" The use of deadly force is carefully limited in Texas law to certain circumstances ...
In this case , however , the grand jury concluded that Mr. Horn use of deadly force did not rise to a criminal offense . "
Magidson said nine of the 12 grand jurors would have had to vote in favor of an indictment in order for Horn to be charged .
Lambright said this week that his client regrets the shooting and would stay inside if he had it to do over again .
Lambright did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment from The Associated Press .
In the 911 call , a dispatcher urges Horn to stay inside his house and not risk lives .
" Do n't go outside the house , " the 911 operator pleaded .
" You 're gonna get yourself shot if you go outside that house with a gun .
I do n't care what you think . "
" You wanna make a bet ? "
Horn answered .
" I 'm gonna kill 'em . "
After the shooting , he redialed 911 .
" I had no choice , " he said , his voice shaking .
" They came in the front yard with me , man .
I had no choice .
Get somebody over here quick . "
Texas law allows people to use deadly force to protect themselves if it is reasonable to believe they are in mortal danger .
In limited circumstances , people also can use deadly force to protect their neighbor 's property ; for example , if a homeowner asks a neighbor to watch over his property while he 's out of town .
It 's not clear whether the neighbor whose home was burglarized asked Horn to watch over his house .
Artist managers are girding for battle with their music overlords over when their clients are going to see some of the dough negotiated last year in copyright - infringement settlements with a host of Web sites .
Universal Music , Warner Music and EMI – either collectively or individually – settled claims with Napster , Kazaa and Bolt.com .
Napster alone had to cough up $ 270 million .
The fourth major label , SonyBMG , was not part of the suit ; SonyBMG and Napster are both owned by Bertelsmann .
All four struck separate deals with YouTube that included revenue participation .
A contingent of prominent artist managers claims that little to none of that money has trickled down to their clients .
They are now considering legal action .
“ Artist managers and lawyers have been wondering for months when their artists will see money from the copyright settlements and how it will be accounted for , ” said lawyer John Branca , who has represented Korn , Don Henley , and The Rolling Stones , among others .
“ Some of them are even talking about filing lawsuits if they do n’t get paid soon . ”
Record label sources said corporate bosses are still deciding on how best to split the money .
In determining the payout , they said not every artist is owed money and it must be calculated with regard to the level of copyright infringement for each artist .
What ’s more , these sources said that after the labels recouped their legal expenses , there was n’t much left to pass along to the artists .
But a source on the artists ’ side said that is an argument heard all too often in the music business .
Getting money out of the major labels is never easy , but given the industry ’s downward financial spiral it is exponentially more difficult now , the source said .
“ The record labels are experts at transferring money around and putting the onus on artists managers to find it . ”
Irving Azoff , the legendary talent manager for The Eagles and Jewel , among others , echoed that sentiment .
“ They will play hide and seek , but eventually will be forced to pay something , ” Azoff said .
“ The record companies have even tried to credit [ unclaimed royalty ] accounts .
It ’s never easy for an artist to get paid their fair share . ”
Reps for the three labels dispute the notion that they are withholding settlement money .
A spokeswoman for EMI said the label has started the process of “ sharing proceeds from the Napster and Kazaa settlements with artists and writers whose work was infringed upon . ”
Warner Music ’s representative said the label “ is sharing the Napster settlement with its recording artists and songwriters and at this stage nearly all settlement monies have been disbursed . ”
A Universal Music spokesman said the label ’s policy “ is to share its portion of various settlements with its artists , regardless of whether their contracts require it . ”

Justice probe of passport breach sought
Senators from both parties urged the Department of Justice on Sunday to investigate the unauthorized searches of the passport files of three presidential candidates by State Department contract workers .
" That kind of a breach of privacy is just despicable , " said Pennsylvania Sen .
Arlen Specter , the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee .
" I think that ought to be a very intense investigation . "
Sen . Ron Wyden , D - Ore. , agreed , saying the incidents seem to point to a broader problem .
" The Government Accountability Office has been warning about this problem for a decade .
And it seems to me in this administration ( that ) there 's been pretty much a culture of disregard for privacy , and that 's part of the problem , " he said .
Both senators spoke on CNN's " Late Edition . "
Last week , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice apologized to presidential candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton , John McCain and Barack Obama after the State Department confirmed the passport files had been compromised .
It was not clear whether the workers - two have been fired - saw anything other than the basic personal data , such as name , citizenship , age , Social Security number and place of birth , that is required when applying for a passport .
The State Department 's inspector general is investigating .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey has indicated that prosecutors are likely to wait until the inspector general concludes the inquiry before deciding whether to open a Justice Department investigation .
On Sunday , Specter urged Mukasey to take up the case , saying the breach could be a violation of several federal criminal statutes .
Specter also said the Judiciary Committee might take a look as well .
" I think privacy is a very fundamental matter .
And if you can't have privacy for Sen. McCain and Sen. Clinton and Sen. Obama , so what 's the average person facing ? "
Specter said .
" It ought to be pursued very diligently , in a tough way . "
The two companies that provided the workers for the State Department - Stanley Inc. , of Arlington , Va. , and The Analysis Corp. , or TAC , of McLean , Va. - have said their employees ' actions were unauthorized and not consistent with company policies .

Michael Geist has begun a new series on the Canadian DMCA , Industry Minister Jim Prentice 's no-consultation copyright law .
In the five part series , Geist will show how the Canadian DMCA will criminalize out of the daily activities of a hypothetical Canadian family .
Jim and Josee live in a Calgary suburb together with their three children Stephen ( age 16 ) , Rona ( age 10 ) , and Diane ( age 4 ) .
Jim is the chief librarian at the National Energy Library , while Josee teaches media and communications at a local high school .
This post focuses on Jim .
Soon after he arrives into the office on Monday morning , he is contacted by a researcher located in the field who asks him to track down an article and to email an electronic copy as soon as possible .
Jim finds the article , scans and sends it via email .
After work , he drops into the local HMV and purchases a DVD copy of the movie Juno .
At home , he transfers a copy of the movie to his video iPod for viewing on an upcoming business trip .
I 've been hearing from Boing Boing readers who 've written to the government to protest the bill , and the government line is " We 're not taking away rights , we 're giving them to the public !
We 're making it legal to rip CDs and make other personal copies ! "
( Indeed , Prentice sent a letter to the Toronto Star that says just this ) .
This is n't mere disingenuousness : it 's a flat - out lie .
Yes , the bill will legalize ripping your CDs , so long as there 's no DRM on them , and so long as the EULA does n't forbid it .
The Canadian DMCA says to rightsholders , " There are no exceptions to copyright law , except the ones you permit .
If you want to prohibit a use that Parliament has protected , go right ahead !
Just add some DRM or stick it in the EULA , and whatever you say will become the law of the land . "
Makes you wonder why we 're bothering to pay Parliament 's salaries , if the laws are going to be made by record companies from now on .

Volkswagen 's hydrogen fuel cell Tiguan made its North American debut today , and it's a pretty slick bit of kit even if it wo n't appear in showrooms anytime soon , if at all .
Although the company was also showing off its upcoming diesel Jetta TDI and talking a lot about the TDI Cup diesel racing series it sponsors , the Tiguan HyMotion was clearly the star of the show .
It 's an advancement over the HyMotion Touran it replaces , but company officials made it clear they are n't betting on hydrogen alone to save us .
" There is n't one technology , one fuel , that will provide the answer , " John Tillman , who leads VW 's advanced powertrain division in the U.S , told Wired.com .
" We have multiple technologies .
This is just one of them . "
The company is pushing clean diesel in a big way and expects it to comprise 30 percent of its sales within a decade .
But , like a growing number of automakers , it believes " the electric motor is the ideal prime mover for sustainable economy , " and Tillman says VW is working on hybrid and battery electric drivetrains .
Volkswagen 's been playing with fuel cells for 10 years now , and it launched a dedicated fuel cell and EV research center in 2001 .
The Tiguan HyMotion is its fourth generation FCV and the its most advanced .
The proton exchange membrane fuel cell generates 80 kW , but it 's coupled with an electric motor and lithium - ion battery that bump output to 100 kW ( about 134 horsepower ) .
That 's enough to propel the Tiguan , which weighs about 4,122 pounds , from zero to 60 in 14 seconds and a top speed of 93 mph .
Not great , but better than the Touran 's 86 mph .
The battery has a charge capacity of 6.8
Ah and is charged by the fuel cell and regenerative braking .
The HyMotion also uses stop - start technology to reduce fuel consumption .
Besides their astronomical price , one of the shortcomings of fuel cell vehicles is their range , and the Tiguan offers a relatively paltry 160 miles .
It carries 3.5 kilograms of gaseous hydrogen in a tank made of carbon fiber , kevlar and aluminum at a pressure of 10,000 pounds - twice that of the Touran .
" We could go higher , but who 's going to provide the fueling infrastructure at that pressure ? " said Westley Khin , one of the engineers who worked on the car .
Ah yes , the fueling infrastructure .
The Achilles heel of fuel cell vehicles , along with the astronomical cost of the cars themselves .
Khin concedes both are the big stumbling blocks to the commercialization , but says " the vehicles are here " and they work well .
That may be , but VW 's only built two HyMotion Tiguans and does n't have any plans to start putting them in driveways like Honda 's doing with the FCX Clarity .
" The FCX Clarity is a good vehicle .
But we want to introduce a vehicle when the customer has the capacity to fuel it .
We do n't see that happening anytime soon , " Tillman says , adding that VW is " working on developing " a home - hydrogen station along the lines of what Honda 's got .
By the way , we asked Tillman if there 's any chance we 'll see that sweet 71 mpg diesel - electric Golf hybrid VW unveiled earlier this year at the Geneva Motor Show .
" We 're looking at it .
I do n't have a timeline , but we are looking at it , " is all he'd say .
VW realizes there 's a market for the car but says the problem is making it affordable .
Hybrid drivetrains are expensive - they add about $ 5 K to the sticker price .
So are diesel engines , which cost about two grand more than similarly - sized gasoline engines .
Put them together in the same car and things quickly get expensive .
" We have to get it to a price point that people can actually afford , " Tillman said .

One of the popular reasons given for sometimes - sluggish game sales on the PC is piracy .
If people can get the game for free , why would they pay for it ?
Go to any popular torrent site and it will likely have many more games than your local gaming store .
The situation led the community manager for Infinity Ward to recently complain about the number of people playing Call of Duty 4 online versus the number of copies the game has sold for the PC .
Brad Wardell , CEO of Stardock , has a much different point of view : the pirates do n't matter .
" So here is the deal :
When you develop for a market , you do n't go by the user base .
You go by the potential customer base .
That 's what most software companies do .
They base what they want to create on the size of the market they 're developing for , " Wardell writes on his blog .
" But not PC game developers . "
His approach is not to think only about the " cool " games , but to make sure what the company does create can be profitable .
What good is spending years on a top - tier game that gets all the buzz , is on all the magazine covers , but that very few people have the hardware to run ?
Furthermore , the people who have spent that much on their PCs know where to find the game for free if they like .
It 's a small user base , with a smaller customer base .
The issue of these " cool " games seems to frustrate Wardell .
" So even though Galactic Civilizations II sold 300,000 copies making [ eight ] digits in revenue on a budget of less than $ 1 million , it 's still largely off the radar .
I practically have to agree to mow editors ' lawns to get coverage ... [ Sins of a Solar Empire ] has already sold about 200,000 copies in the first month of release .
It 's the highest - rated PC game of 2008 and probably the best - selling 2008 PC title .
Neither of these titles have CD copy protection . "
So why are n't these games , which , combined , have sold half a million units on a small budget , getting more attention ?
Because they 're not aimed at some nebulous idea of the " hardcore gamer . "
This is a market that may exist in the minds of people writing about games , and it may describe those who buy gaming magazines , but such gamers are certainly not a force at retail .
" Heck , how much buzz does The Sims get in terms of editorial when compared to its popularity ? "
Wardell asks .
" Those things just are n't that cool to the hardcore gaming crowd that everything seems geared toward despite the fact that they 're not the ones buying most of the games . "
The way to make money in the world of PC gaming , according to Wardell , is to make sure many systems can play your games , while continuing to make them attractive .
Find a market where people want to buy and support the games , and do n't go by what the magazines and the blogs seem to think are the big name titles .
Do n't let people who are n't your audience control the titles you make , and ignore piracy .
This is much like Trent Reznor 's strategy , although the execution is different .
Instead of worrying about pirates , just leave the content out in the open .
The market Reznor plays to will still buy the music ; he 's simply stopped worrying about the pirates .
He came to the same conclusion : they were n't customers , they might never be customers , so spending money to try to stop them serves no purpose .
" The reason why we do n't put copy protection on our games is n't because we 're nice guys .
We do it because the people who actually buy games do n't like to mess with it .
Our customers make the rules , not the pirates .
Pirates do n't count , " Wardell argues .
" When Sins popped up as the # 1 best selling game at retail a couple weeks ago , a game that has no copy protect whatsoever , that should tell you that piracy is not the primary issue . "

LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- DJ and pop star Boy George has been denied a visa to enter the United States , his Web site said Tuesday .
In 2007 , George spent five days cleaning the streets of New York to fulfill a community service sentence .
U.S. immigration authorities denied the visa because George , 48 , faces trial in November in London on charges of false imprisonment relating to an April 2007 incident , according to a statement from Boy George 's management , posted on his site .
" George is astounded at the decision and is having his lawyers here in the States look at it in the hope that someone will change their mind , " the statement read .
Boy George , whose real name is George O'Dowd , was charged in London last November with false imprisonment following a complaint from a 28 - year - old man , police said .
The incident happened in East London the previous April , police said .
George is free on unconditional bail and is not barred from traveling as he awaits trial , his management said .
His upcoming schedule includes a series of U.S. club dates in July and August .
George is best known as the singer of ' 80s pop group Culture Club , with hits including " Karma Chameleon " and " Do You Really Want to Hurt Me ? "
He quit the band in 1987 and embarked on a short solo career before reinventing himself as a club DJ and launching a fashion label , B - Rude .
In August 2007 , George spent five days cleaning the streets of Manhattan to fulfill a community service sentence for falsely reporting a break - in at his New York home .
George 's management said the denial of his U.S. visa had nothing to do with that case .

Honest Money Gold & Silver Report NEW BOOK � HONEST MONEY �I sincerely believe ... that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies , and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity under the name of funding is but swindling futurity on a large scale . � [ 1 ]
Legacy of Infamy
The year was 1933 .
Herbert Hoover was still President .
Franklin Delano Roosevelt waited in the wings to be sworn in as the new President of the United States .
The following Resolution was written by Eugene Meyers and the New York Bankers .
It was given to President Hoover at 10.00 pm. March 3 , 1933 .
Resolution Adopted by the Federal Reserve Board of New York �WHEREAS ,
In the opinion of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , the continued and increasing withdrawal of currency and gold from the banks of the country has now created a national emergency , and WHEREAS ,
It is understood the adequate remedial measures cannot be enacted before tomorrow morning , NOW , THEREFORE , BE IT RESOLVED , That in this emergency the Federal Reserve Board is hereby requested to urge the President of the United States to declare a bank holiday Saturday , March 4 , and Monday , March 6 , in order to afford opportunity to governmental authorities and banks themselves to take such measures as may be necessary to protect the interests of the people and promptly to provide adequate banking and credit facilities for all parts of the country .
Proposed Executive Order EXECUTIVE ORDER WHEREAS the nation 's banking institutions are being subjected to heavy withdrawals of currency for hoarding ; and WHEREAS there is increasing speculative activity in foreign exchanges ; and WHEREAS these conditions have created a national emergency in which it is in the best interest of all bank depositors that a period of respite be provided with a view to preventing further hoarding of coin , bullion or currency or speculation in foreign exchange , and permitting the application of appropriate measures for dealing with the emergency in order to protect the interests of all the people ; and WHEREAS it is provided in Section 5 ( b ) of the Act of October 6 , 1917 , as amended , that " The President may investigate , regulate , or prohibit , under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe , by means of licenses or otherwise , any transactions in foreign exchange and the export , hoarding , melting , or earmarking of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency ; and WHEREAS it is provided in Section 16 of the said Act that " Whoever shall willfully violate any of the provisions of this Act or of any license , rule , or regulation issued there under , and whoever shall willfully violate , neglect , or refuse to comply with any order of the President issued in compliance with the provisions of this Act shall , upon conviction , be fined not more than $ 10,000 , or , if a natural person , imprisoned for not more than ten years , or both ; NOW , THEREFORE , pursuant to the authority granted by said Act , I hereby order , direct and declare that : 1 . From Saturday , the fourth day of March , to Tuesday , the Seventh day of March , Nineteen Hundred and Thirty Three , both dates inclusive , there shall be maintained and observed throughout the United States of America a bank holiday for all of the purposes herein after set forth .
2. During said holiday , no banking institution as hereinafter defined shall pay out , export , earmark , or permit the withdrawal or transfer in any manner or by any device whatsoever of any gold or silver coin or bullion or currency or take any other action which might facilitate the hoarding thereof ; nor shall any such banking institution pay out deposits , make loans or discounts , deal in foreign exchange , or transact any other banking business whatsoever .
3 . Upon the expiration of said holiday and until otherwise ordered by the President of the United States , such banking institutions may pay out , export , earmark or permit the withdrawal or transfer of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency , or deal in foreign exchange to extent as may be permitted by license or otherwise under regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury with the approval of the President .
4 . The Secretary of the Treasury , with the approval of the President , is authorized and empowered to prescribe such regulations as he may find necessary to carry out the purposes of the order .
5 . The term �banking institution� as herein used shall include all Federal reserve banks , national banking associations , banks trust companies , savings banks , building and loan associations , credit unions , or other corporations , partnerships , associations or persons engaged in the business of receiving deposits , making loans , discounting business paper , or transacting any other form of banking business� .

The White House
March , 1933 .
The following is a letter sent by President Hoover to Eugene Meyer : � My dear Governor Meyer : I received at half past one this morning your letter dated March 3rd .
I must assume that this letter was written on the basis of information received by you prior to 11:30 o'clock last night for the reason that before your letter was sent you had certain information as follows : a .
At 11 o'clock last night the President elect had informed me he did not wish such a proclamation issued .
b.
The Attorney General had renewed the same opinion which he had already given to the Board that the authorities on whom you were relying were inadequate unless supported by the incoming Administration .
c.
That groups of representative bankers in both Chicago and New York , embracing members of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks in those cities , were then in conference with the governors of the states of Illinois and New York , and that the governors of these two states were prepared to act if these representative groups so recommended .
It appears that the governors did take action under their authorities , declaring a temporary holiday in these two critical states , and thus accomplishing the major purposes which the Board apparently had in mind .
In view of the above I am at a loss to understand why such a communication should have been sent to me in the last few hours of this Administration , which I believe the Board must now admit was neither justified nor necessary .
Yours faithfully , Herbert Hoover �
The Issues There are three crucial points that stand out and above the many issues that could be addressed .
It is troubling that the Federal Reserve is recommending , almost dictating , Presidential policy and subsequent actions they urge the President to take .
President Hoover said that President elect Roosevelt had indicated that he did n't see the necessity or urgency in issuing a proclamation concerning the supposed national emergency .
What transpired for President Roosevelt to diametrically change his mind just a few hours later ?
Whatever it was , it must have been pretty serious to warrant such drastic changes .
Roosevelt �s First Actions as President
The day after Roosevelt took the presidential oath of office , he issued a proclamation calling Congress into special session .
He also declared a national bank holiday , the very same action that he had refused to agree with during Hoover �s last few days in office .
Such actions were a stunning turn of events .
On March 9 , 1933 , President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed executive orders 6073 , 6102 , 6111 , and 6260 , starting what was quickly to become an avalanche of draconian measures , forced upon an unsuspecting and supposedly free people .
By using the above executive orders , the new President declared a national emergency that made it unlawful for any citizen of the United States to own gold ; the very same gold that was the hard money currency of the Constitution , as well as the circulating currency of the time .
This was a sad day in our country�s history , as a basic right of the Constitution , the right to private property , had been confiscated without just compensation and due process .
Such action cannot be lawfully done without a constitutional amendment , and one has not even been mentioned , let alone passed .
The Supreme Law of the Land states that any law not in pursuance of the Constitution is null and void , as if it never occurred .
It has no legally binding authority .
Not only had this act been perpetrated without a constitutional amendment , it was actually diametrically opposed to the Constitution , trampling the people�s unalienable rights into the ground .
It arguably amounted to a declaration of National Bankruptcy .
What National Emergency
What was the national emergency that prompted Roosevelt to declare that the public�s gold be called in and confiscated ?
Did Roosevelt have the authority to declare such a national emergency , based solely on the fact that private banks were having financial problems ?
And what exactly was the source of the bank�s problems ?
If all shoemakers are going out of business because of inept business practices , should the President declare a national emergency and bail them out ?
This is not how free markets work .
The government should not intervene within the workings of a free market .
The government�s job is to protect the people�s unalienable rights � life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , not to bail out an industry that caused its own bankruptcy .
Is holding the office of the President of the United Sates sufficient authority to go against the Constitution , the very same Constitution he takes an oath of office to preserve , defend and protect ?
Let�s return to the record to see exactly what the emergency was : Emergency Banking Relief Act of 1933 U.S .
Statutes at Large ( 73rd Congress , 1933 p. 1 - 7 )
An Act
� To provide relief in the existing national emergency in banking , and for other purposes .
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled , that the Congress hereby declares that a serious emergency exists and that it is imperatively necessary to speedily put into effect remedies of uniform national application� . [ 4 ]
So , as the above clearly states , the emergency was a national emergency in banking .
By what authority was this national emergency declared and or authorized ?
Let�s once again look to the record , as our government statutes record the above quoted Emergency Banking Relief Act of 1933 : TITLE I
� Section 1 .
The actions , regulations , rules , licenses , orders and proclamations heretofore or hereafter taken , promulgated , made , or issued by the President of the United States or the Secretary of the Treasury since March 4 , 1933 , pursuant to the authority conferred by subdivision ( b ) of section 5 of the Act of October 6 , 1917 , as amended , are hereby approved and confirmed . � [ 5 ]
So , the authority was �pursuant to the authority of subdivision ( b ) of section 5 of the Act of October 6 , 1917 , as amended , are hereby approved and confirmed� .
This refers to The Trading with the Enemy Act , which comes under The War Powers Act.
Notice , however , the last section that comes right after the date of 1917 , which states : �as amended , are hereby approved and confirmed� .
The original Trading with the Enemy Act was not exactly what Roosevelt and the banking powers had in mind , so they changed the act by issuing amendments to fit their agenda .
The Amendments Section 2 . Subdivision ( b ) of section 5 of the Act of October 6 , 1917 ( 40 Stat. L. 411 ) :
''( b ) During time of war or during any other period of national emergency declared by the President , the President may , through any agency that he may designate , or otherwise , investigate , regulate , or prohibit , under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe , by means of licenses or otherwise , any transactions in foreign exchange , transfers of credit between or payments by banking institutions as defined by the President , and export , hoarding , melting , or earmarking of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency , by any person within the United States or any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof ; and the President may require any person engaged in any transaction referred to in this subdivision to furnish under oath , complete information relative thereto , including the production of any books of account , contracts , letters or other papers , in connection therewith in the custody or control of such person , either before or after such transaction is completed .
Whoever willfully violates any of the provisions of this subdivision or of any license , order , rule or regulation issued there under , shall , upon conviction , be fined not more than $ 10,000 , or , if a natural person , may be imprisoned for not more than ten years , or both ; and any officer , director , or agent of any corporation who knowingly participates in such violation may be punished by a like fine , imprisonment , or both .
As used in this subdivision the term ' person ' means an individual , partnership , association , or corporation� . [ 6 ]
Now let�s look at a comparison between the two versions of � the act . �
� Section 2 . Subdivision ( b ) of section 5 of the Act of October 6 , 1917 ( 40 Stat. L. 411 ) , is hereby amended to read as follows :
Within the Act they rewrote Section 5 ( b ) of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 .
What follows is the original act with the new wording of the amended act underlined , and with those of parts of the original act that were removed , having a line drawn through them .
� During time of war or any other period of national emergency declared by the President , That the President may , through any agency that he may designate , or otherwise , investigate , regulate , or prohibit , under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe , by means of licenses or otherwise , any transactions in foreign exchange , export or earmarkings of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency , transfers of credit between or payments by banking institutions as defined by the President , and export , hoarding , melting , or earmarking of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency , in any form ( other than credits relating solely to transactions to be executed wholly within the United States ) ; and transfers of evidence of indebtedness or of ownership of property between the United States and any foreign country , whether enemy , ally of enemy or otherwise , or between residents of one or more foreign countries , by any person within the United States or any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof ; and he the President may require any such person engaged in any such transaction referred to in this subdivision to furnish , under oath , complete information relative thereto , including the production of any books of account , contracts , letters or other papers , in connection therewith in the custody or control of such person , either before or after such transaction is completed ... � [ 7 ]
Two points stick out like sore thumbs .
Transactions solely and wholly within the United States had been exempt in the original version , now such transactions were no longer exempt .
The original act covered property of foreign countries , whether enemy , ally of enemy or otherwise , while in the amended section the designation of enemy is left out , except in the title , and the general reason and reference for confiscation makes it sound like We The People are the enemy , as no one else is mentioned .
One can search from now until the end of time , and you will not find any mention of the enemy or the use of the word enemy in the amended section , as stated in the Emergency Banking Relief Act of 1933 .
Nor can one find that transactions solely and wholly within the United States are exempt .
As a matter of fact , the amendment contains exactly the opposite wording , meaning , and definitions .
�... any transactions in foreign exchange , transfers of credit between or payments by banking institutions as defined by the President .� �... or currency , by any person within the United States or any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof ...�
It thus appears that by taking the words and reference to enemy out of the body of what is the Trading With the Enemy Act , and replacing it with �any person within the United States , which persons were exempt in the original act� , sounds like We the People , or any person within the United States , are considered to be the enemy .
Remember , the Act is still designated as The Trading with the Enemy Act. A Crying Shame
The following is sited from the Emergency Banking Relief Act of 1933 :
Sec. 401 .
The sixth paragraph of Section 18 of the Federal Reserve Act is amended to read as follows : '' Upon the deposit with the Treasurer of the United States , ( a ) of any direct obligations of the United States or ( b ) of any notes , drafts , bills of exchange , or bankers ' acceptances acquired under the provisions of this Act , any Federal reserve bank making such deposit in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury shall be entitled to receive from the Comptroller of the Currency circulating notes in blank , duly registered and countersigned .
When such circulating notes are issued against the security of obligations of the United States , the amount of such circulating notes shall be equal to the face value of the direct obligations of the United States so deposited as security ; and , when issued against the security of notes , drafts , bills of exchange and bankers ' acceptances acquired under the provisions of this Act , the amount thereof shall be equal to not more than 90 per cent of the estimated value of such notes , drafts , bills of exchange and bankers ' acceptances so deposited as security .
Such notes shall be the obligations of the Federal reserve bank procuring the same , shall be in form prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury , shall be receivable at par in all parts of the United States for the same purposes as are national bank notes , and shall be redeemable in lawful money of the United States on presentation at the United States Treasury or at the bank of issue .
The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and empowered to prescribe regulations governing the issuance , redemption , replacement , retirement and destruction of such circulating notes and the release and substitution of security therefore .
Such circulating notes shall be subject to the same tax as is provided by law for the circulating notes of national banks secured by 2 per cent bonds of the United States .
No such circulating notes shall be issued under this paragraph after the President has declared by proclamation that the emergency recognized by the President by proclamation of March 6 , 1933 , has terminated , unless such circulating notes are secured by deposits of bonds of the United States bearing the circulation privilege .
When required to do so by the Secretary of the Treasury , each Federal reserve agent shall act as agent of the Treasurer of the United States or of the Comptroller of the Currency , or both , for the performance of any of the functions which the Treasurer or the Comptroller may be called upon to perform in carrying out the provisions of this paragraph .
Appropriations available for distinctive paper and printing United States currency or national bank currency are hereby made available for the production of the circulating notes of Federal reserve banks herein provided ; but the United States shall be reimbursed by the Federal reserve bank to which such notes are issued for all expenses necessarily incurred in connection with the procuring of such notes and all other expenses incidental to their issue , redemption , replacement , retirement and destruction� . [ 8 ]
Remember Recall that we have previously seen that for the first century of U.S. history our monetary system was in accordance with the Constitution : it was a hard money system of gold and silver coin .
Next , gold and silver certificates were issued that were 100 % backed by gold and silver coins .
Eventually , paper bank notes were issued and backed by the precious metals , but only by fractional reserves ( 40 % at the highest point ) .
Finally , our monetary system devolved into a dysfunctional mess of bills of credit or paper money , backed by nothing but empty promises and obligations to pay � paper fiat debt - money .
Section 401 , as quoted above , goes a long way in destroying and debasing the original hard money system of the Constitution , where payment of debt could actually be transacted with the circulating currency : gold and silver coin .
Hard money of gold and silver coin was not , and is not , representative of debt or promises to pay ; it is the means to pay debt .
One can not pay debt with debt � to believe such is to accept the unacceptable .
The present day monetary system , where the currency in circulation is backed by nothing but other government obligations of paper debt , i.e. bonds � is a mere shade of its former self .
It is nothing more than a tax payment coupon or debt obligation .
It is not payment but putting off unto others , the same as a bookie does to offset his risk and exposure .
We have gone from a solid monetary system of assets � of hard money , in the form of constitutionally mandated gold and silver coin , to a system of paper debt - money , backed by promises to pay with other promises to pay : obligations of debt .
Promises backed by promises .
Our monetary system has stepped over the edge , into the abyss ; we now have a public national credit system where debt is legal tender money , which is allowed to circulate and be accepted as the de facto currency of the realm .
Such a system is the elite collectivist�s dream come true , as it is the perfect wealth transference mechanism .
Suffice it to say that such a system is an abomination that walks the earth in darkness , casting shadows far and wide .
Clarity
What exactly does it mean when the national or public debt is allowed to circulate as the currency , and is accepted as legal tender ?
It means that all the people�s faith and credit has been pledged as the surety for the debt , by the same Congress who created the means that allowed the debt to be issued in the first place .
And how was this done , by House Joint Resolution 192 .
Before moving on to House Joint Resolution 192 , let�s make sure we understand exactly what it means when all the people of the country pledge their faith and credit as surety for the national or public debt .
The Federal Reserve accepts the public�s pledge of faith and credit , issued by and through the Treasury�s power to tax that same faith and credit , as surety for the national debt .
The Fed has implicit faith that the government will pay the Fed back the money it lends it , based on the assumption that the government�s power to tax the people is so great , that it alone is sufficient collateral for the loans the Fed makes to the Treasury .
So , why is it said that the people are collectively giving their faith and credit as a pledge of surety for the payment of the national debt ?
First , remember , the national debt cannot be paid off � it is impossible .
The reason why the people are said to be giving their faith and credit as surety , is because the only means the government has to procure money from , is by the collection of taxes , and its issuance of U.S. Treasury paper ; in other words � from We The People .
But not all bonded debt is bought by U.S. entities ; China and Japan now buy over 40 % of our government debt ( bonds ) .
In other words , when the government promises to pay , those promises are made using our labor , our lives , and our time spent on earth working , in order to earn income to pay our taxes with .
Consequently , it is the people who are pledging their faith and credit � literally , as we are contractually obligating ourselves to continue to work , produce , and earn , enough money to service the interest rate payments on the national debt .
Joint Resolution 192 On June 5 , 1933 , Congress passed House Joint Resolution 192 in order to suspend the gold standard , and to make it appear that the gold clause in the national constitution had been revoked .
House Joint Resolution 192 states in part that : � Whereas the holding or dealing in gold affects the PUBLIC INTEREST , and are therefore subject to proper regulation and restriction : and whereas the existing emergency has disclosed that provisions of obligations which purport to give the obligee a RIGHT TO REQUIRE PAYMENT in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency .... ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE DECLARED POLICY OF CONGRESS IN THE PAYMENT OF DEBTS ........... ........... PAYMENT in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency , or in an amount in money of the United States measured thereby , IS DECLARED TO BE AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY : ........................ AND ........... EVERY OBLIGATION , HERETOFORE OR HEREAFTER INCURRED , SHALL BE DISCHARGED upon payment , dollar for dollar , in any coin or currency which , at the time of payment , is legal tender for public and private debts ....
All coins and currencies of the United States ( including Federal Reserve Notes and circulating notes of Federal Reserve banks and national banking associations ) heretofore , or hereafter , coined or issued , SHALL BE LEGAL TENDER for all debts , public and private , public charges , taxes , duties , and dues ....� [ 9 ]
The suspension of the gold standard , and the prohibition against paying off debts with gold and silver coin , removed the last vestige of real honest money , replacing it with a national public credit system , where debt is circulated and accepted as the currency by the mandate of legal tender laws .
The year 1933 , saw a general banking crisis bad enough for the government to declare a national emergency , which meant that in only twenty short years after being created , the Federal Reserve screwed the whole thing up bad enough to warrant a national crisis , which supposedly was one of the Fed�s reasons for being created � to stop panics and runs on banks , to avert exactly what they created � a National Emergency .
And yet we find that it was the Federal Reserve that was dictating to the President how to handle the crisis , the crisis it had caused .
It was the Federal Reserve that wrote the blueprint to save the banks � by confiscating and outlawing We The People�s Gold , which is one of the most basic and important rights that the Constitution grants .
Where was the protection of our constitutional rights , which is the reason the Constitution was written , the same reason why the government was created , and the reason why the President takes an oath of office to preserve , protect , and to defend that selfsame Constitution ?
And these far sweeping changes were implemented in less than 40 minutes by Congress .
Here is what a true representative of the people had to say about the passage of this bill : Congressman Lundeen : � Mr. Speaker , today the Chief Executive sent to this House of Representatives a banking bill for immediate enactment .
The author of this bill seems to be unknown .
No one has told us who drafted the bill .
There appears to be a printed copy at the speaker�s desk , but no printed copies are available for the House Members .
The bill has been driven through the House with cyclonic speed after 40 minutes debate , 20 minutes for the minority and 20 minutes for the majority .
I have demanded a roll call , but have been unable to get the attention of the Chair .
Others have done the same , notably Congressman SINCLAIR of North Dakota , and Congressman BILL LEMKE , of North Dakota , as well as some of our other Farmer Labor Members .
Fifteen men were standing , demanding a roll call , but that number is not sufficient ; we therefore have the spectacle of the great House of Representatives of the United States of America passing , after a 40 - minute debate , a bill its Members never read and never saw , a bill whose author is unknown .
The great majority of the Members have been unable to get a minute 's time to discuss this bill ; we have been refused a roll call ; and we have been refused recognition by the Chair .
I do not mean to say that the Speaker of the House of Representatives intended to ignore us , but everything was in such turmoil and there was so much excitement that we simply were not recognized .
I want to put myself on record against procedure of this kind and against the use of such methods in passing legislation affecting millions of lives and billions of dollars .
It seems to me that under this bill thousands of small banks will be crushed and wiped out of existence , and that money and credit control will be still further concentrated in the hands of those who now hold the power .
It is safe to say that in normal times .
After careful study of a printed copy and after careful debate and consideration , this bill would never have passed this House or any other House .
Its passage could be accomplished only by rapid procedure , hurried and hectic debate , and a general rush for voting without roll call .
I believe in the House of Representatives .
I believe in the power that was given us by the people .
I believe that Congress is the greatest and most powerful body in America , and I believe that the people have vested in Congress their ultimate and final power in every great , vital question , and the Constitution bears me out in that .
I am suspicious of this railroading of bills through our House of Representatives , and I refuse to vote for a measure unseen and unknown .
I want the RECORD to show that I was , and am , against this bill and this method of procedure ; and I believe no good will come out of it for America .
We must not abdicate our power to exercise judgment .
We must not allow ourselves to be swept off our feet by hysteria , and we must not let the power of the Executive paralyze our legislative action .
If we do , it would be better for us to resign and go home and save the people the salary they are paying us .
I look forward to that day when we shall read the bill we are considering , and see the author of the bill stand before the House and explain it , and then , after calm deliberation and sober judgment � after full and free debate �
I hope to see sane and sensible legislation passed which will lift America out of this panic and disaster into which we were plunged by the World War� . [ 10 ]
It almost sounds like somebody went bankrupt , or would have , if they didn�t get all that gold into their grimy little clutches .
They say there was a national crisis , but they were wrong � again .
The real crisis was confiscating the people�s gold and trampling the Constitution into the ground in the process .
First , the people�s money of gold coin , one of the two forms of honest or lawful money according to the Constitution , was taken from them and made illegal to have possession of � a basic right of ownership to private property granted by the Declaration of Independence , and the Constitution �
The Supreme Law of the Land .
Next , the people were forced to accept paper money , no longer redeemable in gold coin .
This certainly was a New Deal , if not a raw deal .
Is it any wonder social security rose phoenix - like from the ashes of the hard money system of gold and silver coin the Constitution mandates ?
Something � anything had to be offered to the public , to make it appear that the government was in control of the fiscal and monetary affairs of the country , and that the people would be taken care of .
As long as the people are dependent upon the government , the government retains control over them .
So what talisman did the government offer to the people , tossed as a bone to a starving dog : Social Security .
This was a sad day in the affairs of man � a great theft had been made , but the most precious loot was not the gold that was confiscated � it was the freedom and liberty of the Constitution that had been stomped into the mud and stripped from the people , as if rags upon their backs .
Lest not forget : � The fate of the nation and the fate of the currency are one and the same . " [ 11 ]

Six in 10 Americans say the government should not regulate whether gays and lesbians can marry the people they choose , a survey finds .
As same - sex couples line up to get marriage licenses in California on June 17 , the USA TODAY / Gallup Poll found that 63 % of adults say same - sex marriage is " strictly a private decision " between two people .
That the government has the right " to prohibit or allow " such marriages was stated by 33 % , and 4 % had no opinion .
QUESTION OF THE WEEK : Does it matter to you whom your neighbor marries ?
On Monday , the California secretary of state said an initiative to amend the state Constitution to define marriage as a union " between a man and a woman " will be on the ballot Nov. 4 .
If it passes , it would overturn a state Supreme Court ruling in May that legalized same - sex marriage .
After Massachusetts legalized same - sex marriage in 2004 , 11 states voted on similar questions .
" Those initiatives … did have an impact in election results , " says Mark Rozell , professor of public policy at George Mason University in Fairfax , Va . " Turnout was 2.4 % higher on average in those 11 states than the other 39 states . "
But these poll findings " suggest caution " to conservative activists who think this will mobilize voters , he says .
" People were warned , with lots of overheated rhetoric , about the consequences of gay marriage in Massachusetts .
They did n't see it affect their own lives .
Now , most people have let loose a collective yawn about the issue . "
Poll findings :
A majority of respondents at every level of education and income say same - sex marriage is " strictly private . "
This was true :
• In every region : East ( 71 % ) , West ( 64 % ) , Midwest ( 63 % ) and South ( 56 % ) .
• Among all ages except " 65 and older " : 18 to 29 ( 79 % ) , 30 to 49 ( 65 % ) , 50 to 64 % ( 62 % ) and 65 and older ( 44 % ) .
• Among people who also say they have a favorable view of any of the three leading presidential candidates .
For those holding favorable views for John McCain , 55 % say marriage is a private decision ; for Barack Obama , 75 % say so ; and for Hillary Clinton , 69 % do .
All three oppose same - sex marriage .
Both Democrats both favor civil unions .
• Among people who say a relative , friend or co-worker personally has told them he or she was gay or lesbian ( 73 % ) .
The strongest support for government regulation of same - sex marriage came from people who say they :
• Attend religious services weekly ( 56 % ) .
• Are Republicans ( 56 % ) .
• Are politically conservative ( 54 % ) .
" After Massachusetts , the public has seen that the decision there has not affected people 's lives as much as was feared , " Rozell says .
Still , there are forms of marriage Americans overwhelmingly do want to see regulated : 66 % say polygamy should not be a strictly private decision ; 78 % say the government should regulate marriages involving someone under 16 .
Every state but one , New Hampshire , requires parental permission to marry someone under 18 , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .
New Hampshire sets the age at 17 .
Mississippi sets it at 21 .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Cannabis will be raised to a class B drug with a maximum five year jail term for users , the government said on Wednesday , rejecting a recommendation from its own drugs advisers to leave the classification unchanged .

Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said the decision had been made because of concern , particularly amongst the public , about the “ alarming ” use of skunk , a stronger strain of the narcotic which now dominates the market .
“ I want it to be clearly understood that this powerful form of cannabis is an illegal and harmful drug , ” Smith told parliament , vowing the change would be backed by crackdowns on cannabis farms .
“ There is a compelling case for us to act now , rather than risk the future health of young people . ”
Her announcement followed the publication of a report by the independent Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) which said there was insufficient evidence to regrade cannabis to the more serious class B .
“ After careful scrutiny of the available evidence , the ACMD considers -- based on its harmfulness to individuals and society -- that cannabis should remain a class C substance , ” said Chairman Michael Rawlins .
Prime Minster Gordon Brown had been widely expected to ignore the advice because of fears over the mental health effects of skunk .
Last month Brown said he wanted to send a strong message that use of the drug was “ unacceptable ” .
Cannabis was downgraded to Class C -- which includes substances such as anabolic steroids -- on the ACMD ’s advice in January 2004 .
That meant possession of the drug was treated largely as a non-arrestable offence .
Under the tighter class B rules , which put cannabis on a par with amphetamines and barbiturates , users face up to five years ’ jail and suppliers a maximum of 14 years .
Proponents of a tougher drugs policy said its Class C status ignored cannabis ’s potential health impacts .
Mental health criminal lawyer Grahame Stowe , a partner at law firm Grahame Stowe Bateson , said reclassification of cannabis is long overdue .

“ Those of us who work in the criminal and mental health spheres of the legal industry are acutely aware of the danger cannabis poses and the long - term damage it causes , ” the lawyer , who has 35 years ’ experience , said in a statement .
“ Reclassification is the only way to address this problem and make concrete progress on tackling cannabis use . ”
The ACMD was asked by Brown shortly after he took office last June to review the drug ’s classification and it reported to ministers last week .
Going against the council ’s advice is controversial given it plays a major role in drugs policy , but Brown was also likely come under fire from those who said drugs policy was too soft if he decided to keep the narcotic in Class C .
Wednesday ’s move was welcomed by police and the Conservative party , although it condemned the government for the original decision to downgrade the drug , saying it had increased the size of the cannabis market .
[ UPDATE ]
Since this story was first published Wednesday , GameSpot editors Alex Navarro , Ryan Davis , Ricardo Torres , and Ryan MacDonald have appeared on the HotSpot podcast to discuss Jeff Gerstmann 's departure .
You can hear it on the official HotSpot page or via the links below .
The original story is as follows .
The past week marked the end of an era at GameSpot .
After over a decade in a variety of editorial roles , Jeff Gerstmann 's tenure as editorial director has ended .
" Jeff was a central figure in the creation and evolution of GameSpot , having written hundreds of previews and reviews , and anchoring much of our multimedia content , " said Ricardo Torres , editorial director of previews and events .
" The award - winning editorial team he leaves behind wish him nothing but good luck in his future endeavors . "
Due to legal constraints and the company policy of GameSpot parent CNET Networks , details of Gerstmann 's departure cannot be disclosed publicly .
However , contrary to widespread and unproven reports , his exit was not a result of pressure from an advertiser .
" Neither CNET Networks nor GameSpot has ever allowed its advertising business to affect its editorial content , " said Greg Brannan , CNET Networks Entertainment 's vice president of programming .
" The accusations in the media that it has done so are unsubstantiated and untrue .
Jeff 's departure stemmed from internal reasons unrelated to any buyer of advertising on GameSpot . "
" Though he will be missed by his colleagues , Jeff 's leaving does not affect GameSpot 's core mission of delivering the most timely news , video content , in - depth previews , and unbiased reviews in games journalism , " said Ryan MacDonald , executive producer of GameSpot Live .
" GameSpot is an institution , and its code of ethics and duty to its users remains unchanged . "
Tune in later in the week to hear editors ' tributes to Gerstmann on GameSpot 's weekly Webcast , On the Spot .

IN AMERICA they call it the China question .
In Europe they call it the America question .
In every country that has contemplated regulating greenhouse gases , it is seen as a problem : how can policy ensure that legal limits on emissions do not put local firms at a disadvantage to their foreign competitors ?
After all , if the cost of compliance puts factories in countries with strict rules out of business , while those in grubbier places flourish , a regulation is worse than useless .
The planet 's emissions stay the same , or rise , while the country doing its bit for the environment loses investment and jobs .
Politicians have been quick to spot this threat .
Back in 1997 America 's Senate voted by 95 - 0 to reject any international treaty on climate change that did not embrace industrial rivals such as China .
A bill to limit emissions that came close to passing the Senate earlier this month included fearsome “ carbon tariffs ” on imports from such countries , to help shelter American factories from unfair competition .
But warnings from manufacturers that the bill would still cost millions of jobs helped to ensure its defeat .
The European Union has already adopted an emissions cap , but France 's president , Nicolas Sarkozy , wants it to build in a “ carbon tariff ” too .
How grave is the danger that these tariffs would counter ?
By a variety of methods , economists are trying to assess which industries are most at risk , how much they would suffer under different climate regimes and how best to respond .
Their findings do not support the shrill protectionist rhetoric .
Lost in the hot air
The authors of “ Leveling the Carbon Playing Field ” , published recently by the Peterson Institute for International Economics , a think - tank based in Washington , DC , argue that the damage would be small .
Most manufacturers ( let alone service industries ) do not use much energy , the main source of emissions , and so would not suffer big costs .
Energy makes up less than 1 % of the cost of making cars , furniture or computers .
Even some energy - intensive industries , such as power generation , should not be much affected .
Since they have no foreign competition , they could pass on extra costs to their customers .
Only a few industries — metals , paper , chemicals , cement and the like — are both global and profligate enough to be at risk .
These accounted for just over 3 % of America 's output in 2005 and less than 2 % of its jobs .
Much the same is true in Europe : those industries , plus refining , account for less than 5 % of output and an even smaller share of jobs , according to the interim report * of a group of academics studying the effects of Europe 's carbon - trading scheme .
Even those supposedly vulnerable industries do not seem to have wilted in the face of a carbon price , according to two contributors to the study , Richard Baron and Julia Reinaud of the International Energy Agency , a Paris - based consultancy - cum - watchdog for energy - consuming nations .
Ms Reinaud cannot even detect any impact on aluminium , which is as energy - intensive and widely traded as any good .
She points out that a shuttered smelter in Germany reopened in 2007 , despite the rising cost of emissions .
There are many explanations for this resilience .
One is that booming demand for aluminium and other commodities has kept all manufacturers profitable .
Product specifications that vary from country to country , meanwhile , help to protect refiners from foreign competition .
And Europe has handed out so many free permits to pollute that the costs of meeting its emissions cap have been negligible so far .
But putting a price on carbon may still do some harm in the future , Ms Reinaud cautions .
Europe is planning a tighter cap and fewer free permits .
Many blueprints for emissions - trading in America call for no free allocations whatsoever .
What is more , the biggest effects may come not in the short term , as factory closures , but later , as lower investment in new plant .
A study sponsored by Resources for the Future , an American think - tank , has tried to describe how American industry would meet a carbon price , albeit one of just $ 10 a ton — much less than the European price of over € 25 ( $ 39 ) .
Based on economic modelling , it concludes that industrial output would fall by less than 1 % .
The hardest - hit industry would be metals , but even that would shrink by only 1.5 % .
Better yet , the damage could be offset by granting energy - intensive firms enough free permits to cover just 15 % of their emissions .
Another study under way at the Pew Centre on Global Climate Change , another think - tank , sizes up a $ 15 carbon price using data on the past effects of rising energy prices on industry .
It concludes that output would fall by 2 % or less in 80 % of cases .
Paper and glass would face a bigger contraction , of 5 % .
Still , even the most vulnerable industries would not suffer the Armageddon that lobbying groups are predicting .
That is important , since it suggests that the politicians are over - reacting , and that their remedies may actually make matters worse .
A carbon tariff , for example , would be hard to implement .
Customs officials would either have to assess the emissions embedded in imports , an impossibly complicated task , or make arbitrary assumptions , a recipe for a trade war .
Moreover , it would do nothing to protect exports of energy - intensive goods from cheap competition .
Many studies also point out that carbon caps could bring benefits , in the form of factories making windmills , say , or solar panels .
But these are even harder to quantify than the costs — and so they are even easier for the politicians to ignore .

Of course , as oil prices rise , so do the costs of these fuel subsidies .
Many of these countries are also trying to hold food prices steady as the prices of global food commodities soar .
Many countries - especially in the developing world -- are actually directly subsidizing fuel prices .
In the name of helping their citizens cope , they are subsidizing energy waste , subsidizing an addiction to imports , and subsidizing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions .
As I said in my previous post , a gasoline tax holiday would n't make much , if any , difference in the price of gas at the pump .
But if it did lower prices , the U.S. would be joining much of the rest of the world in helping keep demand artificially high .
That 's a recipe for fiscal disaster , and it distorts the market in disturbing ways .
This came up in a conversation I had this week with Rob J. Routs , executive director for oil products and chemicals at Royal Dutch Shell Group .
" Half of the world is not seeing the real oil price , " he said .
He cited India , Indonesia and China , among others , who are subsidizing oil prices so that consumers do n't pay the full amount .
The subsidies , he said , create false economic signals .
" In some countries , " he said , " people have gone 12 months and they have n't seen an increase at the pump .
That keeps demand up . "
For more information I turned to the International Monetary Fund Web site where Amine Mati of the fiscal affairs department wrote a paper earlier this spring tactfully titled " Managing Surging Oil Prices in the Developing World . "
Actually , they 're not being managed very well .
" Less than half of a sample of 42 developing and emerging market countries fully passed through sharply higher world oil prices to retail customers in 2007 , " Mati writes .
The biggest culprits : Oil exporting countries .
They can afford it , given high oil prices .
But it 's still bad energy and climate policy .
Not surprisingly , the Middle East is the one area of the world whose increase in oil consumption rivals China's .
Some countries do tax fuel , but over the past couple of years they have used the McCain - Clinton approach to limiting the big increases in domestic prices .
Lebanon , Mexico , and Peru have cut excise taxes and the Philippines and Ukraine have lowered import duties .
In India , subsidies for widely - used kerosene are also important and the government floats special bonds to cover the losses oil companies have because of price controls .
The Economist reported late last year that India 's fuel subsidies might cost as much as $ 17.5 billion in 2007 , according to Lombard Street Research , a British firm of economists .
" That amounts to as much as 2 % of the country 's GDP , " the magazine said .
If that 's right , then higher than expected oil prices this year will probably punch a $ 3 billion or $ 4 billion hole in the government 's budget .
In all these cases , the dilemma for the governments is the same : Pain now or pain later .
With rising oil prices , the pain deferred gets bigger all the time .
According to this article , Seattle has an approximately 12.9 % gay population , second only to San Francisco , which makes this story even more ridiculous .
Sirbrina Guerrero recently attended a game against the Red Sox at Safeco Field , intending to watch the Mariners continue in their struggle against success .
Unfortunately she got a lot more heartache than is normal from a Mariners game .
It seems that Ms. Guerrero is a lesbian , and she attended the game with some friends and her lover , ALSO A LESBIAN !
Horror !
Even worse , she kissed her LESBIAN LOVER on the lips !
The nerve of these people …
This disgusting bit of information is not where the story ends though .
That ’s because a mother sitting behind them saw the two women kiss and was obviously horrified , so she dutifully and properly reported the incident to a security guard .
Siribrina Guerrero is out to convert the world to rampant lesbianism and must be stopped
“ And he ( the security guard ) goes ‘ there ’s a lady whose son says he saw you guys making out , and I did , too .
And you have to stop . ’
And I said ‘ well , we were n’t making out , but we were kissing and I ’m not going to stop , ' ” said Guerrero .
The security guard then said , “ The mom does n’t want to explain to the kids why two girls are kissing . ”
Guerrero said , “ So I said ‘ well , I ’m not going to stop , so you ’ll have to kick me out .
So he said ‘ so I suggest you leave then . ” ‘
Who do these lesbians think they are ?
I mean , in a city where the gay population thrives , have n’t they done enough ?
I mean , this mother is clearly caring about her children , and the sheer difficulty in trying to explain to her overprotected douchebag kids that two women can be together and love one another and such is simply a burden that should n’t be placed upon a parent .
After all , if her kids see two women kiss who knows what else it might lead to , maybe her son will become a GAY !
That ’s how it spreads after all , you see two lesbians kiss and then you get infected and then BAM one day you ’re a homo .
This mother just came to the game to try and show her children the joy of America ’s pastime but instead was treated to a filth show .
I am horrified for her .
No one expects to go to a baseball game and see people kissing , least of all the GAYS .
We all know that it says somewhere in the Bible that you are n’t supposed to be gay–it makes Jesus and polar bears cry .
And polar bears are endangered !
I am obviously on the side of this heartbroken mother whose children now know that there exists a chance for them to be happy with whomever they might be attracted to , unlike their father who married their stupid dumb bitch of a mother to cover up his own gay urges ; that ’s why he is always going up to the attic to read those men ’s fitness and muscle magazines in his “ special ” corner …
After Guerrero was spoken to by the security guard at the game , she went around and took pictures of other couples who kissed but were not reprimanded ; those couples were all heterosexual .
I ’m sure that that mother would agree that Safeco was right in not reprimanding those couples , after all , those people are in LOVE and can get MARRIED and make BABIES , whereas lesbians only want to STEAL babies for their disgusting witch rituals that cause Lillith Fair concerts to spring forth from the ground .
I can only conclude that these two women were viciously making out , probably fingerblasting each other and using things like this while watching Jose Vidro struggle to hit a single .
I mean , because that would be offensive and worthy of being spoken to by security .
But according to Guerrero when questioned if she and her date were acting lewd in any way that would have prompted such a firm response from the security guard , Guerrero said , “ We were eating garlic fries .
The last thing we wanted to do was make out with each other .
Honestly , that ’s what it was . ”
Sure .
Just another lesbian lie so they can join with the forces of Satan to try and take away the America that was promised to us all by Jesus .
It makes me sad .
UPDATED
The guys over at withleather have done a little bit of investigation on my story and Sirbrina Guerrero is also going to be a contestant on the upcoming Tila Tequila “ reality ” dating show on MTV and is on the cover of some magazine here , although that does n’t take away from the idiocy of the Safeco security guards .
We already know that Age of Conan enjoyed healthy preorder and launch sales , but has its momentum carried over into the summer months ?
According to Age of Conan ’s developer - publisher team , Funcom and Eidos , it most certainly has .
Age of Conan has been one of the top - selling PC games in every territory it 's been released in thus far , and it was the best - selling PC game in several European countries during the month of June .
While the exact number of up - to - date worldwide sales have yet to be compiled due to the different ways they ’re tracked in each country , Funcom has revealed that over 700,000 accounts have been created .
Nice job , guys !
“ We are incredibly pleased to see Age of Conan turning into an MMO phenomenon , ” said Gaute Godager , Game Director on Age of Conan .
“ As an MMO company we know that a good start is just the beginning for a virtual world .
All we care about now is to make Age of Conan into an even better game , and we have extensive plans to ensure that Age of Conan remains a top MMO alternative for many years to come . ”
Most of those “ extensive plans ” Godgar mentioned were revealed earlier this month , and I have to say , if these sorts of big updates become a regular thing , Age of Conan could very well secure its newfound position as the second largest subscription - based MMO .
It seems pretty doubtful that it could ever really challenge World of Warcraft ’s more than 10 million strong player base , but it has at least shown that new MMOs can go up against Blizzard ’s behemoth and still be successful .
Have you given Age of Conan a try yet ?
The Department of Defense is freaked out that the commercially - manufactured microchips in their tech might contain " kill switches " that bad people could use to remotely knock the devices out of operation .
So at the end of last year , DARPA launched its Trust In Integrated Circuits program to develop methods for sussing out chips with " malicious " circuitry hidden inside .
IEEE Spectrum writer Sally Adee looked at the technicalities of the controversy .
She told me , " I think interviewed every electrical engineer in the country so I could wrap my head around 1 ) why that 's a big deal and 2 ) how it would affect me ( I 'm selfish that way . )
From IEEE Spectrum :
Feeding those ( fever ) dreams is the Pentagon 's realization that it no longer controls who manufactures the components that go into its increasingly complex systems .
A single plane like the DOD 's next generation F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter , can contain an " insane number " of chips , says one semiconductor expert familiar with that aircraft 's design .
Estimates from other sources put the total at several hundred to more than a thousand .
And tracing a part back to its source is not always straightforward .
The dwindling of domestic chip and electronics manufacturing in the United States , combined with the phenomenal growth of suppliers in countries like China , has only deepened the U.S. military 's concern .
Recognizing this enormous vulnerability , the DOD recently launched its most ambitious program yet to verify the integrity of the electronics that will underpin future additions to its arsenal .
In December , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , the Pentagon 's R&D wing , released details about a three - year initiative it calls the Trust in Integrated Circuits program .
The findings from the program could give the military –and defense contractors who make sensitive microelectronics like the weapons systems for the Fâ€ '35 – a guaranteed method of determining whether their chips have been compromised .
In January , the Trust program started its prequalifying rounds by sending to three contractors four identical versions of a chip that contained unspecified malicious circuitry .
The teams have until the end of this month to ferret out as many of the devious insertions as they can .
Vetting a chip with a hidden agenda can't be all that tough , right ?
Wrong .
Although commercial chip makers routinely and exhaustively test chips with hundreds of millions of logic gates , they can't afford to inspect everything .
So instead they focus on how well the chip performs specific functions .
For a microprocessor destined for use in a cellphone , for instance , the chip maker will check to see whether all the phone 's various functions work .
Any extraneous circuitry that does n't interfere with the chip 's normal functions wo n't show up in these tests .
" You do n't check for the infinite possible things that are not specified , " says electrical engineering professor Ruby Lee , a cryptography expert at Princeton .
" You could check the obvious possibilities , but can you test for every unspecified function ? "
Update : The Beta version of the desktop application described in this blog was pretty much a failed experiment for us .
We learned a lot though and just today launched a totally new desktop player that is part of our Pandora One subscription offering .
Learn all about Pandora
One here : Pandora
One , the new destkop app here : Pandora One Desktop and share your comments with us here : Blog Post announcing Pandora One
And for posterity , here ’s the original post on the “ old style ” desktop app :
We ’ve always wanted to find a simple way to deliver Pandora as a desktop application — it ’s probably been on our to do list longer than any single feature .
Today we ’re dipping our toe into those waters for the first time with the release of a Beta version of Pandora Desktop .
Truth is , this little guy is pretty simple .
It ’s just a way to pull Pandora out of a browser window and make it accessible with a single click from the Windows tray or Mac dock .
We ’ve built in quick access to common Pandora features from the tray / dock menu ( pause , change stations , etc ) .
If nothing else it ensures that you ’ll never accidentally browse away from Pandora and lose your stream .
One big caveat : it ’s important to understand that at Pandora we have big licensing and streaming bills to pay and from the beginning we ’ve been working hard to figure out that piece of the puzzle .
That means that advertising is an integral part of the Pandora experience and in an effort to keep the advertising as unobtrusive as possible we ’ve focused on graphical ads rather than audio ads .
The one downside to that is that we need lots of pixels to run the ads , so one thing you ’ll find with the desktop app is it ’s not some tiny little widget .
As nice as that would be , it would make it basically impossible for us to cover our costs with advertising .
So , at least for now , the main window of Pandora Desktop ( which you can minimize ) looks pretty much exactly like the Pandora.com home page .
One little caveat : this is a Beta and we ’re asking you to take a look and send us your thoughts and feedback to beta-feedback@pandora.com .
We ’re interested in everything from bug reports , to feature requests , to commentary about the general utility of the application .
The application is built using Adobe AIR , which should automatically install if you do n’t already have it .
If you have trouble with that step , there are links for a two - step manual install too .
Known issues : performance of the Mac version is more CPU intesive than we ’d like it to be .
This seems to be an Adobe AIR issue and we ’re working with Adobe to understand what we might be able to do to improve the situation .
To get started , visit this page : http://www.pandora.com/desktop and do n’t forget to send us your feedback .

Millicent
At the age of four ,
I was taken away from my family and placed in Sister Kate 's Home - Western
Australia where I was kept as a ward of the state until I was eighteen
years old .
I was forbidden to see any of my family or know of their whereabouts .
Five of us D. children were all taken and placed in different institutions
in WA .
The Protector of Aborigines and the Child Welfare Department in
their ' Almighty Wisdom ' said we would have a better life and future brought
up as whitefellas away from our parents in a good religious environment .
All they contributed to our upbringing and future was an unrepairable
scar of loneliness , mistrust , hatred and bitterness .
Fears that have been
with me all of life .
The empty dark and lonely existence was so full of
many hurtful and unforgivable events , that I cannot escape from no matter
how hard I try .
Being deprived of the most cherished and valuable thing
in life as an Aboriginal Child - love and family bonds .
I would like to
tell my story of my life in Sister Kate 's home - WA .
My name is Millicent
D. I was born at Wonthella WA in 1945 .
My parents were CD and MP , both
' half - caste ' Aborigines .
I was one of seven children , our family lived
in the sandhills at the back of the Geraldton Hospital .
There was a lot
of families living there happy and harmonious .
It was like we were all
part of one big happy family .
In 1949 the Protector
of Aborigines with the Native Welfare Department visited the sandhill
camps .
All the families living there were to be moved to other campsites
or to the Moore River Aboriginal Settlement .
Because my parents were fair
in complexion , the authorities decided us kids could pass as whitefellas .
I was four years old and that was the last time I was to see my parents
again .
Because my sisters were older than me they were taken to the Government
receiving home at Mount Lawley .
My brother Kevin was taken to the boys
home in Kenwick .
Colin and I were taken to the Sister Kate 's Home .
We
were put in separate accommodation and hardly ever saw each other .
I was
so afraid and unhappy and did n't understand what was happening .
We were told Sundays
was visiting day when parents and relatives came and spent the day .
For
Colin and I that was a patch of lies because our family were not allowed
to visit .
We spent each Sunday crying and comforting each other as we
waited for our family .
Each time it was the same - no one came .
That night
we would cry ourselves to sleep and wonder why .
We were too young to understand
we were not allowed family visits .
A couple of years
passed and I started primary school .
It had been such
a long time since I had seen my brother Colin .
I was so helpless and alone .
My brother had been taken away to the boys ' home in Kenwick and now I
was by myself .
I became more withdrawn and shy and lived in a little world
of my own hoping one day Mum would come and take me out of that dreadful
place .
As the years passed I realised that I would never see my family
again .
They told me that
my family did n't care ...
They told me that
my family did n't care or want me and I had to forget them .
They said it
was very degrading to belong to an Aboriginal family and that I should
be ashamed of myself , I was inferior to whitefellas .
They tried to make
us act like white kids but at the same time we had to give up our seat
for a whitefella because an Aboriginal never sits down when a white person
is present .
Then the religion
began .
We had church three times a day , before breakfast , lunchtime and
after school .
If we were naughty or got home from school late we had to
kneel at the altar for hours and polish all the floors and brass in the
church .
We had religion rammed down our throats from hypocrites who did n't
know the meaning of the word .
We used to get whipped with a wet ironing
cord and sometimes had to hold other children ( naked ) while they were
whipped , and if we did n't hold them we got another whipping .
To wake us
up in the morning we were sprayed up the backside with an old fashioned
pump fly spray .
If we complained we got more .
Hurt and humiliation was
a part of our every day life and we had to learn to live with it .
Several
more years passed and I still had no contact with my family , I did n't
know what they looked like or how I could ever find them .
By this time
I was old enough to go to High School .
This meant I did n't have to look
after several of the younger kids as I had previously done , bathing , feeding
and putting them on the potty and then off to bed , chopping wood before
school and housework which all of us kids done and the housemothers sat
back and collected wages - for doing nothing .
My life was miserable , and
I felt I was a nobody and things could n't get any worse .
But I was wrong .
The worst was yet
to come .
While I was in first
year high school I was sent out to work on a farm as a domestic .
I thought
it would be great to get away from the home for a while .
At first it was .
I was made welcome and treated with kindness .
The four shillings I was
payed went to the home .
I was n't allowed to keep it , I did n't care .
I
was never payed for the work I did at Sister Kate 's so you do n't miss
what you did n't get , pocket money etc .
The first time I
was sent to the farm for only a few weeks and then back to school .
In
the next holidays I had to go back .
This time it was a terrifying experience ,
the man of the house used to come into my room at night and force me to
have sex .
I tried to fight him off but he was too strong .
When I returned to
the home I was feeling so used and unwanted .
I went to the Matron and
told her what happened .
She washed my mouth out with soap and boxed my
ears and told me that awful things would happen to me if I told any of
the other kids .
I was so scared and wanted to die .
When the next school
holidays came I begged not to be sent to that farm again .
But they would
not listen and said I had to .
I ran away from the
home , I was going to try to find my family .
It was impossible , I did n't
even know where to go .
The only thing was to go back .
I got a good belting
and had to kneel at the altar everyday after school for two weeks .
Then
I had to go back to that farm to work .
The anguish and humiliation of
being sent back was bad enough but the worse was yet to come .
This time I was raped ,
bashed and slashed with a razor blade on both of my arms and legs because
I would not stop struggling and screaming .
The farmer and one of his workers
raped me several times .
I wanted to die , I wanted my mother to take me
home where I would be safe and wanted .
Because I was bruised and in a
state of shock I did n't have to do any work but was n't allowed to leave
the property .
When they returned
me to the home I once again went to the Matron .
I got a belting with a
wet ironing cord , my mouth washed out with soap and put in a cottage by
myself away from everyone so I could n't talk to the other girls .
They
constantly told me that I was bad and a disgrace and if anyone knew it
would bring shame to Sister Kate 's Home .
They showed me no comfort which
I desperately needed .
I became more and more distant from everyone and
tried to block everything out of my mind but could n't .
I ate rat poison
to try and kill myself but became very sick and vomited .
This meant another
belting .
After several weeks
of being kept away from everyone I was examined by a doctor who told the
Matron I was pregnant .
Another belting , they blamed me for everything
that had happened .
I did n't care what happened to me anymore and kept
to myself .
All I wanted now was to have my baby and get away as far as
I could and try and find my family .
My daughter was born
[ in 1962 ] at King Edward Memorial Hospital .
I was so happy , I had a beautiful
baby girl of my own who I could love and cherish and have with me always .
But my dreams were
soon crushed : the bastards took her from me and said she would be fostered
out until I was old enough to look after her .
They said when I left Sister
Kate 's I could have my baby back .
I could n't believe what was happening .
My baby was taken away from me just as I was from my mother .
My baby was taken
away from me just as I was from my mother .
Once again I approached
the Matron asking for the Address of my family and address of the foster
family who had my daughter .
She said that it was Government Policy not
to give information about family and she could not help me .
I then asked
again about my baby girl and was told she did not know her whereabouts .
In desperation I rang the King Edward Memorial Hospital .
They said there
was no record of me ever giving birth or of my daughter Toni .
Then I wrote
to the Native Welfare Department only to be told the same thing and that
there were no records of the D. family because all records were destroyed
by fire .
I now had no other
options but to find a job and somewhere to live .
After working for a while
I left Western Australia and moved to Adelaide to try and get my life
together and put the past behind me .
I was very alone , shy and not many
friends and would break down over the simplest thing .
Every time I saw
a baby I used to wonder , could that by my little girl .
I loved her and
so desperately wanted her back .
So in 1972 I returned to Western Australia
and again searched for my family and child .
I returned to see the Matron
from Sister Kate's .
This time she told me that my daughter was dead and
it would be in my best interest to go back to South Australia and forget
about my past and my family .
I so wanted to find them , heartbroken I wandered
the streets hoping for the impossible .
I soon realized that I could come
face to face with a family member and would n't even know .
Defeated I finally
returned to Adelaide .
In my heart I believed that one day everything would
be alright and I would be reunited with my family .
My baby was dead .
( That 's
what I was told ) .
I did n't even get to hold her , kiss her and had no photographs ,
but her image would always be with me , and I would always love her .
They
could n't take that away from me .

WASHINGTON -- Republican presidential candidates have traditionally been able to count on the support of U.S. farmers , but this year may be different .
According to farmers , lobby groups and academics , presumptive GOP nominee John McCain may not be able to take the crucial farm vote for granted .
The U.S. Senator from Arizona has never been a friend to the agricultural community and his long track record opposing farm subsidies may hurt him in the November election .

SvN reader Michelle posted this comment in the best customer experience you ’ve had lately thread :
Several weeks ago I ran out of cash at the Farmers ’ Market .
After sampling some goat cheese I told the vendor I ’d definitely buy some the next week because I ’d ran out of cash that day .
She said “ take it home today and pay me next week . ”
It ’s not surprising that a vendor at a Farmers ’
Market would behave that way but it was still so refreshing to just be trusted as a consumer .
It seems like so many businesses / vendors think consumers are “ trying to get one over ” on them .
Naturally the goat cheese lady now has a loyal customer for life .
It occurred to me the exact same concept applies to workplaces too .
Just swap out the word employee for customer .
When employees are trusted and treated like adults , they appreciate it just as much .
The result : loyal employees who want to stick around forever .

( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama has asked top contributors to help his former rival for the Democratic presidential nomination , Sen. Hillary Clinton , retire her debt , an Obama campaign source said Tuesday .
Obama did not direct members of his National Finance Committee to contribute to Clinton 's campaign , the source said , but asked them to do so if they were so inclined .
Clinton suspended her campaign and endorsed Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination this month .
She has amassed a campaign debt of about $ 22 million , but about $ 12 million of that is money the New York senator loaned to the campaign herself .
Individual donors can contribute $ 2,300 to individual candidates .
Clinton and Obama have scheduled a joint campaign appearance Friday in Unity , New Hampshire .
Obama said Tuesday that he had spoken with Clinton by phone earlier in the day as well as on Sunday .
" We had a good conversation , " he said .
" We 're looking forward to seeing each other tomorrow and campaigning on Friday . "

How Pure Is Your Altruism ?
We ’ve had a lot of conversations on this blog about charitable contributions .
For instance : where people like to give , and why ; how a young philanthropist should disburse $ 70 million ; whether to give to a street beggar , a hot dog vendor , or neither .
So let ’s start one more conversation on the subject .
There have been a pair of huge natural disasters in the past two weeks : a cyclone in Myanmar and and an earthquake in China , each of which have killed tens of thousands of people .
Have you written a check yet to donate to either cause ?
I seriously doubt it .
Why do I say that ?
Before looking at these recent tragedies , first consider the following three natural disasters from a few years ago , listed along with number of fatalities and amount of U.S. individual charitable donations ( according to Giving U.S.A . ) :
1. Asian Tsunami ( Dec. 2004 )
220,000 deaths
$ 1.92 billion
2. Hurricane Katrina ( Aug. 2005 )
1,577 deaths
$ 5.3 billion
3. Pakistan Earthquake ( Oct. 2005 )
73,000 deaths
$ 0.15 billion ( $ 150 million )
Americans gave nearly three times as much money after Hurricane Katrina as they did after the Asian tsunami , even though the tsunami killed many , many more people .
But this makes sense , right ?
Katrina was an American disaster .
Then along comes a terrible earthquake in Pakistan , killing 73,000 people , and U.S. contributions are only $ 150 million , making the $ 1.92 billion given after the tsunami look very , very generous .
That ’s only about $ 2,054 per fatality in Pakistan , versus an approximate $ 8,727 per fatality for the tsunami .
Two far - away disasters both with huge loss of life — but with a huge disparity in U.S. giving .
Why ?
There are probably a lot of explanations , among them :
1. Disaster fatigue caused by Katrina and the tsunami ; and
2. Lack of media coverage .
Do you remember coverage of the Asian tsunami ?
I am guessing you do , especially because in addition to hitting poor areas , it also struck high - profile resorts like Phuket .
Do you remember coverage of Hurricane Katrina ?
Of course .
But what about the Pakistan earthquake ?
Personally , I remember reading a couple of brief newspaper items but I did n’t happen to see any coverage on TV .
Consider the recent paper “ Media Coverage and Charitable Giving After the 2004 Tsunami , ” by Philip H. Brown and Jessica H. Minty .
Here ’s their rather startling — if sensible — conclusion :
Using Internet donations after the 2004 tsunami as a case study , we show that media coverage of disasters has a dramatic impact on donations to relief agencies , with an additional minute of nightly news coverage increasing donations by 0.036 standard deviations from the mean , or 13.2 percent of the average daily donation for the typical relief agency .
Similarly , an additional 700 - word story in The New York Times or Wall Street Journal raises donations by 18.2 percent of the daily average .
These results are robust to controls for the timing of news coverage and tax considerations .
And what causes one disaster to get a lot of coverage while another does n’t ?
Again , there are probably a lot of factors , foremost among them the nature of the disaster ( i.e. , how dramatic / telegenic is it ? ) and location .
Getting back to the recent disasters in Myanmar and China , I ’d say there are a few other things worth considering :
1 . We are in a season of heavy political coverage in the U.S. , which is hard to dislodge from the airwaves .
2. Covering far - away disasters is time - consuming and expensive , which becomes doubly prohibitive when media outlets are in cost - cutting mode .
3. Neither Myanmar nor China ( nor Pakistan ) have what one would consider a very high Q Score among Americans .
I am guessing that most Americans could n’t find Myanmar on a map , and if they have any impressions about the country at all , they are not good impressions ( think “ military junta ” ) .
Indeed , donations to Myanmar so far are very low .
Considering how unevenly disaster aid is often distributed , maybe this is n’t so terrible .
But still : if you are the kind of person who donates money to people in need , is n’t the family of a cyclone victim in Myanmar as worthy of your charity as anyone else ?
The political or narrative forces of a disaster should n’t change our response to the need , should they ?
We might like to think that we donate almost blindly , depending on need rather than our own response to the particulars of a disaster .
But the growing economics literature on charitable donations shows that is n’t the case .
In a narrow but very compelling piece of research , John List argued that if you are trying to solicit donations door - to - door , the single best thing you can do to get large donations is to be an attractive blond woman .
I thought of this research when the N.F.L. was raising money in a weekend telethon after Hurricane Katrina .
Between games and during halftimes , the league had star players manning the phones ; in the end , the money the league raised was relatively very , very low .
They probably would have done a lot better if they had used cheerleaders to solicit donations instead of the players .
So given the particulars of the disasters in Myanmar and China , as tragic as they are , I feel pretty confident in predicting that U.S. charitable contributions in each case wo n’t be very large .
( One surprising upside may , however , emerge for China : activists from the U.S. and elsewhere who ’ve been urging an Olympic boycott may find it harder to stir up anger against a country that will still be in mass mourning . )
It may be that the only kind of altruism that truly exists is what economists like to call “ impure altruism . ”
( This is a subject we ’ll be writing about at some length in SuperFreakonomics . )
Does this mean that human beings are shallow and selfish — that they only give to a cause when it is attractive to them on some level ?
Will the future produce some sort of “ disaster marketing ” movement in which aid agencies learn to appeal to potential contributors ?

Jerry Seinfeld claims a cookbook author is cooking up some fancy semantics by calling him an actor rather than a comedian to minimise the humour in statements she says defamed her .
Lawyers for Seinfeld say Missy Chase Lapine 's lawyers resorted to the switch in words to describe Seinfeld when several weeks ago they filed a rewritten version of her lawsuit against him and his wife in US District Court in Manhattan .
" Jerry Seinfeld is an enormously wealthy and well - known actor , " Lapine 's revised lawsuit said .
The original had called him a comedian .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Friday he failed to achieve any progress in Middle East peace talks with U.S. President George W. Bush and he was returning home with little to show for his visit .
In an interview with the Associated Press , the Palestinian leader sounded pessimistic about the prospects of achieving any deal with Israel this year despite a big U.S. push that began five months ago at a summit in Annapolis , Md .
" Frankly , so far nothing has been achieved .
But we are still conducting direct work to have a solution , " Abbas said .
Abbas said the biggest obstacle is Israel 's continued expansion of Jewish settlements on Palestinian - occupied territories .
" We demanded the Americans implement the first phase of the [ so - called road map to peace ] that talks about the cessation of settlement expansion , " Abbas said , expressing disappointment the U.S. has n't exerted more pressure on Israel to stop .
" This is the biggest blight that stands as a big rock in the path of negotiations . "
Israel is pushing forward with controversial building projects on disputed land in the West Bank and east Jerusalem and is refusing to take down illegal settlement outposts .
Abbas ' aides said he also was upset after his lunch Thursday with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
While discussing what a peace deal would look like , Rice did n't mention the Palestinian goal of creating a state based on borders before Israel captured Palestinian land during the 1967 Middle East War .
" We demanded that they talk about the ' 67 borders , " Abbas said , showing a rare flash of anger .
" None of them talks about the ' 67 borders . "
Asked if U.S. officials offered any new U.S. proposals , Abbas said no .
" They are exerting efforts .
And we are still negotiating , " he said , but he noted that no progress had been made on any of the core issues .
" All the files are still open .
None of them are concluded .
The situation is still as it was , " Abbas said , speaking in Arabic .
The main unresolved issues include the final borders of a Palestinian state , the fate of Jerusalem , disputed Israeli settlements and Palestinian refugees .
Saeb Erekat , the chief Palestinian negotiator , said Bush did n't respond directly when Abbas brought up the issue of Palestinian objections to continuing Israeli settlement expansion when the two leaders met Thursday at the White House .
" Bush told him ( Abbas ) that I 'm focusing on the bigger picture , " Erekat explained .

An immigration officer at Heathrow Airport
The government has launched the first stage of a new points - based system for migrants from outside the EU .
It will initially only apply to highly skilled workers already in the country who want to extend their stay .
But by the end of 2008 , every graduate with good English , on £ 40,000 or the local equivalent , will potentially have enough points to seek work in the UK .
The Tories say there should be a yearly cap on immigration , the Lib Dems say the rules could cause skills shortages .
Under the new system , skilled workers in occupations where there is a shortage will also be able to enter , provided they have a job offer .
' Biggest change '
But low skilled workers from outside the EU will be barred for the foreseeable future .
The government believes it can fill all manual work vacancies from EU countries which , with the exception of Romania and Bulgaria , face no restrictions on working in the UK .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said people wanted a system of managed migration .
He said : " If you 've got a skill to offer , we 're happy to look at what you have to offer to our country .
POINTS BASED SYSTEM Skills assessed Points awarded Points lead to entry 80 categories reduced to five Two - year roll - out
Points system explained " But obviously if we do n't need the skill , if you have n't got a skill , then there 's a case for us saying that this is not the right time for you to apply to come to our country . "
The government says it is the biggest change in UK immigration policy " in a generation " and will attract migrants with the right skills to boost Britain 's economy while easing pressure on local public services .
But the Conservatives say the changes are " over - hyped " and will not make a significant difference to the numbers entering the country .
English tests
The first phase - Tier One - replaces the existing highly skilled migrant programme , which is also based around points .
It is designed to attract entrepreneurs with significant sums to invest in British business as well as highly qualified people who the government believe will boost the economy .
All applicants will have to pass an English test - unless they have £ 1 m or more to invest .
HAVE YOUR SAY Immigration reforms are as good as the people who act on them Barry , Canada Skills and earning potential will also be taken into account - although much will depend on the country in which applicants live .
For example , someone applying for entry from a poor country , such as Nigeria or Afghanistan , will have to prove annual earnings of at least £ 4,000 , while somebody applying from a wealthier country will have to have a previous salary of £ 40,000 or more .
Tier two , to be launched later this year , will focus on filling gaps in the labour market - an independent committee will advise ministers on which skills the economy needs .
Flexibility Businesses who want to bring in skilled workers will need licences .
Other tiers covering temporary workers , young people and students will be introduced later .
We 've seen real strains in some areas ... and the new system makes no attempt to address that at all
Damian Green
Shadow immigration minister Immigration minister Liam Byrne said the changes , which he says are based on Australia 's immigration system , offer enough flexibility to respond to changing economic conditions .
" If and when we need to raise the points score that a migrant needs to come to Britain we can do that and do it instantly , rather than setting an arbitrary number , " he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
He rejected Conservative calls for an annual cap on immigration , which he warned could create " chronic skills crises " .
Mr Byrne has also said the new system will ease pressure on services and community tensions in parts of the UK experiencing high levels of immigration , even though many of the new arrivals are from Eastern European countries not covered by the points - based system .
' Over hyping '
But asked if he thought there were too many immigrants in Britain , he said " it ca n't be reduced to such simplicities " .
Mr Byrne has also introduced new fines for those found to be employing illegal immigrants as part of a move towards more managed migration .
But shadow immigration minister Damian Green said a " sensible " policy would include a cap on the number of migrants who can come to the UK .
He said : " We 've seen real strains in some areas on housing , on police , on hospitals and on school places and the new system makes no attempt to address that at all .
" You still do n't know whether you 're getting the right number of people that the social services , the public services , can absorb . "
For the Liberal Democrats , Tom Brake said : " This is going to discriminate against people perhaps working in the care sector because they 're unlikely to get a high number of points , or , for instance , people working in the restaurant trade .
" Those jobs are very unlikely to be filled by people from other EU countries and so we could then experience significant shortages in those areas . "

What are these ?
The voters ultimately will decide the political fate of Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle , unless the Republican Presidential candidate and his advisers decide to drop the Senator from the ticket - a decision that now appears unlikely , and a remedy that probably would be worse than the complaint .
On the second question , however , even the Quayle controversy probably wo n't set off much public agitation for a change in the method of choosing vice - presidential nominees .
No such discussion followed the Nixon '' fund crisis ' ' of 1952 or the removal of Tom Eagleton from the Democratic ticket in 1972 .
Perhaps Americans assume there 's no better way ; or that since vice presidents always have been chosen by Presidential nominees - at least since the 12th Amendment was ratified in 1804 - they always should be .
But vice presidents always stand only a heartbeat or a signature from the Oval Office .
In the postwar era alone , Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson succeeded to the office upon the deaths of Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy , and Gerald Ford had to take over when Richard Nixon resigned .
The age of terrorism , moreover , may have made Presidents more vulnerable to attack .
In the modern political era , vice presidents also are more often using the office to promote later Presidential nominations for themselves - Mr. Nixon in 1960 , Hubert Humphrey in 1968 , Walter Mondale in 1984 and Mr. Bush this year .
Mr. Bush may make it , although none of the others were successful ; but altogether , of the 10 Vice Presidents from Truman to Bush , 7 have become President , or a Presidential nominee , or both .
As Presidential nominees themselves have come to be chosen by their own independent efforts in primaries , they have somewhat similarly chosen their running mates by processes largely restricted to their own staffs .
The effectiveness of these staff processes has varied with the nominee .
But when vice presidents are more often becoming Presidents , and in an era when only the President 's hand can be on the nuclear button , the choice of a vice - presidential candidate ought not to be left to one man 's whim or campaign strategy or staff preference .
We do n't choose Presidents quite so cavalierly ; why should we pay less attention to vice - presidential candidates ?
This is a quick follow - up to yesterday ’s post – “ Where did all the PHP programmers go ? “ .
First of all , let me take the moment and say “ Wow ! ” .
Somebody submitted the post to Reddit and it made it to the front page and got an unbelievable amount of comments .
Almost 500 , and still coming .
Thank you all .
Secondly , the comments on this blog are fixed finally .
Murphy ’s Law in action – they got broken just before the wave came in and they got fixed shortly after .
Thirdly , I should clear up a few things .
My apologies for getting you guys confused .
I never asked any candidate to compare sorting algorithms , much less to implement them .
I asked to sort an array .
I was expecting one of those PHP function calls in return .
But I only got it a few times .
Many candidates did n’t know how to sort an array ( apparently they use MySQL to sort an array ) .
A few suggested “ bubble sort ” .
Probably thinking that the tasks for testing sorting algorithms .
One even went as far as implementing a bubble sort in PHP .
With pen and paper .
This one was the toughest to decide about , by the way .
Fourthly , the correction .
The language is indeed called Ruby , not Ruby on Rails .
I am aware of that .
I was just trying to catch a thought .
Thanks for pointing it out though .
Fifthly , explanation for the pen and paper .
Yes , I know that programmers are used to typing code .
I know that they are used to their tools and online references .
But .
This is an interview .
My time is limited and I have to make a decision .
If I give all the tools and references to my mother , she will be able to solve the problem I am giving in reasonable time .
She is not a PHP developer .
She has no experience with PHP .
But she has enough of common sense to do it .
If I take everything away – she wo n’t be able to do that .
But any semi-decent programmer will do .
Further on , I am not feeding the resulting paper into the machine .
The only parser that sees that code is the one embedded in my brain .
And I assure you it is very tolerant to minor syntax errors and missing parameters .
I want to see the process .
The approach .
Some data structures and algorithms .
A bit of style in variable names , indentation , and empty lines , if I am lucky .
That ’s all .
Sixthly , on the exercise itself .
I like to think that I am pretty flexible with answers .
For this particular exercise , a Perl programmer inside me thinks associative array is the best data structre .
( And yes , before you start bashing further , I know that associative arrays in PHP are n’t the same as hashes in Perl . )
I can accept an OOP solution just fine .
What I find hard to accept is a single dimensional array with hopping over a pre-defined number of fields per record .
Seventhly , this post , once it got to reddit and then furthermore to other news streams , generated more candidates and hints to where to find them , then all of my prevoius efforts .
Thanks to all of you who sent me resumes , links , and pointers .
My inbox is a bit overwhelmed right now , but I ’ll reply to everyone over the next few days .
Thanks a lot to all of you .

While no one agrees with everything a candidate for political office says , most people do n’t respond by making threatening phone calls or breaking into the candidate ’s house .
Mark Bennett , the 22 - year - old running for S.C. House District 105 against three other Republicans , said he experienced some constituent hostility Saturday night , when he was the victim of three separate personal attacks including a break - in .
“ I do n’t know if they are all related , but I think it ’s a big coincidence that after one , the others would happen , ” the candidate said Sunday .
Bennett said after campaigning door to door Saturday , he met up with his wife , Anita , to go to dinner .
As they were driving , just before 7:30 p.m. , he received a call on his cell phone .
A woman , who refused to identify herself , yelled at Bennett for 19 minutes over his stance on road improvement priorities in Horry County , he said .
The last sentence the woman said to him was what really bothered the Bennetts , who were listening on the speaker phone .
“ She said that she would hunt me down and yell at me in person and harm me in some way , and that she would make sure I was never elected to an office in Horry County , ” Bennett said .
He and his wife went to dinner , but as he thought about it , Bennett said he decided talking to the police could n’t hurt and filed a report at the Conway Police station while his wife went home .
When his wife arrived at their Conway home , she found the front door had been kicked in .
“ My wife called me while I was at the police station , and I sped home , followed by a police officer , ” Bennett said .
“ Whoever it was , they did n’t take anything .
The computer was there , the television was there , all my wife ’s jewelry was there .
They just left one of my campaign signs with a smiley face painted on it in the middle of the floor . ”
Officials at the Conway Police Department confirmed Bennett filed an incident report for harassing phone calls and breaking - and - entering .
Police said they did not know if the incidents were related .
“ I mean , that ’s intimidation , and it ’s frightening .
The thing is , Mark ’s message is so spot on , he ’s getting threats from people who disagree , ” Matt Jarfi , a friend and campaign adviser to Bennett , said .
Bennett said he noticed Sunday morning that most of his political posters and signs were gone .
“ If this is all related , then the weirdest thing to me is that the road - construction priorities are not something I would be able to change .
They ’re a county issue , and I ’m running for a state office , ” he said .
“ But this is n’t going to stop me from campaigning or from running . ”

Editor ’s Note :
This is a follow up post to Obama ’s Plan to Reduce Foreign Oil Dependence .
Regardless of who is elected next November , both candidates agree that climate change is a fact and not a theory .
“ I know that climate change is real , ” said John McCain .
“ We can have a debate about how serious it is , but the debate about climate change is over . ”
McCain and Obama however vary widely in their response to this issue , leaving the American people with a choice of approaches when choosing the next president .
McCain ’s primary weapons in this battle includes implementing a cap and trade system for emissions and utilizing greater amounts of nuclear power .
Cap and Trade
“ Cap and trade is being implemented in Europe and they have stumbled and they ’ve had problems but it is still the right thing to do , ” said John McCain .
“ It is what we did in relation to acid rain . ”
One of the reasons McCain supports this approach is because it encourages the market to respond with the lowest cost approach .
He believes the market will correct itself with the use of cleaner technologies without the need for intervention , such as a tax credit or major investment from the government .
One challenge with this plan is that we do n’t operate in a free market , which is needed for the market to correct the problem .
Large subsidies for oil companies makes alternative energy sources less affordable .
Many of the hidden costs of pollution are not accounted for , even under a cap and trade system .
For example , who is paying for the hospital visits when a child has an asthma attack ?
Nuclear Power
“ Nuclear power has got to be part of any real meaningful effort that we are going to make to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , ” said McCain .
“ It has got to be part of the equation . ”
McCain is concerned about proposed coal power plants and encourages development of nuclear power .
Despite his view that the market should correct itself , in May of 2005 and January of 2007 , McCain and Lieberman introduced a climate change bills that would give billions in subsidies to the nuclear industry .
Renewable Energy
Although McCain says that he supports renewable energy , he has set so specific targets .
John McCain ’s website makes no mention of solar , wind , renewable energy , or even public transportation under the section on climate change and has no section on energy .
The Senate was one vote shy of passing an economic stimulus package earlier this year that contained an incentive for solar energy .
McCain did n’t show up to vote .
“ Coal fired power plants , ” said McCain “ are being proposed to be built all over this country …
If you can generate that power and set up a station that is powered by solar , by God I would love it , but you know we do n’t have that technology . ”
Despite the advancement of renewable energy in recent years , McCain does n’t support incentives similar to what he has proposed for nuclear power .

A complete overhaul of the way people navigate the internet could begin following a crucial vote in Paris .
The net 's regulator Icann will vote to decide if the strict rules on so - called top level domain names , such as .com or .uk , can be relaxed .
If approved , firms could turn brands into web addresses while individuals could also grab a unique domain based on their name , for example .
Icann will also decide whether to allow names in Asian and Arabic languages .
" We are making it open for anyone to apply in any character set , not just Roman characters , " Dr Paul Twomey , chief executive of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( Icann ) , which acts as a sort of regulator for the net , told BBC News
He said that the proposals would result in the biggest change to the way the internet worked in decades .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It really wo n't make any difference .
People want .com .
All others just add confusion Ian Gibson , UK " The impact of this will be different in different parts of the world .
But it will allow groups , communities and business to express their identities online , " he said .
" Like the United States in the 19th Century , we are in the process of opening up new real estate , new land , and people will go out and claim parts of that land and use it for various reasons they have .
" It 's a massive increase in the geography of the real estate of the internet . "
Brand culture Icann has been working towards opening up net addresses for the past few years .
" We 've done two rounds of experimental introductions over the last five or six years to see how it would work and the Icann board is now considering [ expanding that ] , " explained Dr Twomey .
At the moment top level domains are currently limited to individual countries , such as .uk ( UK ) or .it ( Italy ) , as well as to commerce , .com , and to institutional organisations , such as .net , or .org .
The .com suffix is the most popular and lucrative .
To get around the restrictions , some companies have used the current system to their own ends .
For example , the Polynesia island nation Tuvalu , has leased the use of the .tv address to many television firms .
Under the new plans hundreds of new domain names could be created by the end of the year , rising to thousands in the future .
Individuals will be able to register a domain based on their own name , or any other string of letters , as long as they can show a " business plan and technical capacity " .
Companies will also be able to bid for addresses based on their brand names , although some believe they maybe faced with too much choice .
" Does Tesco want .supermarket or .groceries ? " said Graham Hales , of branding consultancy Interbrand .
" Or maybe it wants .value or .everylittlehelps .
The choice is endless . "
This never ending list of potential web real estate could cause problems , believes Jay Scott Evans , former chair of Icann 's intellectual property division and senior legal advisor for Yahoo .
" Why should brand owners have to invest huge amounts of money to protect their brands , " he said .
It is a view echoed by Geoff Wicks , chief executive of NBT , owner of the domain name registry Netnames .
Q&A : Internet shake - up " It will be expensive and pointless , " he said .
" It will be a big problem for companies as they will have to buy up lots of domains to cover themselves . "
Icann defends these claims and points out that companies will be able to secure domain names easily based on their intellectual property .
" There will be opportunities to protect brand names by appealing if someone else has put forward their brand , " said Dr Twomey .
This will protect so - called " cyber squatting " , where people buy - up domain names associated with well known names .
However , it does admit some could become subject to contention and a bidding war .
Dr Twomey said : " If there is a dispute , we will try and get the parties together to work it out .
But if that fails there will be an auction and the domain will go to the highest bidder . "
Adult web However , others back the plans .
For example , parts of the adult industry plan to carve out an area of the web specifically for their content .
This would be represented by the .xxx domain name , which has been proposed for more than half a decade by its backers , but blocked by Icann .
The latest attempt to launch .xxx was rejected by Icann last year on the grounds that approval would put the agency into the position of a content regulator .
When asked about the possibility of a .xxx domain name , Dr Twomey repeated only that the new system would be " open to anyone " .
The move could yet be blocked as the independent arbitration panel can reject domains based on " morality or public order " grounds .
Dr Twomey said Icann was still working through how much the application fee to register a domain name would be , but it is expected to be at least several thousand dollars .
" We are doing this on a cost recovery basis .
We 've already spent $ 10 m on this , " he said .

What are these ?
The boom in recruiting follows the establishment of a website by the Kyoto Traditional Musical Art Foundation , which made the music , dance and practices of the Geisha available to those outside the formerly closed world of the courtesans and their clients .
In science , as in most things , you usually get what you pay for .
Money does n't always mean you get the best .
Just ask the New York Yankees so far this season .
But when a nation has been the world leader at something as vital as , say , medical research and regulation , and annual funding is flat or declining when it used to go up , then money may matter .
The stakes for America were spelled out in a panel discussion held at the first - ever World Science Foundation last weekend in New York .
" I think there 's a loss of American power and prestige that came about as a result of our anti-science policies , " said biologist David Baltimore , a Nobel laureate and the chairman of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
Harold Varmus , another Nobel laureate and the president of Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in New York , decried the lack of attention being paid to advancing science even in the current presidential campaign .
" The campaign so far has given too little attention to what science means for our own economy and our status in the world , " he said .
This comes as reports and recommendations have been piling up describing the slowdown in research grants and projects at the National Institutes of Health since budgets began a decline in 2004 .
The American Association for the Advancement of Science concluded last spring that five years of shrinking budgets have led to an institute that is " falling further and further behind the increasing challenges and costs of biomedical research . "
Last week , the Senate voted to add $ 400 million tacked onto President Bush 's 2009 budget .
That is less than the $ 600 million Congress added to the budget in 2007 and 2008 , but better than the zero percent increase asked for by the president .
Even more acute is the situation at the Food and Drug Administration , where a report from an advisory panel described an agency in such desperate need for funding that it is in a state of near dysfunction .
The report , issued by the agency 's Subcommittee on Science and Technology in January , said that the F.D.A. " cannot fulfill its mission " in part " because its scientific workforce does not have sufficient capacity and capability . "
The culprit , the panel concluded , was a lack of funding and resources for an agency that oversees virtually all food and drugs American 's consume .
F.D.A. regulates $ 1 trillion of the nation 's economy with a budget of $ 2.27 billion in 2008 — about $ 7.50 for every American .
( See my column , F.D.A. on the Brink ? )
Yet the president 's budget provided only a minuscule increase in the budget of the Food and Drug Administration , up $ 50.7 million to a total of $ 2.4 billion .
( This includes user fees paid by drug companies asking the F.D.A. to approve new drugs . )
This anemic increase does not even cover salary increases , and is also supposed to pay for several hundred new inspectors and other personnel .
The situation is so dire that a few days ago Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach — a political appointee who serves at the pleasure of the president — appealed to Congress to raise his agency 's budget $ 275 million above what his boss asked for .
Earlier , von Eschenbach faced a maelstrom of criticism of the administration 's meager budget increase .
He sent the request and detailed plan for spending it to Senator Arlen Specter , the Pennsylvania Republican who had asked von Eschenbach provide him with this information " to protect the public health . "
According to The New York Times , Specter added in a handwritten note in the letter 's margins : " Andy , I know the situation is extreme .
I want to get you financial help now . "
The Senate responded with a rather paltry increase of about $ 72 million for the F.D.A .
Again , that 's better than nothing , though the January report and others have called for much steeper increases , along with major reforms in how the agency is organized and how it works .
In a demonstration of how tough it is to get science funded in the Bush II era , Senate leaders tucked both budget increases into a $ 156 billion war and veterans ' appropriations bill .
That measure passed the Senate by a wide enough margin to override a threatened veto from the president .
The House did n't include the raise in its version of the bill , but is expected to agree to the increase in conference .
Like so many other things , the task of recovering from Bush 's distressing disinterest in science will be left to the next president .
Merely spending money , however , will not restore the waning prestige and power of American science , as articulated by Baltimore and Varmus .
Nor will it insure that the life sciences in America will continue to produce breakthroughs and treatments that have benefited millions of people .
What is needed is leadership from the White House and Congress in ensuring that our federal medical research and oversight establishment is the best it can be , and that it 's funding is adequate to as much benefit to people in the future as it has to generations past .
プッシュ型のフレンド・タイムラインにおいては、各ユーザが、自分が読むべきメッセージの一覧を保持します。SQL のスキーマは以下のようになります。
-- フォロワー関係を保持するテーブル CREATE TABLE `follower` ( `user_id` int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL , -- follow する user id `follower_id` int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL , -- follow される user id PRIMARY KEY ( `user_id` , `follower_id` ) , KEY `follower_id` ( `follower_id` ) ) ; -- メッセージを保持するテーブル CREATE TABLE `message` ( `id` int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , -- メッセージID `user_id` int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL , -- メッセージの送信者 `body` varchar ( 255 ) NOT NULL , -- メッセージ本体 PRIMARY KEY ( `id` ) , KEY `user_id_id` ( `user_id` , `id` ) ) ; -- ユーザ毎の読むべきメッセージ一覧を保持するテーブル
CREATE TABLE `mailbox` ( `user_id` int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL , -- 受信者の user id `message_id` int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL , -- メッセージの id PRIMARY KEY ( `user_id` , `message_id` ) ) ;
メッセージの登録処理は以下のようになります。
INSERT INTO message ( user_id , body ) VALUES ( $user_id , $body ) ; INSERT INTO mailbox ( user_id , message_id ) SELECT user_id, last_insert_id( )
FROM follower WHERE follower_id=$user_id ;
フレンド・タイムラインの取得処理は以下のようになります。
SELECT message.id,message.user_id,message.body FROM message INNER JOIN mailbox ON message.id=mailbox.message_id WHERE mailbox.user_id=$user_id ORDER BY mailbox.message_id DESC LIMIT 20 ;
フレンド・タイムラインの２ページ目以降の取得処理については、LIMIT
20,20 のように書く方法と、前ページにおける最小のメッセージ
ID を覚えておいて 、WHERE mailbox.message_id<???
のように指定する方法の２種類があります。前者の方が単純ですが、後者の方が軽く
( 前者が O ( n ) なのに対して後者は O( log n ) )、また、ページ遷移の間に新しいメッセージが書き込まれた場合でも、表示内容に重複や欠落が発生しないという点で優れています。
プッシュ型を採用するメリットは、フレンド・タイムラインの取得処理が軽い点です。一方で、メッセージの登録処理は重たくなります。また、データベースがプル型と比較して非常に大きくなります。一人のユーザーが平均
100 人をフォローしていると仮定すると、１メッセージの登録処理毎に
100 回以上の書込処理が発生することになります。具体的なチューニングとベンチマークについては、追って提示します。
2. プル型
プル型のフレンド・タイムラインにおいては、ユーザー毎の受信メッセージリスト ( mailbox テーブル ) は用意しません。リクエストがあった段階で動的に一覧を生成する形になります。
Mailbox テーブルがないため、メッセージの登録処理は単純になります。
INSERT INTO message ( user_id , body ) VALUES ( $user_id , $body ) ;
一方、フレンド・タイムラインの取得処理においては、工夫が必要です。具体的には、以下のようなアルゴリズムを使うのが良いのではないかと思います。
フォローしている各ユーザーについて、そのメッセージ
ID の最大値を取得 1 のリストをメッセージ ID の降順でソートし、その先頭 20 件 ( １ページ分 ) 以外を破 棄 2 のリストの各ユーザーについて、それぞれ最新 20 件のメッセージを取得し、マージ 3 のリストの先頭 20 件が、クライアントに返すべきフレンド・タイムライン
まず、このアルゴリズムにおける手順 1 の負荷ですが、インデックスをフォローしているユーザーの数だけ引くことになります。この処理を軽いと考えるか重いと考えるかは微妙
( ベンチマークは後述 ) ですが、システム全体としての負荷は、１ユーザーあたりの平均フォロー数に比例することになります。また、手順 3 , 4 については、最大 n^2 の行にアクセスすれば良いということになります
( さらに最適化を行うのであれば、最後まで繰り返さなくても、手順 2 で得られたメッセージ ID の最大値が、取得できたタイムラインの 20 件目のメッセージ ID の値を下回った時点でループを打ち切ることもできるでしょう ) 。つまり、n 件 ( ここでは 20 ) のメッセージを取得するためにアクセスする行数は、データの偏りや規模に関係なく ( フォロワー数 + n2 ) 以下ということになります。
残念なことに 、SQL ではこの種のクエリを１ステートメントで実装することは不可能です ( できるのなら誰か教えてください ) 。
かといって、多数のクエリを発行すればプロセス間通信のコストが増大してしまいます。MySQL
においては、今のところ、ストアドプロシージャとして実装するのが、最も効率が高そうです。
CREATE PROCEDURE fetch_timeline_ids
( IN uid int unsigned ) BEGIN DECLARE fid , maxid int unsigned ; DECLARE done int DEFAULT 0 ; DECLARE fid_maxid_cur CURSOR FOR SELECT follower_id , ( SELECT id FROM message WHERE user_id=follower.follower_id ORDER BY user_id DESC , id DESC LIMIT 1 ) AS max_id FROM follower WHERE user_id=uid ORDER BY max_id DESC LIMIT 20 ;注1 DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done=1 ; CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS fetch_timeline_tt ( id int unsigned NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY ) ENGINE =heap DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 ; DELETE FROM fetch_timeline_tt ; OPEN fid_maxid_cur ; REPEAT FETCH fid_maxid_cur INTO fid , maxid ; IF NOT done THEN INSERT INTO fetch_timeline_tt SELECT id FROM message WHERE user_id=fid ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 20 ; END IF ; UNTIL done END REPEAT ; CLOSE fid_maxid_cur ; END ;
このストアドプロシージャを使って、フレンド・タイムラインの取得コードは以下のように書くことができます。
CALL fetch_timeline_ids( $uid ) ; SELECT message.id, user_id, body FROM message INNER JOIN fetch_timeline_tt USING ( id ) ORDER BY message .id DESC LIMIT 20 ;
このコードが実際どの程度の速度で動作するのかは、後述します。ただ、プル型における最新のフレンド・タイムライン取得処理は memcached を使って最適化すればよいことなので、あまり問題にならないかもしれません。むしろ、２ページ目以降の取得処理の負荷をどう考えるか、というのが実際的な課題になるでしょう。
2.1. プル型におけるページ処理
プッシュ型と異なり、プル型においては LIMIT
句を利用したページ処理はできません。ページ処理は、必ず、前ページの最小メッセージ
ID を基準に、より小さいメッセージ ID を探していく、という形式になります。本来であれば、前述のプロシージャ fetch_timeline_ids の SELECT 文に条件を追加すれば済む話なのですが、MySQL のオプティマイザは上手に最適化してくれません。そこで、さらにクエリをストアドプロシージャに展開する必要が出てきます。
CREATE PROCEDURE build_max_ids_of_followers
( IN uid int unsigned , IN max_id int unsigned ) BEGIN DECLARE fid int unsigned ; DECLARE done int DEFAULT 0 ; DECLARE fcur CURSOR FOR SELECT follower_id FROM follower WHERE user_id=uid ; DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done=1 ; CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS max_ids_of_followers ( user_id int unsigned NOT NULL , max_id int unsigned NOT NULL ) ENGINE =heap DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 ; DELETE FROM max_ids_of_followers ; OPEN fcur ; REPEAT FETCH fcur INTO fid ; IF NOT done THEN INSERT INTO max_ids_of_followers SELECT fid , max ( id ) AS m FROM message WHERE user_id=fid AND id < =max_id HAVING NOT ISNULL(m ) ; END IF ; UNTIL done END REPEAT ; CLOSE fcur ; END ; CREATE PROCEDURE fetch_timeline_ids2
( IN uid int unsigned , IN maxid int unsigned ) BEGIN DECLARE fid , fmaxid int unsigned ; DECLARE done int DEFAULT 0 ; DECLARE fid_maxid_cur CURSOR FOR SELECT user_id , max_id FROM max_ids_of_followers ORDER BY max_id DESC LIMIT 20 ; DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done=1 ; CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS fetch_timeline_tt ( id int unsigned NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY ) ENGINE =heap DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 ; DELETE FROM fetch_timeline_tt ; CALL build_max_ids_of_followers(uid , maxid ) ; OPEN fid_maxid_cur ; REPEAT FETCH fid_maxid_cur INTO fid , fmaxid ; IF NOT done THEN INSERT INTO fetch_timeline_tt SELECT id FROM message WHERE user_id=fid AND id <=fmaxid ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 20 ; END IF ; UNTIL done END REPEAT ; CLOSE fid_maxid_cur ; END ;
これらのストアドプロシージャを使って、ページ処理のコードは以下のように書くことになります。
CALL fetch_timeline_ids2( $uid , $ max_id ) ; SELECT message.id, user_id, body FROM message INNER JOIN fetch_timeline_tt USING ( id ) ORDER BY message .id DESC LIMIT 20 ;
3. ベンチマークとチューニング
では、実際のパフォーマンスはどの程度のものでしょうか。プッシュとプル、両モデルについてベンチマークを取ったところ、以下のような値が得られました。なお、測定条件は以下のとおりです。メッセージの投稿頻度やフォローの関係については、一定の傾きを設けました。
表 1. 測定条件 想定ユーザ数 10,000 総メッセージ 数 1,000,000 平均フォロー 数 42.9 実行環境 CentOS 5.1 ( i386 ; linux - 2.6.18-8.1.15.el5xen )
MySQL 5.1.24-rc ( InnoDB を使用 )
Pentium 4 3.0GHz
2GB RAM
表 2. ベンチマーク プッシュ プル データサイ ズ 2.0 GB 130MB 登録速度 ( メッセージ / 秒 ) 560 6,700 取得速度 ( タイムライ ン / 秒 )
1,300 120
まず、データサイズの差が目を引きます。プッシュ型のデータサイズがプル型よりも 10 倍以上大きいのは、mailbox テーブルが肥大化するためです。プッシュ型を採用する場合は、HDD
の容量に気をつける必要がありそうです。対策としては、InnoDB
Plugin のデータベース圧縮機能を使う、あるいは、mailbox テーブルの複数行を単一の blob にまとめる、といった手が挙げられるでしょう。
次に、登録速度ですが、プッシュ型が意外と検討しています。これは、ベンチマークにおいて、ジャーナリング機能をもつ
InnoDB を使ったためだと考えられます。ジャーナル ( innodb_log_file_size ) が十分大きくとることで、異なる領域への書き込みがマージされるので、プッシュ型を
HDD ベースでの運用することも可能と思われます。
最後に、取得速度ですが、やはりプル型は苦戦しています。ストアドプロシージャとはいえ、多数の
SQL を発行するのはパフォーマンス低下を招くためだと考えられます。プル型を使用して大規模なサービスを運用したい場合は、

Bristol aims to help more people choose pedal power Bristol has become England 's first " cycling city " in a £ 100 m government scheme aimed at encouraging cycling .
The city intends to double the number of cyclists over the next three years with a series of innovations .
Sharing the funding will be York , Stoke , Blackpool , Cambridge , Chester , Colchester , Leighton Buzzard , Southend , Shrewsbury , Southport and Woking .
Among the features in Bristol will be the UK 's first major bicycle rental network , modelled on a scheme in Paris .
The government is giving Bristol £ 11.4 m to transform cycling by creating dedicated cycle lanes , better facilities and more training for children .

The local area will match this funding to bring the total investment package to about £ 23 m .
Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly said : " I am delighted to appoint Bristol as the UK 's first ever cycling city .
I am sure that Bristol 's bold and ambitious plans will support cyclists and encourage more people to get on their bikes , get fit and beat the traffic .
" Bristol is leading the way .
I hope that many more will follow its excellent example . "
As well as Bristol , 11 other towns and cities in England have been designated " cycling demonstration " areas , and will get funding to improve infrastructure , bike parking and cycle training .
Six other English towns and cities have held demonstration area status since 2005 ; the Department for Transport says they have seen a significant increase in cycling .
The Public Health Minister and Bristol South MP Dawn Primarolo said the scheme would help tackle growing levels of obesity in the UK .
" For most people , a great way to keep healthy is by building physical activity into everyday life , such as cycling to work or school , " she said .
BRISTOL'S CYCLING PLANS
Create the UK 's first on - street bike rental network Establish a ' re - cycling ' scheme that repairs bikes and provides them free of charge to deprived communities Build state - of - the - art facilities for cyclists commuting to the city centre Create a dedicated cycleway to link the suburbs with the city centre More than double the number of children receiving cycling training Develop a Personalised Travel Plan programme , focusing on changing the way people conduct short journeys to work " The first step in persuading people to leave their cars at home is to offer them a real choice . "
Phillip Darnton , chair of Cycling England , agreed , but said it was important that proper training was given .
" Nobody is suggesting you dump somebody , particularly a young person , on a bike , " he said .
" We do n't drop them in the deep end of swimming pools , you 've got to learn properly , there 's a national standard called bike ability and that 's what we 're urging people to do and we have some funding to help . "
Councillor Helen Holland , leader of Bristol City Council , said : " Our aim is to make the bicycle a real alternative for many more people travelling to and around Bristol .
" This award , and the funding that it brings , will enable us to progress with a raft of off and on - road improvements which will encourage more people to chose pedal power to make a real difference to their own and our city 's health and environment . "
Among the city 's innovative proposals are the creation of the UK 's first on - street bike rental network and setting up a scheme to repair bikes and provide them free of charge to people in deprived communities .

York City Police Commissioner to resign
The details around Robinson 's departure remains unknown , but it appears to be sudden .
D&AD , a British charity group that seeks to promote good design , awarded Apple three top awards at a ceremony held last night .
The company earned two prestigious Black Pencils for the iMac and iPhone , as well as a Yellow Pencil for iPod touch in the Product Design category .
The Apple Wireless Keyboard and iPod nano were also nominated for product design .
D&AD has offered awards for outstanding design in a yearly design competition throughout its 45 - year history .
It awards Yellow Pencils based on judging by juries of design professionals in a variety of creative fields , including advertising , architecture , graphic design , film , and photography .
Occasionally , Black Pencils are awarded for truly exceptional works , and some years , the organization does n't award any at all if no work is deemed worthy enough .
Apple took two of these awards home last night , giving the company a total of six Black Pencils earned since 1999 .
" This makes the multi-national design company the biggest single winner of Black Pencils in D&AD ’s 45 - year history , " D&AD said in a statement .
Design has always been at the heart of Apple .
Steve Jobs once famously said :
In most people 's vocabularies , design means veneer .
It 's interior decorating .
It 's the fabric of the curtains or the sofa .
But to me , nothing could be further from the meaning of design .
Design is the fundamental soul of a human - made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service .
While many have often scoffed at paying an " Apple Tax " for cool design , Mac users know that the care and attention to detail are more than skin deep .
This recognition of Apple 's hard work should further support the fact that design matters , even in a computer .
Mofaz , a former army chief , may be lining up a challenge to Olmert
A top Israeli official has said that if Iran continues with its alleged nuclear arms programme , Israel will attack it .
Speaking to Yediot Ahronot newspaper , Deputy Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz said sanctions on Iran were ineffective .
Mr Mofaz is one of three deputy prime ministers and the transport minister .
Earlier this week , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Iran 's nuclear programme must be stopped by what he termed all possible means .
Attacking Iran , in order to stop its nuclear plans , will be unavoidable
Shaul Mofaz
Analysis : Growing talk of attack
" The international community has a duty and responsibility to clarify to Iran , through drastic measures , that the repercussions of their continued pursuit of nuclear weapons will be devastating , " Mr Olmert said .
Iran insists that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes but it is defying a demand from the UN Security Council to stop the enrichment of uranium .
' Attack unavoidable '
" If Iran continues with its programme for developing nuclear weapons , we will attack it .
The sanctions are ineffective , " Mr Mofaz told Yediot Ahronot .
" Attacking Iran , in order to stop its nuclear plans , will be unavoidable , " he said .
The former chief of the army and defence minister is one of several senior figures in the governing Kadima party who may challenge the leadership of Mr Olmert , who faces allegations of corruption .
The UN Security Council has approved three rounds of sanctions against Iran .
These include asset restrictions and travel bans on Iranian individuals and companies said to be involved in nuclear work .
The sanctions also ban the sale to Iran of so - called dual - use items - items which can have either a military or civilian purpose .

Women who decided to have a caesarean have a slightly lower mortality rate according to a new study
A major breakthrough by British scientists could bring new hope for women facing the heartbreak of infertility .
For the first time a team has managed to grow hundreds of eggs in the laboratory using a new technique which could help cancer patients whose treatment can leave them infertile .
It would also allow thousands more women to wait until middle age to have children .
The scientists from Edinburgh University have shown that immature eggs can be frozen , grown and matured in the lab .
The process could lead to women having pieces of ovary containing the immature eggs removed and stored .
Much later on , they could be thawed , fertilised and finally implanted into the womb .
The breakthrough , which comes as MPs prepare to debate the controversial Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill , raises again the ethical debate surrounding the freezing of eggs .
Some say it is morally wrong for a woman to do so and have them fertilised years later in order to delay having children while she pursues a career .
However , scientists hope the new process will revolutionise fertility preservation for women because it will allow them to store many more eggs than they can under traditional IVF techniques .
And , because immature eggs survive the freezing process much better than the mature ones used in IVF , it is much more likely that older women will be able to conceive using them .
It brings forward the prospect that thousands of women will use the technique to side - step the menopause , delaying motherhood for the sake of their careers .
The process , which could be available in five years , also provides hope for cancer sufferers who at the moment are often left infertile following chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
Powerful anti-cancer drugs can destroy follicles in the ovaries , wiping out any possibility of women having children .
At the moment , these women have a piece of ovary removed , frozen and then re-transplanted after their cancer treatment .
But there is always the danger that the cancer could be reintroduced by the implant .
The new technique means women 's immature eggs contained in the patch of ovary could be grown in the lab and then screened for cancer before being used in IVF treatment .
There are also hopes it will provide a rich source of eggs for scientists to study for clues on ways to treat a range of diseases .
There is a shortage of human eggs for medical research , and if the technique works it would bypass the controversy over the use of animal - human ' hybrid ' embryos .
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill , which MPs are due to debate next month , would allow scientists to use these embryos in medical research , but many MPs plan to vote against .
The research , carried out by an Edinburgh University team led by Dr Evelyn Telfer , is published today in the journal Human Reproduction .
" This is a significant step in developing immature eggs to maturity outside the body , " said Dr Telfer .
" Women who face infertility as a result of chemotherapy , or who want to put their biological clock on hold , could benefit from this system .
" However , there is a lot more research to be carried out before this technique could be safely applied within a clinical setting . "
Last year , Canadian scientists announced the first birth of a child created from a human egg matured in the laboratory .
However , they did not use the same " primordial follicles " studied by the researchers from Edinburgh .
These are the tiny egg - bearing pockets within the ovaries that are present in their millions at birth , but gradually die off over the course of a woman 's life .
They represent a woman 's fertility " battery " which once depleted cannot be recharged .
Many remain dormant , but some go on to mature and eventually release their eggs in preparation for fertilisation .
For the first time , the team led by Dr Telfer has succeeded in growing primordial follicles to a late stage of maturation in the lab .
They took pieces of ovary containing the follicles from six volunteer women who were giving birth by caesarean section .
These were then exposed to a chemical that promotes growth , similar to the one that functions in the ovaries .
Around a third of them survived and went on to reach the advanced ' antral ' stage of development .
At this stage , the follicles are filled with fluid and contain eggs almost ready to be fertilised .
It means that it could soon be possible to grow hundreds of eggs in the laboratory .
The Canadian team which managed to create a child from immature eggs was working with only around a dozen .
Another advantage is that the follicles mature much more quickly in the lab than they do in the ovary .
The scientists do not yet know whether eggs - or oocytes , to give them their technical name - matured in this way are completely normal and suitable for in - vitro fertilisation .
But animal studies suggest they are .
The next step is to use hormones and other substances to try to nudge the ' antral ' eggs on to the next stage of maturation , and then test the technique on humans .
" We believe there 's good evidence that we can get normal oocytes , but of course you would never apply this technique clinically until you are sure , " said Dr Telfer .
" We 're seeking funding for further research to bridge that gap .
It might take five to ten years from now before we get to the stage of a clinical trial . "
Dr Jane Stewart , consultant in reproductive medicine at the Newcastle Fertility Centre , said :
" This work increases our understanding of the maturation of human eggs in the lab and takes us a step nearer the goal of strong immature eggs for fertility preservation for women . "
NORTH BERWICK , Maine — A Noble High School teaching intern says she was barred from the school Tuesday after hosting an in - class poetry slam contest where profanity was used .
Wren Hayes , 26 , who had been teaching at the school for nearly a year as part of an internship for her master 's degree at the University of New Hampshire , said her university adviser told her to stay away from school grounds and avoid contact with students or teachers after a parent complained to the school about the language used in the Feb. 29 slam contest .
Hayes , who said she warned students and school administrators , including the principal , that slam poems can contain " strong language , " indicated there were two instances of profanity used during the contest .
The first was by a 12th - grade female student , who used the line " Why the ( expletive ) did you do that ? " in a poem she wrote about a person she knew who committed suicide .
The second was by one of nine slam poets who were invited to the event , who used one curse word " more so than I would 've appreciated , " Hayes said .
Superintendent Paul Andrade would n't confirm or deny if Hayes was barred from the school due to the poetry slam , though he did say of the situation : " We 're working on it . "
" We 're still in the process of meeting with ( Hayes ' ) student adviser , " said Andrade , who gave few specifics about the issue because it was a " personnel matter . "
Andrade instead explained the role of free speech in schools .
" Students have a right to free speech , ( but ) there are limits as to what you can say , " he said .
" You ca n't yell ' fire ' in the middle of an auditorium . "
The school 's 2007 - 08 student / parent handbook has a " Civility Policy Code " that reads : " It is the intent of the school board to promote mutual respect , civility and orderly conduct among district employees , parents and the public .
It is not the intent of the school board to deprive any person of his or her right to freedom of expression .
The intent of this policy is to maintain , to the greatest extent reasonably possible , a safe , harassment - free environment . "
The code states that " Disruptive behavior includes , but is not necessarily limited to ...
Using loud and / or offensive language , swearing , cursing or display of temper . "
There are no specific punishments listed for violating the code .
Hayes said she and her UNH adviser will meet with school officials on Tuesday .
She said she has not had any contact with school officials since the day of the slam .
Principal Joseph Findlay declined to comment when reached by telephone Wednesday afternoon .
" They 've made very strong judgments about me without speaking to me , " Hayes said , adding she was told by school officials not to talk to the press .
When reached on her cell phone Wednesday , Hayes said the poetry slam contest was " phenomenal . "
When the expletives were used during the performance , " Students never blinked ... they never thought twice about it , " Hayes said , adding she prepped students to be aware of expletives that are often used in slam poems .
Hayes noted that books such as " Catcher in the Rye " and " The Grapes of Wrath , " which are part of the school 's curriculum , contain swear words .
Hayes said there had been no previous problems during her nearly yearlong internship at the school .
" This was n't the final straw .
This was the only straw , " she said .
Hayes was working 40 - hour weeks at the school for credit toward her master 's degree in Secondary English .
The poetry slam contest was the culmination of an eight - week poetry class she had been teaching .
Andrade said Noble High and UNH have participated in a student - internship teaching program for about a decade , and that there have not been any problems in the past .
" It 's been a very beneficial relationship , " he said .
Kim Billings , a university spokesperson , wrote in an e-mail message : " The university is aware of the situation and we are working with officials at the high school . "
Hayes had been scheduled to graduate from UNH on May 15 .
She does n't know if she will be able to graduate on time because she needs to complete her internship to finish the master 's program .
The record - shattering run-up in energy and food prices has put investors who buy and sell such things on the hot seat -- so hot that some in Congress on Tuesday threatened action .
“ The American people are about to take out pitchforks ” because of the cost of groceries and gasoline , Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D - Mo. ) said during a Senate hearing on whether commodities are being pushed higher by investors ’ high - stakes bets that prices will keep going up .
Given the uproar from consumers , McCaskill warned an official from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission , “ if you do n’t do something , Congress will . ”
Such strong words came on another record day for oil prices -- which flirted with $ 130 a barrel -- and as drivers in many states prepared to pay more than $ 4 a gallon for gasoline on Memorial Day trips .
Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn. ) , who chaired Tuesday ’s hearing before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , said that commodities trading by pension funds and other institutional investors has risen sharply .
He noted that investment in index funds tied to commodities has grown twentyfold to $ 260 billion in the last five years .

“ This unbridled growth raises justifiable concerns that speculative demand -- divorced from market realities -- is driving food and energy price inflation and causing a lot of human suffering , ” Lieberman said .
Much of the focus has been on the stunning rise in the cost of crude oil , which has rocketed up by more than $ 40 a barrel since early February and closed Tuesday at $ 129.07 , up $ 2.02 , in New York futures trading .
But similarly spectacular jumps have hit the prices of gasoline , diesel , heating oil , corn , wheat and gold .
The link between soaring prices and the vast sums of money flowing through commodity markets is controversial and hard to quantify .
Economists , traders and regulators routinely dismiss the notion that excessive trading is the culprit instead of traditional market forces such as supply and demand .
And they warn that increased regulation could interfere with trading programs used by airlines and others to blunt the negative effects of rising commodity prices .

Jeffrey Harris , chief economist at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , told lawmakers Tuesday that the high prices reflected increased demand from emerging markets and decreased supply because of bad weather or geopolitical events .
Harris and others also pointed to broader economic factors such as the sinking value of the dollar , which has made commodities traded in the United States a relative bargain for foreign investors .
Commodities also have recently offered more certain returns than the stock market .
“ Together , these fundamental economic factors have formed a perfect storm that is causing significant upward pressure on futures prices across the board , ” Harris said .
Such explanations are less than soothing in the face of the unprecedented price hikes , which have alarmed consumers and politicians and yielded unusual alliances .

A nationwide group calling itself the Energy Market Oversight Coalition hopes to persuade Congress to rein in commodity speculation .
Its members include consumer advocate Public Citizen , municipal utilities , convenience store and truck stop operators , a steel makers trade group and retailers that sell heating oil , wheat , barley and gasoline .
“ Frankly , our industry and consumers are under siege right now , ” said Shane Sweet , chief executive of the New England Fuel Institute , a trade group for heating oil distributors that helped organize the coalition .
The coalition runs a website , www.closetheenronloophole.com, that urges Congress to eliminate a provision pushed by energy trader Enron Corp. that in 2000 cleared the way for energy trading outside the purview of regulations governing activity on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Much of the world ’s energy trading still takes place through the Nymex , but a growing share flows through thinly regulated electronic systems that critics call “ dark markets . ”
The farm bill that Congress is sending to President Bush includes a measure that would close that so - called Enron loophole , increasing federal oversight of energy trades .
The effort took five years to get through Congress and is a clear sign that re-regulating some energy markets now has much broader appeal .
Advertisement
Rep. Joe L. Barton of Texas , the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and influential among his fellow GOP lawmakers on energy issues , said in an interview that he supported efforts to rein in energy trading .
“ I do n’t think there ’s any question that speculators in the oil markets have taken prices higher than they would be otherwise , ” Barton said .
“ I think there ought to be new rules . ”
Barton , Lieberman and others have said they would draft legislation that would restrict commodity investments by large investors and close a loophole that allows speculators to avoid investment limits .
A separate provision embedded in the Senate Democrats ’ energy bill would ensure that foreign exchanges using trading terminals within the United States adopt the same limits and reporting requirements as energy commodities traded on U.S. exchanges .
“ You ’ve got futures exchanges that are rife with the ability to manipulate and excessively speculate , ” said Michael Greenberger , a University of Maryland law professor who spent two years in charge of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ’s trading and markets division .
“ Congress firmly believes that they ’ve got to bring this speculation under control .
And it is my thesis that if these markets were policed , the prices would drop very rapidly . ”

Chrysler announced today that in - car Internet hotspots would be available as an option on all new models for around $ 500 .
The service , offered through Autonet Mobile , combines a cellular EVDO modem with a WiFi hotspot to offer constant conductivity within a 100 foot radius of the vehicle — making it " convenient to access the Internet at a soccer field or family picnic , " according to the announcement .
Chrysler calls the new system UConnect Web and says it will be available in August .
The best part seems to be the price , which is $ 29 a month for apparently unlimited data use ( though if you already pay for an EVDO card , you 'll have to cough up again to get the service in the car ) .
Chrysler promises speeds of 400 - 800 Kbps on average when downloading , consistent with our own findings when using EVDO networks .
The downside for families on trips is that EVDO service can get spotty between cities , especially out West , so listening to that streaming audio version of This American Life might become a rage - inducing exercise .

He 's using the Internet !
In a car !
The system offers connectivity to any WiFi device including PSPs , PDAs , smartphones , and more , and encrypts the signal with WEP , which as we all know is highly secure ( the technically - inclined may want to use the optional MAC filtering ) .
How long will it be until we see the first court case involving a tailgating vehicle that has hacked into to the WiFi connection of the minivan up ahead ?
I picture a band of nerds following a Chrysler in their Priuses and Metros , trying to jockey close enough to get a signal , Road Warrior style .
You can see a video of the system in action on Chrysler 's official blog , but be warned : it looks a lot like a dude sitting in the back of a car , typing on an Eee keyboard .
When I was a kid , my apparently insane parents used to stuff three kids and a batch of suitcases into a non-air - conditioned Chevy Celebrity and drive from Chicago to Florida for a bit of time on the beach .
While the constant connectivity of today 's world can sometimes make it hard for families to tear their collective eyes away from laptop screens , iPods , and Nintendo DS handhelds in order to engage in face - to - face communication , the long hours spent in that station wagon have convinced me that a bit of electronic distraction is n't a wholly bad thing .
It 's certainly preferable to lengthy poking fights with your brother and / or sister , and it definitely beats listening to a Weird Al cassette on repeat or playing the " alphabet game " for the 28th time .
In the future , road trip dialogues might look more like this :
Kid : " Are we almost there yet ? "
Dad : " No . "
Kid : " Great . "
And then Little Timmy 's back to Twittering about the New Mexico landscape out his window and uploading photos of it to his Facebook page .
Mom , meanwhile , is hunched over in the passenger seat , unable to stop obsessively editing the Perkins report for work , while Timmy 's older brother is in the back seat , a jacket over his head , looking at women in bikinis .
Family road trips may never be the same .

Part Seven : The Place of Economics in Society > Chapter XXXVIII .
The Place of Economics in ...
When the businessmen finally learned that the boom created by credit expansion cannot last and must necessarily lead to a slump , they realized that it was important for them to know in time the date of the break .
They turned to economists for advice .
The economist knows that such a boom must result in a depression .
But he does not and cannot know when the crisis will appear .
This depends on the special conditions of each case .
Many political events can influence the outcome .
There are no rules according to which [ p. 871 ] the duration of the boom or of the following depression can be computed .
And even if such rules were available , they would be of no use to businessmen .
What the individual businessman needs in order to avoid losses is knowledge about the date of the turning point at a time when other businessmen still believe that the crash is farther away than is really the case .
Then his superior knowledge will give him the opportunity to arrange his own operations in such a way as to come out unharmed .
But if the end of the boom could be calculated according to a formula , all businessmen would learn the date at the same time .
Their endeavors to adjust their conduct of affairs to this information would immediately result in the appearance of all the phenomena of the depression .
It would be too late for any of them to avoid being victimized .
If it were possible to calculate the future state of the market , the future would not be uncertain .
There would be neither entrepreneurial loss nor profit .
What people expect from the economists is beyond the power of any mortal man .
The very idea that the future is predictable , that some formulas could be substituted for the specific understanding which is the essence of entrepreneurial activity , and that familiarity with these formulas could make it possible for anybody to take over the conduct of business is , of course , an outgrowth of the whole complex of fallacies and misconceptions which are at the bottom of present - day anticapitalistic policies .
There is in the whole body of what is called the Marxian philosophy not the slightest reference to the fact that the main task of action is to provide for the events of an uncertain future .
The fact that the term speculator is today used only with an opprobrious connotation clearly shows that our contemporaries do not even suspect in what the fundamental problem of action consists .
Entrepreneurial judgment cannot be bought on the market .
The entrepreneurial idea that carries on and brings profit is precisely that idea which did not occur to the majority .
It is not correct foresight as such that yields profits , but foresight better than that of the rest .
The prize goes only to the dissenters , who do not let themselves by misled by the errors accepted by the multitude .
What makes profits emerge is the provision for future needs for which others have neglected to make adequate provision .
Entrepreneurs and capitalists expose their own material well - being if they are fully convinced of the soundness of their plans .
They would never venture to take their economic life into their hands because an expert advised them to do so .
Those ignorant people who [ p. 872 ] operate on the stock and commodity exchanges according to tips are destined to lose their money , from whatever source they may have got their inspiration and " inside " information .
In fact reasonable businessmen are fully aware of the uncertainty of the future .
They realize that the economists do not dispense any reliable information about things to come and that all that they provide is interpretation of statistical data referring to the past .
For the capitalists and entrepreneurs the economists ' opinions about the future count only as questionable conjectures .
They are skeptical and not easily fooled .
But as they quite correctly believe that it is useful to know all the data which could possibly have any relevance for their affairs , they subscribe to the newspapers and periodicals publishing the forecasts .
Anxious not to neglect any source of information available , big business employs staffs of economists and statisticians .
Business forecasting fails in the vain attempts to make the uncertainty of the future disappear and to deprive entrepreneurship of its inherent speculative character .
But it renders some services in assembling and interpreting the available data about economic trends and developments of the recent past .

For all those who were gagging to see a giant illuminated phallus , I apologise ; it was a very mean trick .
Graphic image aside , the Oral Sex Light will set you back $ 13.99 , and mounts ( ha ) via a clip - on ear piece .
The torch attached is completely flexible , meaning you can totally scope out those hard to find regions .
Unfortunately , if you ever did try to wow a date with your I - come - prepared attitude , she 'll likely be out of the door quicker than she could say , " What the hell was I doing there in the first place ? "

Is he able , but not willing ?
Then he is malevolent .
Is he both able and willing ?
Then whence cometh evil ?
Is he neither able nor willing ?

My conclusion is that there is no reason to believe any of the dogmas of traditional theology and , further , that there is no reason to wish that they were true .

But it must be a positive attack , for science and reason have so much to give .

I suggest that we might want to depose this incumbent God and start dealing with The Real World .
He 's proven — time and again — to be cruel , capricious , and vindictive .
He drowns , crushes , burns , and starves millions of us every day .
He created cancer , viruses , and germs to invade and destroy our bodies as He sees fit , and uses them very effectively .
In His wisdom ,
He directed those in charge to impede stem cell research so that such a powerful approach would not be available to us and He would n't have to strain the Divine Intellect to disarm that defense .
We amuse Him as we flail about vainly trying to appease Him .
I vote that we dump Him . - James Randi

Cicero 106 – 43 BCE
The Apache Lucene project , a high - performance full - featured text search engine library written entirely in Java , released version 2.3 today .
InfoQ spoke with committer and Project Management Committee ( PMC ) member Grant Ingersoll to learn more about this release and the future plans for Lucene .
Ingersoll indicated that the largest change in this release is a new indexing algorithm , which uses new in - memory models to achieve large speed improvements .
According to Ingersoll , simply switching the existing Lucene 2.2 JAR for a Lucene 2.3 JAR resulted in speed - ups of 500 % in indexing performance in several tests which were performed .
Other changes include :
Improved index management - long pauses which were occasionally seen during indexing due to merging of internal index files have been eliminated , and other approaches to managing the indexing process are now easy to implement
- long pauses which were occasionally seen during indexing due to merging of internal index files have been eliminated , and other approaches to managing the indexing process are now easy to implement Object pooling - Document , Field and Token instances can now be reused during indexing analysis , which both speeds up analysis and reduces the number of allocations during indexing
- , and instances can now be reused during indexing analysis , which both speeds up analysis and reduces the number of allocations during indexing IndexReader reopening - Reopening an IndexReader to capture the latest changes in an index is now much faster with the new reopen ( ) method , which loads in only those index segments which have changed rather than reloading the entire index

The setMaxBufferedDocs method has been supplanted by the more intuitive setRAMBufferSizeMB method
In addition , 2.3 is intended to be a drop - in replacement for 2.2 , with no recompilation required .
A comprehensive changelog is also available .
Ingersoll also discussed the future plans for Lucene , saying that the next release would be 2.9 .
The 2.9 release will be a relatively minor , with items being marked as deprecated and other clean - up being performed in preparation for Lucene 3.0 .
The 3.0 version will be a major release which will involve moving the codebase to JDK 5 as the minimum supported codebase - the other major features of 3.0 are yet to be determined .
The Lucene community as a whole was also discussed , with Ingersoll indicating that Lucene and Solr have a strong integration , and that Nutch , Tika and Hadoop also enjoyed a fair amount of intercommunication .
Ingersoll also described a new project named Mahout which he is in the process of launching :
That will be a separate project , but may be beneficial to Lucene users .
There are currently some patches in JIRA for Lucene that implement ML algorithms .
The goal of this project is to provide commercial quality , large scale machine learning ( ML ) algorithms built on Hadoop under an Apache license .
I have seen a fair amount of interest already , and hope to have this project underway in the coming month .
Ingersoll said that , by creating Mahout , he hoped to " further unlock the mysteries of Google and companies like it to provide these capabilities to the masses and spur on new innovation in the space " -- for those with an interest in this new project , there are both a project plan and an incubator proposal available .
Religious believers often have questions when encountering an atheist .
I realize this can be annoying at times , but I 'd encourage you to view religious believers with questions as a good thing .
While some are little more than tactics pushed by their pastors aimed at converting us , others do seem to be sincere attempts to understand how someone could possibly not believe in their preferred god .
This is an opportunity we probably should n't squander .
Many of the questions I 'm used to hearing from Christians reflect a lack of scientific knowledge ( e.g. , " Then how did we get here ? " or " Then why are there still monkeys ? " ) , a lack of moral development ( e.g. , " If there is no god , why should we be good ? " ) , or just a lack of imagination ( e.g. , " Then what do you worship ? " ) .
Setting those aside , there is at least one question I think atheists should be eager to receive and willing to provide meaningful answers :
Then what do you believe ?
A Christian who recognizes that atheism refers only to the lack of theistic belief and not to some broad agenda , philosophy , or alternative religion , sometimes asks an excellent question : " I understand that you do not accept the existence of any gods , but I 'm curious about what you do believe . "
I hate to see atheists angrily dismiss this question as irrelevant , provoking , or as a desperate attempt to set up some sort of apologetics trap that will soon be sprung on the unsuspecting atheist because it is not necessarily any of these things .
It might even represent a genuine attempt to understand atheism or the worldview of the particular atheist being questioned .
As we consider this question , one critical disclaimer must be offered at the outset .
Because atheism has no doctrine , set of core values , or even shared vision of the world , no honest atheist is likely to have much to say about what other atheists believe , at least not on the basis of their atheism .
Since atheism implies nothing besides a lack of theistic belief , one must expect tremendous diversity in the beliefs of atheists .
For example , I have met atheists who believe in ghosts .
All atheists necessarily share is that we do not believe in gods .
This may be difficult for some Christians to grasp because they have at least some shared doctrine ( i.e. , some things one probably has to believe in order to reasonably call oneself a Christian ) ; however , most Christians are aware that many evangelical fundamentalist Christians have a rather narrow perspective on this .
Thus , there is plenty of disagreement , even among Christians .
To understand the importance of the question we are considering , imagine that you encounter someone who informs you that he does not believe in fairies .
Regardless of what you think about fairies , this person has told you very little about what he or she does believe .
Such is the case with atheists .
Those of us who think it is important to provide religious believers with an alternative worldview are going to need to offer something beyond atheism .
To do my part , I am going to use this post as a springboard to mention some of what I believe that has little , if anything , to do with atheism .
That way , anyone wanting to know what besides atheism composes my worldview will find it here .
I expect it will change over time because what I believe tends to change over time .
With that in mind , here are a few things I might note if I were to try to explain what I believe to a religious believer :
Nato peacekeepers have taken up positions around Mitrovica A senior UN official in Kosovo has strongly criticised Serbia for failing to prevent the trouble which led to the death of a Ukrainian policeman .
Ihor Kinal , 25 , was fatally wounded on Monday by shrapnel from a hand grenade .
Deputy head of mission Larry Rossin told reporters that some of the comments from Serbia 's Kosovo minister in Mitrovica were " objectionable " .
He also said : " It is clear to us that the violence ... was orchestrated .
We believe we know who was responsible " .
The trouble broke out when UN police wrested control of a courthouse in the divided town from Kosovo Serbs who had seized it days earlier .
We are very sad .
The Kosovo institutions and government send condolences to the family and to his country
Hashim Thaci
Kosovo Prime Minister
More than 130 people were hurt in the trouble that followed , both protesters and international forces .
Rocks , hand grenades and petrol bombs were hurled at UN officers and Nato troops fired back .
Nato 's K - For force maintains it fired only in the air .
The UN official said he had asked Serbian minister Slobodan Samardzic to use his influence so that the international forces would not have to remove the protesters by force .
But , he said , nothing had happened .
" We 've never had what we would consider a clear and unambiguous denunciation of this kind of violence from the ministers , " he said .
Regular protests
There have been regular protests in Mitrovica since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia last month but Monday 's trouble was the worst so far .
Larry Wilson ( right ) said murder charges would be brought Police commissioner Larry Wilson told a news conference that , because of the gunfire that erupted after the UN moved in , emergency services had been unable to reach the Ukrainian officer and he had bled to death .
Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim
Thaci told reporters in Pristina : " We are very sad .
The Kosovo institutions and government send condolences to the family and to his country . "
Although tensions were high in Mitrovica on Tuesday , Nato peacekeepers were in control of the main flashpoints in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the previous day 's violence .
French soldiers fired a stun grenade when Serbs began throwing stones .
The protesters were described as high - school students .
Bridges over the Ibar river that divides the Serb north from the ethnic Albanian south were closed .
' Lethal means '
The UN says 41 policemen are still being treated for their injuries .
Eleven French officers have been flown home for treatment .
Ukrainians and Poles are also among the wounded .
Doctors say a Serb demonstrator who was shot in the head is in a coma , fighting for his life .
Officials in Belgrade have accused the UN and Nato of using excessive force against demonstrators .
Russia 's UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin also suggested there had been a lack of restraint .
But Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik appealed to Serbia and Kosovo Serb leaders to do more to quell the violence .
" It 's up to Belgrade and the Kosovo Serb leaders to calm the residents of northern Kosovo , " she said .
" Nobody questions the right to peaceful demonstrations , but the use of force against Unmik police and K - For is unjustifiable . "
On Tuesday , Japan became the latest country to recognise Kosovo 's independence , joining the United States and a majority of countries in the European Union .

As quelling foreign populations becomes a staple of warfare , private mercenary forces are increasingly relied upon as a tool of foreign policy , writes Galal Nassar
May 30 , 2008
It is not just government forces , the resistance and sectarian strife that have wrought chaos in Iraq .
The US invasion of Iraq and subsequent policies were what triggered the security breakdown and unleashed the chaos .
To make matters worse , on the heels of the occupying forces followed thousands of personnel from private firms that offer military services for hire .
The corporate mercenary business is a relatively recent phenomenon and this article attempts to probe what function it plays and how it operates in Iraq and elsewhere .
There are now more than 50 private security firms currently operating in Iraq and their number is likely to increase , according to recent reports .
Officially their function is to protect vital facilities ( from government buildings to oil wells ) and important persons ( the US ambassador , for example ) .
Some of these companies have special information gathering and analysis departments whose staff has access to state - of - the - art military and security technologies .
Global Risks is one such company .
Charged with protecting Baghdad International Airport , it has hired for this purpose 500 Nepalese and 500 Fijian soldiers who are apparently the cheapest of the 30 nationalities of mercenaries currently in Iraq .
The existence of these types of firms in Iraq was first brought to public attention by the London Times , which reported in May 2004 that the number of British employees such firms posted to Iraq had doubled to 1,500 since the previous year .
Among these employees were former British police , navy and paratrooper officers and soldiers .
Iraqi officials at the time admitted to having no idea of how many mercenaries were operating in the country .
A year later , former US secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld stated that they were by then in the neighbourhood of 100,000 and that they were needed because coalition forces were unable to supply the number of forces necessary to protect foreign diplomats and businessmen .
He added that about � 1 billion was paid out annually to such private security firms .
It has apparently become Pentagon policy to hire mercenaries in American wars , despite official denials .
According to Peter Singer , a security analyst at the Brookings Institution and author of Corporate Warriors , private companies offering specialised military services for hire played a major support role in most of the wars in which the US was involved in the 1990s , including Somalia , Haiti , Rwanda , the Balkans and East Timor .
But this role has increased exponentially in America 's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
A certain kind of murkiness surrounds these companies .
It is often difficult to pin down exactly what functions their personnel are supposed to perform in their overseas postings .
The titles and job descriptions given to them by their companies only compound the mystery .
There have also been growing concerns over their lack of restraint .
Former British foreign secretary Jack Straw , for example , expressed his dismay over the mounting brutality of mercenaries whose status and activities are not covered by the laws and conventions governing the presence of conventional armed forces .
The practice of importing foreign mercenaries to perform special military tasks is undoubtedly a factor that has aggravated strife and turmoil in Iraq .
Indeed , there is mounting suspicion that mercenaries may be involved in the kidnappings , killings , assaults on international agencies , and other such terrorist activities that taint the images of Iraq and Islam .
One thing is clear : mercenaries earn much , much more than their counterparts in the armed forces .
BANKING ON WAR :
The firms themselves , the majority of which are American or British owned , offer services ranging from guarding important persons and facilities , and supplying equipment and provisions , to intelligence gathering and actual field combat .
The growth of this phenomenon has added a new term to the late 20th century military lexicon .
On top of " remote control warfare " , " proxy wars " and " pre-emptive war " , we now have " privatised war " , or war fought or supported by forces and personnel subcontracted from private military firms and who are not subordinate to the official military hierarchy .
In October 2006 , The Independent reported that the British government had been accused of promoting the privatisation of the war on Iraq as a part of its exit strategy .
The newspaper quoted John Hillary , director of the charity organisation War on Want , as saying " there are genuine worries that the government is trying to privatise the Iraq conflict .
The occupation of Iraq has allowed British mercenaries to reap huge profits .
But the government has failed to enact laws to punish their human rights abuses , including firing on Iraqi civilians . "
What initially prompted the British and American government to turn to private security forces was their ability to recruit sufficient traditional troops to meet the unanticipated force of the Iraqi resistance .
Soon , as the resistance escalated , coalition forces were overstretched and morale deteriorated -- mercenaries were needed to plug the gaps of growing numbers of conscripts gone AWOL or refusing double or sometimes triple tours of duty .
Officials in Washington and London quickly perceived another advantage to mercenaries .
Their dead and wounded are not included in official military casualty figures , which enables officials to project to the public an incomplete picture of the actual losses incurred by the occupation .
Soldiers of fortune could also come in handy for operations that fall outside the pale of international law because recourse to them would spare members of official occupation forces from being brought before international courts on charges of crimes against humanity or violating international humanitarian law governing occupation .
If Washington continues the pursuit of the American global enterprise , one could well envision an increasing reliance on privatised military forces , or PMFs -- a term that certainly has a more respectable ring than " mercenaries " , reflecting a business that has become a legal and increasingly lucrative industry .
PMFs in Iraq are equipped with or have access to the most sophisticated military equipment ( armoured four - wheel vehicles , helicopters , super computers and various satellite surveillance , positioning and guidance services ) .
They offer very attractive incentives , more than enough to tempt individuals into quitting their jobs at home as truck drivers , prison wardens or private security guards and seeking employment in a PMF that will send them to the world 's most violent hotspots .
Pay ranges from $ 500 to $ 1,500 a day , whereas an ordinary career army soldier earns around $ 3,000 a month and an Iraqi policeman earns less than $ 400 per month .
Such figures cast new light on ways Iraq is being drained of its national resources .
Consider , too , that private security firms represent $ 100 billion worth of contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan and that one of these companies -- a British one -- increased its revolving capital from � 554,000 in 2003 , before the war on Iraq , to � 62 million in 2005 .
Not all personnel are British or American ; they could just as well be from South Africa , Nepal , Chile , Columbia , San Salvador , Honduras , Ireland , Spain , Poland , Brazil , Israel and , more recently , Russia and Lebanon .
Private security personnel undertake a broader range of tasks than ever in military history and the history of the mercenary profession .
They guard Iraqi reconstruction projects , VIPs such as former civil administrator Paul Bremer and the US ambassadors to Iraq that followed him , supply convoys that pass through areas controlled by resistance forces , key buildings in Baghdad and sensitive government agencies , and the headquarters of the occupation in the so - called Green Zone .
A former Russian paratrooper recently told a Russian newspaper that a PMF had approached him with an offer of employment as a guard for humanitarian aid convoys , visiting foreign delegations and American petroleum facilities .
The officer maintained that such offers did not detail all the job requirements that security personnel would be required to undertake , such as combing residential quarters for resistance fighters , reconnaissance missions and conducting searches at roadblocks .
He said that private security firms preferred to hire Russians because of the combat expertise they acquired in Afghanistan and Chechnya .
Not a few Arabs have signed up with mercenary outfits , which have been linked to some of the most atrocious crimes against Iraqi civilians , and for less money than their fellow mercenaries from other countries .
The Lebanese Al - Nahar newspaper writes , " Many Lebanese have joined the ranks of the mercenaries in Iraq at salaries ranging from $ 1,000 to $ 4,000 a month , which is relatively low compared to the salaries received by their French , American and even Croatian counterparts .
Experienced experts from these nationalities make anywhere from $ 1,000 to $ 10,000 a day . "
FARMING OUT KILLING : Contrary to the impression Washington has tried to convey to the world , reports on massacres perpetrated against Iraqi civilians reveal that the US army has farmed out more than just security functions to PMF personnel .
As though the American invasion and occupation of Iraq outside the framework of international law was not already a crime by all international legal and humanitarian standards , the importation of thousands of mercenaries can only be regarded as a flagrant violation of human rights and a crime against Iraqi civilians .
Baghdad has become the international capital of PMFs and hired killers .
Of the thousands of PMFs in the world , more than 50 now exist in Iraq .
Although most of these are British or American owned , some are Israeli and South African .
It appears , too , that mercenaries have begun to fill the ranks of the US army itself .
So desperate has the US military become that it has recruited more than 35,000 soldiers who are not US citizens .
Instead , these recruits possess or have been awarded the much - coveted " Green Card " and the promise of naturalisation if they should be fortunate enough to live out their tour of duty in Iraq .
Most of these recruits are originally from Spanish speaking countries , but many were in for disappointment .
As the Philadelphia Inquirer wrote , " US nationality does not come automatically after military service .
Of the 13,500 non-American soldiers who applied for naturalisation in 2002 , only 8,000 were granted citizenship . "
Some in Iraq believe that mercenaries are much more widespread in various official and unofficial capacities than authorities are willing to recognise .
They also suspect that official guard duties are only a cover for more questionable assignments , especially in view of the fact that many mercenaries have criminal records or are even wanted by Interpol .
They further hold that such mercenaries form the backbone of organised crime gangs which are used by occupation forces , foreign intelligence agencies or political forces inside Iraq for carrying out vendettas , assassinations and other acts of violence intended to achieve certain political or economic ends .
With the US - British occupation of Baghdad , all existing controls over border crossings collapsed , allowing the infiltration of various elements from neighbouring countries , notably Iran and Kuwait .
Among the most important groups to walk into Iraq at the time were some 1,000 Iraqi officers and soldiers who had been trained in the US or Hungary and who had been captured during the 1991 Gulf War , along with some Iraqi criminal types who had been arrested in Gulf countries and released several months before the 2003 invasion .
At the same time , from the Iranian side arrived several thousands of Shia Islamist militants who had been trained in Iran and who came to form the backbone of the Badr militia .
Many of these included Iraqis who had been captured in the Iraq - Iran war and later released .
Not only do many of these continue to regularly receive their monthly salaries from Iran , several of them are members of the current Iraqi parliament , as was revealed by the Iranian Mujahedin - e - Khalq organisation in 2007 .
MERCENARIES IN HISTORY :
The mercenary business will remain if , in the wake of major wars when armies are demobilised , discharged soldiers continue to find a lucrative market for their combat skills .
Many military analysts believed that the end of the Cold War would bring an end to the phenomenon of soldiers for hire .
What happened was the reverse .
Mercenaries have proliferated , under new guises and godfathers , many of who call themselves " military consultants " .
On 30 January 1968 , the UN General Assembly issued a resolution condemning mercenary activities .
Mercenaries were condemned again in the Geneva Diplomatic Conferences of 1974 and 1977 .
In the latter year , the term was given a comprehensive definition in Article 47 of the first Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 .
It states that a mercenary is any person who : " Is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict ; Does , in fact , take a direct part in the hostilities ;
Is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and , in fact , is promised , by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict , material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party ;
Is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict ;
Is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict ; and Has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces . "
To be sure , there has always been a connection between " making money " and " making war " .
The soldier of fortune is one of the oldest professions in history .
In ancient Middle Eastern texts from Pharaonic Egypt to Mesopotamia , there are frequent mentions of " Hebrews " ( Habiru or Hapiru ) which referred variously to stateless peoples or marauding tribes or brigands that voluntarily entered into the service of kings as slave - armies , and to bands of mercenaries willing to attach themselves to an army in exchange for pay or a share in the booty .
Wherever there has been combat there have been fighters solely on the lookout for profit , even if their forms of recruitment have changed , their methods have become more sophisticated and their functions have grown increasingly specialised and diversified .
The 20th century world was a crucible of global wars , regional conflicts and civil strife , and a period of alarming advancements in military technology that sapped developing nations of their wealth and exacerbated their poverty .
Since the Americans dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the world has seen at least 172 wars .
In most of these wars , mercenaries not only took part but also contributed to aggravating and prolonging them .
After all , they are in business not to defend a nation , humanitarian principles or the oppressed , but to make money -- lots of it .
The longer a war lasts , the more money they make .
Camouflage describes more than just the type of uniforms they might wear .
Like chameleons they change colour in order to appeal to the highest bidder for their services , and their services are to spread death , terror and destruction .
They are entirely without compunction and they suffer no pangs of conscience , traits which apply as much to the companies that have made the mercenary business their stock in trade as it does to the individuals themselves .
Whether we call them mercenaries , private security firms or the neat and fashionable PMF , they are a taint on the military profession and blight on the history of human progress .
GLOBAL PROFITEERING :
The fact that some wars erupt for ethnic or religious reasons , as in Kosovo , or over the struggle for power , as in Uganda and Congo , or due to organised crime and the drug trade , as in Sierra Leone , Afghanistan and Columbia , suggests that in many of today 's wars profiteering is a fundamental ingredient -- all the more so in countries rich in natural resources and rife with government corruption .
Warfare in such countries offers incentives to criminal elements , if not into participating in actual conflict in exchange for pay , then at least indirectly by offering the necessary cover of violence for smuggling and other illegal operations , which in turn require their own private guards and militias .
Africa is the world 's most politically unstable region .
Its countries seem embroiled in virtually uninterrupted ethnic strife and civil wars that have wrought massive human carnage and genocide .
Some of these countries have deteriorated into total chaos after their governments brought in mercenaries in order to help them reassert control over their respective countries .
The mercenary industry boomed in Africa in part because the traditional notion , still widely held in certain areas , that power should go to the party that possesses the most money and buy the most supporters encourages a mercenary culture .
In part , too , because the collapse of the apartheid regime in South Africa gave rise to a surplus of military and intelligence experts with extensive knowledge of neighbouring countries in which they have fought before .
These fighters , no longer welcome in South Africa due to their ignominious record and their unwillingness to adjust to civilian life , find many lucrative opportunities elsewhere in the continent .
As for the worldwide boom in the mercenary business , it dates to the collapse of the Soviet Union , the end of the Cold War and Washington 's drive to fill the gap resulting from the withdrawal of the great powers from Africa .
In this regard , the US fostered strategic relations in Africa via NGOs and transnational companies , instead of by means of state - state relations as had prevailed in the previous era .
Also the end of the Cold War all but turned off the taps on the flow of free weapons -- to the governments of sub-Saharan Africa in particular .
This combined with the relatively poor military resources at their disposal , a weakness inherited from the colonialist era when colonial powers deliberately kept local armies as minimally equipped and trained as possible , diminished their ability to maintain control over their respective countries .
The end of the US - Soviet rivalry over spheres of influence did not alleviate explosive conditions in Africa .
It merely reduced the strategic importance of this continent .
Now that Moscow was out of the picture , the US had no more need to solicit the friendship of African governments in order to win more strategic friends and allies .
At the same time , European nations , whether out of deference to custom or due to a lack of sufficient will , were reluctant to intervene in Africa outside the NATO framework .
As the largest former coloniser of Africa , France 's position was particularly significant .
In the 1990s , Paris began to turn its attention closer to home and concentrate on matters connected to European unity .
In addition , since the French parliament 's vote to abolish obligatory military service , France has begun to reduce the levels of its forces in six African countries : Senegal , Gabon , Central Africa , Ivory Coast , Djibouti and Chad .
It is expected that by the end of another four years France will have no more than 5,000 troops left on the continent , compared to 30,000 in the 1960s .
In addition , the victory of capitalism over communism unleashed the competitive commercial spirit , even in the domain of security .
Up - and - coming mercenary firms were quick to perceive the opportunities , and in Africa where tensions bred by the Cold War were no longer restrained the opportunities were rife , especially in Congo , Zaire and Sierra Leone .
This said , outside of Africa the mercenary business found abundant offerings in trouble spots in Asia , parts of Europe and Latin America .
HIDING BEHIND MASKS :
One of the earliest best - known modern mercenary firms was the South African - based Executive Outcomes .
The pioneering private military company specialised in covert warfare and aerial combat patrols .
With thousands of recruits on its rosters , it won hundreds of millions of dollars worth of contracts with various African countries .
According to the contracts , the firm was paid for its " security " services in the form of mining concessions in gold , diamonds or other valuable mineral resources .
Executive Outcomes officials , drawn primarily from former South African police and army officers , claimed that they only worked with governments or with the approval of the governments concerned .
Other key personnel included Ukrainian pilots , being capable of flying the company 's MIG - 27 fighters and Russian - made M - 24 helicopters .
( Executive Outcomes was dissolved in 1999 when South Africa moved to stop mercenary activities . )
Another major mercenary firm is the US - based Military Professional Resources Incorporated ( MPRI ) .
Also staffed by former military or quasi-military personnel , the company has a website on which it promotes itself as an organisation that offers helicopter piloting training services .
MPRI officials maintain that they abide by US law and policy , that they are licensed to operate by the State Department , and that they are not mercenaries .
In Britain , a number of mercenary outfits were discovered .
Operating out of luxurious headquarters , they hire out arms and forces to such countries as Sierra Leone , in defiance of UN prohibitions .
One of the most important British firms in this field is Defence Systems Limited ( DSL ) , which rents out the " special air force services " of former RAF officers .
DSL has provided counter - insurgency training programmes to the governments of New Guinea , Sri Lanka , Mozambique and Columbia .
Definitive Results , registered in both the UK and South Africa , boasts an army of 5,000 fighters and a fleet of civilian and military aircraft , including reconnaissance and espionage planes and several MIG - 24 assault helicopters .
It also operates a commercial airline company that offers flights to destinations in Africa , the Middle East and Europe .
So successful has this company been that it has managed to buy up several rival firms , as well as a company that manages the petroleum and mining concessions in Angola , Sierra Leone , Uganda , Kenya , Tanzania and Mozambique .
In 1996 , it won the contract from the Sierra Leone government to repel the anti-government Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) forces led by Fodaj Sankoh , a task in which it achieved remarkable results .
According to Definitive Results ' director , his company 's strategy is " to enter into dialogue with the UN and the African Union in order to let them know who we are , what services we provide and how important these services are .
We want to explain to them why we can perform the operations they need better and yet at only 10 per cent of what they currently cost them . "
A more modest operation is Africa Security .
Founded by former French army officer Patrick Tourne in 1990 and staffed by about 2,500 recruits , it has helped put down anti-government opposition movements in Rwanda , Gabon and Cameroon .
At the time , Africa Security paid its soldiers 20 - 30,000 francs a month plus living expenses .
The South African - based company pays a monthly salary of $ 10,000 to its pilots and $ 2,000 to its non-commissioned officer equivalents .
The salaries are four times higher than what their counterparts would earn in the South African army .
THE PR GAME :
Yet the more their business thrived , the more the so - called PMFs had to work on their image and -- specifically -- to disassociate themselves from the concept of the mercenary .
PMFs naturally find supporters .
They are of the opinion that it is important to distinguish between so - called private security firms and internationally proscribed mercenaries .
But they also have their detractors who argue that there is little difference between what mercenaries and PMF operatives do .
In all events , no one has yet brought charges against governments for violating humanitarian law by granting lucrative contracts to such firms .
Yet some of the activities of such firms have prompted investigation by the US army itself .
Investigations were triggered by a video circulating on the Internet depicting personnel belonging to a British - owned security firm opening fire on Iraqi civilians in cars .
The investigative panel eventually recommended against bringing charges against the firm and its operatives .
In spite of such notorious black marks , PMF officials and employees insist that their companies aim to promote security and stability in weak nations .
Their business , they claim , is to help equip and train these nations ' armies so as to enable them safeguard their internal and national security .
They adamantly refuse to be called mercenaries , preferring instead the term " contracted soldiers " .
Mercenary , they agree , conveys the pejorative connotation of ruthless and unbridled rampage , pillage and bloodshed .
Contracted soldiers , by contrast , are respectable law - abiding citizens , operating out of proper offices and performing protection and training services clearly laid out in legal contracts .
As modern and professional as their offices may be and as tidily as their contracts are worded , it is obvious that much goes on behind the fa�ade and that PMFs are willing to hire out their personnel to perform more than the contractually stipulated services .
They engage in espionage , carry out assassinations , and engage in guerrilla warfare against countries near to the country that contracted them .
They import and smuggle in weapons , train rebel forces , plan and execute propaganda campaigns , carry out surveillance and sabotage operations in " enemy " territory , protect the wealth and power of corrupt rulers , and otherwise help to spread poverty , destruction and chaos , for the simple reason that , uncontrolled by law as they are , they can -- and will -- so long as there is money to be made .
What is the Facilities Protection Service ?
The Facilities Protection Service ( FPS ) was established on 4 October 2003 , according to Paul Bremer 's Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 27 .
The order says that , " The FPS may also consist of employees of private security firms who are engaged to perform services for the ministries or governorates through contracts , provided such private security firms and employees are licensed and authorised by the Ministry of Interior as provided in Section 7 herein . "
According to Global Security , " The FPS works for all ministries and governmental agencies , but its standards are set and enforced by the Ministry of Interior .
It can also be privately hired .
The FPS is tasked with the fixed site protection of ministerial , governmental , or private buildings , facilities and personnel .
The FPS includes oil , electricity police and port security .
" The majority of the FPS staff consists of former service members and former security guards .
The FPS will now secure public facilities such as hospitals , banks , and power stations within their district .
Once trained , the guards work with US military forces protecting critical sites like schools , hospitals and power plants . "
Which private security firms are operating in Iraq ?
" According to a February 2006 Government Accountability Office report , there were approximately 48,000 private military contractors in Iraq , employed by 181 different companies .
There may now be many more . "
As a former CIA agent , the author knows how mercenaries work : in the shadows .
But how did a notorious former British officer , Tim Spicer , come to coordinate the second largest army in Iraq -- the tens of thousands of private security contractors ( AEGIS ) ?
The report also mentions Blackwater , Dyncorp , Hart Security , Erinys ... " Private military companies -- companies providing security in the field -- make up a $ 30 - billion - a - year industry globally ... "
In Iraq , there are about 50 known private security firms working .
These include :
AEGIS PLC : ( AEGIS Special Risk Management )
AEGIS is a British security firm , it has about 1,000 employees in Iraq , 250 of which are Iraqis .
A film recently showed AEGIS members happily shooting Iraqi civilians .
Sourcewatch information on AEGIS : " AEGIS Defence Services was initially awarded a $ 300 million contract by the Pentagon in May 2004 to act as the ' coordination and management hub ' for the 50 - plus private security companies in Iraq .
As of December 2005 , that contract was worth in excess of $ 430 million .
They also contributed 75 teams of eight armed civilians each to assist and protect the Project Management Office of the United States .
They also provided protection for the Oil - for - Food Programme Enquiry . "
According to The Washington Post ( 12 August 2007 ) , the US military has paid $ 548 million over the past three years to two British security firms that protect the US Army Corps of Engineers on reconstruction projects , more than $ 200 million over the original budget , according to previously undisclosed data that shows how the cost of private security in Iraq has mushroomed .
The two companies , AEGIS Defence Services and Erinys Iraq , signed their original Defence Department contracts in May 2004 .
By July of 2007 , the contracts supported a private force that had grown to about 2,000 employees serving the Corps of Engineers .
The force is about the size of three military battalions .
The size of this force and its cost have never been documented .
The Pentagon has said that about 20,000 security contractors operate in Iraq , although some estimates are considerably higher .
AEGIS and Erinys work side - by - side in Baghdad 's Green Zone .
Erinys Iraq Ltd :
According to Global Security , " Erinys Iraq Ltd is the private security company hired to protect Iraq 's oil pipelines under a $ 40 million contract awarded in August 2003 .
Erinys Iraq , an affiliate of Erinys International formed in 2001 , landed the Iraq contract to supply and train 6,500 armed guards charged with protecting 140 Iraqi petroleum wells , 7,000 km of pipelines and refineries , as well as power plants and the water supply for the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum .
A majority of Erinys ' workforce [ 15,000 Iraqi and 350 international staff ] in Iraq are Kurdish peshmerga . "
Sourcewatch information on Erinys : " Erinys Iraq Ltd , which won an $ 80 million contract from the Coalition Provisional Authority to provide security for the petroleum infrastructure in Iraq , has had some powerful alliances in Iraq . "
Erinys set up a Joint Venture with Nour USA Ltd .
Nour 's founder is Abul - Huda Farouki , a wealthy Jordanian - American who lives in northern Virginia and whose companies have done extensive construction work for the Pentagon .
A founding partner and the director of Erinys Iraq is Faisal Dhaghistani .
Faisal is the son of Tamara Dhaghistani , who played a major role in the development of Ahmed Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress .
The firm 's counsel in Baghdad has been Chalabi 's nephew , Salem Chalabi .
" Many among the 14,000 guards recruited by Erinys to protect the petroleum infrastructure came directly from the Iraqi Free Forces , a militia that had been loyal to Chalabi 's movement . "
Blackwater USA :
Blackwater was the security firm hired to protect Paul Bremer in Iraq .
Sourcewatch information on Blackwater : " Blackwater is one of two companies which make up the Prince Group , the other being Prince Manufacturing ...
The Prince Group bought Aviation Worldwide Services [ which ] consists of STI Aviation , Inc , Air Quest , Inc , and Presidential Airways , Inc .
These companies provide the logistical and air support for Blackwater operations .
Blackwater itself consists of Blackwater Training Center , Blackwater Target Systems , Blackwater Security Consulting and Blackwater Canine . "
Blackwater vs Falluja : The 1st Marine Expeditionary Force took over Falluja on 27 March 2004 .
During a demonstration on the following day , the US killed 18 Falluja civilians .
The Iraqi response to this was the murder and hanging of four Blackwater employees on 31 March 2004 .
War crimes committed by the United States followed .
Najaf was also affected .
Sourcewatch says : " According to Russel Mokhiber and Robert Weissman , a few days after the Falluja killings , " Blackwater Security Consulting engaged in full - scale battle in Najaf , with the company flying its own helicopters amidst an intense firefight to re-supply its own commandos ...
The increased scrutiny of security firms led Blackwater to hire the Alexander Strategy Group [ now involved in three " K Street " scandals ] for crisis management , public and media relations . "
Armorgroup :
ArmorGroup operates in 40 countries worldwide and is a leading international risk management , security services , mine action , and information service provider .
ArmorGroup has bid for what is believed to be the largest US security contract in Iraq , worth about $ 475 million .
ArmorGroup is already one of the largest security firms in Iraq , with more than 1,200 employees .
It says it is the largest convoy escort contractor in Iraq -- accounting for about 30 per cent of convoys -- including about 1,200 missions last year .
The potential bidders also include AEGIS Defence Services .

Private security companies lack oversight and regulation -- UN working group
A growing number of private security and military companies are operating domestically and internationally without effective oversight or accountability , the United Nations working group on the use of mercenaries warned on 10 March 2008 .
Presenting its report to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva , the working group said that private security companies in such conflict - wracked countries as Iraq , Colombia and Afghanistan are recruiting former policemen and members of the military from developing countries as " security guards " in their operations .
Once there , those guards in fact become " militarily armed private soldiers " , which is essentially a new way to describe mercenaries , who are often responsible for serious human rights abuses , the working group stated .
War - torn states also frequently lack the capacity to control and regulate the private companies , the report noted , with national legislation granting immunity to the companies -- which are sometimes transnational -- in some cases .
When this happens , the private guards are only accountable to their employers , and the working group said immunity can soon turn into impunity .
The working group , established in 2005 and composed of five independent experts serving in personal capacities , called for the wider ratification of the International Convention against the recruitment , use , financing and training of mercenaries .
It noted that as holders of the monopoly of the legitimate use of forces , states are and should be the main actors responsible for protecting and promoting human rights .
The working group 's members are Jos� Luis G�mez del Prado of Spain ( chairperson - rapporteur ) , Libya 's Najat Al - Hajjaji , Amada Benavides de P�rez of Colombia , Russia 's Alexander Nikitin and Shaista Shameem of Fiji . ( source : www.globalsecurity.org)

By Barry Sheppard
This article is taken from a chapter of volume one of a political memoir , covering the years 1960 - 1973 .
Barry Sheppard was a central leader of the US Young Socialist Alliance and Socialist Workers Party during the years 1960 - 1988 .
***
Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little in Omaha , Nebraska , on May 19 , 1925 .
In February 1946 he was sentenced in Massachusetts to 8 - 10 years ' imprisonment for burglary .
While in prison , he was won to the Nation of Islam , a Black Nationalist religious sect founded by W.D. Fard and headed at that time and until his death by Elijah Muhammad .
Emerging in the early 1930s , the Nation of Islam was one of the groups that developed as a result of the decline and splintering of Marcus Garvey 's Universal Negro Improvement Association , which had galvanised a large section of the Black community after World War I .
The Nation of Islam taught a religious doctrine that Black people were blessed by God and that whites were devils specially created to oppress Black people .
They called for the creation of an independent Black nation in the United States , but tended to stress that the achievement of this state would be the work of God , not human beings .
In 1952 Malcolm X , as he had renamed himself in the Nation of Islam manner , became assistant minister of the Nation of Islam in Detroit .
In 1954 , he was appointed minister of the Harlem mosque .
A powerful speaker and thinker , Malcolm was a great success as a proselytiser for the Nation of Islam , which began to attract significant support in the late 1950s and early 1960s as nationalist sentiments spread among Blacks in the wake of an increased pace of civil rights activity throughout the country .
As the Black struggle burgeoned in the early 1960s , in the north as well as the segregated south , Malcolm X began to press the Nation of Islam to become more deeply involved in the struggle .
His conflict with the leadership deepened when he discovered that the moral precepts of the Nation of Islam ( which had helped reshape his life and which included opposition to drugs , alcohol and violence and sexual abuse against Black women ) were not being adhered to by Elijah Muhammad .
Malcolm X was suspended from the Nation of Islam at the end of 1963 .
In early 1964 he broke from the organisation .
Instead of attempting to combine religious and political organisations , he established a mosque for those who shared his religious beliefs and a Black nationalist political organisation , the Organization of Afro-American Unity , to participate in building a Black nationalist movement in the United States
Today , Malcolm
X is a recognised hero of Black America and is also widely respected among many other sectors of society , so much so that his picture even appears on us postage stamps .
But that 's not the way it was in the 1960s .
Prominent liberals like James Wechsler , Social Democrats like Bayard Rustin and Tom Kahn , the Communist Party USA and other left - wing groups and spokespersons attacked Malcolm X with bitter hatred .
Even the Black leaders of the civil rights movement treated Malcolm with guarded circumspection .
And while he is a hero today , Malcolm 's revolutionary ideas , especially those he developed or began to talk about openly after his break with the Nation of Islam in 1964 , have largely been ignored and suppressed in the chorus of posthumous praise .
This background needs to be remembered in order to understand and appreciate the revolutionary response of the Socialist Workers Party [ SWP ] to the rise of Black nationalism and the revolutionary development of Malcolm X .
The split in the Nation of Islam resulted in a remarkable development on the part of Malcolm X. Malcolm had until then been the main public spokesperson for the Nation and was well known for his fiery brand of Black nationalism .
Now , in what would turn out to be the last year of his life , Malcolm X broadened his horizons and deepened his understanding of the nature of the system that was responsible for the oppression of African Americans .
Even before his break with the Nation of Islam , Malcolm took notice of the fact that the Militant [ the newspaper of the Socialist Workers Party ] defended the Nation 's civil rights against police frame - ups .
The Militant also reported the content of his speeches honestly , in contrast to the daily press and most publications on the left .
When he encountered Militant salespeople — Black or white — outside his meeting , he would often stop to say , " That 's a good paper . "
Harry Ring , a Militant staff writer , interviewed Malcolm X early in 1964 .
In a change from his past positions , Malcolm said that he would now support the civil rights movement in the south , while continuing to support the right of Blacks to armed self - defence against racist attacks .
He began to accept speaking engagements in the south .
In a March 12 statement reprinted in the Militant , he outlined his plans for a new Black organisation .
" Whites can help us " , he said , " but they can't join us .
There can be no black - white unity until there is first some black unity .
There can be no workers ' solidarity until there is first some racial solidarity .
We cannot think of uniting with others , until after we have first united among ourselves . "
1
This too was new .
Malcolm was thinking of the need for workers ' solidarity ; but such solidarity had to be constructed on the basis of equality , and it required that Blacks first be organised as Blacks to fight their special oppression .
The struggle itself was bringing the northern and southern movements closer .
Blacks were intensifying their fight in the north as well as all across the south .
In New York City , a massive school boycott was being organised , as well as a rent strike in Harlem to protest the appalling conditions in the slums of the Black ghetto .
The rent strike , led by Jesse Grey , was widespread , but had a weakness in not involving many rent strikers in the actual organisation of the action .
The YSA [ Young Socialist Alliance , the youth group in political solidarity with the SWP ] helped out .
We went from door to door in Harlem , handing out leaflets and explaining the issues .
Malcolm X agreed to speak at the Militant Labor Forum on April 8 .
We knew that the meeting would draw far more people than could fit into our usual meeting hall at 116 University Place .
So we rented the Palm Garden Ballroom for the event .
Eight hundred people showed up for his talk on " Black Revolution " .
Among them were my parents .
Like many other people , my parents had been influenced by the incessant public smear campaign against Malcolm X .
But they came to see for themselves .
They heard a powerful revolutionary speech , quite different from what they had been led to expect from the press .
Years later , my father would proudly tell people that he had heard Malcolm X firsthand .
The meeting was deemed important enough that the New York Post sent one of its top columnists , the liberal James Wechsler , to cover the event .
Wechsler wrote a column warning of the danger of the " young Trotskyist intellectuals " getting together with the angry Black masses that Malcolm spoke for .
2
Shortly thereafter , the cops and the press raised a hoax about the formation of a Black youth gang in Harlem , called the " Blood Brothers " , who were supposedly organising to murder whites for political reasons .
One reporter said they were trained by " Black Muslim dissidents " .
The scare campaign was obviously directed against Malcolm X . We scheduled a Militant Labor Forum at 116 University Place , with Clifton DeBerry , the SWP 's presidential candidate , Quentin Hand from the Harlem Action Group , William Reed of New York core ( the Congress of Racial Equality ) , and James Shabazz , a leader of Malcolm 's Muslim Mosque , Inc .
It was a hot night , and the forum was packed .
We were pleasantly startled when Malcolm X walked in with Shabazz and spoke in his place .
Malcolm had founded the Muslim Mosque , Inc. right after his split with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam .
But Malcolm 's subsequent experiences and his travels to Africa and the Arab world had caused his viewpoint to evolve ; he became convinced of the need for a broader , non-religious organisation .
At a rally held at the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem , he announced the formation of the Organization of Afro-American Unity .
Jack Barnes and I held an interview with Malcolm X in early 1965 , a few weeks before his assassination .
He outlined the development of his thinking in the year since the split .
He told us that the " press has purposely and skillfully projected me in the image of a racist , a race supremacist , and an extremist .
First , I 'm not a racist .
I 'm against every form of racism and segregation , every form of discrimination .
I believe in human beings , and that all human beings should be respected as such , regardless of color . "
Explaining the split in the Nation , he said :
The split came about primarily because they put me out , and they put me out because of my uncompromising approach to problems I thought should be solved and the movement could solve .
I felt the movement was dragging its feet in many areas .
It did n't involve itself in the civil or civic or political struggles our people were confronted by .
All it did was stress the importance of moral reformation — do n't drink , do n't smoke , do n't permit fornication and adultery .
When I found that the hierarchy itself was n't practicing what it preached , it was clear that this part of its program was bankrupt .
So the only way it could function and be meaningful in the community was to take part in the political and economic facets of the Negro struggle .
And the organization would n't do that because the stand it would have to take would have been too militant , uncompromising and activist , and the hierarchy had gotten conservative .
It was motivated mainly by protecting its own self interests .
I might point out that although the Black Muslim movement professed to be a religious group , the religion they had adopted — Islam — did n't recognize them .
So religiously it was in a vacuum .
And it did n't take part in politics , so it was not a political group .
When you have an organization that 's neither political nor religious and does n't take part in the civil rights struggle , what can it call itself ?
It 's in a vacuum .
So , all of these factors led to my splitting from the organization .
Shortly after the split , Malcolm made his pilgrimage ( hajj ) to Mecca , where he learned that Islam was colour - blind and accepted all races and peoples .
He also told us :
I used to define Black nationalism as the idea that the Black man should control the economy of his community , the politics of his community , and so forth .
But , when I was in Africa in May [ 1964 ] , in Ghana , I was speaking with the Algerian ambassador who is extremely militant and is a revolutionary in the true sense of the word ( and his credentials as such for having carried on a successful revolution against oppression in his country ) .
When I told him that my political , social and economic philosophy was Black nationalism , he asked me very frankly , well , where did that leave him ?
Because he was white .
He was African , but he was Algerian , and to all appearances , he was a white man .
And he said if I define my objective as the victory of Black nationalism , where does that leave him ?
Where does that leave revolutionaries in Morocco , Egypt , Iraq , Mauritania ?
So he showed me where I was alienating people who were true revolutionaries dedicated to overturning the system of exploitation that exists on this earth by any means necessary .
So , I had to do a lot of thinking and reappraising of my definition of Black nationalism .
Can we sum up the solution to the problems confronting our people as Black nationalism ?
And if you notice , I have n't been using the expression for several months .
But I still would be hard pressed to give a specific definition of the overall philosophy which I think is necessary for the liberation of the Black people in the country .
He explained the function of the two organisations he had helped to form .
First was the " Muslim Mosque , Inc. , which is religious " .
This was the first group he established after the split .
" Its aim is to create an atmosphere and facilities in which people who are interested in Islam can get a better understanding of Islam . "
As a result of his thinking and experiences abroad , he came to the conclusion that another organisation had to be built , a political organisation that would be secular .
" The aim of the other organization , the Organization of Afro-American Unity , is to use whatever means necessary to bring about a society in which the 22 million Afro-Americans are recognized and respected as human beings . "
In this interview , he went on to talk about the role of students and youth in the struggle in the United States and worldwide , his opposition to us intervention in Congo , Vietnam and elsewhere , his contempt for the Democratic Party , and his belief that capitalism eventually will " collapse completely " .

The Militant sent reporters to cover the meetings of the OAAU , which often featured a talk by Malcolm .
We also sent people to sell the Militant at those meetings .
My brother Roland was one of the most consistent salespeople at these events .
Sometimes the crowd would be suspicious of these salespersons , especially if they were white .
But Malcolm would urge the audience to buy the paper , endorsing it as " one of the best " .
In his April 8 talk to the Militant Labor Forum , Malcolm said :
1964 will be America 's hottest year yet ; a year of much racial violence and bloodshed .
But it wo n't be blood that 's going to flow only on one side .
The new generation of Black people that have grown up in this country during recent years are already forming the opinion , and it 's just an opinion , that if there is going to be bleeding , it should be reciprocal — bleeding on both sides .

Malcolm was right .
In July a Black rebellion rocked Harlem .
Robert DesVerney , writing in the Militant , reported :
Armed with nothing more than courage , bottles , bricks , bare fists , and occasional Molotov cocktails , Harlem residents , provoked by years of savage brutality by New York 's corrupt and racist cops , managed to fight the tactical riot force of the police to a stalemate in three days of demonstrations and open hostilities .
The immediate cause of the outbreak was the killing on July 16 of a 15 - year - old Negro boy , James Powell , by a white police lieutenant wearing civilian clothes .

The rebellion had a deep impact on me and my political consciousness .
Nothing like this had happened before in the United States during my lifetime .
But it was only the beginning .
In the following years , similar Black rebellions spread to cities across the country .
New militant Black organisations formed , and older ones were transformed .
Malcolm X was the prophet and symbol of this new upsurge .
The worldwide youth radicalisation that marked the political period called the " 1960s " was profoundly influenced by the Black movement .
When he returned from a tour of Africa and Europe at the end of November , Malcolm blasted a renewed assault by Belgian and us imperialism on Congo .
The purpose of the attack was to prop up the Belgian puppet Moises Tshombe , precursor to the infamous Mobutu .
Tshombe 's forces were under strong attack from the followers of the assassinated Patrice Lumumba .
At an OAAU rally of about 1000 in Harlem , he characterised Tshombe as the " worst Negro in the world " , and said of the president - elect , " Johnson is sleeping with [ Tshombe ] " .
Addressing the crowd , he said , " Man , you voted for him [ Johnson ] .
You were insane , out of your mind .
I do n't blame you .
You were tricked . "

Malcolm X agreed to speak at another Militant Labor Forum on January 7 , 1965 .
The title of his talk was " 1965 — Prospects for Freedom " .
About 600 people came to hear him .
After the talk , I jumped up on the stage and introduced myself as the editor of the Young Socialist .
I asked Malcolm if he would do an interview with the YS .
He readily agreed , and we set the day and time .
The result was the interview referred to above .
I discussed the project with Jack Barnes , newly elected national chairman of the YSA .
We agreed that Jack should accompany me to the interview , to help build the YSA 's relations with Malcolm X . I drew up a list of questions , and we went with a tape recorder up to Malcolm 's office at the Hotel Teresa on 125th Street in Harlem .
Malcolm was dressed immaculately , as always , but I noticed that the collar of his white shirt was frayed .
Clearly he was having financial troubles since the break with the Nation .
We had a good interview with him , and we went away convinced that he would like to talk again with us .
I took the tape , transcribed it , and edited it lightly .
I also sharpened some of Malcolm 's points .
We had agreed that Malcolm would have the final say on the article .
I had to work at my new assignment on the Militant , as well as edit the Young Socialist , so we decided that Jack would take the draft back for Malcolm 's approval .
Jack was excited when he came back from his meeting with Malcolm .
He told me that Malcolm liked the way I had edited the piece and had nothing to change .
He also discussed the planned march against the Vietnam War that Students for a Democratic Society had initiated and that the YSA had endorsed and was building .
Malcolm wanted to know how we planned to resolve the contradiction between our view , that the us should get out of Vietnam immediately , and the overall theme of the march , which shied away from such a stance .
Malcolm had been wrestling with questions like this for some time , even before he was expelled from the Nation of Islam .
The Nation had always talked in a militant fashion , but it never participated in struggles along with other groups .
Malcolm X wanted to take part in the Black struggle as it was , and at the same time he wanted to further his militant revolutionary objectives .
Malcolm and Jack also talked about the possibility of Malcolm making a nationwide speaking tour of the college campuses , organized by the YSA .
Jack told him that he thought student groups of many types , and even student governments and faculty , could be drawn into such an effort .
What we would do is spearhead the project .
Malcolm replied that even if only the YSA sponsored the speaking tour , it would be ok with him .
But this was not to be .
Malcolm X was assassinated on February 22 , 1965 as he was about to address a meeting of the OAAU at the Audubon Ballroom .
My brother Roland was present , and had to duck for cover as the shooting started .
He got up to witness Malcolm collapse and die on the stage .
Melissa Singler and I were at the YSA 's national headquarters .
We rushed over to 116 University Place , as did most members of the party and YSA .
An event of some sort was scheduled to take place later in the afternoon .
Tom Kerry , shaken as we all were , addressed us .
He told us that in face of this terrific blow , we should go ahead with our plans , and not allow this criminal act to demoralise us .
We had just received off the press the issue of the ys that contained Malcolm 's interview .
We put a special insert into each copy about the assassination .
Three people were charged and tried for the assassination .
One of these , Talmadge Hayer , was caught at the scene because he had been shot by one of Malcolm 's followers .
The other two were members of the Nation of Islam .
Hayer admitted his part in the crime , but has always said the other two defendants were not part of the plot .
The government sought to put the blame on the Nation , which had certainly opened itself to the charge by making openly hostile and threatening remarks about Malcolm .
There had been a fire - bombing of Malcolm 's home , and an attempt on his life when he was driving through the Sumner Tunnel in Boston , which he thought were the work of the Nation .
But shortly before the assassination , Malcolm came to believe that the government was the main force behind actions taken against him , including in other countries .
He said that the Nation did n't have the resources to carry out these actions .
Herman Porter was at the Audubon Ballroom when the assassination took place , planning to cover the meeting for the Militant .
He also covered the trial of those accused of the murder , who were all convicted .
His Militant articles on the trial were collected into a pamphlet , which made a strong case that it was the government , through one of its covert agencies , that was responsible .
The New York Times gloated in its reporting of the assassination , suggesting that Malcolm X , as an apostle of violence , got what he deserved .
Today , this same mouthpiece for the ruling class portrays the historical Malcolm as a tame figure , as simply another civil rights leader .
Some 30,000 people passed by Malcolm 's casket in the Harlem funeral home where his body was on view .
At the funeral itself , thousands of Blacks and a few dozen whites stood in line on a bitterly cold day , but only 1000 were able to get in .
In the audience were John Lewis , chairman of sncc ( the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ) ; Black comedian and civil rights activist Dick Gregory ; Stanley Branch of the Chester , Pennsylvania , Freedom Now Committee ; James Farmer of CORE ; Harlem rent strike leader Jesse Grey ; James Foreman , executive director of SNCC ; Robert Moses , head of SNCC 's Mississippi voter registration project ; and even Bayard Rustin , a Black social democrat and a political opponent of Malcolm X .
Ossie Davis , the Black activist and actor , spoke .
Ruby Dee , also an actress and Black activist , read the many statements from around the world and the country , many from Africa , saluting the fallen leader .
In a very moving passage in his speech , Ossie Davis said :
Malcolm was our manhood , our living Black manhood .
This was his measure .
This was his meaning to his people .
In honoring him we honor what is best in ourselves .
We know him for what he was — a prince .
Our own , Black , shining prince — who did not hesitate to die because he loved us so .
And now we surrender his services to Islam .
7
We also held our own memorial meeting at 116 University Place .
Clifton DeBerry chaired the meeting , which was addressed by James Shabazz , Robert DesVerney and Farrell Dobbs , national secretary of the SWP .
The final speaker was Jack Barnes , who spoke on the meaning of Malcolm 's life for the new generation of revolutionists .
We of that new generation felt that Jack was speaking for all of us .
The YSA soon put out a pamphlet with our interview and Jack 's speech .
There were other memorial meetings we held around the country .
George Breitman gave a speech in Detroit , which we published in full over two issues of the Militant , entitled " Malcolm X : The Man and His Ideas " .
We soon published books by and about Malcolm that explained and preserved Malcolm 's contribution to the movement for the liberation of all humanity .
Malcolm X was the greatest person I have ever met .
Notes
In his 1961 book , The Image , Daniel J. Boorstin noted , " The celebrity is the person who is known for his well - knownness . "
Nearly half a century later , the ever - expanding phenomenon of self - created , self - publicized " expertainers " contains a paradoxical niche profession known as Motivational Speakers — people who are mostly successful at selling books and giving lectures about success .
A sort of meta-success .
Let 's take a look at a few examples :
Suze Orman
Suze Orman , Financial Guru with her own show ( The Suze Orman Show ) on CNBC , was not always a brilliant financial advisor .
She started out as a waitress , serving up pastries , cakes , cookies , brownies at the Buttercup Bakery in Berkeley , California .
At age 29 , she received a business loan of $ 50,000 to open her own restaurant , and she decided to invest the money in the stock market .
Within 4 months , she lost the money to a swindling stock broker at Merrill Lynch .
( No problem : to pay back the loan , she , herself , became a stockbroker at Merrill Lynch , and eventually the vice - president of Prudential Bache Securities . )
In her 28 years since leaving the bakery , she has gone on to earn $ 32 million by authoring seven pop-culture financial advice books and hanging out with Oprah all the time .
Still no restaurant of her own , though .
Tony Robbins
At age 18 , having already read over 700 motivational books , Tony Robbins was , " alone , overweight , broke and sad in a bachelor apartment in Venice , California , " but " within one year he turned his whole life around . "
He became known as , " the 19 year old kid that became a millionaire in less than one year by transforming his whole life . "
Of course , that mysterious million dollars earned in one year is $ 2,739 a day , and you certainly can't make that much selling BluBlockers on Venice Beach .
So how did he do it ?
The man with the malfunctioning pituitary gland ( who was thrown out of his parents ' house at age 17 for being " too intense " ) allegedly discovered he had a mutant power for selling tickets to Jim Rohn seminars .
30 years later , everyone 's favorite Neuro - Linguistic Programmer and Fire - walker is selling front row tickets to his very own " Unleash The Power Within " performances for a mere $ 2595 .
Dr. Phil
In Germany and Scandinavia , a " Dr. Phil " is the name of a doctoral degree .
In the US however , Dr. Phil signifies something completely different ; it 's the celebrity moniker for Phillip Calvin McGraw .
Another TV personality who hangs out with Oprah a lot , he met her when his own company , Courtroom Services , Inc. , was hired to prepare her for a 3 - year lawsuit called the Amarillo Texas Beef Trial .
Oprah was so impressed with his work that she invited him to appear on her show regularly as a " Relationship and Life Strategy Expert . " 13 books ( and an appearance on The Simpsons ) later , Dr. Phil 's entertainment career is as strategic as ever .
Not bad for a guy who is n't even a licensed psychologist !
* * * * *
There are numerous other examples of these meta- successful beings : Born Eben W. Pagan , " Double Your Dating " creator David DeAngelo claims to have been a rock guitarist in a former life ( but no evidence of this can be found , unfortunately ) .
Deepak Chopra won the 1998 Ig Nobel Prize in physics for " his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life , liberty , and the pursuit of economic happiness . "
Zig Ziglar 's real first name is Hilary .
And of course , Matt Foley never actually existed outside of the set of Saturday Night Live .
Un-credilble pasts aside , these expertainers have all proven in their own ways that success actually works .

LLVM 2.3 Release Notes
Written by the LLVM Team
This document contains the release notes for the LLVM compiler infrastructure , release 2.3 .
Here we describe the status of LLVM , including major improvements from the previous release and any known problems .
All LLVM releases may be downloaded from the LLVM releases web site .
For more information about LLVM , including information about the latest release , please check out the main LLVM web site .
If you have questions or comments , the LLVM developer 's mailing list is a good place to send them .
Note that if you are reading this file from a Subversion checkout or the main LLVM web page , this document applies to the next release , not the current one .
To see the release notes for a specific releases , please see the releases page .
This is the fourteenth public release of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure .
It includes a large number of features and refinements from LLVM 2.2 .
LLVM 2.3 no longer supports llvm - gcc 4.0 , it has been replaced with llvm - gcc 4.2 .
LLVM 2.3 no longer includes the llvm - upgrade tool .
It was useful for upgrading LLVM 1.9 files to LLVM 2.x syntax , but you can always use a previous LLVM release to do this .
One nice impact of this is that the LLVM regression test suite no longer depends on llvm - upgrade , which makes it run faster .
The llvm2cpp tool has been folded into llc , use llc - march=cpp instead of llvm2cpp .
LLVM API Changes : Several core LLVM IR classes have migrated to use the ' FOOCLASS :: Create ( ... ) ' pattern instead of ' new FOOCLASS ( ... ) ' ( e.g. where FOOCLASS= BasicBlock ) .
We hope to standardize on FOOCLASS :: Create for all IR classes in the future , but not all of them have been moved over yet .
' pattern instead of ' ' ( e.g. where FOOCLASS= ) .
We hope to standardize on for all IR classes in the future , but not all of them have been moved over yet .
LLVM 2.3 renames the LLVMBuilder and LLVMFoldingBuilder classes to IRBuilder .
MRegisterInfo was renamed to TargetRegisterInfo .
The MappedFile class is gone , please use Memory Buffer instead .
The ' - enable - eh ' flag to llc has been removed .
Now code should encode whether it is safe to omit unwind information for a function by tagging the Function object with the ' nounwind ' attribute .
' flag to llc has been removed .
Now code should encode whether it is safe to omit unwind information for a function by tagging the Function object with the ' ' attribute .
The ConstantFP :: get method that uses APFloat now takes one argument instead of two .
The type argument has been removed , and the type is now inferred from the size of the given APFloat value .
The core LLVM 2.3 distribution currently consists of code from the core LLVM repository ( which roughly contains the LLVM optimizer , code generators and supporting tools ) and the llvm - gcc repository .
In addition to this code , the LLVM Project includes other sub- projects that are in development .
The two which are the most actively developed are the new vmkit Project and the Clang Project .
The " vmkit " project is a new addition to the LLVM family .
It is an implementation of a JVM and a CLI Virtual Machines ( Microsoft .NET is an implementation of the CLI ) using the Just - In - Time compiler of LLVM .
The JVM , called JnJVM , executes real - world applications such as Apache projects ( e.g. Felix and Tomcat ) and the SpecJVM98 benchmark .
It uses the GNU Classpath project for the base classes .
The CLI implementation , called N3 , is its in early stages but can execute simple applications and the " pnetmark " benchmark .
It uses the pnetlib project as its core library .
The ' vmkit '
VMs compare in performance with industrial and top open - source VMs on scientific applications .
Besides the JIT , the VMs use many features of the LLVM framework , including the standard set of optimizations , atomic operations , custom function provider and memory manager for JITed methods , and specific virtual machine optimizations .
vmkit is not an official part of LLVM 2.3 release .
It is publicly available under the LLVM license and can be downloaded from : svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/vmkit/trunk vmkit
The Clang project is an effort to build a set of new ' LLVM native ' front - end technologies for the LLVM optimizer and code generator .
Clang is continuing to make major strides forward in all areas .
Its C and Objective - C parsing support is very solid , and the code generation support is far enough along to build many C applications .
While not yet production quality , it is progressing very nicely .
In addition , C++ front - end work has started to make significant progress .
At this point , Clang is most useful if you are interested in source - to - source transformations ( such as refactoring ) and other source - level tools for C and Objective - C. Clang now also includes tools for turning C code into pretty HTML , and includes a new static analysis tool in development .
This tool focuses on automatically finding bugs in C and Objective - C code .
LLVM 2.3 includes a huge number of bug fixes , performance tweaks and minor improvements .
Some of the major improvements and new features are listed in this section .
LLVM 2.3 includes several major new capabilities :
The biggest change in LLVM 2.3 is Multiple Return Value ( MRV ) support .
MRVs allow LLVM IR to directly represent functions that return multiple values without having to pass them " by reference " in the LLVM IR .
This allows a front - end to generate more efficient code , as MRVs are generally returned in registers if a target supports them .
See the LLVM IR Reference for more details .
MRVs are fully supported in the LLVM IR , but are not yet fully supported in on all targets .
However , it is generally safe to return up to 2 values from a function : most targets should be able to handle at least that .
MRV support is a critical requirement for X86 - 64 ABI support , as X86 - 64 requires the ability to return multiple registers from functions , and we use MRVs to accomplish this in a direct way .
LLVM 2.3 includes a complete reimplementation of the " llvmc " tool .
It is designed to overcome several problems with the original llvmc and to provide a superset of the features of the ' gcc ' driver .
The main features of llvmc2 are : Extended handling of command line options and smart rules for dispatching them to different tools .
Flexible ( and extensible ) rules for defining different tools .
The different intermediate steps performed by tools are represented as edges in the abstract graph .
The ' language ' for driver behavior definition is tablegen and thus it 's relatively easy to add new features .
The definition of driver is transformed into set of C++ classes , thus no runtime interpretation is needed .
LLVM 2.3 includes a completely rewritten interface for Link Time Optimization .
This interface is written in C , which allows for easier integration with C code bases , and incorporates improvements we learned about from the first incarnation of the interface .
The Kaleidoscope tutorial now includes a " port " of the tutorial that uses the Ocaml bindings to implement the Kaleidoscope language .
LLVM 2.3 fully supports the llvm - gcc 4.2 front - end , and includes support for the C , C++ , Objective - C , Ada , and Fortran front - ends .
llvm - gcc 4.2 includes numerous fixes to better support the Objective - C front - end .
Objective - C now works very well on Mac OS/X .
Fortran EQUIVALENCEs are now supported by the gfortran front - end .
llvm - gcc 4.2 includes many other fixes which improve conformance with the relevant parts of the GCC testsuite .
New features include : LLVM IR now directly represents " common " linkage , instead of representing it as a form of weak linkage .
LLVM IR now has support for atomic operations , and this functionality can be accessed through the llvm - gcc " __sync_synchronize " , " __sync_val_compare_and_swap " , and related builtins .
Support for atomics are available in the Alpha , X86 , X86 - 64 , and PowerPC backends .
The C and Ocaml bindings have extended to cover pass managers , several transformation passes , iteration over the LLVM IR , target data , and parameter attribute lists .
In addition to a huge array of bug fixes and minor performance tweaks , the LLVM 2.3 optimizers support a few major enhancements : Loop index set splitting on by default .
This transformation hoists conditions from loop bodies and reduces a loop 's iteration space to improve performance .
For example , for ( i = LB ; i < UB ; ++i ) if ( i <= NV ) LOOP_BODY is transformed into : NUB = min( NV+1 , UB ) for ( i = LB ; i < NUB ; ++i) LOOP_BODY
LLVM now includes a new memcpy optimization pass which removes dead memcpy calls , unneeded copies of aggregates , and performs return slot optimization .
The LLVM optimizer now notices long sequences of consecutive stores and merges them into memcpy 's where profitable .
optimization pass which removes dead calls , unneeded copies of aggregates , and performs return slot optimization .
The LLVM optimizer now notices long sequences of consecutive stores and merges them into 's where profitable .
Alignment detection for vector memory references and for memcpy and memset is now more aggressive .
and is now more aggressive .
The Aggressive Dead Code Elimination ( ADCE ) optimization has been rewritten to make it both faster and safer in the presence of code containing infinite loops .
Some of its prior functionality has been factored out into the loop deletion pass , which is safe for infinite loops .
The new ADCE pass is no longer based on control dependence , making it run faster .
The ' SimplifyLibCalls ' pass , which optimizes calls to libc and libm functions for C - based languages , has been rewritten to be a FunctionPass instead a ModulePass .
This allows it to be run more often and to be included at - O1 in llvm - gcc .
It was also extended to include more optimizations and several corner case bugs were fixed .
LLVM now includes a simple ' Jump Threading ' pass , which attempts to simplify conditional branches using information about predecessor blocks , simplifying the control flow graph .
This pass is pretty basic at this point , but catches some important cases and provides a foundation to build on .
Several corner case bugs which could lead to deleting volatile memory accesses have been fixed .
Several optimizations have been sped up , leading to faster code generation with the same code quality .
We put a significant amount of work into the code generator infrastructure , which allows us to implement more aggressive algorithms and make it run faster :
The code generator now has support for carrying information about memory references throughout the entire code generation process , via the MachineMemOperand class .
In the future this will be used to improve both pre-pass and post - pass scheduling , and to improve compiler - debugging output .
The target - independent code generator infrastructure now uses LLVM's APInt class to handle integer values , which allows it to support integer types larger than 64 bits ( for example i128 ) .
Note that support for such types is also dependent on target - specific support .
Use of APInt is also a step toward support for non -power - of - 2 integer sizes .
LLVM 2.3 includes several compile time speedups for code with large basic blocks , particularly in the instruction selection phase , register allocation , scheduling , and tail merging / jump threading .
LLVM 2.3 includes several improvements which make llc's -- view - sunit - dags visualization of scheduling dependency graphs easier to understand .
visualization of scheduling dependency graphs easier to understand .
The code generator allows targets to write patterns that generate subreg references directly in .td files now .
memcpy lowering in the backend is more aggressive , particularly for memcpy calls introduced by the code generator when handling pass - by - value structure argument copies .
lowering in the backend is more aggressive , particularly for calls introduced by the code generator when handling pass - by - value structure argument copies .
Inline assembly with multiple register results now returns those results directly in the appropriate registers , rather than going through memory .
Inline assembly that uses constraints like " ir " with immediates now use the ' i ' form when possible instead of always loading the value in a register .
This saves an instruction and reduces register use .
Added support for PIC / GOT style tail calls on X86/32 and initial support for tail calls on PowerPC 32 ( it may also work on PowerPC 64 but is not thoroughly tested ) .
New target - specific features include : llvm - gcc's X86-64 ABI conformance is far improved , particularly in the area of passing and returning structures by value .
llvm - gcc compiled code now interoperates very well on X86 - 64 systems with other compilers .
Support for Win64 was added .
This includes code generation itself , JIT support , and necessary changes to llvm - gcc .
The LLVM X86 backend now supports the support SSE 4.1 instruction set , and the llvm - gcc 4.2 front - end supports the SSE 4.1 compiler builtins .
Various generic vector operations ( insert / extract / shuffle ) are much more efficient when SSE 4.1 is enabled .
The JIT automatically takes advantage of these instructions , but llvm - gcc must be explicitly told to use them , e.g. with - march=penryn .
.
The X86 backend now does a number of optimizations that aim to avoid converting numbers back and forth from SSE registers to the X87 floating point stack .
This is important because most X86 ABIs require return values to be on the X87 Floating Point stack , but most CPUs prefer computation in the SSE units .
The X86 backend supports stack realignment , which is particularly useful for vector code on OS 's without 16 - byte aligned stacks , such as Linux and Windows .
The X86 backend now supports the " sseregparm " options in GCC , which allow functions to be tagged as passing floating point values in SSE registers .
Trampolines ( taking the address of a nested function ) now work on Linux / X86 - 64 .
__builtin_prefetch is now compiled into the appropriate prefetch instructions instead of being ignored .
is now compiled into the appropriate prefetch instructions instead of being ignored .
128 - bit integers are now supported on X86 - 64 targets .
This can be used through __attribute__ ( ( TImode ) ) in llvm -gcc .
in llvm - gcc .
The register allocator can now rematerialize PIC - base computations , which is an important optimization for register use .
The " t " and " f " inline assembly constraints for the X87 floating point stack now work .
However , the " u " constraint is still not fully supported .
New target - specific features include : The LLVM C backend now supports vector code .
The Cell SPU backend includes a number of improvements .
It generates better code and its stability / completeness is improving .
New features include : LLVM now builds with GCC 4.3 .
Bugpoint now supports running custom scripts ( with the - run- custom option ) to determine how to execute the command and whether it is making forward process .
LLVM is known to work on the following platforms : Intel and AMD machines ( IA32 ) running Red Hat Linux , Fedora Core and FreeBSD ( and probably other unix - like systems ) .
PowerPC and X86 - based Mac OS X systems , running 10.3 and above in 32 - bit and 64 - bit modes .
Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 using MinGW libraries ( native ) .
Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 with the Cygwin libraries ( limited support is available for native builds with Visual C++ ) .
Sun UltraSPARC workstations running Solaris 10 .
Alpha - based machines running Debian GNU / Linux .
Itanium - based ( IA64 ) machines running Linux and HP - UX .
The core LLVM infrastructure uses GNU autoconf to adapt itself to the machine and operating system on which it is built .
However , minor porting may be required to get LLVM to work on new platforms .
We welcome your portability patches and reports of successful builds or error messages .
This section contains all known problems with the LLVM system , listed by component .
As new problems are discovered , they will be added to these sections .
If you run into a problem , please check the LLVM bug database and submit a bug if there is n't already one .
The following components of this LLVM release are either untested , known to be broken or unreliable , or are in early development .
These components should not be relied on , and bugs should not be filed against them , but they may be useful to some people .
In particular , if you would like to work on one of these components , please contact us on the LLVMdev list .
The MSIL , IA64 , Alpha , SPU , and MIPS backends are experimental .
The llc " - filetype=asm " ( the default ) is the only supported value for this option .
The X86 backend does not yet support all inline assembly that uses the X86 floating point stack .
It supports the 'f ' and 't ' constraints , but not 'u ' .
The X86 backend generates inefficient floating point code when configured to generate code for systems that do n't have SSE2 .
Win64 code generation was n't widely tested .
Everything should work , but we expect small issues to happen .
Also , llvm - gcc cannot build mingw64 runtime currently due to several bugs due to lack of support for the 'u ' inline assembly constraint and X87 floating point inline assembly .
The X86 - 64 backend does not yet support position - independent code ( PIC ) generation on Linux targets .
The X86 - 64 backend does not yet support the LLVM IR instruction va_arg .
Currently , the llvm - gcc front - end supports variadic argument constructs on X86 - 64 by lowering them manually .
The Linux PPC32 / ABI support needs testing for the interpreter and static compilation , and lacks support for debug information .
Thumb mode works only on ARM v6 or higher processors .
On sub -ARMv6 processors , thumb programs can crash or produce wrong results ( PR1388 ) .
Compilation for ARM Linux OABI ( old ABI ) is supported , but not fully tested .
There is a bug in QEMU - ARM ( <= 0.9.0 ) which causes it to incorrectly execute programs compiled with LLVM .
Please use more recent versions of QEMU .
The SPARC backend only supports the 32 - bit SPARC ABI ( - m32 ) , it does not support the 64 - bit SPARC ABI ( - m64 ) .
On 21164s , some rare FP arithmetic sequences which may trap do not have the appropriate nops inserted to ensure restartability .
The Itanium backend is highly experimental , and has a number of known issues .
We are looking for a maintainer for the Itanium backend .
If you are interested , please contact the llvmdev mailing list .
The C backend has only basic support for inline assembly code .
The C backend violates the ABI of common C++ programs , preventing intermixing between C++ compiled by the CBE and C++ code compiled with llc or native compilers .
The C backend does not support all exception handling constructs .
llvm - gcc does not currently support Link - Time Optimization on most platforms " out - of - the - box " .
Please inquire on the llvmdev mailing list if you are interested .
The only major language feature of GCC not supported by llvm - gcc is the __builtin_apply family of builtins .
However , some extensions are only supported on some targets .
For example , trampolines are only supported on some targets ( these are used when you take the address of a nested function ) .
If you run into GCC extensions which are not supported , please let us know .
The C++ front - end is considered to be fully tested and works for a number of non-trivial programs , including LLVM itself , Qt , Mozilla , etc. Exception handling works well on the X86 and PowerPC targets , including X86 - 64 darwin .
This works when linking to a libstdc ++ compiled by GCC .
It is supported on X86 - 64 linux , but that is disabled by default in this release .

The funniest thing of all : Like you other ladies , I always identified with Daria on the female level -
but then I discovered the big secret .
Daria is a man !
Seriously !
I went to college with the son of the guy who made Daria , and he WAS Daria , down to every detail .
EVERY detail .
Tone of voice , sense of humour , glasses , the works .
The whole show , I think , was based on the creator 's son .
First I felt betrayed by my cartoon heroine , then realized that I had actually met her , but just in the male flesh .
Weird , huh ?

Well if you 're reading this , you already know it 's you .
I walked into the lab today because of chronic diarrhea , and they called you specifically to take care of my case .
You were so cute when you said I had abnormally huge taste buds .
When you said you had to have another look at the back of my throat , it was obvious you just wanted to see their freaky fatness once more , and I called you on it .
You then turned completely red , and I do n't know if it was because of my grossly exaggerated yet founded accusations or because I was n't wearing a bra and you left me waiting for like 45 minutes in an industrial AC powered office .
You 're gonna be growing five different cultures from my stool in the next week and I have no idea , despite all my funk and resourcefulness , how to make the idea of giving me a call after work seem inspiring .
Between all these questions you 're asking me , all of which are related to my loose bowel movements , and the fact that you could lose your license if you got together with a patient , there is just no way I can slip you my number .
I do n't really know what to do .
I think I 'm gonna try to run into you at the end of your internship at this hospital .
I hear if it 's not in an office , there is no law to prevent me hitting on you , and you taking it up .
If you 're not gay that is - cause you sort of give off that kind of vibe too .
But if you 're not , where is my highest chance of running into you completely by chance , one morning when I 'm not your patient and you 're not my hot , out - of - bounds microbiologist ?

Screenshot of Mark Bunker from one of his YouTube postings
Two well - known critics of Scientology have had their user accounts on the video sharing website YouTube suspended .
The YouTube accounts of both Tory Christman and Mark Bunker were suspended this week .
In a statement to Wikinews , YouTube explained why accounts are suspended , but did not specifically state why these particular accounts were suspended .
Neither Christman nor Bunker received a notice or explanation from YouTube as to why their accounts were suspended .
On Tuesday April 15 , Tory Christman a former Scientologist and volunteer for their Office of Special Affairs , and known as ToryMagoo44 on YouTube , had her account suspended for unknown reasons .
On Wednesday , after complaints to YouTube from other YouTube users and from members of the group Anonymous , Christman 's account was restored .
Wikinews confirmed Friday that Mark Bunker known as ' xenutv1 ' on YouTube , a television journalist and critic of Scientology , had his user account suspended .
This is the second time that Bunker 's account was suspended .
He was formerly known as ' xenutv ' when his account was suspended the first time .
" I want to see the complaint and on what grounds did YouTube suspend my account .
I have done nothing on that account that would violate any of their terms and my videos and account should not have been pulled .
The only caveat to this is my first account " XenuTV " was suspended a while back for a Stephen Colbert video I had from Comedy Central .
At that time I created XenuTV1 and according to YouTube 's terms you can only have one account .
Any time I have ever been asked to remove something that may violate their terms for copyright materials , I comply immediately .
It would be wrong and a misuse of power to pull my account because of this lone loophole in their terms , " said Bunker exclusively to Wikinews .
I want to see the complaint and on what grounds did YouTube suspend my account .
— Mark Bunker
Bunker , who is also the owner of the anti-Scientology website www.xenutv.com, has become known as Wise Beard Man to Anonymous .
He was interviewed by Wikinews in February .
Bunker started XenuTV in 1999 and began to make videos that he provided for the Lisa McPherson Trust .
Bunker has been a critic of the Church of Scientology since 1997 .
In 2006 , he won a Regional Emmy Award after he and KUSI - TV news reporter Lena Lewis produced a documentary news video on the issues with the United States - Mexico border with San Diego , California .
With permission from Christman , Bunker responded to his account 's suspension with a video post to her YouTube channel on Thursday .
Bunker stated : " This afternoon at 2:41 , I found out YouTube canceled my account .
No justification was given to me , I got no notice from them , and there appears to be no recourse .
And why did this happen ?
Because the Jason Beghe interview was about to be posted - and Scientology did not want anyone to see that .
My tease for the Jason Beghe interview went up on Sunday , and by this afternoon we had almost six hundred thousand views , and it had been profiled in newscasts around the world .
There is a lot of tension being drawn to this video , and Scientology wanted to stop it . "
Jason Beghe is a television and film actor who joined Scientology in 1994 .
He gave USD1 million to the Church of Scientology over the years , and told Roger Friedman of FOX News that Scientology head David Miscavige called him " the poster boy for Scientology " .
Beghe appeared in promotional videos for Scientology in 2005 .
In April 2008 he left Scientology , and contacted Andreas Heldal - Lund , who put him in touch with Mark Bunker .
Bunker arranged an interview with Beghe , which was uploaded to Bunker 's YouTube account on April 7 .
The posted video is a 3 - minute portion of a larger 3 - hour interview with Beghe about his criticism of Scientology .
In the video Beghe states : " Scientology is destructive and a rip - off . ...
It ’s very , very dangerous for your spiritual , psychological , mental , emotional health and evolution . "
In an interview with Wikinews , Tory Christman commented on the suspension of her account , and now Bunker 's : " Well having worked for the Office of Special Affairs which is part of the Church of Scientology , they used to have me go out and open up phony accounts , I did n't know they were stopping free speech on the net but once I realized that ...
I said ' I can't do this , I did n't get into Scientology to stop free speech ' .
...
I 'm pretty sure , you know , I 'm quite sure , that it 's Scientology .
That 's what they do , that 's their view is just ' shut em down ' they have no morals on it or anything .
They just figure ' screw em , shut em down ' . "
Christman said she found out her YouTube account had been suspended on Tuesday : " I came back from lunch at four and Mark called me and said ' Do you know your account is suspended ? ' , and by the morning of yesterday it was back up . "
I would like to know , why was it suspended , why is Mark 's suspended , what are the violations .
— Tory Christman
When asked if she had received a notice about the suspension from YouTube , Christman responded : " I never got anything , and I 've looked through everything , I never got any kind of a notice , either way .
... I never heard from YouTube either way - suspending it , or putting it back .
And I 've written them , and it was only put back thanks to Anonymous and all the critics and people that wrote in to them , I 'm quite sure - Because tons of people did , it was n't like they just put it back up . "
" I would like to know , why was it suspended , why is Mark 's suspended , what are the violations , okay , because if the Church of Scientology is just paying them off that 's kind of weird , is n't it ? , " added Christman .
Wikinews asked Christman if she knew if the suspension of Bunker 's account had anything to do with the interview with Jason Beghe : " Why Jason 's video was pulled , I do n't know , and I 've spoken to Jason and he did n't know either . "
She told Wikinews : " I would like to know why .
Someone should have a right to be told ' you are screwing up on this , remove this video ' ... ' change it ' .
But to never be notified and then just you 're suspended , that 's kind of weird , I think .
And I have every intention of either , YouTube can contact me , or I 'm going to keep contacting ... they need to let the people know what is going on . "
YouTube takes these issues very seriously but we do n't comment on individual videos .
— Press Office spokesperson , YouTube
A YouTube spokeswoman told Wikinews that they would respond to our e-mails " as soon as possible . "
Within two hours YouTube issued a statement to Wikinews saying that they " do not comment on individual videos . "
" You Tube takes these issues very seriously but we do n't comment on individual videos .
Our general approach is simple : we have clear content policies about what videos are allowed on the site .
For example we prohibit clips that infringe copyright or show extreme violence .
Videos that breach these rules are removed and we disable all accounts belonging to repeat offenders , " said a spokesperson for YouTube .
When asked , YouTube did not state when or if Bunker 's account will be reinstated .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraq on Tuesday condemned Turkey ’s incursion into northern Iraq to fight Kurdish guerrillas in the strongest terms so far and demanded an immediate end to the violation of its sovereignty .
The Turkish troops crossed the border last Thursday to root out PKK fighters who have used mountainous northern Iraq as a base for their fight for self - rule in the mainly Kurdish southeast of Turkey since the 1990s .
“ The cabinet expressed its rejection and condemnation for the Turkish military interference , which is considered a violation of Iraq ’s sovereignty , ” the Iraqi government said in a statement released by spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh .
“ The cabinet stresses that unilateral military action is not acceptable and threatens good relations between the two neighbors . ”
Dabbagh said earlier on Tuesday that a Turkish envoy would meet Iraqi President Jalal Talabani , a Kurd , and government leaders including Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari in Baghdad on Wednesday .
Turkish troops , backed by warplanes and artillery , have been fighting Kurdish guerrillas at close quarters as they advance on a Kurdistan Workers ’ Party ( PKK ) base .
The Turkish General Staff has said the total PKK death toll in the offensive has risen to 153 , and that 17 of its own soldiers have been killed .
PKK claims that 81 Turkish troops have been killed could not be verified .
See here where Fake Steve Jobs compares Java to Lotus Notes .
Flippant .
But yet …Java is two different things : a platform and a language .
Both are going to survive for a good long time in BigCo .
They too deeply en-snarled in BigCo ’s internals to be excised in a single stroke .
And like Notes , Java ’s corporate parent is n’t doing so well .
No surprise , Java simultaneously commoditizes hardware and operating systems , leaving professional services as the only way to make money from it .
Hopefully , SUNW — oops , I meant JAVA — will continue to do better with Java the language and / or platform than IBM has done with Notes p.s .
Yes , you ( I mean you ! ) have written great stuff with Java .
Why not ?
You are a programmer , it is a programming language , you can write anything you want with it .
And there were people who did good things with Notes in its day .
I respect you for it , even honour you for it .
But do n’t take it personally when I try to look at the big picture and ask where the platform is going and whether it looks like anything we ’ve seen before .p.p.s.
I ’ve heard from a number of people asking why I am implying that Sun and IBM are n’t doing so well , when they are thriving in a certain sense .
I posted the share price for a reason : a privately held company exists for whatever reason its shareholders deem appropriate , such as employing people or building great products .
A publicly held company , OTOH , has one and only one overriding mandate : returns for its investors , either through dividends or through share appreciation .
Over the last five years , Sun has done better than IBM .
At the moment , 100 % better .
So if I were a JAVA shareholder , I would want to be very sure that Sun has a business plan to do something differently .
And when picking a platform , I want to be sure that its parent is n’t going to wake up one day and ask , “ So why are we doing this , exactly ? ”
If what 's keeping you from buying your own personal ultralight aircraft is lack of garage space and a USB plug on the plane 's dash for your iPod — you are certainly in luck .
Los Angeles startup ICON
Aircraft this week unveiled its A5 ultralight " sport plane , " which the company hopes will open a new market made up of amateur pilots zipping around the skies with style .
Concept art — what , no reflective black effect ?
Yes , you see , in 2004 the US Federal Aviation Administration created a new classification of Sport Pilot licenses that only requires 20 hours of in - flight training , no medical check , and half the cost of a traditional private pilot 's license .
With the piloting bar set to an unprecedented low ( not seen since they let a couple of bicycle repairmen tool around Kitty Hawk , North Carolina ) companies such as ICON are looking to get rich .
" Son , let me tell you something : Fuck hiking . "
ICON focuses on special touches that are time - tested to appeal to the mass market — namely looking good and not killing the operator .
The two - seater A5 includes an " intuitive , " sports car - like cockpit with a MP3 player port , runs on both auto and aviation gasoline , and sports retractable wings that make the plane fit snugly in a large garage .
It 's also got safety kit such as a propeller guard and a whole - airframe parachute for those times when finding a landing strip is too damn inconvenient .
Should have saved up for the gas
Fold@Home
ICON CEO Kirk Hawkings says the aircraft brings the " freedom , fun and adventure back into aviation . "
[ Note : apparently at some point , piloting a regular personal aircraft has become — yawn — way too boring . ]
The plane starts at $ 139,000 with initial models scheduled to be delivered in late 2010 .
That 's assuming things go well when the full - scale prototype begins flight tests this summer .
Look to the sky — if you see a ball of screaming death and fire plummeting from above you 'll know it 's time to seek a refund on the required $ 5,000 deposit .
There 's more about the plane at Popular Mechanics including a video of its unveiling .
( Warning : Audience comments about the plane such as " This would be perfect for the Bahamas , " will make you extremely bitter if you are going home to a studio apartment and peanut butter sandwich dinner . ) ®
WASHINGTON , May 30 — The Supreme Court declared today , in a ruling affecting millions of government employees , that the Constitution does not always protect their free - speech rights for what they say on the job .
In a 5 - to - 4 decision , the court held that public employees ' free - speech rights are protected when they speak out as citizens on matters of public concern , but not when they speak out in the course of their official duties .
Today 's ruling , involving a deputy Los Angeles district attorney who contended that he had been denied a promotion for challenging the legitimacy of a search warrant , came in a case that has been closely watched not just by public workers but by those who have worried that it could discourage internal whistle - blowers from speaking up about government misconduct and inefficiency .
" We hold that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties , the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes , and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline , " Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court .
