Kelly Osbourne Enters Rehab
, the 24 year old daughter of Ozzy andhas checked herself into a Los Angeles rehab facility for a planned 30 day stay .
Her London rep told People magazine , " Kelly Osbourne has voluntarily entered a medical facility to address some personal issues .
Her family stands by and supports her . "
Sharon Osbourne told RadarOnline.com , " Yeah , Kelly 's in rehab .
What else can we say ?
She knew that it was the right thing to do at this point and we 're proud that she did it .
The family is all standing behind her .
Kelly knew that she needed help and she 's getting it .
We just pray that everything 's going to be ok . "
Kelly , who was treated five years ago for an addiction to painkillers , turned herself in to police earlier this week to answer charges that she slapped a reporter last summer .
Her first court appearance on that charge is slated for March .
We wish Kelly the very best with her recovery efforts .

STOCKHOLM – The Pirate Bay prosecutor altered the copyright - infringement charges Tuesday to make it easier to convict the four defendants who co-founded the world 's most notorious BitTorrent tracker .
Moments later , Hollywood investigators testified about the ease with which they obtained copyright works using the 5 - year - old site .
But at the outset of Tuesday 's proceedings , the prosecutor , Håkan
Roswall , announced a alteration of the charges , which legal scholars suggested would make it more likely to win a conviction .
The prosecutor removed one sentence from the part of his summons where the purported crimes are described .
Until Tuesday , it read :
" The Pirate Bay consists of three sub - components : an index portal in the form of a website with search functionality , a database with related directory containing the torrent files , and a tracker feature .
The tracker feature creates a ' peer - to - peer ' network of users who want to share the same file .
All components are necessary for the users of the service to share files between them . "
In the altered version , he removed the concluding sentence starting with " All components . "
Daniel Westman , a legal scholar at " The Swedish Law and Informatics
Research Institute " at Stockholm University , suggested the prosecutor likely feels uncertain that he can prove all three elements .
" The question is whether the defendants fulfill the requirements in the penal code for complicity in a crime .
One could maybe argue that the degree of complicity were higher if all three components could be proven , but the court may as well decide that only one or two is enough , " Westman said .
The crowd at the Pirate Bay trial here was noticeably smaller when the proceedings continued Tuesday after being dark Monday .
Last week , there were overflowing hordes of onlookers when the four Pirate Bay defendants took the stand in the trial 's opening days .
Apparently in the same clothing as Friday , the defendants sat in the back of the courtroom flanked by their lawyers , while two piracy busters who gathered evidence of illegal file sharing took the witness stand .
Magnus Mårtensson , a lawyer for the International Federation of Phonographic Industries — the worldwide counterpart of the Recording Industry Association of America — testified he visited The Pirate Bay site and looked for " Intensive Care " by Robbie Williams , downloaded the torrent file and started his copy of BitTorrent client Azureus .
He showed the courtroom screen shots of the beginning of the download and after it had finished .
He testified it was the copyright property of EMI .
Anders Nilsson , a former police officer now working for the Anti-Piracy Bureau , seemed technically savvier and displayed to the gallery fuller printouts of activities and peers for various downloads .
Defense lawyer Per E. Samuelson went through the Robbie Williams case in detail and pointed out that someone with a nickname " russiananorak " had uploaded the torrent .
When asked if Mårtensson or IFPI had done anything to find this uploader or any of the four peers that he downloaded the work from , the answer was " No . "
The same answer was given to similar questions put to Nilsson .
It was all part of the Pirate Bay defendants ' defense :
The 5 - year - old site with about 22 million users does n't infringe copyrighted works , but rather points the way to where chunks of files of copyright works can be accumulated and automatically assembled into full copies of copyright material .
Pirate Bay co-founders Fredrik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg , Peter
Sunde and Carl Lundström face up to two years in prison each , in addition to fines as high as $ 180,000 .
But the stated defense might not help the four skirt Swedish law .
The four defendants are not accused of committing copyright infringement directly .
They are accused of " complicity in a crime " through facilitating copyright infringement .
The case against the Pirate Bay is not Sweden 's only battle against file sharing .
The Swedish Parliament is expected to adopt a proposal on Wednesday that , for the first time , would make it possible for rights holders to force ISPs to hand out information about their subscribers , so they can be sued for copyright infringement .
" It will make it possible for wealthy industries to act as a private police force and bankrupt ordinary families with children , just like in neighboring Denmark , " said Christian Engstrom , a Pirate Party candidate for the EU Parliament .
Over the weekend , three Lund University sociology scholars wrote in the op - ed pages of Sweden 's largest daily , Dagens Nyheter , that 75 percent of Sweden 's youth does not care what the law says about illegal downloading .
They predicted a general erosion of support for the legal system if laws are too far removed from the opinions of the masses .
The Pirate Bay , meanwhile , celebrated a public relations victory of sorts late Friday when it was awarded the Freedom Prize of 2008 by the Stockholm section of the Moderate Youth Party .
Trial continues Wednesday , when John Kennedy , the IFPI international chairman and CEO , is expected to testify .

And in time - honored fashion , the Bush administration used its last two months in office to rush through a series of regulatory changes .
In equally time - honored fashion , Rahm Emanuel , President Obama ’s chief of staff , has ordered all agencies and departments to review these rules and , where possible , suspend or stop the ones they do n’t like .
Any rules that were not completed by Jan. 20 can simply be withdrawn or rewritten .
Those that have become law can be undone in three ways , all laborious .
One is to undertake a new rule - making process  preliminary proposals , public comment and hearings , a final proposal , etc.  which could take months or even years .
The second is to ask Congress to revoke the rule under the rarely used Congressional Review Act .
The third is to wait for an outside group to bring suit , then step aside and not defend the rule in court .
Here is a selection of last - minute rules that in our view are worth overturning one way or another .

If you , or your loved one , were recently diagnosed with aortic stenosis , I imagine you might have several questions about this heart valve disorder .
Many patients and caregivers often ask me , " What is aortic stenosis ? " , " Is my heart valve narrow ? " , " How can aortic valve stenosis impact my heart ? " , " What are the symptoms ? " , " Can it be life threatening ? " and " How is it treated ? "
As a former patient that required aortic valve replacement surgery due to this disease , I recently filmed this video with Dr. Marc Gillinov , a leading cardiac surgeon from the Cleveland Clinic and co-author of Heart 411 , to help you learn about aortic stenosis .
What Is Aortic Stenosis ?
In the simplest terms , this heart valve disorder is a condition in which your aortic valve has become narrowed .
When a valve becomes narrow , or stenotic , it can negatively impact the flow of blood through the heart and the body .
There are many different causes of of this disease including congenital birth defects , infections , and degenerative conditions ( like aging ) .
Aortic Valve Stenosis
So you know , normal aortic valves have three tissue leaflets ( or flaps ) .
These leaflets open - and - close like " swinging doors " managing bloodflow .
Valves with stenosis , however , are rigid and fail to " swing " properly .
Over time , this can lead to many complications for the patient -- including atrial fibrillation , an enlarged heart and congestive heart failure .
Anatomy of Aortic Stenosis
To better understand the patient risks from this disease , it might help to learn about the anatomy of the aortic valve .
During my research , prior to surgery , I learned that the aortic valve is located between the left ventricle , or lower chamber of the heart , and the largest artery , the aorta .
The left ventricle pumps oxygen - rich blood into the aorta , which carries blood to the brain and the rest of the body .
When the aortic valve becomes stenotic , the ability of the left ventricle to pump blood out of the heart to the aorta and other arteries is compromised .
Your organs no longer receive a sufficient supply of oxygen - rich blood .
Plus , blood can " back up " into the lungs , causing shortness of breath .
By evolutionary design , the aortic leaflets should open - and - close with a tight seal .
Much like the plumbing valves in your home ( which control the flow of water through pipes ) , the aortic valve controls the flow of blood through your heart .
When the left ventricle contracts , the aortic valve opens .
This allows blood to flow out of the left ventricle and into the aorta .
When the heart relaxes between contractions , the aortic valve closes .
This prevents blood in the aorta from returning to the left ventricle .
Interestingly , many patients diagnosed with this condition were born with a bicuspid aortic valve .
A bicuspid aortic valve is a congenital heart valve defect in which the aortic valve has only two leaflets , not three ( shown below ) .
Other causes of this disorder include rheumatic heart disease , infection and other congenital issues .
As I personally experienced , aortic valve stenosis often results from " calcification " in which calcium deposits in the blood build up on and inside the valve .
Ultimately , a calcified aortic valve with stenosis lacks flexibility , creating additional stress on the cardiac muscle .
What Are Aortic Stenosis Symptoms ?
Patients with a narrow valve can be symptomatic or asymptomatic .
During my research , I reviewed several resources from the Cleveland Clinic , the Mayo Clinic and the American Heart Association , which identified these common symptoms :
Shortness of breath , especially during exercise or when you lying down
Fatigue , especially during times of exercise
Coughing , especially when lying down
Heart palpitations , flutters , sensations of a rapid heartbeat
Swollen feet or swollen ankles
Heart murmurs
Excessive urination
Chest pain or chest tightness
Feeling faint or fainting
Dizziness
While the above - referenced symptoms are common , it is critical to note that patients with this type of valvular disease can be asymptomatic .
Personally , I only experienced one symptom prior to seeking help .
Upon the results of my echocardiogram , I learned that my heart valve condition was severe and my left ventricle was already enlarged .
Is Aortic Stenosis Harmful To Your Health ?
The immediate answer to that question is ...
Yes .
Over time , as aortic valve stenosis progresses , the amount of blood ejected from the left ventricle ( the ejection fraction value ) is reduced .
This can have multiple effects upon the human heart .
The left ventricle of the heart can thicken , or get stronger , to compensate for the increased efforts needed to pump blood through the body .
The medical term for this condition is cardiomegaly , although most patients will hear that their hearts are enlarged or dilated .
At first , this helps overcome aortic valve stenosis .
However , over time , the left ventricle progressively increases in diameter , stiffens , and gradually loses its ability to generate enough force to compensate for aortic valve stenosis .
Patients can develop abnormal heart rhythms such as atrial fibrillation .
Congestive heart failure .
Needless to say , this type of heart disease is very dangerous .
For this reason , I recently met with Dr. Junaid Khan , a leading cardiac surgeon at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center , to learn more about this valvular disorder .
To further emphasize the potential risks of this condition , please consider :
A recent study published in The Journal of American College of Cardiology found that within just 3 years of the onset of symptoms , 75 % of patients are dead unless the disorder is surgically treated .
A study by Dr. Ross Braunwald found that 50 % of patients died within two years of symptom manifestation unless surgically treated .
For these reasons , I strongly encourage patients to get regular check - ups to monitor cardiac function if they ( i ) experience the symptoms referenced above , ( ii ) have a heart murmur , or ( iii ) have been previously diagnosed with a stenotic aortic valve .
Are There Different Types Of This Valve Disorder ?
Like most heart disorders , there are varying degress of diagnosis .
The most common categories of this condition are mild , moderate and severe .
Typically , patients with mild or moderate stenosis do not require surgical treatment .
However , if mild or moderate stenosis remains untreated and progesses into a severe diagnosis , the left ventricle can dilate resulting in many complications that could require aortic valve repair or aortic valve replacement surgery .
While a stethoscope can detect this type of heart disease , an echocardiogram can best determine the severity of the aortic valve disorder .
If you are curious , the key determinants for classifying aortic valve stenosis are valve area , aortic velocity and mean pressure gradient .
Other tests used to diagnose the diseasee include a transesophageal echocardiogram ( TEE ) , an angiogram ( cardiac catheterization ) , radionuclide scans and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .

With the Mormon church having poured money into getting gay marriage somehow illegal in California , you might be wondering what the highest - profile Mormon celebrity might be feeling .
Naturally , Donny Osmond is n't going to upset his church , is he , opening a page on his website to explain his stance on gay people who consider themselves to be married .
( Nice to see him approaching the question with an open mind . )
Do n't run away with the idea that just because he feels he has the right to tell them what to do , he 's in any way homophobic :
There are many gay individuals that are members of our church .
I know many of them .
In fact , some of my best friends are gay .
You ask how I react regarding their marriages .
Well , I do support our Church leaders who say that we can accept those with gay tendencies in our church as long as they do not act upon their temptations .
Everyone has tenancies to succumb to temptation , but we all have the same standard given to us by our Father in Heaven .
Whether we may be tempted to be immoral with members of our own sex or of the opposite sex , we are expected to live chaste lives .
This is very well explained not only in the Book of Mormon , but in the Bible as well .
We all determine for ourselves what is right and what is not right for our own lives and how we live God 's commandments .
I am not a judge and I will never judge anyone for the decisions they make unless they are causing harm to another individual .
I love my friends , including my gay friends .
We are all God 's children .
It is their choice , not mine on how they conduct their lives and choose to live the commandments according to the dictates of their own conscience .
We warn that individuals who violate covenants of chastity , who abuse spouse or offspring , or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God .
Further , we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals , communities , and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets .
We call upon responsible citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society .
Of course some of your best friends are gay , Donny .
We all know you 're not having a go at individual people , just an amorphous ' other ' , right ?
But how can you have gay people in church : does n't that somehow threaten all that is holy ?
Aha !
How generous .
Providing you do n't actually be gay , you 're fine .
Right .
But let 's say that someone chooses to live their lives by their own moral code , rather than a book that you might find in a drawer in a Courtyard by Marriott ; what then , Donny ?
That - although not actually answering the question about gay marriage - seems fair enough .
Except Donny arrives at this conclusion after running this extract from a Mormon executive :
So he seems to be saying if people want to get married , that 's great , it 's up to them , providing nobody else gets hurt ... oh , which they will , because it will bring down calamities on the nations .
It 's not so much that Osmond is happy to pretend he 's friends with gays while actually suggesting that for them to fall in love is a security risk , it 's that he tries to seem like he 's reasonable while doing the equivalent of writing a post that says ' up to you ' underneath a photo of a man holding a ' sodomites will kill us all ' .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Bernard Madoff , a quiet force on Wall Street for decades , was arrested and charged on Thursday with allegedly running a $ 50 billion “ Ponzi scheme ” in what may rank among the biggest fraud cases ever .
The former chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market is best known as the founder of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC , the closely - held market - making firm he launched in 1960 .
But he also ran a hedge fund that U.S. prosecutors said racked up $ 50 billion of fraudulent losses .
Madoff told senior employees of his firm on Wednesday that “ it ’s all just one big lie ” and that it was “ basically , a giant Ponzi scheme , ” with estimated investor losses of about $ 50 billion , according to the U.S. Attorney ’s criminal complaint against him .
A Ponzi scheme is a swindle offering unusually high returns , with early investors paid off with money from later investors .
On Thursday , two agents for the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation entered Madoff ’s New York apartment .
“ There is no innocent explanation , ” Madoff said , according to the criminal complaint .
He told the agents that it was all his fault , and that he “ paid investors with money that was n’t there , ” according to the complaint .
The $ 50 billion allegedly lost would make the hedge fund one of the biggest frauds in history .
When former energy trading giant Enron filed for bankruptcy in 2001 , one of the largest at the time , it had $ 63.4 billion in assets .
U.S. prosecutors charged Madoff , 70 , with a single count of securities fraud .
They said he faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 5 million .
The Securities and Exchange Commission filed separate civil charges against Madoff .
“ Our complaint alleges a stunning fraud -- both in terms of scope and duration , ” said Scott Friestad , the SEC ’s deputy enforcer .
“ We are moving quickly and decisively to stop the scheme and protect the remaining assets for investors . ”
Dan Horwitz , Madoff ’s lawyer , told reporters outside a downtown Manhattan courtroom where he was charged , “ Bernard Madoff is a longstanding leader in the financial services industry .
We will fight to get through this unfortunate set of events . ”
A shaken Madoff stared at the ground as reporters peppered him with questions .
He was released after posting a $ 10 million bond secured by his Manhattan apartment .
Authorities , citing a document filed by Madoff with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on January 7 , 2008 , said Madoff ’s investment advisory business served between 11 and 25 clients and had a total of about $ 17.1 billion in assets under management .
Those clients may have included other funds that in turn had many investors .
The SEC said it appeared that virtually all of the assets of his hedge fund business were missing .
CONSISTENT RETURNS
An investor in the hedge fund said it generated consistent returns , which was part of the attraction .
Since 2004 , annual returns averaged around 8 percent and ranged from 7.3 percent to 9 percent , but last decade returns were typically in the low - double digits , the investor said .
The fund told investors it followed a “ split strike conversion ” strategy , which entailed owning stock and buying and selling options to limit downside risk , said the investor , who requested anonymity .
Jon Najarian , an acquaintance of Madoff who has traded options for decades , said “ Many of us questioned how that strategy could generate those kinds of returns so consistently . ”
Najarian , co-founder of optionmonster.com , once tried to buy what was then the Cincinnati Stock Exchange when Madoff was a major seatholder on the exchange .
Najarian met with Madoff , who rejected his bid .
“ He always seemed to be a straight shooter .
I was shocked by this news , ” Najarian said .
‘ LOCK AND KEY ’
Madoff had long kept the financial statements for his hedge fund business under “ lock and key , ” according to prosecutors , and was “ cryptic ” about the firm .
The hedge fund business was located on a separate floor from the market - making business .
Madoff has been conducting a Ponzi scheme since at least 2005 , the U.S. said .
Around the first week of December , Madoff told a senior employee that hedge fund clients had requested about $ 7 billion of their money back , and that he was struggling to pay them .
Investors have been pulling money out of hedge funds , even those performing well , in an effort to reduce risk in their portfolios as the global economy weakens .
The fraud alleged here could further encourage investors to pull money from hedge funds .
“ This is a major blow to confidence that is already shattered -- anyone on the fence will probably try to take their money out , ” said Doug Kass , president of hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management .
Kass noted that investors that put in requests to withdraw their money can subsequently decide to leave it in the fund if they wish .
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities has more than $ 700 million in capital , according to its website .
Madoff remains a member of Nasdaq OMX Group Inc ’s nominating committee , and his firm is a market maker for about 350 Nasdaq stocks , including Apple , EBay and Dell , according to the website .
The website also states that Madoff himself has “ a personal interest in maintaining the unblemished record of value , fair - dealing , and high ethical standards that has always been the firm ’s hallmark . ”

Hello
Here is the latest Caml Weekly News , for the week of January 06 to 13 , 2009 .
Parsing simple type expressions
Archive : http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/a31a92422ece14d9#
For a serializer I 'm writing I need to parse simple OCaml type expressions composed by OCaml basic types , tuples , options and lists .
Given a string like " ( int * string option ) list " and this type : type types = | Int | String | Float | Char | Bool | Option of types |
List of types |
Tuple of types list the function I need should return something like List ( Tuple ( [ Int ; Option ( String ) ] ) )
Before starting with low level sscanf functions I looked at the Genlex module , but it was n't so inspiring .
Then I tried with Camlp4 but the documentation does n't really shine :-)
So is there a simple way to write this function using some standard module ?
This is pretty easy with Camlp4 , although as you say there is n't much in the docs to point the way .
You might take a look at how orpc does it -- see the parse_type function in http://code.google.com/p/orpc2/source/browse/trunk/src/generator/parse.ml
( I 'm going to cover using Camlp4 in this way on the blog I posted yesterday , but not for another week or two . )
You might also look at some other Camlp4 - based serialization tools , like bin-prot / type-conv at http://www.ocaml.info/home/ocaml_sources.html
> ocamlyacc - you can get most of it for free out of parsing / parser.mly in the > OCaml sources ... the section on type expressions starts at line 1144 for > OCaml 3.11.0 .
Our json - wheel library is a complete example : http://martin.jambon.free.fr/json-wheel.html
Thanks , Matthieu and Jake , this is exactly what I had in mind .
At the end , Camlp4 was the right solution to my simple problem , as I suspected from the beginning .
Camlp4 is an extremely powerful tool and it's a pity it could n't be used by everyone for lack of documentation .
What is really needed , in my opinion , is a description of * what * one can do with Camlp4 without being an expert .
For example a list of all syntax extension available out of the box might spread the use of Camlp4 among common programmers .
Searching in the source code I can see things named : Camlp4 ExceptionTracer , Camlp4FoldGenerator , Camlp4MetaGenerator , and so on .
The names sounds great but ... what is it ?
The source code is cryptic to every " regular " OCaml programmer like me .
The same considerations apply to all the ( many ! ) libraries available and related to Camlp4 .
What is needed to spread the use of this tool are some ... recipes , like those available for ocamlbuild in its wiki pages .
Jane Street is hiring ...
Archive : http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/87c6fcea57a8dff1#
Greetings all .
I just wanted to remind people that Jane Street is still hiring .
Despite the problems besetting much of the financial industry , we have grown strongly in the last few years in our people , our technology , the scope of our business and its profitability .
We now have over 30 OCaml developers , and we are actively looking to hire more in Tokyo , London and New York .
For someone who cares about functional programming , Jane Street is an interesting place to consider .
Jane Street has invested deeply in OCaml , to the point where we now have the largest team of OCaml programmers in any industrial setting , and probably the world 's largest OCaml codebase -- almost a million lines .
We really believe in functional programming , and use OCaml for everything from research to systems adminstration to trading systems .
The atmosphere is informal and intellectual , with a focus on learning .
The work itself is deeply challenging , and you get to see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms .
Jane Street is also a small enough place that people have the freedom to get involved in many different areas of the business .
Unlike many financial firms , software and technology are considered a core part of what we do , not some segmented - off cost center that the people who run the business do n't think about .
Jane Street is a place where people really care about the quality of the software , to the point that several of the most senior members of the firm , who do not have technology backgrounds , nonetheless review critical portions of the codebase before they can go into production .
If you 'd like to learn more , here are some links .
First , here 's a paper I wrote for the Monad Reader : http://www.haskell.org/sitewiki/images/0/03/TMR-Issue7.pdf
We also have a technically - oriented blog : http://ocaml.janestreet.com
For a ( recruiting - oriented ) overview of Jane Street , here 's the firm website : http://janestreet.com

I would like to now if anyone has or knows of functional implementations of priority ( aka Min , aka Max ) heaps .
Specifically I am looking for : Fibonacci , Brodal and relaxed heaps [ 1 ] with fast insert and deletes .
Any literature or implementation in Haskell or F# are also welcome .
I also would appreciate any additional comments on implementation issues and experience with heaps that may help me .

Oscar nominations were announced Wednesday , leaving many fanboys grumbling in its wake .
After months of media hyping , after rave reviews from critics and fellow filmmakers alike , after a passionate grassroots campaign and an enthusiastic push from Warner Bros …
The academy gave no serious consideration to The Dark Knight after all , despite its 8 ( mostly technical ) nominations .
No Best Director , no Best Adapted Screenplay , and no Best Picture .
The Dark Knight has a Tomatometer rating of 94 % , placing it above nominees Milk ( 93 % ) , The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( 72 % ) , Frost / Nixon ( 91 % ) and The Reader ( 60 % ) .
The favorite to win , Slumdog Millionaire , leads only by a small margin with 95 % .
With such critical acceptance , surely it deserves to at least be recognized by the academy ?
The Dark Knight also graced many Top Ten lists and even scored noms at DGA , WGA and PGA 's respective awards .
So where ’s the Oscar love , y’all ?
Even The Dark Knight ’s rivals are among the many Hollywood insiders who found the snub unexpected .
Both Milk producer Michael London and Benjamin Button producer Frank Marshall expressed genuine surprise that they would n’t be competing against Batman .
“ The fact that The Dark Knight did so well at the box office was probably a good thing and maybe a not - so - good thing , ” Marshall said to AP .
“ People tend to think films as successful as that are not well made , but certainly , Dark Knight is exceptionally well made . ”
“ People were surprised The Reader got the fifth slot instead of Dark Knight , ” Michael London told the LA Times .
“ That seemed to be the biggest surprise .
People are talking about it .
I do n’t know what it means .
I love The Dark Knight .
It was a fantastic movie , but I suppose it ’s difficult for successful popcorn movies to get serious attention from the academy .
It ’s a knee - jerk thing where smaller movies are perceived as more artistic . ”
There may be some truth to that , sure — but I do n’t think such stigma applies this time .
Not to the The Dark Knight , anyway , considering its near - universal acclaim .
There ’s no reason why voters would be hesitant to pick a movie hailed as a worthy nomination by not just the public , but critics as well .
Furthermore , there ’s a considerable overlap of voters between the academy and the DGA , PGA and WGA — three union groups that nominated The Dark Knight .
Why did those DGA members choose Chris Nolan as one of the year 's best directors , yet forget him come Oscar time ?
The answer to that question is perhaps linked to another question :
Why is it that Oscar contenders are always so middling , so predictably easy to lump together into a certain dramatic tone ?
Believe it or not , it might be a simple case of mathematics ...
Variety ’s Timothy Gray wrote this boggling expose that tries to explain the academy ’s ballot counting system in an oversimplification that already sounds like a headache .
He ’s right , this is just as — if not more — convoluted than the college electoral process .
For example , there are 375 voting members in the directors branch .
The accountants take that 375 number and divide it by six — i.e. , the number of eventual nominees ( five ) plus one .
The division yields the number 62 — and then you add one , so that ’s 63 .
( There ’s a reason for adding these ones , but do n’t worry about it . )
The accountants then take all 375 director ballots and go through only the first choices , putting each helmer - contender into his / her own stack .
When a contender hits 63 first - place votes , he has enough for a nomination .
Anyone who voted for this director gets his ballot set aside , and none of the voter ’s other choices is tallied .
The reason is to make sure that every voice is heard .
It ’s possible , but not likely , that when the first round of voting concludes , there are five contenders who got 63 votes .
If not , the [ team at counting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers ] take the remaining ballots and go through people ’s second choices , to see who gets enough votes in this round .
One caveat : A contender has to receive at least one first - place vote .
The thinking is that if a person got zero first - place finishes , maybe he does n’t deserve a nomination .
How many people understood this method ?
Did the voters even know about this ?
It would be logical to assume that all five of your choices are counted , but it would be a mistake .
What this means is that it ’s entirely possible for all of the academy voters to have picked The Dark Knight as one of the five they believe deserve a nomination , but because not enough of them put the film as # 1 , those votes were n’t counted .
The problem is n’t so much that the voters did n’t want the film — it ’s that it lacked a significant number willing to say it was the best of the year .
I ’m not sure if that ’s a consolation or if it stings even more — this idea that the film was considered the best five but missed the honor anyway .
We 'll never know for sure , however , unless someone takes the time to recount how many people voted for it .
Do n't hold your breath on that one .
On the other hand , how did a dull and divisive film like The Reader make it ?
Simple .
All that ’s required was to have 1/6 of the voters place it at the top of the pile , which is not outside the Weinstein Company ’ lobby reach .
It is a Holocaust film , after all , and the air of importance is a necessity for any Oscar contender .
This is undoubtedly disappointing for the fans who have tried so hard to campaign for the film — most notably the website DarkCampaign.com — but perhaps this letter from a certain screenwriter , sent to the site on Friday , can help ease the pain .
hey — not sure who to address this to as it looks like a collective effort , but I just wanted to pass along my thanks .
It ’s truly humbling that you guys would take the time and effort to try to get the film recognized .
I , like you , was disappointed that Chris did n’t get some recognition this morning , but for Heath and so many of the people who worked so hard on this thing to get nominated is thrilling .
Any nominations for a comic book movie is a thing of beauty no matter how you slice it , and that takes the sting out a bit .
Besides , I ’ve been to the big show before , and , like any of these things , it ’s a little disappointing .
Did you know it ’s not even an open bar once the show starts ?
At least this time I would have remembered to bring a little cash so I could buy myself a drink after losing .
The best part of this experience is seeing other people getting passionate about the film the way that we did .
It has been a truly incredible experience .
So thank you again .
best , jonah nolan
At the end of the day , eight nominations is not too shabby , considering how Batman Begins only received one for Best Cinematography , a feat Wally Pfister is repeating again this year for his work on The Dark Knight .

Advertisement British forces could begin pulling out of Iraq by next March , a senior defence source has revealed to the BBC .
The UK has been negotiating the legal basis on which its forces can stay when its UN mandate expires at the end of the year .
It still has 4,100 troops in Basra but defence chiefs plan a withdrawal over the next year if Iraqi elections in January pass off peacefully .
A withdrawal could allow soldiers to be diverted to Afghanistan .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has indicated that almost all British troops should leave Iraq by the middle of next year , with a few hundred possibly remaining to train Iraqi security forces .
Previously it had been suggested that troops could start leaving in January .
However , the BBC has learned that the process is likely to begin in March - six years after the US - led invasion .
' Significant progress ' A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said : " Significant progress has been made in Basra , a city which has now been transformed thanks to Iraqi , coalition and British efforts .
Some troops could eventually be redeployed to Afghanistan " As such , we are now expecting to see a fundamental change of mission in early 2009 . "
The majority of the British troops are confined to Basra air base .
The Iraqi parliament may have to vote on any deal to allow British troops to remain in the country beyond the end of the year .
It recently agreed a similar deal which allows American forces to remain in Iraq for another three years .
US troops are due to pull out of Iraqi cities by the middle of next year , and be gone completely by December 2011 .
The US is planning to boost the strength of its force in Afghanistan in the new year and is hoping its Nato allies follow suit .
BBC defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt said the withdrawal of British troops from Iraq " should allow a renewed focus on the multi-national mission in Afghanistan , which is facing a stalemate " .
She said it would free up helicopters , intelligence assets and eventually troops for the battle against the Taleban .

Sri Lankan death squads kill editor and ransack TV station
By K. Ratnayake
13 January 2009
Two brazen attacks on the media in Sri Lanka last week constitute a sharp warning that the government and the military will not tolerate any , even limited , criticism of its communal war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) .
Last Thursday , Lasantha Wickrematunge , editor of the Sunday Leader , was shot dead in broad daylight as he drove to work on a busy suburban road .
According to eyewitnesses , four masked gunmen rode up to his car on motorbikes .
One blocked the path of the vehicle while another smashed a hole in the windscreen and shot Wickrematunge with a pistol .
The two others stood guard .
All four escaped , even though the spot was 100 metres from an air force checkpoint and next to a high security zone .
Two days earlier , an armed gang broke into the MTV / Sirasa broadcasting network in the early hours of the morning , overpowered the guards and ransacked the building .
Some 20 masked gunmen armed with automatic rifles , pistols , hand grenades and a mine destroyed the control room and shot up the offices and studios .
Despite being called , the police did not arrive until the 30 - minute rampage was over .
Speaking to the WSWS , news director Asoka Dias denounced the raid as " an attack on media freedom " .
Both incidents have the hallmarks of assaults by military - sponsored gangs of thugs , which have been responsible over the past three years for hundreds of abductions , murders and violent attacks directed against the country 's Tamil minority and anyone critical of the government and the war .
Last week 's attacks took place as President Mahinda Rajapakse was whipping up a wave of reactionary triumphalism following the army 's capture of the LTTE 's headquarters in Kilinochchi the previous week .
Wickrematunge ’s funeral procession in Colombo
The ability of Wickrematunge 's killers to flee , and of 20 heavily armed gunmen to travel unimpeded at night , both point to the complicity of the security forces .
The police and military maintain a huge network of checkpoints and roadblocks throughout Colombo and the surrounding suburbs .
Vehicles , passengers , even pedestrians are routinely stopped and checked .
Moreover , the MTV / Sirasa attackers arrived in a white van without a number plate — the trademark of military death squads in Sri Lanka for decades .
Thousands took part in the funeral of Wickrematunge in Colombo yesterday , shouting slogans accusing the government of his death .
The Paris - based Reporters without Borders ( RSF ) blamed the government for inciting hatred against the editor , noting that the president had branded him a " terrorist journalist " last October .
In its statement condemning the killing , Amnesty International pointed out that during Rajapakse 's tenure 14 media workers , including journalists , had been killed and 20 had fled the country due to threats .
Wickrematunge sympathised with the conservative opposition party — the United National Party ( UNP ) — and like the rest of the Colombo establishment backed the war against the LTTE .
At the same time , however , Wickrematunge had been critical of the government and defence hierarchy about the way the war was carried out .
The Sunday Leader had exposed instances of high - level corruption involving top generals and ministers .
Defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapakse , a brother of the president , had filed a defamation case against Wickrematunge that was being heard in the district courts .
The case , in which Gotabhaya Rajapakse was claiming a billion rupees in damages , involved a Sunday Leader article exposing corruption in a defence deal .
At the same time , Wickrematunge 's criticisms reflected concerns in sections of the Colombo elite at Rajapakse 's increasingly autocratic methods of rule , including his sidelining of parliament and dependence on the military .
Well aware that he was a target , Wickrematunge wrote his own death notice published as the editorial in last weekend 's Sunday Leader in which he likened Sri Lanka to Nazi Germany .
Wickrematunge directly addressed the president , noting the two had previously been long - time friends .
" In the wake of my death I know you [ Rajapakse ] will make all the usual sanctimonious noises and call upon the police to hold a swift and thorough inquiry .
But like all the inquiries you have ordered in the past , nothing will come of this one , too .
For truth be told , we both know who will be behind my death ...
" Sadly , for all the dreams you had for our country in your younger days , in just three years you have reduced it to rubble .
In the name of patriotism you have trampled on human rights , nurtured unbridled corruption and squandered public money like no other President before you ...
[ No one else has ] caused so much blood to be spilled on this land as you have , or trampled on the rights of citizens as you do . "
Taken in the context of Sri Lanka where governments have trampled on democratic rights and shed blood for decades , the editorial written by a former friend is an extraordinary indictment of the Rajapakse regime .
Under Rajapakse , power has been concentrated to an unprecedented extent in the hands of a political - military cabal that broke the 2002 ceasefire , re-launched communal war and used it to justify the gross abuse of democratic rights .
Wickrematunge spoke for sections of the political establishment who fear that such methods will ultimately provoke a massive backlash by working people .
In the case of MTV / Sirasa , the government has gone one step further , attempting to blame the opposition UNP .
Police , purportedly acting on an anonymous tip off , have arrested a UNP municipal councillor , alleging that he helped transfer the weapons involved in the attack .
Neither the government nor the police has offered any explanation as to why the councillor or the UNP would be involved in ransacking a television station critical of Rajapakse .
The attack came in the wake of denunciations of MTV / Sirasa in the state - run media for its " unpatriotic " attitude .
The station 's coverage , the government mouthpieces declared , did not give sufficient coverage of the army 's victory at Kilinochchi and gave too much prominence to an LTTE suicide bombing in Colombo on the same day .
Like the Sunday Leader , MTV / Sirasa fully backs the war but has been critical of government corruption and abuses .
For all the government 's fanfare about the army 's victories over the LTTE , the attack on MTV / Sirasa and Wickrematunge 's murder demonstrate just how weak the Rajapakse regime is .
Last Friday , announcing the army 's capture of the strategic Elephant Pass on national television , the president was preoccupied with conspirators who were trying to " belittle these victories , to turn the attention of the people to other directions " .
" The aim of these conspirators is to level unfounded charges against the army commander who works with the greatest dedication to achieve these victories , " Rajapakse declared .
They were seeking to " destroy the morale of troops , destabilise the country " in order to " make room for various international forces to interfere to grab our gains away from us " .
Not surprisingly , Rajapakse failed to name the conspirators or provide any concrete detail about this conspiracy .
His paranoia reflects above all a fear of the broad masses of working people who have been forced to bear the costs of the war and now confront rapidly worsening living standards as a result of the global economic downturn .
The army 's victories have not been accompanied by widespread popular euphoria .
On the orders of the government , state institutions including schools were compelled to " celebrate " the Kilinochchi victory .
Various Sinhala chauvinist organisations held relatively small rallies .
But among working people , despite considerable confusion , there was just the hope that the 25 - year war would soon be over and life might improve .
It is precisely these expectations that the government is incapable of fulfilling .
Coming in the wake of Wickrematunge 's assassination , Rajapakse 's obsession with " conspirators " is the sharpest possible warning of the measures that will be used to suppress any opposition .
If the army does capture the LTTE 's remaining strongholds , this " victory " will not bring " peace , freedom and democracy " , as Rajapakse claimed after the fall of Kilinochchi , but police - state measures aimed against the working class .

I firmly believe that many political problems are born of the average Americans inability — and unwillingness — to try to think and understand the world around them rather than accept conventional wisdom .
This is clearly evident in peoples ’ lack of understanding of pricing ; it is disturbingly evident in the political policies they seek as a result of this lack .
It ’s clear enough when you hear about “ price gouging ” , and every economic argument that prices must rise to avoid shortages falls on deaf ears .
But it ’s the same principle when folks rail in favor of “ windfall profits taxes ” , as if businesses have the power to just arbitrarily select the level of profits they ’ll earn .
Someone should really tell Ford , GM , and Chrysler , because they seem to be having some trouble with this concept !
Given that this is such an important concept , and given that it ’s really quite simple , it ’s surprising that the simple rules of pricing are n’t more apparent .
But it ’s not something that most people regularly have to think about .
And sadly , because it ’s so simple , it is not often explained — which I ’d like to change .
The misconception of pricing is obvious .
Most people think that prices are determined by a simple formula :
Price =
Cost of materials +
Cost of labor +
Overhead + reasonable profit
It sounds so axiomatic that it is taken at face value .
It ’s so often true ( but for a different reason ) that it seems correct .
But it ’s not that clear .
Pricing is actually determined by the following equation , with a second equation added for clarity :
Price = whatever the market will bear
Profit ( or loss ) = Price – Cost of inputs – Cost of labor – Overhead
Note the difference between the two .
Price is not a PRODUCT of the equation of material / labor / overhead / profit .
Price is determined through a wholly different process , and profit or loss is the product of the pricing equation .
Allow me to use an anecdote to explain .
As I pointed out a while ago , my wife and her sister recently opened a business making gourmet rice krispy treats .
They intuitively understood the reality of pricing , but their logical thought process was all on the wrong model .
They initially thought about how much their gifts should cost .
Then , as certain costs started piling up , they had that internal desire to raise prices to compensate .
But in fact , they started to understand that their initial pricing goals were actually too high , not too low .
They realized that the market will only price gourmet gifts around a certain level , and they must adjust their costs to suit .
They ’ve ended up making some sacrifices that they did n’t want to make in the early term , and will have to defray some business decisions they ’d wanted to make until orders become larger and economies of scale develop .
The simple fact is that in the gourmet gift market , the type of people who are buying gifts and the type of occasions they buy them for ( birthday , Valentine ’s Day , Secretary Appreciation Day , etc ) have certain price tags already in mind .
They will not buy a gift beyond that level .
Conversely , a gift priced too low will not be purchased for it will seem “ cheap ” to the recipient .
It ’s a fairly narrow band for this type of product .
It does n’t matter that their product ( rice crispy treats ) is a new entrant to the gourmet gift market .
Their pricing structure has to compete with the existing players .
Of course , they can go against the market pricing .
If they price their product too low , they may move more units but will end up working extremely hard for a very slim profit margin .
If they price their product too high , they wo n’t sell very many units but each unit will carry a lot more profit .
It ’s the difference between Outback Steakhouse , a fine establishment that I might enjoy on a business trip or a random Tuesday , and my personal favorite steakhouse , Ruth ’s Chris , where I might eat once or twice a year .
It ’s the difference between Honda and Ferrari .
You see a lot of Honda ’s on the road , but you notice a Ferrari .
Premium products can command a premium price , but fewer people are willing and able to afford them on a regular basis .
Thus , you see a lot more “ regular ” products than premium products .
The situation becomes even worse when you start talking about commodity products .
The gas you buy at Arco is n’t noticeably different from that you buy at Shell , which is pretty much the same as that you buy at Chevron .
Thus , pricing is almost identical across the board .
Different stores may have different business models , of course .
Many stations will price their gas lower if they have much more full - service convenience store attached , as the profit margins on the convenience store items help to keep them afloat , and the low gas prices entice you to pull into the station ( and hopefully , for the station , you ’ll walk in and buy a Coke and some Pringles , probably tripling or more the profit they made on your gas ) .
Or , they ’ll price gas lower in cash than using a credit card , partially because they must pay a transaction fee on the card , but also partly because you need to walk inside to pay cash ( and again , may buy a higher - margin item while inside ) .
Thus , the pricing equation looks simple and correct , but if you ’ve ever had to actually select a price to sell a good , you know that it is one of the most complex parts of business that anyone will encounter .
It ’s especially difficult in areas where pricing is a lot more opaque .
When you own a gas station , you know how much all your competitors in town are pricing their product .
When you ’re pricing an industrial product that is an input to other production , you typically do n’t know what your competitors are charging .
Pricing often becomes an educated guess , and there can be thousands or millions of dollars difference over large quantities between how much the customer is willing to pay and how much you attempt to charge .
In my business * , some deals may be so tight that $ 1 move up in price can pay multiple employees ’ salaries for a year out of the increased profit , but that $ 1 move up in price loses the deal to the competition .
Like anything else , though , as a producer you ’re trying to charge the customer as much as you think they ’re willing to pay , but still low enough to win the business .
Thus , a business cannot simply set a price based on the profit they ’d like to make .
Instead , business run an analysis of profit / loss based on what they expect is the price they can charge , and the costs they must incur to produce .
Furthermore , business energy rates in 2019 can also play a part in deducing a final price .
If the expected price is too low to make enough of a profit , they do n’t engage in the business venture .
If the profit is high , they rush into business as quickly as possible .
Profits thus also tend towards the “ reasonable ” over time , because large profits attract new entrants to the market ( driving down price ) , and small profits ( or losses ) cull participants from the market ( allowing price to rise ) .
This again is why the pricing equation appears to be correct , because in an equilibrium point of price stability , the market tends to only allow the “ right ” number of producers to exist .
This is why GM , Ford , and Chrysler have such trouble .
The price for their automobiles is set by the market .
They cannot raise their prices beyond this level or they wo n’t sell enough cars to stay afloat .
They ca n’t lower their prices to move more units because they ’re already at a cost structure that is too high for their prices .
For them to continue compete , they need to cut costs .
And they do n’t have a corporate DNA that makes it easy for them to alter their cost structure .
Especially not when they can simply go to Congress for regulation to punish their competitors , or as we see this week , a big fat bailout .
This is also why we ’ve seen such problems in the airline industry .
Airlines were created in the days when travel was a luxury , the only way to schedule a flight was to call multiple airlines on the phone or use a travel agent , and they could differentiate their product on a service model rather than a cost model .
The market has changed , and air travel has now become a commodity .
With transparent pricing easily comparable on the internet , casual travelers ** almost never choose their airline based on a service model .
If they save $ 2 to fly low - cost airlines instead of a “ name ” , they ’ll do so .
This is why you see airlines adding things like baggage fees , because they know that they need to increase revenue per passenger , but they cannot increase the fare that shows up on an online search .
Many are slowly adopting the Southwest Airlines approach , which is the “ sit down and shut up because we ’re about to take off ” model , delivered with a smile !
This has been a very long explanation for what is a very simple concept .
But it all comes down to a single point :
Prices are a signal that tell producers what goods and how much of those goods to produce .
This does n’t mean that the prices are always responded to in exact terms , many industries go through feast / famine cycles as inventories wax and wane , particularly when the lag time between deciding to produce a good and it actually reaching the market is long ( i.e. semiconductor products , oil , etc ) .
But the political message is clear .
Anything that politicians do to artificially modify the price signals in the market will have consequences to production of goods .
Price - gouging laws are a good example .
In the wake of a major hurricane , bottled water and portable electric generators tend to see huge spikes in demand .
Due to this , the price tends to go up quite a bit .
In some ways this signal is taken by consumers as a sign that they should ration their purchases ( which helps more consumers get some of a good , rather than few consumers getting all of a good ) .
High prices also offer an incentive to suppliers to deliver more of a good into the affected area , though , which helps to alleviate some of the price pressure while allowing more consumers to get more of the needed goods .
If you disrupt the price signal , through a price - gouging law , you tend to see hoarding of goods by those quick enough to get them at low prices , and you see a sustained supply crunch of those goods .
Windfall profit taxes work the same way .
When prices of a commodity increase sharply , it creates a signal to producers that they need to work especially hard to produce more of that commodity .
Oil companies spend more money on exploration , they are willing to produce oil in wells where the marginal cost of production is far higher than the “ easy ” wells , and they do everything in their power to increase supply , because they want to take part in those profits .
If you institute a large tax on those profits , though , they will refrain from the exploration and production of the higher marginal cost projects .
The supply will remain below its potential , and the situation the politicians are trying to achieve — lower commodity costs — will actually end up in the exact opposite .
So if price - gouging laws and windfall profit taxes are such bad economics , why are they so popular ?
It ’s because peoples ’ understanding of what drives prices is completely backwards .
If I believe that prices are set by “ costs + a reasonable profit ” , I would naturally feel that an external situation which creates much larger profits without an increase in costs is “ unfair ” .
I would feel that way because my understanding of prices assume that the price of a good is tied to its production cost , and thus to increase prices without a change in those costs is “ gouging ” your customers .
If it assumed , on the other hand , that prices are a function of the market and they are merely a signal to producers to change their behavior , we should be able to understand that short - term increases in prices will result in long - term increases in supply , and that in the long run the equilibrium of all of these goods and services reaches the “ right ” level .
Pricing seems like an easy and a trivial task .
As we ’ve seen , though , it ’s not easy , and when the politicians get involved , it ’s not trivial .
For our entire economy to work , pricing has to be allowed to naturally emerge from the market .
Any deviation from this natural occurrence results in unintended consequences and reduces the efficiency of the market .
It should be noted that many of the areas where government is most actively regulating prices ( such as the medical industry ) is where we see the market behaving contrary to the wealth - producing tendency it has in all other markets .
Pricing is not difficult in concept , but a lack of understanding about its nature can grind our whole system to a halt .
* I personally am in the technical end of the business , not the sales / pricing end .
While I understand the impact if a dollar swing either way , I just do n’t have the heart to argue with a customer over a dollar — even if that dollar is multiplied a few hundred thousand times .
It ’s not my personality .
** Note also that one aspect of air travel that is not being cut is frequent - flyer programs .
Business travelers are far more capable of loyalty to a specific airline , and the airlines know that they ’re willing to pay a bit more for the perks of “ elite ” status .
Business travelers are the remaining cash cow of their industry , and they ’re doing what they can to protect that status .
There were long queues for the clean water More than 3,300 people have died from the worst outbreak of cholera in Zimbabwe 's history , which has infected nearly 66,000 people .
The epidemic has been fuelled by the country 's economic meltdown , which has led to the collapse of the country 's water , health and sanitation systems .
Matthew Cochrane , from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies , has been keeping a daily diary for the BBC News website this week , as he travels around Zimbabwe to see things for himself .
This is his final entry .
FRIDAY 6 FEBRUARY , CHITUNGWIZA , HARARE I watched 11,000 litres of clean water pumped into the jerry cans and plastic bottles of a cholera - affected community on Thursday .
Not very often that you get to say that .
But as has been the case all week , things were n't what they seemed .
They do n't like the chlorinated taste of the clean water
Raphael Bonnaud , French Red Cross
Whilst a group of people lined up at the distribution point to collect water , still more were huddled around the nearby borehole despite the water there being contaminated .
Raphael Bonnaud is with the French Red Cross water team .
" People still prefer the bore water , even though we have explained that it's not clean , " he said .
" They do n't like the chlorinated taste of the clean water , and they 've been collecting water from the bore for years , so there 's a behavioural element to it as well . "
It 's another sign of how complex this operation is , and of the importance of health and hygiene awareness raising .
Chitungwiza is a high - density suburb on the outskirts of Harare .
It is home to one of the first and worst outbreaks of this cholera epidemic .
It is not hard to see why .
Driving through the townships , houses seemed to be built on top of each other .
Few if any have running water or sanitation .
Leaks
The local water authority is stretched beyond capacity , undermined by a lack of chemicals and faulty pipes .
About 45 % of the water that is produced is lost due to leakages .
To try and arrest this situation , we have set up a treatment plant at the Prince Edward water plant , and we 're producing about 50,000 litres per day of high quality water .
At the Zimbabwe Red Cross headquarters in Harare we heard that we 're on our way to meeting most if not all of our preliminary targets .
But around the country , the crisis rolls on .
Two provinces - Masvingo and Mashonaland Central - have experienced a four - fold increase in cases in the last two weeks .

We 've heard how Age of Conan is in a state of decline .
Now let 's look at how it 's in a state of decline .
In particular , how over half the game 's servers are to be shuttered .
Advertisement
Funcom have announced that during the week , the total number of servers for the game will be reduced from 49 to just 18 , with the biggest losses due to strike North America and Oceania .

There , 16 servers are closing , leaving only six behind .
Europe will fare slightly better , with 12 servers to be left open so as to cater to the all major language regions equally .
Funcom 's line is that this will improve player experience , with busier servers meaning busier , more enjoyable worlds .
And in a small way , they 're right .
But in a bigger way ?
Going from 49 servers to 18 shows just how quickly and how savagely this game has tanked .

Hollywood star Tom Cruise braved freezing Berlin temperatures yesterday to spend time on the red carpet with fans at the European premiere of ' Valkyrie ' .
Hollywood 's biggest star Tom Cruise visits Bild ' Valkyrie ' star reveals why he loves Berlin Hollywood actor Tom Cruise stopped by the BILD offices in Berlin to discuss his new film ' Valkyrie ' and why he loves the German capital so much .
Tom Cruise in ' Valkyrie ' " I would also have tried to kill Hitler ! "
Hollywood megastar Tom Cruise told BILD that he would have tried to kill Hitler like Claus von Stauffenberg , who he plays in the hit film ' Valkyrie ' .
Charming Cruise was a model Hollywood star as he spent a total of 102 minutes chatting to fans and signing autographs !
Those who had waited in the cold to see him were no doubt thankful for the hot drinks and handwarmers that Cruise had distributed amongst the crowd .
“ What a welcome ” he said .
“ And it happens every time I come to Germany ! ”
His wife Katie Holmes looked beautiful in a black Escada dress but was not dressed for the cold , so hurried inside the Potsdamer Platz cinema .
The German actors in Valkryrie were also in attendance : Carice van Houten ( 32 ) , Christian Berkel ( 51 ) and Thomas Kretschmann ( 46 ) .
Kretschmann spoke about his most exciting day on set : “ I had to be on time on the first day of filming , so Tom sent a helicopter to fly me from Tempelhof to the location – even though I am scared of flying .
It was simply incredible . ”
The premiere started at 8 pm , but Tom promised his fans to come out and sign more autographs afterwards .
“ I am a bit freezing , ” he admitted .
There was a five - minute standing ovation when the film ended .
Tom and Katie then greeted people outside before they had to return to the hotel to fly to London the next day .
Two decades ago a 23 - year - old Cornell University graduate student brought the Internet to its knees with a simple software program that skipped from computer to computer at blinding speed , thoroughly clogging the then - tiny network in the space of a few hours .
The program was intended to be a digital “ Kilroy Was Here . ”
Just a bit of cybernetic fungus that would unobtrusively wander the net .
However , a programming error turned it into a harbinger heralding the arrival of a darker cyberspace , more of a mirror for all of the chaos and conflict of the physical world than a utopian refuge from it .
Since then things have gotten much , much worse .
Bad enough that there is a growing belief among engineers and security experts that Internet security and privacy have become so maddeningly elusive that the only way to fix the problem is to start over .
What a new Internet might look like is still widely debated , but one alternative would , in effect , create a “ gated community ” where users would give up their anonymity and certain freedoms in return for safety .
Today that is already the case for many corporate and government Internet users .
As a new and more secure network becomes widely adopted , the current Internet might end up as the bad neighborhood of cyberspace .
You would enter at your own risk and keep an eye over your shoulder while you were there .
Charter Communications said Thursday that it had reached an agreement in principle with a debt holders committee on terms of a financial restructuring , to be done under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , to reduce Charter ’s debt by about $ 8 billion .
The cable operator , controlled by Microsoft ’s co-founder , Paul Allen , said in a statement it would file for Chapter 11 on or before April 1 .
Various debt holders and bondholders will receive a mix of new notes , equity and cash , depending on their seniority .
Shareholders will not receive anything for their common stock , which will be canceled .
Mr. Allen will continue as an investor and retain the largest voting interest in Charter .
The company , which has more than 5.5 million subscribers , said it would make an overdue interest payment of $ 74 million before a final deadline of Feb. 15 .

In an interview on the MSNBC program " Hardball , " host Chris Matthews asked Bachmann , currently running for reelection in Minnesota 's 6th District , if she thinks Obama may have anti-American views .
Her response : " Absolutely .
I 'm very concerned that he may have anti-American views . "
Bachmann said she based her suspicions on Obama 's past associations with his former pastor , Jeremiah Wright , and 1960 's - era radical Bill Ayers .
In so doing , she echoed similar criticisms by Republican presidential candidate John McCain and his running mate , Sarah Palin - although they have stopped short of outright suggesting that Obama is anti-American .

Palin told CBS News on Friday , " I know Obama loves America . "
Nick Kimball , Minnesota spokesman for the Obama campaign , called Bachmann 's criticisms " scare tactics and false attacks " and said Republicans are using them in order to distract voters from discussions of the economy .
During the TV interview , Bachmann also singled out a comment that Obama 's wife , Michelle , made earlier in the year in which she remarked that " for the first time in my adult life I am proud of my country . "
" And so these are very anti-American views , " Bachmann said on the show .
Matthews also asked Bachmann , " How many people in Congress of the United States do you believe are anti-American ? "

Bachmann replied , " I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out , are they pro-America or anti-America ? "
Michelle Marston , spokeswoman for Bachmann 's reelection campaign , said it 's " perfectly legitimate for the American people to want to know how all this informs his policy positions and what direction an Obama Administration would want to lead the nation . "
Minnesota Democratic Party Chairman Brian Melendez said Bachmann was playing with fire .
" The last politician who used that term that carelessly was Joe McCarthy , and Michele Bachmann seems anxious to step into his shoes , " Melendez said .
A day earlier at a debate in St. Cloud with her Democratic opponent , Elwyn Tinklenberg , Bachmann spoke kindly of Obama .
" If the presidency would somehow go to Barack Obama , I would welcome him to the 6th District as well , " Bachmann said after the debate .
" As a matter of fact , I would put my hand on his shoulder and give him a kiss if he wanted to " - a reference to when Bachmann gained notoriety for grabbing President Bush 's shoulder after his 2007 State of the Union address and holding on until he kissed her .

The sharp fall in the pound against the euro over the past six months has not led to an upsurge in British support for joining the euro , a poll has found .
Some 71 % of people are against entering the European single currency , with only 23 % in favour , according to the ICM survey for BBC Radio 4's the World At One .
The euro has achieved parity against the pound making the cost of overseas holidays more expensive , but there is no sign this is leading to a rethink in the British public 's attitude to the euro .
With British interest rates likely to remain below those of the eurozone for some time to come , it is expected that the pound will continue to fall , possibly putting pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates earlier than it would like .
The ICM poll found that 69 % of people felt recent changes in the exchange rate made no difference to whether Britain should join the single currency , while 14 % said it made them less inclined .
Only 15 % said that the pound 's fall made them more keen on ditching sterling for the euro .
It is possible those figures will change when larger numbers of British holidaymakers this summer feel the impact of sterling 's fall on their purchasing power .
Sterling 's fall may continue in 2009 , said Martin Ellis , chief economist at Halifax .
" The financial markets appear to be reacting to the belief that the already record low bank rate of 2 % could be cut further in the new year . "
The weakness of the pound is also linked closely to Britain 's public finances and debt levels , which have been deteriorating as the country sinks into recession .
The government is expected to publish new figures for bank lending to business today which will reopen the debate on whether the banks have responded properly to government recapitalisation .
The Conservatives have sought to exploit speculation that Labour might wish to join the euro by emphasising that Britain would never join the single currency under a Tory government .
William Hague , the shadow foreign secretary , said yesterday the fall in the pound 's value did not mean Britain should join the euro , arguing instead that " since the interest rates in the eurozone have been lower than ours for many years , it is fair to assume that had we been in the euro all this time Gordon Brown 's boom would have been even more unsustainable " .
The Tories have been pushing the issue partly to ward off a split among eurosceptics during European parliament elections in June .
The election will see Tories challenged from the right by the UK Independence party , the BNP and Libertas .
The pro-European business secretary , Peter Mandelson , reiterated government policy recently by saying it was its aim to take Britain into the euro .
But he stressed the matter was unlikely to be discussed seriously for the foreseeable future .
Caroline Flint , the Europe minister , said the euro was " a non-debate at this time " .
The government and public were focused on jobs and recession , she told the BBC .
Last month the European commission president , José Manuel Barroso , said " people who matter " in UK politics were contemplating giving up the pound .

Advertisement A giant white horse has been chosen as a new £ 2 m art commission for south east England dubbed " Angel of the South " .
The design , by former Turner Prize winner Mark Wallinger , was selected from a three - strong shortlist as part of the Ebbsfleet Landmark Project .
His design for the public art commission will see a horse standing on all four hooves at 33 times life - size .
Once built , it will dominate the north Kent landscape , standing as high as Nelson 's Column at about 164ft ( 50 m ) .
There was some very tough competition and I am honoured that the horse has won

The announcement was made at Swan Valley Community School in Swanscombe in Kent , which overlooks the Springhead Park area where the giant statue will be built .
The landmark , which will be close to Eurostar 's international station , is intended as an iconic symbol representing the regeneration of north - west Kent , and the eastwards growth of London .
Mr Wallinger , who was chosen over artists Daniel Buren and Richard Deacon , described it as a " tremendously exciting project " .
" There was some very tough competition and I am honoured that the horse has won through , " he said .

The Ebbsfleet Landmark Project has been dubbed the " Angel of the South " , in reference to Antony Gormley 's Angel of the North sculpture which overlooks the A1 motorway in Gateshead .
A prancing white horse is the logo for the county council and has been the symbol of Kent for hundreds of years .
However , a sculpture of the Invicta , supported by Kent County Council in response to Mr Wallinger 's entry , was rejected by judges last year .
Victoria Pomery , chairman of the Ebbsfleet Landmark Project 's selection panel , said their decision was based on " artistic merit " .
She added : " Mark is a superb artist of world renown and his sculpture will become a real landmark for Ebbsfleet and the whole region . "
Last week , organisers of the project said they were still hoping it would be in place for the London 2012 Olympics , despite the recession .
Project manager Mark Davy revealed to the BBC that there could be short - term funding problems for the Ebbsfleet scheme .
Following Tuesday 's decision , he said : " The 2012 Olympics is a significant milestone but outside of our control .
" The project is such a complex one that it will be difficult to set a specific deadline until we have undertaken the significant technical studies and costing investigations . "
It was commissioned by Eurostar , London & Continental Railways and Land Securities , the developers of Ebbsfleet Valley .

Thanks to its open - ended design and a thriving user community , Twitter is fast outgrowing its roots as a simple , easy - to - use messaging service .
Enterprising hackers are creating apps for sharing music and videos , to help you quit smoking and lose weight – spontaneously extending the text - based service into one of the web 's most fertile ( and least likely ) application platforms .
Hardware hackers have set up household appliances to send status alerts over Twitter , like a washing machine that tweets when the spin cycle is through , or a home security system that tweets whenever it senses movement inside the house .
Others have incorporated Twitter into their DIY home automation systems .
Forgot to turn off the lights ?
Send a tweet to flip the switch by remote control .
" It 's so simple and easy to access , people are thinking of more and more uses for the platform , " says Dan Wasyluk , creator of the Twitter - based Snipt service .
Wasyluk launched Snipt last week as a way to let programmers share short snippets of code over Twitter .
Launched in 2007 , Twitter quickly became a darling of the life - and mind - casting interneterati .
But some saw boundless possibilities in the 140 - character limit , and what was a slow trickle of innovation is now quickly elevating what is essentially a micro- blogging service into one of the internet 's most important technologies , along with instant messaging and e-mail .
Though its main use – sending and receiving short messages to your social network – is often dismissed as time - wasting trivia , Twitter 's potential as a broad internet platform is just beginning to be fully realized .
Twitter has grown into a ubiquitous presence – you can send tweets from your phone , your desktop and your browser – that has potential to not only facilitate communication among humans , but even to make machines do our bidding .
Businesses are starting to be built around it .
Botanicalls , for example , sells a Twitter - enabled hardware kit that lets your neglected house plants alert you when they 're thirsty .
The company has developed a tiny moisture sensor attached to a circuit board with an Ethernet port .
You stick it in your plant 's soil , and when the moisture levels drop below a certain level , your plant sends you a tweet begging to be watered .
Using Twitter 's application programming interface ( API ) , a programmer with even a modest amount of experience can create a web app that gathers public data from Twitter , or uses it to send links , commands or bursts of information .
" [ Twitter 's ] open API is a huge reason it has grown into such a platform , " says Wasyluk .
File sharers were the first to rush in .
The photo - sharing service TwitPic , one of the oldest Twitter mashups , lets users send pictures to their followers by storing a photo on its servers , then passing the link around on Twitter .
Now there are newer apps like Tweetcube and Twittershare , which let users share larger media like MP3s and videos .
Twitter 's limited format of short , text - based announcements are a natural match for sites like Track This , which you can use to get status updates on FedEx and UPS packages , and Tweetajob , which job seekers can use to get real - time updates about new job openings .
Anyone who needs help quitting smoking can use Qwitter to monitor their progress .
Those looking to lose weight can turn to TweetWhatYouEat or TweetYourEats .
Hardware hackers have put a new spin on the Twitter mashup – as it turns out , just about anything that can be plugged into the internet is capable of talking to Twitter .
Programmer Ryan
Rose rigged up his washing machine to send him a tweet when his clothes are done .
He just follows his machine 's twitter account ( it's PiMPY3WASH ) and he knows when to go downstairs and move his undies to the dryer .
Linux hacker Shantanu Goel set up a video camera and some motion - sensing software on a PC connected to the internet .
If anyone breaks into his house or goes snooping through his room , the software detects the movement and sends out a tweet .
Tech - savvy environmentalists can install Tweet - a- Watt , a gadget that plugs into your wall socket and connects to your wi-fi network .
Once a day , the pocket - sized device broadcasts stats of your daily energy usage to Twitter .
Whether that sort of transparency results in embarrassment or bragging rights can be determined by a system like the one created by Justin Wickett .
The Duke University student wired up his home so he could turn his lights on and off remotely , just by sending a text message to Twitter from his mobile phone .

The Sun newspaper had an exclusive interview with the parents
The case of the 13 - year - old who has fathered a baby highlights a worrying trend of " children having children " , the Tory leader has said .
David Cameron was speaking after Alfie Patten 's girlfriend Chantelle Steadman , 15 , gave birth on Monday .
Latest figures from UK National Statistics show there were 7,826 conceptions in under - 16s in 2006 - down 1,000 from 10 years earlier .
Sexual health experts said teens should be encouraged to have " ambition " .
Children 's Secretary Ed Balls said it was an " awful " and " unusual " case .
" I want those kids to be safe and also the young child as well , and I want us to do everything we can as a society to make sure we keep teenage pregnancies coming down , " he said .
Mr Cameron said : " It is really worrying in our country today you 've got children having children - and obviously we all hope that these very , very young children will grow up and be good parents , but frankly parenthood is n't something they should be thinking about .
" That 's what 's gone wrong and we 've got to put it right . "
In some of the more difficult communities , this has become pretty much the norm
Iain Duncan Smith , Centre for Social Justice
Support for ' boy ' father Father at 14 ' changed my future ' Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith , who now runs the Centre for Social Justice said it " exemplified the point we have been making about broken Britain " .
He told the BBC the problem of teenage pregnancies was concentrated in certain communities .
" Quite often what fails to recognise is that in some of the more difficult communities , this has become pretty much the norm .
" I 've visited many estates where there are very huge collections of very young mothers , often with multiple children - and often ' guesting fathers ' .
" This is a major problem in the UK . "
No prosecution
The teenagers , both from Eastbourne , had kept the pregnancy secret until Chantelle 's mother Penny noticed her daughter was getting bigger .
Chantelle had her baby in Eastbourne District General Hospital , and is now home with her family .
Sussex Police said no action would be taken with it " not in anyone 's interests " to prosecute .
East Sussex County Council said the teenage parents will be supported with intensive monitoring and health visitor support .
We know that life as a teenage parent is hard
Beverley Hughes , children and young people 's minister Tony Kerridge , a spokesman for the sexual health specialist Marie Stopes International , said : " These sorts of lifestyle choices can be dealt with on an educational level if teenage girls realise what they are contemplating is a route into social deprivation and being in the benefits culture for the rest of their lives .
" It may seem like a short term solution to problems at home , but the mid to long term prospects are probably a life stuck on benefits .
" We should , as a society , be encouraging our young people to have much bigger and better aspirations than that . "
Simon Blake of Brook added : " Most under - 16 s are n't having sex , but young people do want more education about sex .
" They want their parents to talk to them , their school to talk to them and they want confidential services to go to . "
Mandatory education Speaking on a visit to the Midlands , Prime Minister Gordon Brown said : " I do n't know the individual details of the case , but of course I think all of us would want to avoid teenage pregnancies . "
Beverley Hughes , children and young people 's minister , said 80 % of under - 18 pregnancies were in 16 and 17 - year - olds .
" Evidence shows that good quality sex and relationship education and parents talking to their children delays early sex and increases the use of contraception whenever they do have sex .
" We know that life as a teenage parent is hard , with outcomes for them and their children often very poor .
" That 's why the government has issued guidance to local areas on providing the right support to improve the welfare of both the teenage parents and child . "

Kangaroos have a different digestive system to cows and sheep
An Australian government adviser on climate change has urged Australians to ditch beef and lamb for kangaroo steaks to help save the planet .
Sheep and cows produce a high amount of environmentally unfriendly methane gas through belching and flatulence .
But economist Ross Garnaut noted in a report on global warming that kangaroos produce virtually no methane .
He predicts a change in farming and eating habits with the introduction of a national carbon trading scheme .
In a 600 - page study commissioned by the Australian government , Professor Garnaut calls for the agricultural industry to be included in the emissions trading scheme to be set up by 2010 .
This would mean landowners would have to buy permits for their greenhouse gas emissions if they go beyond the recommended limits .
Pet food
The higher costs of farming sheep and cattle and their vulnerability to the effects of climate change , including water scarcity , could hasten a transition toward greater production of lower - emitting forms of meat , Prof Garnaut believes .
And he thinks kangaroos , which have a different digestive system to cows and sheep , could hold the key .
" For most of Australia 's human history - around 60,000 years - kangaroo was the main source of meat .
It could again become important , " he said .
Citing a study for the potential of kangaroos to replace other livestock for meat production , he notes that by 2020 beef cattle could be reduced by 7 million and sheep by 36 million .
This would create the opportunity for an increase in kangaroo numbers from 34 million to 240 million in 12 years time .
That amount would be more than enough to replace the lost beef and lamb production , while also being more profitable for farmers as emissions permit prices rise .
While popular in a number of countries , in Australia eating kangaroo - the country 's national symbol - is still controversial and the meat is largely used in pet food .
But many health - conscious Australians have been won over by its lean red meat .

It is being called " the voice from the grave " , a remarkable and accusing article written by one of Sri Lanka 's best - known journalists and published days after he was murdered in a hail of gunfire .
In a 2,500 word editorial , Lasantha Wickrematunge foresees his own death , hints at the identity of the killers from within the ranks of Sri Lanka 's government , and lays out a gripping and detailed account of what he sees as his country 's descent into persecution of citizens and flouting of democracy .
" When finally I am killed , it will be the government that kills me , " he wrote .
Addressing Sri Lanka 's president , Mahinda Rajapakse - a close friend - he says : " In the wake of my death I know you will make all the usual sanctimonious noises and call upon the police to hold a swift and thorough inquiry .
But like all the inquiries you have ordered in the past , nothing will come of this one , too .
For truth be told , we both know who will be behind my death . "
Wickrematunge was shot in the head in Sri Lanka 's capital , Colombo , by two gunman on a motorcycle as he drove to work on Thursday .
More than 4,000 people attended his funeral yesterday , including opposition leaders and human rights activists .
In its 15 years of existence his paper , the Sunday Leader , became well known as the island 's best independent newspaper .
It took an impartial line on the vicious civil war ravaging the island between the Sinhala - dominated government and the Tamil Tigers fighting for autonomy .
It produced a series of scoops about dissension within the government and , in spite of heavy censorship of all on - the - ground reporting of the war , it regularly exposed atrocities for which the security sources were suspected .
Wickrematunge had suffered three attacks before last week .
He was twice assaulted by unknown assailants and his house was sprayed with machine - gun fire .
" Countless [ Sri Lankan ] journalists have been harassed , threatened and killed .
It has been my honour to belong to all those categories and now especially the last , " said his article , published under the headline " And then they came for me " .
The government has made a series of military gains over the Tigers in the last two weeks , capturing their political capital and reopening the main road from Colombo to Jaffna by seizing the important Elephant Pass .
In the editorial Wickrematunge said this would not bring victory - a sign he wrote his article very recently .
" A military occupation of the country 's north and east will require the Tamil people of those regions to live eternally as second - class citizens , deprived of all self respect .
Do not imagine that you can placate them by showering " development " and " reconstruction " on them in the post - war era .
" The wounds of war will scar them forever , and you will also have an even more bitter and hateful diaspora to contend with , " he wrote .
A member of the Sinhala elite , Wickrematunge said : " Unknown to most of the public , Mahinda and I have been friends for more than a quarter century .
Indeed , I suspect that I am one of the few people remaining who routinely addresses him by his first name . "
He pointed out that he still had frequent late - night meetings with the president where they chatted and even joked .
" You have told me yourself that you were not greedy for the presidency .
You did not have to hanker after it : it fell into your lap .
You have told me that your sons are your greatest joy , and that you love spending time with them , leaving your brothers to operate the machinery of state .
Now , it is clear to all who will see that that machinery has operated so well that my sons and daughter do not themselves have a father . "
The editor ends his article appealing to his readers : " If you remember nothing else , remember this : the [ Sunday ] Leader is there for you , be you Sinhalese , Tamil , Muslim , low - caste , homosexual , dissident or disabled .
Its staff will fight on , unbowed and unafraid , with the courage to which you have become accustomed .
Do not take that commitment for granted .
Let there be no doubt that whatever sacrifices we journalists make , they are not made for our own glory or enrichment : they are made for you .
Whether you deserve their sacrifice is another matter .
As for me , God knows I tried . "
A spokesman for Sri Lanka 's high commission in London said last night : " There was condemnation last week by the president of the murder . "
Asked if the president or government had responded to the dead editor 's article in the Sunday Leader , he said : " There has been no reaction . "
The civil war
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam - designated a terrorist organisation by the US , the EU and India - are fighting for an independent state in the north and east of Sri Lanka .
The 25 - year civil war has killed 70,000 people but was only officially acknowledged in January last year when the government ended a 2002 ceasefire , saying " terrorists " had used the truce to re-arm and plan attacks .
Tamils , who are predominately Hindu and make up 12 % of Sri Lanka 's population , claim they are discriminated against by the Buddhist Sinhalese majority .
The Sri Lankan military has achieved a string of major victories against the rebels in recent months , including the capture of the Tamil Tiger administrative capital of Kilinochchi a week ago .
Many of us who study the gilded world of Christian media and megaministries have wondered what impact these harsh economic times would have on evangelical broadcasting .
Well , according to Religion News Service , some statistics are in .
The number of viewers has remained constant , but financial contributions are way down .
This reality is leading Christian broadcasters and networks not only to cut back , but also return to tried and true audiences and fundraising techniques .
For instance , Trinity Broadcasting Network has been forced to lay off employees while trying to fill empty time slots due to the reduction of airtime purchased by otherwise high profile personalities .
Rather than the conversational talk - show formats that have become popular with ministries in recent years , evangelists like Joyce Meyers and T.D. Jakes are airing more traditional sermon formats .
Television and radio networks are also targeting their core senior audience with increased talk content .
Moody Radio , a nationwide Christian network , is now 80 percent talk in order to appeal to the seniors and conservative demographic that tends to be much more liberal in their giving .
In contrast , other ministries have come to discover that while streaming video and Internet downloads attract nontraditional viewers ( i.e. , a younger and more mainstream crowd ) , the podcast generation does not reach into their pockets with the same consistency or generosity as their parents and grandparents .
It appears , then , that the economic recession is causing Christian broadcasters to return to the “ big hair , blue hair ” crowd that they so desperately sought to move away from in recent years .
Mainstream appeal is one thing , keeping the lights on is another !

Important Note :
In 2005 , the term General Maintenance was replaced with Corrective Maintenance , which better describes the purpose of the maintenance .
These terms are synonomous , so you can use either term , but courseware updated in 2005 and later uses the term Corrective Maintenance .
Troubleshooting :
What 's in it for me ?
These are the benefits accruing to the expert Troubleshooter , or the manager whose people troubleshoot quickly and accurately .
Money
I 'm not saying that if you double your troubleshooting productivity you 'll double your salary .
That 's not how it works unless you 're on commission .
Instead , a productive Troubleshooter is seen as a capable and valuable employee , receiving more promotion opportunities , better raises and avoiding layoffs .
Use Al and Bob as an example .
Both make $ 50,000.00 in year 1 .
Both are quite capable , although Bob is a much more productive troubleshooter .
Al receives a 4 % raise per year , while Bob receives a 6 % raise per year because his troubleshooting success makes him look smarter and more capable .
At year 10 , Al 's salary is $ 71,165.59 , while Bob gets $ 84,473.95 .
That 's more than a $ 13,000.00 premium for excellent troubleshooting .
That 's some pretty good money , but it does n't take into account layoffs and promotions ...
Imagine that in year 5 there 's a recession .
Al gets laid off and slides back to $ 50,000.00 on his next job .
Being able to solve problems , Bob is promoted in the leaner and meaner organization , and receives a 15 % raise instead of his usual 6 % .
Before and after year 5 , Al and Bob get their usual raises .
In year 10 , Al 's salary is $ 60832.65 while Bob 's making $ 91646.26 .
Over $ 30,000 more .
Over 50 % more .
This is the monetary power of troubleshooting productivity .
The preceding example detailed the monetary reward for a technologist .
What if you 're a manager ?
If your department troubleshoots effectively , they 'll solve problems quickly .
You 'll be considered a good manager .
On the other hand , if every technical problem causes your crew to twist in the wind , that will be noticed in a different way .
The effects of better raises , promotions and layoffs are math that apply to any employee .
Unless your team currently consistently solves technical problems quickly and accurately , it 's in your financial best interest to make sure they learn troubleshooting .
As mentioned , monetary reward for enhanced troubleshooting productivity is n't instant -- it accrues over a career .
Most of troubleshooting productivity 's other benefits are instant .

Influence
I once saw a rather new and low level employee use bottleneck analysis to determine that the main computer 's bottleneck was its processor .
This computer served about 200 employees .
One night when everyone was gone he borrowed a faster processor from the hardware vendor and installed it .
The next day everyone raved about the computer 's speed and how easy it was to work with now that it was fast .
Rank and file employees noticed it .
Upper management noticed it and paid for the processor immediately .
A couple months later this guy was promoted to upper management and put in charge of all software development , leapfrogging six people who were ahead of him .
When you use the Universal Troubleshooting Process , you know your superior troubleshooting productivity is due to following a process .
But to others , it looks like competence , ability , intelligence , and leadership .
Your prowess is noticed .
And rewarded .
Reputation
An ex client called me .
A programmer had left , and his code had several bugs .
Could I come back and fix it ?
When I walked in the door , the network director said " Here comes the cavalry ! " .
I was famous as a guy who could fix anything .
They thought I was a genius , but I was just an average guy who used the Universal Troubleshooting Process .
Brand
Troubleshooting productivity is a huge portion of your brand .
Think of the last time your Internet provider let a problem go on for days or weeks because they sent out incompetents , they did n't listen to your symptom description or your observations , or each successive " technician " was unaware of the results obtained by previous technicians .
Were you in the mood to recommend your Internet provider to others ?
Your Internet provider gets away with poor troubleshooting because in most communities , it 's the only game in town , or one of two equally bad games .
You , your department , and your company probably do n't have that crutch .
Companies continually angering their customers go broke .
Departments continuously failing to solve technical problems get outsourced .
And individuals who continually and repeatedly can't troubleshoot join the unemployment line .
Brand is key in the value of any company , department , or individual .
Corporations spend millions building their brand .
Effective troubleshooting is low hanging fruit .
Happiness
All those with an easy job , raise your hands ...
What -- nobody raised their hands ?
You say your job is stressful ?
Long hours , tight deadlines and high expectations ?
As a technologist , if you consistently follow the Universal Troubleshooting Process , you 'll be replacing deep thought with easy diagnostic tests .
That means much less stress .
With process oriented troubleshooting , you 'll be much less likely to conduct wandering or circular searches for a root cause , and much more likely to efficiently zero in on the root cause .
That means faster work , and perhaps more importantly , more consistent and predictable times to solution .
This predictability reduces stress .
And then there 's this simple fact :
You 're happier when you do a good job .
When someone points to you and says " Here comes the cavalry " , it feels great .
Bottom line , as a technologist , you 're happier on the job and happier when you go home .
But what if you 're a manager ?
Would your work life be easier if your team solved technical problems quickly and in a predictable manner ?
Would it make you happy if you could give your boss a reasonable range for the time to solution of a high profile problem ?
The manager with a crew using process oriented troubleshooting is a happy manager .
Improved Social and Family Life
The stress reduction previously mentioned carries through to your life outside work .
How nice it is to walk into your house and greet your family knowing things are OK at work , and that you do n't have to think about work , even in the back of your mind .
You can pay full attention to your childrens ' problems or your wife 's idea for the next party .
Let 's say you 're single .
Would your social life be better if you could go to a party knowing everything 's OK at work ?
Would this make you a better conversationalist ?
Would you be less likely to drink excessively in an effort to " forget your problems " ?
Would you be more likely to attract a mate if you were happy and secure in your work ?
Organizational Success
Today , an employee 's well being is linked to that of his or her employer .
With global competition , if a company is n't the best they can be , the company dies , and the employees are unemployed .
Your organization 's success might not make you happy , but your organization 's failure will surely make you miserable .
Enhanced troubleshooting productivity on your part and that of your co-workers is one key to organizational success .
Besides , if you 're anything like I was when I was an employee , I took pride in working for a successful company .

The 10 step Universal Troubleshooting Process
Troubleshooting Tips and Articles
Here Are Some Other Troubleshooting Tips :
Quality Control
The quality of the solution depends on the quality put into the steps .
Getting a complete and accurate symptom description , and reproducing the symptom , assures that you fix the symptom the customer wanted you to fix .
A good damage control plan ensures that you wo n't make anything worse .
Correct general maintenance shows the customer you care about quality , and often greatly reduces costs .
A correct narrowing process will reduce costs , prevent further damage , and ensure that the root cause , rather than a peripheral symptom , is fixed .
Proper repair or replacement of the defective component prevents further damage .
Testing is like inspection in the factory .
The few defects that escape the quality controls of the earlier steps are caught here , by showing that the symptom description you recorded and reproduced has been eliminated , and that no further problems have been created .
Taking pride is a periodic maintenance item that ensures the quality of you as a troubleshooter and a human being .
Preventing further occurrence is the utmost in customer service .
The quality of the solution depends on the quality of the steps .
Bottleneck Analysis
Use Bottleneck Analysis when the symptom can be described as " it 's too ( slow , fast , etc. ) " .
Bottleneck is a special kind of Divide and Conquer ( see step 6 ) .
One cool and easy bottleneck analysis test is to slow down a section of the system .
If that section is the bottleneck , the system as a whole will slow down significantly .
If not , it wo n't .
The entire March 1998 Troubleshooting Professional Magazine is devoted to bottleneck analysis .
Do n't skip steps
The Divide and Conquer process can be thought of as continually forcing the problem into ever smaller boxes , until it 's trapped .
Some of the worst troubleshooting debacles I 've seen involved the problem escaping the box .
In other words , the troubleshooter thought he had proved it was in one area , when it was really in another .
When that happens , tests become inconclusive and the troubleshooter starts to doubt himself .
Whole days can be wasted .
Take every precaution to avoid this -- do n't skip steps .
Troubleshooting Supplies

Money Morning
A massive slump in oil exploration spending pummeled Schlumberger Ltd. ( SLB ) , the world 's largest oilfield services corporation , as profit fell 17 % in the fourth quarter .
But the company said curtailed spending could be setting the stage for a rebound in oil and gas prices as supplies dwindle .
Schlumberger is pulling back as a collapse in petroleum prices led to a sharp drop in exploration spending by its customers .
Commodity prices have plummeted in recent months , as recessions in some of the world 's largest economies dampened demand .
Like all oil producers , Schlumberger has been hurt by the plunge in the price of oil , which has fallen from $ 147 per barrel in July to about $ 42 per barrel now .
The company has also seen its budget for exploration cut by 40 % .
Schlumberger reported net profit of $ 1.15 billion , or 95 cents per share , down from $ 1.38 billion , or $ 1.12 per share , although revenue rose nearly 10 % to $ 6.87 billion .
Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Andrew Gould told investors on a conference call that the company was cutting 5,000 jobs out of 87,000 worldwide , and did not rule out more cuts in the first half of 2009 , if necessary .
" It is a good sign that they 're coming front and center and acknowledging things have gotten a lot worse , " Mark Brown , an analyst at Pritchard Capital Partners in New York , told Bloomberg News .
" We had to get this negative news out there . "
Schlumberger 's results echoed the sentiment of energy analysts who have forecast spending by oil and gas producers would drop by one - fifth or more in 2009 as companies move to conserve cash .
Spending by companies around the world on oil and natural gas exploration will fall to $ 400 billion in 2009 , according to a Dec. 19 report by analysts James Crandell and James West of Barclays Capital Research .
The biggest decline in exploration spending is expected to come in North America , where U.S. spending will fall 26 % to $ 79 billion and Canadian spending will slide 23 % to $ 22 billion , Barclays said .
By contrast , capital spending outside North America will fall only 6 % to $ 300 billion .
" At current prices , most of the new categories of hydrocarbon resources are not economic to develop , " Gould said in the statement .
" We expect 2009 activity to weaken across the board with the most significant declines occurring in North American gas drilling , Russian oil production enhancement and in mature offshore basins . "
Russia is part of Schlumberger 's largest regional market , which includes Europe and Africa .
In Canada , big producers like EnCana Corp. ( ECA ) , Canadian Natural Resources and Husky Energy Inc. ( PINK : HUSKF ) have cut 25 % to 30 % from their capital budgets , according to Gary Leach , president of the Small Explorers and Producers Association of Canada .
" Right now it 's way cheaper to buy gas and oil on the market than to go drill for it , " Leach told the Calgary Herald .
But all those spending cuts may soon lead to a significant rebound in prices , Gould said .
Despite heavy spending by producers to develop new resources in recent years , the supply situation is still depressed and the cuts in investments hitting the industry now will " sow the seeds of strong rebound , " Gould said .
That seemed to be reflected in at least one of Schlumberger 's units .
Even though it posted a 68 % drop in profit and a 25 % drop in revenue in the quarter , Schlumberger 's WesternGeco seismic business – which measures prospective oil and gas reservoirs – is sitting on a record $ 1.77 billion order backlog .
And the gloomy earnings report from Schlumberger did nothing to dispel the notion among investors that oil prices will move higher .
" The fact that because this was n't the quarter that was prophesying the end of the world , it 's causing people to rethink their pessimism , " Bill Herbert an analyst at Simmons & Co. in Houstonsaid told Bloomberg .
Indeed , oil services stocks rebounded in trading Friday .

XMLTV to XHTML+RDFa
The XMLTV format is designed for storing TV listings in XML .
It was originally created by my co-aulmni Ed Avis at Imperial College .
This script converts an XMLTV file into a set of XHTML files displaying the TV listings sorted by time and date , by genre and by channel .
Whatsmore , the XHTML is marked up using RDFa which allows the data to be parsed and handled by RDF tools .
You probably want to use this script as part of a tool chain including XMLTV grabbers and tv_grep .
I use it as part of the following script , run automatically at 6 am every day :
#!/bin/sh DIR=/home/tai/public_html/vhosts/goddamn.co.uk/tv tv_grab_uk_rt -- days 2 >$DIR/tv.xmltv tv_grab_uk_bbcbackstage >$ DIR/radio.xmltv tv_cat $ DIR / tv.xmltv $ DIR/radio.xmltv >$ DIR/all.xmltv tv_grep \ -- on - after `date - Is -d " 6 am today " ` \ -- on - before `date - Is -d " 6 am tomorrow " ` \ < $DIR/all.xmltv \ >$ DIR/today.xmltv rm -f $ DIR /*.html /home/tai/bin/xmltv2xhtml.pl \ -- d_fmt= '%A ' \ -- target - directory=$DIR / \ $ DIR / today.xmltv
Deductive and Inductive Arguments
When assessing the quality of an argument , we ask how well its premises support its conclusion .
More specifically , we ask whether the argument is either deductively valid or inductively strong .
A deductive argument is an argument that is intended by the arguer to be deductively valid , that is , to provide a guarantee of the truth of the conclusion provided that the argument ’s premises are true .
This point can be expressed also by saying that , in a deductive argument , the premises are intended to provide such strong support for the conclusion that , if the premises are true , then it would be impossible for the conclusion to be false .
An argument in which the premises do succeed in guaranteeing the conclusion is called a ( deductively ) valid argument .
If a valid argument has true premises , then the argument is said also to be sound .
All arguments are either valid or invalid , and either sound or unsound ; there is no middle ground , such as being somewhat valid .
Here is a valid deductive argument :
It ’s sunny in Singapore .
If it ’s sunny in Singapore , then he wo n’t be carrying an umbrella .
So , he wo n’t be carrying an umbrella .
The conclusion follows the word “ So ” .
The two premises of this argument would , if true , guarantee the truth of the conclusion .
However , we have been given no information that would enable us to decide whether the two premises are both true , so we cannot assess whether the argument is deductively sound .
It is one or the other , but we do not know which .
If it turns out that the argument has a false premise and so is unsound , this wo n’t change the fact that it is valid .
Here is a mildly strong inductive argument :
Every time I ’ve walked by that dog , it has n’t tried to bite me .
So , the next time I walk by that dog it wo n’t try to bite me .
An inductive argument is an argument that is intended by the arguer to be strong enough that , if the premises were to be true , then it would be unlikely that the conclusion is false .
So , an inductive argument ’s success or strength is a matter of degree , unlike with deductive arguments .
There is no standard term for a successful inductive argument , but this article uses the term “ strong . ”
Inductive arguments that are not strong are said to be weak ; there is no sharp line between strong and weak .
The argument about the dog biting me would be stronger if we could n’t think of any relevant conditions for why the next time will be different than previous times .
The argument also will be stronger the more times there were when I did walk by the dog .
The argument will be weaker the fewer times I have walked by the dog .
It will be weaker if relevant conditions about the past time will be different next time , such as that in the past the dog has been behind a closed gate , but next time the gate will be open .
An inductive argument can be affected by acquiring new premises ( evidence ) , but a deductive argument cannot be .
For example , this is a reasonably strong inductive argument :
Today , John said he likes Romona .
So , John likes Romona today .
but its strength is changed radically when we add this premise :
John told Felipé today that he did n’t really like Romona .
The distinction between deductive and inductive argumentation was first noticed by the Aristotle ( 384-322 B.C.E. ) in ancient Greece .
The difference between deductive and inductive arguments does not lie in the words used within the arguments , but rather in the intentions of the arguer .
It comes from the relationship the arguer takes there to be between the premises and the conclusion .
If the arguer believes that the truth of the premises definitely establishes the truth of the conclusion , then the argument is deductive .
If the arguer believes that the truth of the premises provides only good reasons to believe the conclusion is probably true , then the argument is inductive .
If we who are assessing the quality of the argument have no information about the intentions of the arguer , then we check for both .
That is , we assess the argument to see whether it is deductively valid and whether it is inductively strong .
The concept of deductive validity can be given alternative definitions to help you grasp the concept .
Below are five different definitions of the same concept .
It is common to drop the word deductive from the term deductively valid :
An argument is valid if the premises can’t all be true without the conclusion also being true .
An argument is valid if the truth of all its premises forces the conclusion to be true .
An argument is valid if it would be inconsistent for all its premises to be true and its conclusion to be false .
An argument is valid if its conclusion follows with certainty from its premises .
An argument is valid if it has no counterexample , that is , a possible situation that makes all the premises true and the conclusion false .
Some analysts prefer to distinguish inductive arguments from “ conductive ” arguments ; the latter are arguments giving explicit reasons for and against a conclusion , and requiring the evaluator of the argument to weigh these competing considerations , that is , to consider the pros and cons .
This article considers conductive arguments to be a kind of inductive argument .
The noun “ deduction ” refers to the process of advancing or establishing a deductive argument , or going through a process of reasoning that can be reconstructed as a deductive argument .
“ Induction ” refers to the process of advancing an inductive argument , or making use of reasoning that can be reconstructed as an inductive argument .
Although inductive strength is a matter of degree , deductive validity and deductive soundness are not .
In this sense , deductive reasoning is much more cut and dried than inductive reasoning .
Nevertheless , inductive strength is not a matter of personal preference ; it is a matter of whether the premise ought to promote a higher degree of belief in the conclusion .
Because deductive arguments are those in which the truth of the conclusion is thought to be completely guaranteed and not just made probable by the truth of the premises , if the argument is a sound one , then we say the conclusion is “ contained within ” the premises ; that is , the conclusion does not go beyond what the premises implicitly require .
Think of sound deductive arguments as squeezing the conclusion out of the premises within which it is hidden .
For this reason , deductive arguments usually turn crucially upon definitions and rules of mathematics and formal logic .
Consider how the rules of formal logic apply to this deductive argument :
John is ill .
If John is ill , then he wo n’t be able to attend our meeting today .
Therefore , John wo n’t be able to attend our meeting today .
That argument is valid due to its formal or logical structure .
To see why , notice that if the word ‘ ill ’ were replaced with ‘ happy ’ , the argument would still be valid because it would retain its special logical structure ( called modus ponens by logicians ) .
Here is the form of any argument having the structure of modus ponens :
P
If P , then Q
So , Q
The capital letters should be thought of as variables that can be replaced with declarative sentences , or statements , or propositions , namely items that are true or false .
The investigation of logical forms that involve whole sentences and not their subjects and verbs and other parts is called Propositional Logic .
The question of whether all , or merely most , valid deductive arguments are valid because of their logical structure is still controversial in the field of the philosophy of logic , but that question will not be explored further in this article .
Inductive arguments can take very wide - ranging forms .
Some have the form of making a claim about a population or set based only on information from a sample of that population , a subset .
Other inductive arguments draw conclusions by appeal to evidence , or authority , or causal relationships .
There are other forms .
Here is a somewhat strong inductive argument having the form of an argument based on authority :
The police said John committed the murder .
So , John committed the murder .
Here is an inductive argument based on evidence :
The witness said John committed the murder .
So , John committed the murder .
Here is a stronger inductive argument based on better evidence :
Two independent witnesses claimed John committed the murder .
John ’s fingerprints are on the murder weapon .
John confessed to the crime .
So , John committed the murder .
This last argument , if its premises are known to be true , is no doubt good enough for a jury to convict John , but none of these three arguments about John committing the murder is strong enough to be called “ valid , ” at least not in the technical sense of deductively valid .
However , some lawyers will tell their juries that these are valid arguments , so we critical thinkers need to be on the alert as to how people around us are using the term “ valid . ”
You have to be alert to what they mean rather than what they say .
From the barest clues , the English detective Sherlock Holmes cleverly “ deduced ” who murdered whom , but actually he made only an educated guess .
Strictly speaking , he produced an inductive argument and not a deductive one .
Charles Darwin , who discovered the process of evolution , is famous for his “ deduction ” that circular atolls in the oceans are actually coral growths on the top of barely submerged volcanoes , but he really performed an induction , not a deduction .
It is worth noting that some dictionaries and texts define “ deduction ” as reasoning from the general to specific and define “ induction ” as reasoning from the specific to the general .
However , there are many inductive arguments that do not have that form , for example , “ I saw her kiss him , really kiss him , so I ’m sure she ’s having an affair . ”
The mathematical proof technique called “ mathematical induction ” is deductive and not inductive .
Proofs that make use of mathematical induction typically take the following form :
Property P is true of the natural number 0 .
For all natural numbers n , if P holds of n then P also holds of n + 1 .
Therefore , P is true of all natural numbers .
When such a proof is given by a mathematician , and when all the premises are true , then the conclusion follows necessarily .
Therefore , such an inductive argument is deductive .
It is deductively sound , too .
Because the difference between inductive and deductive arguments involves the strength of evidence which the author believes the premises provide for the conclusion , inductive and deductive arguments differ with regard to the standards of evaluation that are applicable to them .
The difference does not have to do with the content or subject matter of the argument , nor with the presence or absence of any particular word .
Indeed , the same utterance may be used to present either a deductive or an inductive argument , depending on what the person advancing it believes .
Consider as an example :
Dom Perignon is a champagne , so it must be made in France .
It might be clear from context that the speaker believes that having been made in the Champagne area of France is part of the defining feature of “ champagne ” and so the conclusion follows from the premise by definition .
If it is the intention of the speaker that the evidence is of this sort , then the argument is deductive .
However , it may be that no such thought is in the speaker ’s mind .
He or she may merely believe that nearly all champagne is made in France , and may be reasoning probabilistically .
If this is his or her intention , then the argument is inductive .
As noted , the distinction between deductive and inductive has to do with the strength of the justification that the arguer intends that the premises provide for the conclusion .
Another complication in our discussion of deduction and induction is that the arguer might intend the premises to justify the conclusion when in fact the premises provide no justification at all .
Here is an example :
All odd numbers are integers .
All even numbers are integers .
Therefore , all odd numbers are even numbers .
This argument is invalid because the premises provide no support whatsoever for the conclusion .
However , if this argument were ever seriously advanced , we must assume that the author would believe that the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion .
Therefore , this argument is still deductive .
It is not inductive .
Given the way the terms “ deductive argument ” and “ inductive argument ” are defined here , an argument is always one or the other and never both , but in deciding which one of the two it is , it is common to ask whether it meets both the deductive standards and inductive standards .
Given a set of premises and their intended conclusion , we analysts will ask whether it is deductively valid , and , if so , whether it is also deductively sound .
If it is not deductively valid , then we may go on to assess whether it is inductively strong .
We are very likely to use the information that the argument is not deductively valid to ask ourselves what premises , if they were to be assumed , would make the argument be valid .
Then we might ask whether these premises were implicit and intended originally .
Similarly , we might ask what premises are needed to improve the strength of an inductive argument , and we might ask whether these premises were intended all along .
If so , then we change our mind about what argument existed was back in the original passage .
So , the application of deductive and inductive standards is used in the process of extracting the argument from the passage within which it is embedded .
The process goes like this : Extract the argument from the passage ; assess it with deductive and inductive standards ; perhaps revise the decision about which argument existed in the original passage ; then reassess this new argument using our deductive and inductive standards .
Implicit premises and implicit features of explicit premises can play important roles in argument evaluation .
Suppose we want to know whether Julius Caesar did conquer Rome .
In response , some historian might point out that it could be concluded with certainty from these two pieces of information :
The general of the Roman Legions of Gaul crossed the Rubicon River and conquered Rome .
Caesar was the general of the Roman Legions in Gaul at that time .
That would produce a valid argument .
But now notice that , if “ at that time ” were missing from the second piece of information , then the argument would not be valid .
Here is why .
Maybe Caesar was the general at one time , but Tiberius was the general at the time of the river crossing and Rome conquering .
If the phrase “ at that time ” were missing , you the analyst have to worry about how likely it is that the phrase was intended .
So , you are faced with two arguments , one valid and one invalid , and you do n’t know which is the intended argument .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Wanted : Cheerful , chubby men , preferably with fluffy white beards and no criminal record , ready to work hard for one month .
Germany is running out of qualified Santa Clauses and needs to recruit and train them fast , a leading job agency says .
Germans are trying to shut out the financial crisis by taking comfort in traditional festivities , and there is an acute shortage of Santas to entertain children at shopping centers , Christmas markets and private parties .
“ Being Santa is not an easy job , ” Jens Wittenberger , in charge of Santa Claus recruitment at the Jobcafe Munich , told Reuters Monday .
“ To be honest , not many people have what it takes to be a good Father Christmas . ”
The job center wants its Santas to be child - friendly , good organizers , reliable and have acting skills .
They also need a clean police record .
“ You ca n’t have your Santa drive up in a car , ” said Wittenberger .
“ Every child knows that Santa travels in a sleigh pulled by reindeer so we do n’t want to disappoint anybody . ”
Santas are told to park their car a few streets away and walk .
“ People are turning to traditions to protect their children from the ‘ evils of the real world ’ , especially in the wake of this financial turmoil , ” Wittenberger said .
Recruitment sessions are being held in cities across the country , and while the job may be stressful , it ’s better than being jobless , Wittenberger said .
“ Santas can make up to 60 euros ( $ 75 ) an hour , ” he said .
“ That ’s not bad , is it ? ”
The cost to put a single drug dealer in jail is about $ 450,000 , composed of the following :
The cost for arrest and conviction is about $ 150,000 .
The cost for an additional prison bed is about $ 50,000 to $ 150,000 , depending upon the jurisdiction .
It costs about $ 30,000 per year to house a prisoner .
With an average sentence of 5 years , that adds up to another $ 150,000 .
The same $ 450,000 can provide treatment or education for about 200 people .
In addition , putting a person in prison produces about fifteen dollars in related welfare costs , for every dollar spent on incarceration .
Every dollar spent on treatment and education saves about five dollars in related welfare costs .

Emily Dickinson
Hermann Klaus Hugo Weyl ( 1885 -1955 ) .
German mathematical physicist .
In 1918 , proposed an early form of gauge symmetry in an attempt to unify electrodynamics and gravitation .
Subsequently applied a similar approach to quantum physics and discovered what is today considered one of the most profound and beautiful concepts in modern physics -- the principle of gauge invariance .
Shortly after Einstein announced his theory of general relativity ( gravitation ) in November 1915 , Weyl began an intensive study of the theory 's mathematics and was soon publishing related scientific papers dealing with its physical applications .
In 1918 Weyl published his book Raum - Zeit - Materie ( Space - Time - Matter ) , which provided the first fully comprehensive analysis of the geometric aspects of the theory and its relationship with spacetime physics .
One of the topics covered in the book was Weyl 's idea that gravity and electromagnetism might both be derivable from a generalization of Riemannian geometry , the mathematical basis from which Einstein had developed his relativity theory .
Weyl 's idea was based on a new mathematical symmetry that he called gauge invariance .
I came across Weyl 's book in 1975 , but it did n't impress me very much because I did n't know general relativity .
However , in the summer of that year I stumbled across Misner - Thorne - Wheeler 's massive Gravitation during a one - week work assignment in the microscopic rural town of Lone Pine , California ( which then had a population of perhaps 500 people ) .
Miraculously , the town 's tiny public library somehow had this book , which is now regarded as a classic graduate text on general relativity .
I checked out the book and brought it back to the hotel room to read in the off - hours .
The book took immediate and total possession of me , and motivated me to learn everything I could about general relativity .
( I spoke with co-author Kip Thorne about this in 1994 , and he was quite amused to learn where one of his books had ended up . )
But Gravitation is not an easy read , and I had to look for more introductory texts .
I soon came across Adler / Bazin / Schiffer 's Introduction to General Relativity , which besides being easier had a chapter on unified field theory , including Weyl 's 1918 theory of the combined gravitational - electromagnetic field .
For whatever reason , the theory 's mathematical beauty absolutely fascinated me .
I had known about local and global phase invariance from my studies of quantum mechanics , but I was not aware that Weyl 's theory was the origin of this powerful symmetry principle in quantum physics .
I have since read all of Weyl 's books and many of his papers .
Although today I believe that my interest is now based more on an appreciation of modern gauge theory ( easily the most profound and beautiful concept of physics ) , I credit Weyl for having initiated the idea in 1918 and for his subsequent ( 1929 ) seminal application of the idea to the then still - developing quantum theory .
In his 2002 biographical memoirs , the great contemporary mathematician Sir Michael F. Atiyah praised Weyl as the discoverer of the gauge concept and as the driving force behind the current emphasis of gauge theories on modern theoretical physics :
The past 25 years have seen the rise of gauge theories -- Kaluza - Klein models of high dimensions , string theories , and now M - theory , as physicists grapple with the challenge of combining all the basic forces of nature into one all embracing theory .
This requires sophisticated mathematics involving Lie groups , manifolds , differential operators , all of which are part of Weyl 's inheritance .
There is no doubt that he would have been an enthusiastic supporter and admirer of this fusion of mathematics and physics .
No other mathematician could claim to have initiated more of the theories that are now being explored .
His vision has stood the test of time .
Weyl was an exceptionally gifted mathematician and physicist , but he was also a highly cultured man in the classical German tradition .
He studied and wrote extensively on philosophy and was a serious student of German poetry and literature .
His mathematical writing style could be exceedingly obtuse , but his other writings reveal a genuinely warm person who truly understood the human condition .
Weyl was also very human himself ; he could be overly thoughtful and cautious , often to the point of being unable to take action or make even basic decisions , and sometimes with the result that he became physically incapacitated .
He was a devoted and loving husband and father , yet he could also be persuaded to stray , in accordance with the surprisingly liberal attitudes of post - World War I Weimar society .
T his website is my feeble attempt to document ( and in many cases expand on ) Weyl 's ideas and thoughts on gauge symmetry in a manner that will be accessible to anyone with a basic understanding of calculus .
Not a lot has been written about the original theory 's underlying mathematics , and I wanted to provide a fairly detailed and complete mathematical description for those who want to learn about Weyl 's ideas and to appreciate the beauty of his gauge theory ( I 'm even of the opinion that much of Weyl 's work can be understood and appreciated at the high school / beginning university level ) .
As this site progresses , I will also include discussions of other topics in mathematical physics ( as well as some related scientific philosophy ) which exhibit a similar mathematical beauty and elegance .
I turn off on the dodgy road to Shwt , which to the non-Welsh ear sounds somewhere between “ shoot ” and “ shit . ”
A blind curve descends to a narrow stone bridge over a little river rippling through a grove of dwarf oaks .
It ’s a glorious , sun-flooded spring morning .
The oaks are still leafless , but daffodils are out everywhere , the gorse is spattered with yellow blossoms , and the tits and thrushes are singing their hearts out .
There ’s nothing suicidal about this rolling , pastoral landscape , drenched with the sense of being inhabited for thousands of years , that I can detect .
But a few years ago , a local 17 - year - old boy left his car running and gassed himself here .
While there has always been a lot of suicide in the lowlands of South Wales , what ’s been happening lately in the county borough of Bridgend is something different and very troubling .
Since January of 2007 , 25 people between the ages of 15 and 28 have killed themselves within 10 miles of here , all by hanging , except for one 15 - year - old , who lay down on the tracks before an oncoming train after he was teased for being gay .
This is n’t just a series of unrelated , individual acts .
It ’s an outbreak — a localized epidemic — of a desire to leave this world that is particularly contagious to teenagers , who are impressionable and impulsive and , apparently in Bridgend , not finding many reasons for wanting to stick around .
It represents , if the official statistics are to be believed , a fivefold increase in Bridgend ’s young - male suicide rate in three years .
Outbreaks like this are rare but not new .
Plutarch writes about an epidemic of suicide by young women in the Greek city of Miletus that was stopped by the threat that their naked corpses would be dragged through the streets .
Sigmund Freud , who himself committed assisted suicide , held a conference in the 1920s on teen - suicide clusters .
They have happened in Germany , Australia , Japan , the U.S. , Canada , and Micronesia .
Psychologists familiar with the phenomenon are saying that what ’s going on in Wales is a classic case of the Werther effect , named for Goethe ’s novel The Sorrows of Young Werther , about a young man who puts a gun to his head to end the agony of unrequited love and because he can’t find his place in the provincial bourgeois society of the day .
The novel ’s publication , in 1774 , prompted young men all over Europe to dress like Werther and take their lives .
It ’s also called the contagion effect and copycat suicide : one person does it , and that lowers the threshold , making it easier and more permissible for the next .
Like 10 people waiting at a crosswalk for the light to change , and one of them jaywalks .
This gives the rest of them the go - ahead .
Publicity dramatically accelerates the spread of the contagion .
In the late 1970s , there were a number of self - immolations in England and Wales , and within a year after the media picked up on them , the toll shot up to 82 .
Many of them were women in their 30s , even though mature adults have more life under their belts and are less vulnerable than adolescents to mass psychogenic behavior , and females are statistically much less prone to take their own lives .
But humans in general are highly suggestible , especially when things are n’t falling into place .
This particular epidemic in Wales has followed the pattern .
On January 17 of last year , the first female — and the 15th suicide in the cluster — a pretty 17 - year - old named Natasha Randall , was found hanging in her bedroom in Blaengarw , a depressed former coal - mining town a few miles north of here .
This was front - page stuff .
The tabloids descended on Bridgend , and the story went national , then international , in less than a week .
The sudden global attention precipitated — or permitted — four hangings over the next month .
Three of them were girls .
It is unusual for girls to hang themselves .
Girls care more about how they are going to look , a suicide specialist told me .
They overdose or cut their wrists .
They are more prone to do it as a cry for help than to go through with it .
( This is known in psychopathological parlance as parasuicide : deliberate self - harm without real suicidal intent . )
I am sure all of you have used ‘ echo ’ and ‘ print_r ’ to debug PHP .
We all know that this way debugging is hard and you need to remember to remove them from production server .
Well , thanks to xdebug you can now debug , and you do n’t need expensive or blotted IDE for that , just plain and simple Notepad + + can do the job .
In this post we will setup xdebug and DBGp plugin with Notepad ++.
Let ’s start by installing xdebug .
Download the latest release of xdebug for PHP version you are using .
Copy xdebug dll file into php ’s extension directory , in my case , as I use wamp , it is c:wampphpext .
Now we need to configure xdebug so that it get recognized by PHP , so open php.ini
Add following at the end of your php.ini file [ xdebug ] zend_extension_ts="c:/wamp/php/ext/php_xdebug-2.0.3-5.2.5.dll " xdebug.profiler_output_dir = " c:/wamp/tmp/xdebug " xdebug.profiler_output_name = " cachegrind.out . %p " xdebug.profiler_enable = 0 xdebug.profiler_append=0 xdebug.extended_info=1 xdebug.remote_enable=1 xdebug.remote_handler=dbgp xdebug.remote_mode=req xdebug.remote_host=127.0.0.1 xdebug.remote_port=9000 xdebug.idekey=xdebug xdebug.remote_log="c:/wamp/tmp/xdebug/xdebug_remot.log " xdebug.show_exception_trace=0 xdebug.show_local_vars=9 xdebug.show_mem_delta=0 xdebug.trace_format=0
Just create a folder ‘ xdebug ’ in ‘ c:wamptmp ’ folder .
Finally restart Apache service .
With these steps you have , finished xdebug installation , it is configured for profiling application and remote debugging .
Check documentation to know what all these configuration do , and tweak according to your preference .
We will now install DBGP plugin for Notepad ++.
Make sure you have latest version of Notepad ++ is installed .
Download the latest release of DBGp Plugin .
Unzip and move dbgpPlugin.dll file to plugins folder of your notepad ++ installation folder , in my case the path is “ C: Program FilesNotepad ++ plugins ” .
Check out the readme .
txt file , that is bundled with plugin , to make sure we do n’t miss anything .
Now open Notepad ++ , and you should see DBGp option in plugins menu .
Well we are now almost finished with setup , only ting remaining is to configure DBGP to listen to right port and we are done .
Goto “ Plugins -> DBGp -> Config ” to open the configuration screen of DBGp plugin .
Fill the details as shown in the image above .
IDE KEY should be same to the one you specified in php.ini settings above .
Click
Ok and you are done .
To start debugging just add “ ? XDEBUG_SESSION_START=session_name ” at end of you url .
‘ session_name ’ could be anything you want to keep .

Something just happened that I ’d like advice on ( from you or your readers ) .
My son has been diagnosed with ADHD by his pediatrician and I figured we ’d go to a child psychologist for more info ( an idea the pediatrician encouraged ) .
I picked the closest one on my insurance ’s coverage list and set up an appointment .
Luckily , we got an informational packet in the mail from this psychologist ( actually a Licensed Professional Counselor ) before we actually went to meet with her .
Let me quote some of the things that were in her packet .
The counselor ’s responsibilities are :
* Spending personal time with the Lord
* Praying for the client
* Studying scriptures
* Listening to client concerns , facts , feelings , faith position
* Sharing scripture and personal walk appropriate to client concerns
* Praying with the client , acknowledging God ’s available presence with him / her
She holds a Master ’s degree in Religious Education from a Baptist theological seminary ( in addition to other more valid sounding degrees ) .
She signs off by saying , “ I have already begun to pray for our times together … ”
I was dumbfounded by this .
I mean , I do live in the Bible Belt , so I should n’t have been surprised .
But I am still dismayed that this person appeared on a list of medical providers supplied by my insurance company !
I guess my question is , how do I keep this from happening again ?
( I cancelled the appointment , of course . )
Do I need to call and explicitly ask each psychologist ( or whatever other health care specialist ) if their practice is based in reality or superstition ?
When first calling to schedule an appointment , inquire about the provider 's degree and the institution from where the degree was obtained .
If the degree is from a fundamentalist Christian school , you can probably move on .
If the provider is an LPC , ask directly whether this person provides " Christian counseling . "
If so , move on .
You are not asking whether the counselor is Christian but whether they provide " Christian counseling . "
This is an important difference and one which you are well advised to heed .
View the initial appointment as an opportunity to evaluate the provider .
If you do not feel comfortable for any reason , ask for a referral and move on .
Reputable providers tend to encourage this sort of evaluation - they want to make sure they can be helpful to you and that you feel comfortable with them .
, ask for a referral and move on .
Reputable providers tend to encourage this sort of evaluation - they want to make sure they can be helpful to you and that you feel comfortable with them .
Recognize that many mental health professionals will ask , on questionnaires or in person , something about your religious affiliation or the importance of spirituality in your life .
They tend to do this to help understand your worldview and not to convert you .
However , if the provider makes disparaging comments about your lack of religious participation , spirituality , and the like , move on .
This represents a violation of the provider 's professional ethics , and you deserve better .
If you are seeking therapy and want to make sure that your provider will utilize scientifically - sound methods , look for someone who provides cognitive - behavioral therapy .
Of all the therapeutic modalities , it has been researched the most extensively and has the most evidence supporting its efficacy .
I guess it was the title of Friendly Atheist 's post ( " Can You Avoid Religious Psychologists ? " ) that struck a nerve and prompted this post .
As an atheist , it ticks me off when people spread misconceptions about atheists .
I suppose as someone with a background in the mental health field , I feel similarly when it comes to my profession .
The good news is that it is much more difficult to find a psychologist , counselor , or other mental health professional who will push religion on his or her clients than it is one who would never dream of doing so .
That said , it is important that atheists seeking a mental health provider are able to find one with whom they will feel comfortable .
In this post , I will use Friendly Atheist 's post as a springboard for sharing some tips on selecting a mental health provider .
A reader contacted Friendly Atheist and had the following to say :
The reader did the right thing by canceling the appointment .
This sort of thing certainly can happen , but it is fortunately uncommon and fairly easy to avoid .
There are some poorly trained , unethical and / or seriously deluded mental health practitioners out there , but they are the minority .
This is true even here in the Bible Belt .
First , I 'd like to clarify some credentialing terminology .
The provider described by the reader was a Licensed Professional Counselor ( LPC ) and not a psychologist .
The LPC is a master 's - level designation as opposed to the doctoral degree psychologists have .
There are many excellent LPCs out there , and they are a cheaper alternative when one does not need the additional expertise of a psychologist .
So when might one need the additional expertise of a psychologist ?
First , a psychologist will generally have more extensive research training than a master 's level clinician .
This does not necessarily mean they are better , but it does mean that they are more likely to operate as scientist - practitioners than master 's - level clinicians .
The more complex the problem , the greater benefit can be derived from someone with this additional training .
Second , psychologists can do psychological testing .
I mention this not only because it is a critical difference but because it might be relevant to Friendly Atheist 's reader .
Medical doctors are fairly quick to diagnose ADHD , and psychological testing is likely to result in a more accurate diagnosis .
For the atheist who needs a mental health professional , I offer the following recommendations :

Newswise — Vacationing at the shore led to a 5 percent increase in nevi ( more commonly called " moles " ) among 7 - year - old children , according to a paper published in Cancer Epidemiology , Biomarkers and Prevention , a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research .
Number of nevi is the major risk factor for malignant melanoma , the most dangerous form of skin cancer .
Melanoma rates have been rising dramatically over recent decades .
More than 62,000 Americans are diagnosed with melanoma each year and more than 8,000 die .
The study was conducted among children who lived in Colorado , but lead author Lori Crane , Ph.D. , M.P.H. , chair of the Department of Community and Behavioral Health at the Colorado School of Public Health , said the findings are applicable worldwide .
" Parents of young children need to be cautious about taking their kids on vacations that are going to be sun-intensive at waterside locations , where people are outside for whole days at a time in skin- exposing swimsuits , " said Crane .
Crane said parents often mistakenly believe that sunscreen is a cure - all .
Although it does offer some protection , the likelihood is that children stay out in the sun longer , thus increasing their risk .
" We recommend that , for young children , parents keep the kids involved in indoor activities from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. to decrease risk , or if they are to be outside , that they wear shirts with sleeves , " said Crane .
Crane and colleagues examined 681 white children born in 1998 who were lifetime residents of Colorado .
Vacation histories were assessed by interview and skin exams were used to evaluate the development of nevi .
Researchers observed that each waterside vacation one or more years prior to the exam at age 7 was linked to a 5 percent increase in nevi , or skin moles , less than two mm .
" Daily sun exposure at home did not seem to be related to the number of moles , while waterside vacations were .
Vacations may impart some unique risk for melanoma , " said Crane .
Crane and colleagues also found that young boys had a 19 percent higher risk than young girls for nevi development .
" This may be due to an increased likelihood among boys to want to stay outdoors , " said Crane .
Finally , higher incomes were associated with greater risk , as those with higher incomes were more likely to take waterside vacations .

i Phone application developers have until February 2 , 2009 to submit comments to the Copyright Office in support of EFF 's proposal for a DMCA exemption for iPhone owners who want to " jailbreak " their iPhones to gain the freedom to install applications of their choice .
If you 're an iPhone app developer , and you have a story about your frustration with Apple 's chokehold over iPhone apps , please share it with the Copyright Office .
Legalizing jailbreaking is a critical step in loosening Apple 's grip and creating an open market for iPhone applications .
Apple uses " software locks " to prevent applications other than those sold from the iTunes App Store from running on the iPhone .
The process of modifying an iPhone to run applications from other sources is known as " jailbreaking " ( this is different from " unlocking , " which generally refers to modifying an iPhone to operate with a different network carrier ) .
Although hundreds of thousands of iPhone owners have already jailbroken their phones , Apple is likely to argue that the act of jailbreaking violates the DMCA 's ban on circumventing software locks .
In an effort to lift this legal cloud , EFF has proposed that the Copyright Office grant a 3 - year exemption from the DMCA to permit jailbreaking .
Apple 's shackling iPhone owners to the iTunes App Store has nothing to do with protecting Apple software from piracy .
Instead , it 's all about limiting competition and innovation on the iPhone platform .
For example , Apple has refused to approve iPhone apps that compete with Apple 's own software , such as Mail , Safari , and iTunes .
Apple has also censored ebooks from the App Store .
And developers of iPhone VoIP applications have also encountered inexplicable delays in app approval .
So , if you 're an iPhone developer , and you are frustrated with Apple 's iPhone app approval process , please consider sharing your experience with the Copyright Office and supporting EFF 's proposed DMCA exemption for jailbreaking .
Real cases / scenarios are some time hard to come by and definitely you want to be prepared when you are in such a situation .
It is good that you can create such scenario yourself .
In my Part 2 regarding shell script performance , I asked my audiences to come up with the fastest way to create 1000 files .
of course you do not want to wait for minutes or hours for just 1000 files .
What if you want to test on 10,000 or even 100,000 files ?
With that many files in your directory , you can practice your shell scripting by changing the prefix , suffix , extension , padding with zeros , ... , the amount of things you can script is endless .
In Part 1 , we understand that process creation is a very expensive task and we should avoid running too many commands , especially within a loop .
So I am not going to use the traditional approach like this one :
count=1 ; while [ $ count - le 100 ] ; do touch file - $ count.txt ; count=`expr $ count + 1` ; done
Below shows you various ways to ' skin a cat ' :
create1.sh - use ' seq ' to generate 1 to 1000 number to be used in a for loop and each loop create a new file create2.sh - use Bash shell built - in capability to do brace expansion create3.sh - use ' seq - f ' to generate the file name and supply that to touch to create all the files .
[ Thanks to comment by pjz ] create.tcl - a Tcl implementation create.py - a Python implementation
And the run time :
As you can see , the less commands you used the shortest the run time .
In this case , pjz won !.
In create2.sh , I introduced Bash shell brace expansion which is a very useful feature in doing command expansion .
See this blog in how I create 48 ' devices ' ( c0d0t0s0 , ... ) in a single command line .

The wish of a pianist , who passed away 26 years ago , has been turned into reality .
He wanted his skull to appear on stage in the graveyard scene of the famous William Shakespeare 's tragedy " Hamlet " .
The Sun newspaper reported that actors used the skull of Andre Tchaikowsky in rehearsals since the man willed it to the Royal Shakespeare Company .
A run of performances has ended up in Stratford - on - Avon , where David Tennant , actor who plays Hamlet , held the skull intoning " Alas , poor Yorick , I knew him , Horatio ... "
Till the final performance no one from the audience knew that the actor was holding a real skull .
It is worth mentioning that Andre Tchaikowsky , who was a Polish pianist , was a huge fan of William Shakespeare and " Hamlet " was his favorite work .
The pianist frequently paid visits to Stratford to see the performances of Royal Shakespeare Company .
" It was Andre 's dream .
They will be pleased he has made it on stage , " said Dave Ferre , who is a friend of the Tchaikowsky 's family .
David Tennant , who is mostly known for his role in " Doctor Who , " hopes to use the pianist 's skull again when the production of Shakespeare 's tragedy opens in Britain 's capital .
According to David Howells , the Royal Shakespeare Company archivist , for the last time a real skull has been used back in the 19th century .

The massive economic stimulus package being debated in the US Senate this week has a hugely controversial condition attached .
Caterpillar has come out against the " Buy America " provisions
It is called " Buy American " and it means that all of the projects financed by the government 's $ 800 bn ( £ 567bn ) bailout should favour American iron and steel .
It could , perhaps , even mandate American preference for all " manufactured goods " .
Could this be the start of a new American protectionism ?
Even a new trade war ?
There are big principles - and great passions - on both sides of the argument .
It seems to be abstract , but it could have a huge global impact .
More jobs I met the president of the United Steelworkers Union Leo Gerard this week .
He had two reasons to celebrate : his football team - the Pittsburgh Steelers - had just pulled off a Superbowl victory against the Arizona Cardinals ; and he had seen the " Buy American " provision attached to President Obama 's economic stimulus plan clear its first hurdle in the House of Representatives .
The bill was up for debate in the Senate on Tuesday and may jump that hurdle by the end of the week .
What does it mean ?
The steelworkers say it is about putting stimulus cash - American taxpayers ' dollars - towards American jobs .
This at a time when the domestic steel industry has fallen below 40 % capacity for the first time in history .
Mr Gerard is known for his straight - talking .
Why should we send dollars to China , so that they can ship us more junk steel ?
Leo Gerard
President , United Steelworkers UNion
It is " baloney " , he says , to argue the case for spending billions to prop up US banks , then cry foul about a commitment to buy US steel .
His case has strong backing in Congress from Democrats who represent big steel states - Pennsylvania , Ohio , Indiana .
Ohio Democrat Tim Ryan has calculated that using wholly domestic input for infrastructure projects here will yield an extra 77,000 jobs across America .
" We 're going to spend this money in Youngstown , Warren , Akron " he says .
" Not Beijing , Mumbai or Dubai . "
Mr Gerard is blunter still : " Why should we send dollars to China , so that they can ship us more junk steel ? "
But there is a predictable backlash in Congress .
The senior Republican in the US Senate , Mitch McConnell , has warned that the provision could lead to trade wars .
" The entire world is experiencing a downturn in the economy , " he says .
" I think it 's a very bad idea " .
' Tipping point ' Even American industry itself is split .
Blue - chip companies like General Electric , Boeing , and Caterpillar have come out against the " Buy American " provisions , which could funnel millions their way .
The reason ?
Exports .
William Lane speaks for Caterpillar here in Washington .
He told me this could be the " tipping point " into global economic depression , if the measure goes ahead .
His company wants to ship tools and trucks and excavators not just around America , but across South - East Asia .
More than half of Caterpillar 's sales go abroad .
Nobody will take this lying down
John Bruton
EU ambassador to Washington
He believes a trade war will end up costing his company at home - and that is on top of its current layoff estimate of 20,000 jobs .
Free - traders are using words like " shortsighted " , " foolish " , " selfish " and " stupid " to describe the " Buy American " provision .
The Dallas Federal Reserve president Richard Fisher - who is a former deputy US trade representative - warned on Monday that " protectionism is the crack cocaine of economics " .
" It provides an immediate high that leads to economic death , " he said .
" We can not afford to go down that route . "
Would retaliation be inevitable ?
Yes , according to international leaders from Canada to the EU to the WTO .
Looking for leadership John Bruton , the European Commission 's ambassador in Washington , and former Irish leader , says : " Nobody will take this lying down . "
He says it would take the world right down the road it travelled in the 1930s - when , he believes , retaliatory protectionism led to the Great Depression lasting years longer than it would otherwise have done .
It would be " very helpful " , he says , if the new US administration would make it clear where it stands .
So what does America 's new president do about the campaign to " Buy American " ?
During the election campaign , touring key swing states like Pennsylvania and Ohio , Barack Obama promised to stand up for American workers .
During the election campaign , touring European capitals like London and Berlin , he promised a new multilateral American foreign policy .
Now , can he pull those two pledges together with a demonstration of clear leadership on US trade policy ?
President Obama 's first comments came on Tuesday night in a series of interviews with the US TV networks .
There was n't much detail , but the message seemed designed to head off foreign fears .
To one network , he said " we ca n't send a protectionist message " ; to another , " any provisions that are in there are not going to trigger a trade war " .
Does that mean he 's applying pressure to his own party leaders behind the scenes ?
We 'll see as the debate continues in the US Senate this week .
What 's clear is that Obama 's current high standing outside America 's borders could be diminished if - on one of his first foreign forays to the G20 meeting in London this April - he has to admit that he 's overseeing a shift in American outlook towards a new protectionism .

ACLU calls for end to ' inhumane ' nose tube - feeding of Guantanamo detainees RAW STORY
Published : Friday January 9 , 2009
Print This Email This FROM A RELEASE // FRIDAY 314PM ET // NEW YORK 
In light of recent media reports that 25 hunger striking detainees at Guantánamo are being force - fed through tubes in their noses , the American Civil Liberties Union sent an urgent letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates urging him to end the inhumane and unlawful practice .
The letter asks Secretary Gates to allow independent medical professionals to review and monitor the status of hunger - striking detainees in a manner consistent with international ethical standards and to order authorities at the detention facility to revise any procedure that authorizes force - feeding of detainees .
The ACLUs letter states that 30 of the 250 men detained at Guantánamo are on hunger strikes , apparently taking the extreme measure in order to protest their indefinite and arbitrary detention at the prison .
Force - feeding contravenes U.S. domestic and international law , the ACLU says .
The full text of the ACLUs letter to Secretary Gates appears below .
January 9 , 2009
Dr. Robert M. Gates
Secretary
United States Department of Defense
1000 Defense Pentagon
Washington , DC 20301- 1000
Dear Secretary Gates ,
I am writing to bring your attention to the cruel , inhuman , degrading and unlawful treatment of the thirty hunger striking detainees currently held at the Guantánamo Bay detention facility .
This recent wave of hunger strikes at Guantánamo coincides with the eve of the seventh anniversary of the opening of the controversial detention facility that President - elect Obama has committed to closing .
According to press reports , thirty of the 250 men currently detained at Guantánamo are on hunger strike , the highest number in months .
These detainees , none of whom have been charged with a crime , appear to be taking this extreme measure in order to protest their indefinite and arbitrary detention , conditions of confinement and lack of meaningful access to courts .
By refusing food , these detainees hope to bring public attention to these matters of international concern .
Detainees at Guantánamo who refuse nine consecutive meals are classified as being hunger strikers .
Twenty - five of the thirty men classified as such are now being force - fed through tubes inserted in their noses .
These twenty - five detainees have refused food for twenty - one consecutive days and / or weigh less than eighty - five percent of their weight on arrival at the detention facility , according to Pauline Storum , Deputy Commander for Public Affairs for Joint Task Force Guantánamo .
Approval for the force - feeding procedure is acquired through sign - off from both a doctor and the prison camps commander .
The unlawful force - feeding procedure requires that guards and medical professionals strap the detainee into a chair , Velcro his head to a metal restraint , then tether a tube into the mans stomach through his nose to pump in liquid nourishment twice a day .
3
Two of the striking detainees have been force - fed through tubes in their noses since August 2005 .
One of these detainees , Imad Hassan , a thirty - year old Yemeni , has been fed through a tube periodically for the last three years and suffers from digestive and pancreatic problems , among other severe health issues .
Debilitating risks of force - feeding include major infections , pneumonia and collapsed lungs .
Five detainees held at Guantánamo have died in custody since the facility opened in January 2002 .
Four of these detainees allegedly committed suicide as an apparent consequence of the cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment they suffered from and the despair they experienced while being indefinitely detained without meaningful access to courts and fair trials .
A 2006 joint report submitted by five independent human rights experts of the United Nations Human Rights Council ( formerly the Commission on Human Rights ) found that the mistreatment of detainees at Guantánamo has had profound and long - term mental effects on many of them and that conditions of confinement have led to individual and mass suicide attempts , widespread and prolonged hunger strikes and over 350 acts of self - harm in 2003 alone .
Force - feeding is universally considered to be a form of cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment .
The aforementioned 2006 United Nations report authoritatively declares that the manner in which detainees are force - fed and the ethics and legality of the practice of force - feeding , regardless of the manner in which it is undertaken , are matters of grave and distinct human rights concerns .
The report additionally stated that the confirmed force - feeding of detainees on hunger strike amounted to torture as defined in Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which the United States ratified in 1994 .
The report also asserts that doctors and other health professionals authorizing and participating in force - feeding procedures on detainees are in violation of the rights to health and other human rights , including those outlined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which the United States ratified in 1992 .
The U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health shared in the same communication that he had received reports , many confirmed by investigations of the United States military , that health professionals in Guantánamo Bay have systematically violated widely accepted ethical standards set out in the United Nations Principles of Medical Ethics and the Declaration of Tokyo [ of the World Medical Association ( WMA ) ] .
. .
Alleged violations include . . . being present during or engaging in non-consensual treatment , including drugging and force - feeding . "
In its 1975 Declaration of Tokyo , the WMA prohibited force - feeding and advised  where a prisoner refuses nourishment and is considered by the physician as capable of forming an unimpaired and rational judgment concerning the consequences of such a voluntary refusal of nourishment , he or she shall not be fed artificially . 
The WMAs subsequent 1991 Declaration of Malta reinforces that forced feeding contrary to an informed and voluntary refusal is unjustifiable  and recognizes the hunger strike as a form of protest by people who lack other ways of making their demands known . 
Finally , the WMAs Declaration on Hunger Strikers states ,  Forcible feeding is never ethically acceptable .
Even if intended to benefit , feeding accompanied by threats , coercion , force or use of physical restraints is a form of inhuman and degrading treatment .
The American Medical Association is a member of the WMA .
The Department of Defense policy allows health professionals to force - feed a detainee when his hunger strike threatens his life or health .
The aforementioned 2006 United Nations report renders this United States policy to be inconsistent with the principle of individual autonomy , the policy of the World Medical Association and the American Medical Association , as well as the position of [ International Committee of the Red Cross ] doctors . 
Finally , the practice of forced feeding constitutes a violation of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 which prohibits the cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment or punishment of detainees regardless of nationality or physical location , treatment which includes force - feeding .
Force - feeding may also be in violation of U.S. Supreme Court holdings in Cruzan v. Director , Missouri Department of Health and Washington v. Glucksberg that individuals necessarily possess a fundamental right to refuse lifesaving medical treatment .
We respectfully and urgently request that you immediately order the prison camps commander to cease all force - feeding of detainees who are capable of forming a rational judgment and are aware of the consequences of refusing food .
We also urge you to allow independent medical professionals to review and monitor the status of hunger - striking detainees in a manner consistent with international ethical standards .
We also request that you order authorities at the detention facility to revise any procedure that allows force - feeding of detainees .
In light of the dire and devastating consequences of force - feeding on hunger - striking detainees at Guantánamo , we respectfully request your immediate attention to this matter .
Respectfully ,

By my count , we 've seen three types of time travel recently on ABC's Lost .
Desmond 's mind - trips , the island itself vanishing , and people jumping around the island 's past .
Will one theory ever explain all three ?
Advertisement
Personally , I love time travel stories , even when they do n't quite make sense - as is frequently the case .
At least Lost is scoring points for me in one area : it has already stated definitively that a time - traveler can't change his / her own past , which is an important question to resolve .
( And I think it invalidates this site 's theory . )
In other words , when you travel through time , you do n't create a new timeline , you just visit other points on the same , immutable timeline .
( Of course , we 've already got an escape clause , because the rules do n't apply to Desmond .
We 'll have to see whom else they do n't apply to ...)
Advertisement
What do other TV shows do ?
Most TV shows involving time travel try to have it both ways at various times - I 'm looking at you , Doctor Who and Star Trek !
They 'll show how you can go back in time and alter your own timeline , but then try to play the " predestination paradox " game .
( Data traveled back in time because he saw his head in the ground , and his head was in the ground because he traveled back in time .
But if traveling back in time creates a new timeline , as Trek has shown on numerous other occasions , Data 's head should n't have been in the ground until he 'd already traveled backwards in time . )
So far , Lost has n't tried anything so silly .
Besides Doctor
Who , a few other current shows seem to be toying with time travel on a regular basis .
Lost 's companion show Life On Mars has a cop whose mind has been thrown back in time to 1973 , but that show seems months ( or years ) away from explaining what 's actually happening .
On Heroes , I honestly can't tell what the rules are supposed to be - like , I thought the goodies erased the future timeline where Ando killed Hiro , but last night they were talking about it as if it was a fixed point in the future .
So far , Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles has kept a pretty consistent view of time travel : every time you travel back , you create a new timeline .
So the future that Kyle Reese came back from in the original movie is long gone , and even the future that his brother Derek Reese came from is kaput .

Lost 's 3 Forms Of Time Travel
Advertisement
The episode " The Constant " basically made sense to me - Desmond was unstuck in his own timeline , skipping between his past and his present .
His body was n't going anywhere , and the time travel was strictly neurological .
It seemed just about plausible that that could happen .
( And even though Desmond is " special , " we 've seen that happen to other people , including the radio operator and that lady in Oxford . )
But now we 've seen two other things : the island vanishing , and the castaways coming physically unstuck .
They 're treated as if they 're sort of the same thing , but they 're obviously not .
( If the island itself was skipping through time , should n't its inhabitants be staying put , as the waters around the island change ? )
Advertisement
" Think of the island as a record , spinning on a turntable , " says Daniel Faraday .
" Only now , that record is skipping . "
Advertisement
It 's interesting that - as far as I can remember - we 've never seen what happens when Locke , Sawyer and friends " time travel " from the point of view of someone else .
What does Ethan or Richard Alpert see , when Locke vanishes ?
Does Locke actually physically disappear , or does something else happen ?
I have a feeling there may be a surprise waiting for us there .
Commenter Putch points out that temporal wrangling comes into play a couple of other ways : Daniel proved that time is moving at a different speed on the island than off .
And when Ben left the island , he apparently traveled forward in time to 2005 .
Advertisement
What 's the actual science here ?
In the season premiere " Because You Left , " Dr. Marvin Candle says the Orchid Station is on top of a store of " exotic matter . "
Physicist Michio Kaku told Popular Mechanics that nobody really knows much about exotic matter :
Such matter would have " formed when the Earth was young , and then floated into outer space , " Kaku says , " and therefore there 's none left on Earth . "
However , it may have been possible for a pocket of the matter to become accidentally trapped underground .
Physicists theorize that exotic matter could have antigravitational properties ( so it would fall up ) or it would have negative energy ( absorbing energy around it , possibly making it implosive ) .
And if it were to have antigravitational properties , it would n't want to stay on Earth either ; instead , it would rocket into space - violently .
" It would be quite dangerous to people who encounter it , " says Kaku .
Advertisement
Kaku also has suggested , on other occasions , that a black hole or wormhole could be involved in the island 's time travel , but it would require fantastic amounts of energy .
That would explain Mrs. Hawking 's equations : they 're probability equations , because she 's calculating a radiation effect .
( Radiation has to do with the stability of the wormhole . )
Note that in one episode , we see one of the Others reading Stephen Hawking 's A Brief History Of Time , and it 's open to a page on black holes .
Advertisement
Does Alpert have two compasses ?
Advertisement
BuddyTV brings up an interesting point :
Lost seems to be trying to avoid time paradoxes with its rule against changing the timeline .
So when Locke meets Alpert in 1954 , from Alpert 's point of view this meeting " always happened . "
But what about Alpert 's compass ?
FutureAlpert gives Locke his compass , so Locke can give it back to him in 1954 .
Does this mean that the compass is stuck in a time loop ?
Is there only one compass , which Alpert gives to Locke in the future , and then Locke gives back to him in the past ?
Or does the 1954 version of Alpert have two compasses now ?
Also , does Alpert only know to give his compass to Locke because he remembers Locke giving it to him in 1954 ?
Advertisement
Also , TVoholic points out , Daniel sends the brain of his rat , Eloise , back in time , and now she already knows how to run his maze - because FutureDaniel taught her .
But why will Daniel teach Eloise to run the maze , when she now already knows how ?
Where / when did the island itself go ?
As I mentioned , I do n't think we 've ever seen Locke or Sawyer " disappear " when a flash happens and they travel through time .
We do n't know what happens to them from the standpoint of an outside observer .
But we have seen the island itself vanish .
So where / when is it ?
Advertisement
The fact that the people who were on the island at the time are " skipping through time " would n't explain the disappearance of the island itself .
The island can't be visiting its own past , because then you 'd have two near - identical islands occupying the same space .
( Which I 'm guessing would be bad . )
We probably wo n't learn more about the island 's actual , physical disappearance until we see the Oceanic Six try to return .
At least , I 'm hoping that returning to the island will clarify where / when it 's got to .
Advertisement
So will Lost 's time travel ever entirely make sense ?
Well , it 'll probably make more sense than time travel on Heroes or Star Trek , but I 'm guessing there will be some hand - waving involved .
At the same time , we 're probably 27 Earth - shattering revelations and twists between now and the final , absolute explanation of Lost 's clock - buggery .
Finally it is up .
Man was this weekend a mess .
Hopefully the week will be better !
See you tomorrow .
A carefully coordinated global ATM heist last November resulted in a one - day haul of $ 9 million in cash , after a hacker penetrated a server at payment processor RBS WorldPay , New York ’s Fox 5 reports .
RBS WorldPay announced on December 23 that they ’d been hacked , and personal information on approximately 1.5 million payroll - card and gift - card customers had been stolen .
( Payroll cards are debit cards issued and recharged by employers as an alternative to paychecks and direct - deposit . )
Now we know that account numbers and other mag - stripe data needed to clone the debit cards were also compromised in the breach .
At the time , the company said it identified fraudulent activity on only 100 cards , making it sound like small beans .
But it turns out the hacker managed to lift the withdrawal limits on those 100 cards , before dispatching an global army of cashers to drain them with repeated rapid - fire withdrawals .
More than 130 ATMs in 49 cities from Moscow to Atlanta were hit simultaneously just after midnight Eastern Time on November 8 .
A class action lawsuit has been filed against RBS WorldPay on behalf of consumers .
A nearly identical cybercrime feeding frenzy targeted payment card company iWire in late 2007 .
From September 30 to October 1 of that year — just two days — four iWire payroll cards were hit with more than 9,000 actual and attempted withdrawals from ATM machines around the world , resulting in losses of $ 5 million .
A similar MO was employed against Citibank account holders last year , after a processing server that handles withdrawals from Citibank - branded ATMs at 7 - Eleven convenience stores was breached .
In that case , cashers converged on New York and withdrew at least $ 2 million from Citibank accounts , sending 70 percent of the take back to a mysterious hacker kingpin in Russia .
Could all three breaches be the work of a single wealthy cybercrook sitting on piles of cash somewhere in Moscow ?
Some of the cashers in the iWire and Citibank caper are cooperating with the FBI , so we may eventually find out .
What ’s clear is that this is a great time to be a hacker .
In just over one year we ’ve seen these kinds of breaches go from virtually unheard of into a multimillion dollar industry .
In September , Canadian police announced the arrest of Israeli hacker Ehud Tenenbaum for allegedly penetrating the Calgary - based financial services company Direct Cash Management and increasing the cash limits on prepaid debit cards he and his co-conspirators legitimately purchased .
The caper allegedly netted the crooks the equivalent of $ 1.7 million U.S .
Despite much - ballyhooed payment card security standards , the industry responsible for protecting our money appears to be as leaky as a sieve .
But , as always , consumers are n’t responsible for fraudulent withdrawals that they find and promptly report to their card issuer .
Overview
As Barack Obama takes office , the public ’s focus is overwhelmingly on domestic policy concerns – particularly the economy .
Strengthening the nation ’s economy and improving the job situation stand at the top of the public ’s list of domestic priorities for 2009 .
Meanwhile , the priority placed on issues such as the environment , crime , illegal immigration and even reducing health care costs has fallen off from a year ago .
While it is not unusual for the public to prioritize domestic over foreign policy , the balance of opinion today is particularly one - sided .
Roughly seven - in - ten Americans ( 71 % ) say that President Obama should focus on domestic policy , while just 11 % prioritize foreign policy .
By comparison , last January , 56 % cited domestic policy as most important while 31 % said Bush should focus on foreign policy .
The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , conducted Jan. 7 - 11 among 1,503 adults on cell phones and landlines , finds that strengthening the economy and improving the job situation are higher priorities today than they have been at any point over the past decade , and the recent upward trend has been steep .
The share of Americans saying that strengthening the nation ’s economy should be a top priority has risen from 68 % two years ago to 75 % last January to 85 % today .
Concern about jobs has risen even more sharply .
The 82 % who rate improving the job situation as a top priority represents a 21 - point jump from 61 % a year ago .
Of the 20 issues people were asked to rate in both January 2008 and January 2009 , five have slipped significantly in importance as attention to the economy has surged .
Protecting the environment fell the most precipitously – just 41 % rate this as a top priority today , down from 56 % a year ago .
The percentage rating illegal immigration as a top priority has fallen from 51 % to 41 % over the past year , and reducing crime has fallen by a similar amount ( from 54 % to 46 % ) .
And while reducing health care costs remains a top priority to 59 % of Americans , this is down 10 - points from 69 % one year ago .
The public ’s interest in many other policy areas remains relatively stable , by comparison .
Roughly three - quarters ( 76 % ) say that defending the country from future terrorist attacks should be a top priority , making it the third highest priority among the 20 issues tested in the survey .
As recently as two years ago , terrorism ranked at the top of the list of policy priorities .
The share of Americans who rate terrorism as a top priority has not changed substantially in recent years ; the issue has simply been leapfrogged by the economy and jobs at the top of the list .
As with terrorism , public views of the importance of several other policy priorities have not changed much in recent years .
Roughly six - in - ten continue to rate making the Social Security system ( 63 % ) and making the Medicare system ( 60 % ) more financially sound as top priorities .
Dealing with the nation ’s energy problems also remains a top priority for six - in - ten , as does improving the educational system ( 61 % ) , though the public ’s emphasis on the latter has slipped slightly in recent years .
Republicans ’ Job Concerns Surge
There is partisan agreement that strengthening the economy should be a top priority for the president and Congress in 2009 – more than eight - in - ten Democrats ( 88 % ) , independents ( 85 % ) and Republicans ( 83 % ) rate strengthening the nation ’s economy as a top priority .
There is also increasing agreement across party lines about the importance of improving the job situation .
A year ago , 76 % of Democrats rated improving the job situation as a top priority compared with just 43 % of Republicans – among the biggest partisan divisions in 2008 .
Today , the partisan gap is much smaller ; the share of Republicans rating jobs as a top priority has jumped 29 points to 72 % .
The percentage of Democrats citing jobs as a major priority has increased by a smaller margin ( from 76 % to 89 % ) .
The large decline in the percentage of Americans citing the environment is seen across the political spectrum , but Republicans ( 20 % ) remain far less likely than Democrats ( 54 % ) or independents ( 41 % ) to say that protecting the environment should be a top priority for the president and Congress .
The only policy that ranks lower than protecting the environment among Republicans is dealing with global warming ( 16 % ) .
Far fewer Republicans rate dealing with illegal immigration as a major policy priority than did so in January 2008 ( 46 % now , 64 % then ) .
Dealing with illegal immigration also has declined as a policy priority for independents and Democrats ( nine points each ) .
Reducing health care costs is viewed as a less important priority than at the beginning of last year .
Only about half of independents ( 52 % ) say that reducing health care costs should be a top priority , down from 68 % a year ago .
This decline is less pronounced among Democrats ( down 10 points since 2008 ) and Republicans ( down eight points ) .
Environment a Lower Priority
The 15 - point decline in the percentage calling environmental protection a top priority this year is steep , but not unprecedented given the broader shift in public priorities .
Between January 2001 and January 2002 , the proportion rating environmental protection as a top priority fell by a similar amount ( from 63 % to 44 % ) ; a number of domestic priorities declined in importance following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
By January 2003 , just 39 % called environmental protection a top priority – comparable to today ’s 41 % – before resurging as a priority from 2006 to 2008 , only to fall again this year .
The decline in the percentage calling environmental protection a top priority crosses partisan and demographic lines .
For instance , only about four - in - ten women ( 43 % ) and men ( 39 % ) now say that protecting the environment should be a top priority ; last January , 57 % of women and 55 % of men rated environmental protection as a top priority .
Deficits and Tax Cuts
For the past several years , a greater percentage of Democrats than Republicans have rated reducing the budget deficit as a top priority .
But this gap has disappeared , as a narrower majority of Democrats view this as a major priority than did so last year ( 64 % vs. 52 % ) .
Republicans ’ views about the importance of reducing the deficit have been stable ( 52 % in 2008 , 51 % now ) .
By contrast , a partisan gap has emerged this year over reducing middle - class taxes .
At the start of 2008 , roughly half of both Democrats ( 50 % ) and Republicans ( 46 % ) rated this as a top priority .
Today , just 31 % of Republicans say middle class tax cuts are a top priority , compared with 48 % of Democrats .
Crime Concerns Fall
The public ’s crime concerns have fluctuated over the past eight years .
In January 2001 , fully 76 % rated reducing crime as a top priority .
Reducing crime fell as a major goal after 9/11 , but increased in 2006 and 2007 ( 62 % rating it a top priority in each year ) .
Currently , just 46 % say that reducing crime should be a top priority , down from 54 % in January 2008 .
In the past year , the percentage of Democrats who view reducing crime as a major goal has fallen sharply – from 62 % to 47 %
.
Far fewer women and college graduates also rate crime reduction as a top priority ( down 13 points and 12 points , respectively ) .
Dueling Agendas
The fundamental gaps between Democratic and Republican priorities seen in previous years remain largely the same today .
Democrats place a far higher priority on issues related to the poor , on the environment and on education than do Republicans .
And Republicans place a higher priority on defense and illegal immigration than do Democrats .
As was the case a year ago , the single biggest partisan gap comes over how much priority to place on providing health insurance to the uninsured .
Two - thirds ( 66 % ) of Democrats rate this as a top priority while just 28 % of Republicans agree .
Similarly , 62 % of Democrats say that dealing with the problems of the poor and needy is a top priority , compared with 34 % of Republicans .
By contrast , Republicans place greater priority on strengthening the military ( 64 % vs. 38 % of Democrats ) and dealing with illegal immigration ( 46 % vs. 34 % ) .
Most Want Obama to Focus Domestically
Democrats , independents and Republicans generally agree that it is more important for President Obama to focus on domestic policy than foreign policy .
The partisan gap has narrowed since January 2008 , when Republicans were evenly split about whether former President Bush should focus domestically or internationally ( 45 % each ) .
Currently , 66 % of Republicans say it is more important for Obama to focus on domestic issues while just 14 % say he should focus on foreign policy .
A year ago , majorities of Democrats ( 62 % ) and independents ( 60 % ) said that Bush should focus more on domestic than foreign policy .
Even higher percentages of those groups express that view about Obama ’s priorities today ( 75 % of Democrats , 73 % of independents ) .
Now that George W. Bush has finally left office , here 's a challenge to a nation famous for its proud tradition of invention :
Can somebody invent a machine capable of fully measuring the disaster that was the Bush presidency ?
Yes , yes , I know that attitudes towards presidencies are volatile .
Harry Truman was hated when he left office and look at him now ; he 's so highly regarded that President Bush thought of him as a role model .
There are , I 'm sure , still a few William Henry Harrison dead - enders around , convinced that the 31 ...
Joel Watson of Hijinks Ensue made this printable Valentine 's Day card that is oh - so - wrong if you think about it .
If you do n't get this , then it 's obvious that you 've never watched Star Wars before ...

" Too many fundamental political questions ... remain unresolved .
Too many Iraqis are still displaced or destitute . "
12:17 p.m. ET : " The United States will pursue a new strategy " -- a transition to Iraqi responsibility .
Obama says the U.S. cannot sustain indefinitely a commitment that has strained the military and cost $ 1 trillion , even if Iraq is not perfectly safe or united .
As a candidate I made clear my commitment to a 16 - month withdrawal , Obama says .
After consultations with military leaders , he 's settled on an 18 - month timeline .

That is the most important lesson of all . "
He closes with the story of two young Marines who lost their lives but saved 50 others by stopping a truck loaded with explosives .
He warns that there will be more danger and trials in Iraq .
" But thanks to the sacrifices of those who have served , we have forged hard - earned progress , we are leaving Iraq to its people , and we have begun the work of ending this war , " he says .

We kept our troops in Iraq to help establish a sovereign government – and you got the job done .
And we will leave the Iraqi people with a hard - earned opportunity to live a better life – that is your achievement ; that is the prospect that you have made possible . "

Jan 20 , 2009 at 01:08 AM
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama ’s new administration ordered all federal agencies and departments on Tuesday to stop any pending regulations until they can be reviewed by incoming staff , halting last - minute Bush orders in their tracks .
“ This afternoon , White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel signed a memorandum sent to all agencies and departments to stop all pending regulations until a legal and policy review can be conducted by the Obama administration , ” the White House said in a statement issued just hours after Obama took office .
The review is a tool commonly used by a new administration to delay so - called “ midnight regulations ” put in place by a former president between the election and Inauguration Day .
Midnight regulations have been heavily used by recent former presidents , including the Democrat Bill Clinton , Republican George H. W. Bush , and most recently , the Republican George W. Bush .
Controversial late rules by the outgoing Bush administration include allowing the carrying of concealed weapons in some national parks and prohibiting medical facilities from receiving federal money for discriminating against doctors and nurses who refuse to assist with abortions or dispense contraceptives based on religious grounds .
Federal law requires a 60 - day waiting period before any major regulatory changes become law , so some presidents try to publish new major regulations to ensure they go into effect before the new president ’s inauguration on January 20 .
The examples of stupid laws would fill volumes .
Examples of conflicting laws would fill even more volumes .
Some ( or is it most ) lawmakers just are n’t very smart .
Since the final draft of the U. S. Constitution became the Supreme Law of the Land , legislators have been legislating , that is they have been passing law ..... after law ..... after law .
Do you want to know why you are a criminal ?
Here is why .
“ The U.S. Code , which contains all federal statutes , occupies 56,009 single - spaced pages .
Its 47 volumes take up nine feet of shelf space .
An annotated version , which attempts to bring order out of chaos , is three feet long and has 230 hardcover volumes and 36 paperback supplements .
Administrative lawmaking under statutes fill up the 207 - volume Code of Federal Regulations , which spans 21 feet of shelf space and contains more than 134,488 pages of regulatory law .
…
Federal law is further augmented by more than 2,756 volumes of judicial precedent , taking up 160 yards ( almost twice as long as a football field ) of law - library shelving . ”
This is just federal law and it is growing by the second .
All of this law does not include the millions of state , county and city laws that have been passed since we won our freedom in our first revolution .
State and local laws are also growing by the second .
The Obama / Pelosi / Reid Stimulus package was over 1,000 pages of more law that no one read and it included more taxes and much more socialism .
More so - called “ stimulus ” packages are on the way , requiring trillions more of our dollars that the government does n’t own and must “ steal ” from us , by force , to “ fix ” the problem that they themselves created .
Too many laws create competing special interests who lobby the system to entrench their own little worlds , while the un-represented ( that ’s millions of Americans ) are left out in the cold .
We have become a government of cronies , in a world run by cronyism , in an atmosphere of corruption , Hell bent on driving America and Americans into unabashed socialism and the one - world - order .
Too many laws create victims who inadvertently violate one or more laws and spend their life ’s savings trying to defend themselves against an intransigent , all - powerful and abusive government .
Too many laws lead to powerful , entitled special interests and the innocent victims are left with no political power at all .
Interestingly , America contains an almost ghostly , silent majority .... mostly silent and heard from rarely , but it does exist .
Most of this group are trying to live out their lives as best they can , earn a living and raise their children in a country they thought was the land of the free .
You know , a government they could trust , a government that protects the unalienable , individual rights as granted to us by our creator and codified into law by our constitution , and a government that operates within the enumerated powers allowed them by that very same constitution .
Unfortunately , in the silent majority ’s silence , their government , without the silent majority ’s consent , assumed powers that far exceeded their constitutional powers .
They passed laws to pander to ( or buy off ) special interest groups , or to increase their political powers and then levied ever - increasing taxes to pay for it all .
Even as the regulations rose exponentially and as taxes became more burdensome , the silent majority , to their discredit , still remained silent .
Their silence , their apathy and their disinterest in what government has been and is doing , has unknowingly turned each and everyone of them into criminals ..... law breakers , who can be subject to fines and imprisonment for violating laws they know nothing about .
America was founded on the principles of a Constitutional Republic .
That is , a system of government by the rule of law , with the Constitution as the foundation of all law .
What the Founders failed to realize , or maybe they did but did n’t account for it , was that lawmakers have but one goal in life , that is the passing of laws .
The lawmakers very rarely consider repealing laws , or remove conflicting laws , upon which clever attorneys can twist to fit a particular case , which they do all too often .
The net result is we have become enslaved by the passage of too many laws and we became unintentional law breakers of those laws ..... thus perpetual criminals whom have yet to be caught .
As the silent majority watches our government use our tax money and our children ’s tax money to increase their pandering and buying off of special interest groups , as government pours our hard - earned money into banks and businesses , as they prop up people who have acted irresponsibly with more of our money that we earned responsibly , they are increasing their power over us and increasing the laws that control us ..... laws eliminating our individual rights , gun rights , property rights , freedom of speech , freedom of religion , the sovereignty of states and the people under the 9th and 10th Amendments and equal protection under the law contained in the 14th Amendment .
The 5th Amendment is all but null and void through the passing of draconian environmental regulation , along with government abuse of eminent domain .
However , the days of the silent majority being silent , must be over .
Once we realize that , if the silent majority suddenly united as one in defiance of more laws and more of our money and our children ’s money being stolen by the government , at the point of a gun , ( just try not paying your taxes , even though Senator Harry Reid thinks our tax system is voluntary ) to buy off banks , businesses and irresponsible individuals , we could turn America around in months .
If the Consent of the Governed , that Silent Majority , “ esplained ” it to government to get out of the way , our economy would improve naturally , in a shorter period of time , based on sound economic and capitalistic principles , not government manipulated insanity .
So how does the American silent majority unite as one ?
It rallies around one simple idea or symbol and uses that idea or symbol as the rallying cry for freedom and liberty and the reduction of government power .
In the coming weeks we will be releasing just such an idea , a symbol and some simple principles , around which the American Silent Majority can rally !
No , the war is hardly lost , it is just getting interesting , as more Americans of the silent majority , wake up to what their government has perpetrated upon them , over the last 80 to 100 years .
They grow weary of too many laws that make them unintended criminals and angry with a government , at all levels , that has become helplessly and hopelessly out of control .
It is way past time for the Silent Majority to cease being silent and return control to where it belongs ..... to the Consent of the Governed .

If there 's chagrin on Wall Street about the TARP bonus limits tucked into the stimulus , here 's a chart that should at least help bankers understand where the country 's anger is coming from .
In 2008 , a year in which most firms lost tens of billions of dollars and had to be rescued by taxpayers , Wall Street paid itself more than it did in 2000 , at the peak of the wildly profitable technology bubble .
If there was any doubt left that bonuses reward performance , this Wall Street Journal chart should put it to rest .

Hughes Telematics stopped by to show us and our buddies at Jalopnik the in - car connected tech they 're pitching to OEMs , which was actually pretty great .
But it did include this perfect piece of generational misunderstanding .

Yes , this car will text your colleagues " b 15 m l8 " next time you 're running late .
Like Ford 's Sync service , you can use Hughes ' in - car tech platform , which is being pitched to car manufacturers on an OEM basis for inclusion in future vehicles , to do a lot of things with your voice , including respond to text messages ( but only with canned SMS presets that are activated by spoken keywords ) .
You can choose to respond in plain English , or with translations using a custom dictionary ( here , apparently , set to illiterate ' tween ) .
It can also translate any internet - isms it may find while it reads you your exchange email or calendars , too .

Hughes 's demo vehicle was packed full of lots of other cool stuff , including an on - board 3G connection ( with compatibility for WiMax down the road ) that can be fed out via wi - fi to turn your car into a roaming hotspot .
The only auto maker offering something like that right now is Chrysler with their UConnect service ( not done by Hughes ) , but it 's something we 'd love to see more of .
Hughes is bringing some of its voice - activated telematics to Mercedes vehicles later this year ( not including the mobile hotspot tech , sadly ) , but their demo jeep we saw today is a good example of what might come .

On March 2 , Bill McKibben and Wendell Berry are asking for large civil disobedience at the Capitol Power Plant in Washington D.C.
Why , cuz Clean Coal sucks !
Over 2,000 people are expected to risk arrest .
And the protest comes on the heels of the upcoming grassroots action — Powershift 2009 — which will bring 10,000 young people to the capitol for two days of training and lobbying .
Help 1
Sky stop the clean coal myth : Demand a Moratorium on New Coal Plants !
Amazingly , the White House has been in daily contact with the organizers .
It ’s nice to hear that the youth which turned out in record numbers for this administration still plays a key role .
Gobama !
Jessy Tolkan , the executive director of the Energy Action Coalition ( EAC ) , explains just why the White House wants daily updates from her , and how the youth of the country is bringing social justice through climate action to the nation and the entire world :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/vFBZuYUihXQ&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01&hl=en&feature=player_embedded&fs=1]
Currently , more than 40 environmental , public health , labor , social justice , faith - based and other advocacy groups are planning to participate in the protest .
Heck , even Susan Sarandon did a PSA on urgency of the event .
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/Q-HXYXvZZWk&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&feature=player_embedded&fs=1]
“ The Capitol Climate Action comes not a moment too soon .
For more than thirty years , scientists , environmentalists and people from all walks of life have urged our leaders to take action to stop global warming ; and that action has yet to come , ” said Dr. James Hansen , one of the world ’s leading climate scientists .
Dr. Hansen will join the protest .
“ Coal is the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country and that must change .
The world is waiting for the Obama administration and Congress to lead the way forward on this defining issue of our time .
They need to start by getting coal out of Congress . ”
The Capitol Power Plant is owned by Congress and sits just blocks away from the Prez .
It ’s responsible for heating and cooling numerous buildings on Capitol Hill .
In fact , the facility no longer even generates electricity .
But its complete reliance on coal – the biggest contributor to global warming – has made the plant a huge target for clean energy .
“ We can no longer wait for the changes we know we can , and must , make today , ” continued Rebecca Tarbotton of Rainforest Action Network ( RAN ) , a lead sponsor of the action .
“ We ’ve got to take the slogan ‘ yes we can ’ seriously .
With a new administration and a new Congress , we have a window of opportunity to build a clean energy economy that will protect the health of our families , our climate and our future . ”
It ’s a wee bit long , but here is the call to action ?
What are your thoughts ?
Dear Friends ,
There are moments in a nation ’ s–and a planet ’s–history when it may be necessary for some to break the law in order to bear witness to an evil , bring it to wider attention , and push for its correction .
We think such a time has arrived , and we are writing to say that we hope some of you will join us in Washington D.C. on Monday March 2 in order to take part in a civil act of civil disobedience outside a coal - fired power plant near Capitol Hill .
We will be there to make several points :
Coal - fired power is driving climate change .
Our foremost climatologist , NASA ’s James Hansen , has demonstrated that our only hope of getting our atmosphere back to a safe level–below 350 parts per million co2–lies in stopping the use of coal to generate electricity .
Even if climate change were not the urgent crisis that it is , we would still be burning our fossil fuels too fast , wasting too much energy and releasing too much poison into the air and water .
We would still need to slow down , and to restore thrift to its old place as an economic virtue .
Coal is filthy at its source .
Much of the coal used in this country comes from West Virginia and Kentucky , where companies engage in “ mountaintop removal ” to get at the stuff ; they leave behind a leveled wasteland , and impoverished human communities .
No technology better exemplifies the out - of - control relationship between humans and the rest of creation .
Coal smoke makes children sick .
Asthma rates in urban areas near coal - fired power plants are high .
Air pollution from burning coal is harmful to the health of grown - ups too , and to the health of everything that breathes , including forests .
The industry claim that there is something called “ clean coal ” is , put simply , a lie .
But it ’s a lie told with tens of millions of dollars , which we do not have .
We have our bodies , and we are willing to use them to make our point .
We do n’t come to such a step lightly .
We have written and testified and organized politically to make this point for many years , and while in recent months there has been real progress against new coal - fired power plants , the daily business of providing half our electricity from coal continues unabated .
It ’s time to make clear that we ca n’t safely run this planet on coal at all .
So we feel the time has come to do more–we hear President Barack Obama ’s call for a movement for change that continues past election day , and we hear Nobel Laureate Al Gore ’s call for creative non-violence outside coal plants .
As part of the international negotiations now underway on global warming , our nation will be asking China , India , and others to limit their use of coal in the future to help save the planet ’s atmosphere .
This is a hard thing to ask , because it ’s their cheapest fuel .
Part of our witness in March will be to say that we ’re willing to make some sacrifices ourselves , even if it ’s only a trip to the jail .
With any luck , this will be the largest such protest yet , large enough that it may provide a real spark .
If you want to participate with us , you need to go through a short course of non-violence training .
This will be , to the extent it depends on us , an entirely peaceful demonstration , carried out in a spirit of hope and not rancor .
We will be there in our dress clothes , and ask the same of you .
There will be young people , people from faith communities , people from the coal fields of Appalachia , and from the neighborhoods in Washington that get to breathe the smoke from the plant .
We will cross the legal boundary of the power plant , and we expect to be arrested .
After that we have no certainty what will happen , but lawyers and such will be on hand .
Our goal is not to shut the plant down for the day–it is but one of many , and anyway its operation for a day is not the point .
The worldwide daily reliance on coal is the danger ; this is one small step to raise awareness of that ruinous habit and hence help to break it .
Needless to say , we ’re not handling the logistics of this day .
All the credit goes to a variety of groups , especially EnergyAction ( which is bringing thousands of young people to Washington that weekend ) , Greenpeace , the Ruckus Society , and the Rainforest Action Network .
A website at that latter organization is serving as a temporary organizing hub : http://ran.org/ get_involved / powershift_and_mass_civil_disobedience_updates / .
If you go there , you will find a place to leave your name so that we ’ll know you want to join us .
Thank you .

What I ’m posting here is a close reading and interpretation of Luke ’s code .
I ’d like to understand it myself and elucidate it for others , and I want to identify ways to add future lessons about Clojure into its code .
For example , how could , or should , concurrency be used to increase the efficiency or modularity of the creation of the index at the heart of the generator ?
As it stands now , the code makes excellent use of lazy sequences and Java interop for reading the file .
So let ’s roll up our sleeves and dig in .
The Code
First of all , Luke ’s code is available from our Google group : http://tinyurl.com/markov.
Go ahead and get it .
I ’m not going to reproduce it all here , since this post will be long enough as it is .
The code is what he posted and updated on December 14th , 2008 .
Luke has done us a big favor by making his code quite readable .
The program is divided into sections : File IO , index generation , chain generation , and execution examples .
Furthermore , definitions of values and functions are well - commented .
First , the program defines two sets of characters , word - break - chars and semantic - punct - chars , that will help define where words in the “ corpus , ” or the text file you supply to the program , begin and end : the text will be split into words at any of the word - break - chars , whereas chars in semantic - punct - chars will be considered separate words themselves .
Next , two functions that produce sequences from the corpus are defined .
I ’m only going to focus on word - seq .
It takes a Java reader as an argument and recursively takes characters from the reader until it identifies a complete word or the reader signals it is finished with a - 1 .
Notice that word - seq is lazy .
It supplies one word at a time .
It does not read to the end of the reader ’s stream unless asked to .
Take a look at piece - file , a convenience function that takes a file name , to use as a corpus , and a sequencing function ( e.g. word - seq ) :
( defn piece - file [ fname piece - function ] " returns a file as a lazy seq of pieces , using the supplied piecing function " ( piece - function ( java.io.BufferedReader . ( java.io.FileReader. fname ) ) ) )
You ’ve probably seen this before , but it ’s worth noting how easily Java interop is accomplished in Clojure .
A new FileReader , taking the file name as the argument to its constructor , is instantiated and passed as an argument to the BufferedReader constructor , and presto — you ’ve got a Buffered Reader ready to go .
Specifically , it ’s ready to be passed to the sequencing function as a reader .
A sequencing example
Here ’s what the product of piece - file looks like when used with word - seq and a file containing a certain amount of the beginning of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , available from Project Gutenberg .
> ( def corpus ( piece - file " /arbitrary_path/huck-finn.txt " word - seq ) ) #'user / corpus > ( take 21 corpus ) ( " YOU " " don't " " know " " about " " me " " without " " you " " have " " read " " a " " book " " by " " the " " name " " of " " The " " Adventures " " of " " Tom " " Sawyer " \ ;)
Indexing
The next section of Luke ’s code contains a trio of indexing functions that produce a hash - map : the keys are word sequences found in the corpus , and the values are a set of following - word occurrences : each occurrence is a map of a word that was seen following the sequence to a number representing the number of times the word was seen following the sequence .
That last bit was a mouthful , so let me show you an example using my Huck Finn corpus :
> ( def indx ( build - index corpus 2 1 ) )
Here is the “ signature ” of build - index :
( defn build - index [ full - corpus key - length completion - length ] ...)
It takes a corpus , called full - corpus to distinguish the complete corpus from the steadily - shrinking portion of the corpus on which an internal loop will recur .
The key - length and completion - length parameters are integers that determine how many words will be grouped into each key of the index and how many words will be grouped into “ completions ” , that is , sequences that follow the key in the corpus .
In my example , and by default in Luke ’s program , the keys will be two words and the completions one word .
So build - index is instructed to read the sequence of words from my Huck Finn file , reading two words at a time and then noting the word , aka the completion , that follows those two .
If build - index has seen this two - word sequence before ( i.e. there is a key matching the sequence in the index hash - map ) , it checks whether it has already seen the following word after the two - word sequence .
has seen this two - word sequence before ( i.e. there is a key matching the sequence in the index hash - map ) , it checks whether it has already seen the following word after the two - word sequence .
If so , it increments the integer value in the occurrence that matches the word .
Otherwise , it adds an occurrence : a map of the word to the number 1 , for one occurrence
If build - index has not seen this two - word sequence before , it adds a new key - value pair in the index with the two - word sequence as a key and a new set with one occurrence map .
has not seen this two - word sequence before , it adds a new key - value pair in the index with the two - word sequence as a key and a new set with one occurrence map .
Then the process begins again on Huck Finn minus the word at the “ front ” .
This is what ( recur index ( nthrest corpus completion - length ) ) does in this case .
does in this case .
When the corpus has been processed , the index is returned .
Here ’s what I get from having build - index work on my Huck Finn snippet , with some formatting added into my REPL output to make it more readable :
> ( def indx ( build - index corpus 2 1 ) ) # 'user / indx > ( take 5 indx ) ( [ ( " only " " everything " ) { ( " was " ) 2} ] [ ( " was " " no " ) { ( " kin " ) 1} ] [ ( " over " " the " ) { ( " victuals " ) 2} ] [ ( " was " " all " ) { ( " right " ) 1} ] [ ( " I " " was " ) { ( " glad " ) 1 , ( " there " ) 1 , ( " fidgety " ) 1 , ( " dead " ) 1 , ( " in " ) 1} ] )
This tells us that the index has captured certain information about my Huck Finn snippet — for example , the word “ was ” follows “ only everything ” twice , and the sequence “ I was ” is followed by “ glad ” , “ there ” , “ fidgety ” , “ dead ” , and “ in ” , each one time .
If you ’d like to poke around with the index , you can take advantage of Clojure ’s gorgeous treatment of maps as functions : pass a key to a map as though the map were an operator , and you get the value , if any :
> ( take 5 ( keys indx ) ) ( ( " only " " everything " ) ( " was " " no " ) ( " over " " the " ) ( " was " " all " ) ( " I " " was " ) )
> ( indx ' ( " I " " was " ) ) { ( " glad " ) 1 , ( " there " ) 1 , ( " fidgety " ) 1 , ( " dead " ) 1 , ( " in " ) 1}
> ( keys ( indx ' ( " I " " was " ) ) ) ( ( " glad " ) ( " there " ) ( " fidgety " ) ( " dead " ) ( " in " ) )
Generation
Now we want to take our index and generate some eerily Huck - Finn - like text with it .
This is where Markov comes in .
As the wikipedia article about Markov Chains explains , there are situations where the a future state can be predicted , in this case by probabilities , solely from a present state — to wit , the to - be - generated text ’s contents can be predicted from the index of the corpus .
We are building the new text solely out of pieces of Huck Finn .
To implement the probability part of the generator , we have markov - next , which , as Luke succinctly explains in his documentation , “ Given an index and a key , picks a statistically consistent completion ” .
I want to look at how it does that .
( let [ completions ( index key ) probabilities ( vals completions ) total - probabilities ( reduce + probabilities ) random ( inc ( rand- int total - probabilities ) ) ] ...
The index is our index of sequences and occurrences of completions in Huck Finn .
The key is one of those sequences , maybe ‘ ( “ I ” “ was ” ) .
In that case , here is how the let ‘s bindings evaluate :
completions ( index key ) ;=> { ( " glad " ) 1 , ( " there " ) 1 , ( " fidgety " ) 1 , ( " dead " ) 1 , ( " in " ) 1} probabilities ( vals completions ) ;=> ( 1 1 1 1 1 ) total - probabilities ( reduce + probabilities ) ;=> 5 random ( inc ( rand- int total - probabilities ) ) ;=> a number between 1 and 5 , inclusive
After a defensive check to make sure completions is n’t somehow nil , the markov - next function enters this loop :
( loop [ current 0 remaining ( seq completions ) ] ( let [ next (+ current ( last ( first remaining ) ) ) ] ( if ( <= current random next ) ( ffirst remaining ) ( recur next ( rest remaining ) ) ) ) )
The loop simply counts up from zero , determining the next number by adding the frequency number of each completion , next , to its counter current , and checks to see whether the number random is now between , or equal to either of , the counter and the counter plus next .
If you ’ve never seen the <= operator used with more than two arguments — I had n’t — try doing what I did : use doc at the REPL to get the documentation for Clojure ’s <= operator :
> ( doc <= ) ------------------------- clojure.core /<= ( [ x ] [x y ] [ x y & more ] )
Returns non-nil if nums are in monotonically non-decreasing order , otherwise false .
That ’s the Lisp world for you .
Somewhere in 50 years of hacking , somebody decided <= should n’t just compare two numbers but rather the order of a whole sequence of numbers .
Bless their heart .
So the loop recurs until it can put its random number in the range defined by the frequency of the completion : the more frequent the completion , the more likely that the loop will choose it .
When that happens , ffirst is applied to the remaining completions , with the chosen one at the front .
( ffirst x ) is an abbreviated form for ( first ( first x ) ) .
So , if random came out to 3 , and so remaining has been recursively set to ( [ ( " fidgety " ) 1 ] [ ( " dead " ) 1 ] [ ( " in " ) 1 ] ) , then ffirst will give us “ fidgety ” , a fine Twainian word , if not quite as good as “ fantods ” .
The markov - chain function calls markov - next recursively to build our new text one completion at a time .
It too is lazy , so it will only build as long a text as you ask it to .
get - random - key chooses a starting key for the process .
Ta da !
Let ’s try it out :
> ( def chain ( markov - chain indx ( get- random - key indx ) ) ) > ( println ( apply str ( interpose \space ( take 50 chain ) ) ) ) was rough living in the house all the year round -- more than a body could tell what to do with .
The Widow Douglas is all told about in that book , which was no kin to her , and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the
That ’s pretty good .
Tweaks and future directions
A get - random - start - word function might ensure that the first random key begins with a capital letter :
( defn get - random - start - word [ index ]
" Determines a random word , that must begin with a capital letter , from the supplied index with which to start generation " ( loop [ random - key ( get- random - key index ) ] ( if ( re-seq # " [ A - Z ] " ( str ( first random - key ) ) ) random - key ( recur ( get- random - key index ) ) ) ) ) > ( get - random - start - word indx ) ( " I " " warn't " ) > ( get - random - start - word indx ) ( " She " " put " ) > ( def chain ( markov - chain index ( get- random - start - word indx ) ) ) > ( println ( apply str ( interpose \space ( take 50 chain ) ) ) )
Mark Twain , and you had to wait for the whole world ; she was going to start a band of robbers , and I was dead . ...
This of course assumes that there is at least one capitalized word in the corpus .
Of course , it would be fun to put this on the web , behind a form for uploading texts or linking to online texts .
A Clojure program should be able to create and wrap a servlet , and there ’s some buzz about a web library for Clojure called compojure .

The " last " bag of Woolworths pic 'n 'mix has sold for more than £ 14,500 at an online auction .
The souvenir from the collapsed retail chain received 115 bids before finally being sold to the highest bidder on eBay at midday on Saturday .
Ed Adams , a Woolworths store manager , filled the pic 'n 'mix just before his shop in Petts Wood , Bromley , south London , closed for the last time .
The money will go to the Retail Trust , a charity for retail industry workers .
" I am really proud and excited to see such an enormous sum has been raised for the last bag of pic ' n ' mix , " said Mr Adams .
" Retail Trust is a fantastic organisation that has helped so many people like me . "
Worthwhile cause
The 800g bag includes fizzy cola bottles , rhubarb & custards , strawberry bon bons , Turkish delight , white mice and pineapple cubes .
Nigel Rothband , Retail Trust chief executive , said : " It 's taken us by surprise .
It 's very exciting and much more than we were expecting . "
The bag has been officially certified by Woolworths ' administrators , Deloitte , as the last one .
A spokesman said : " The administrators of Woolworths PLC have consented to the sale of this item for the benefit of Retail Trust .
" They are pleased to be supporting this worthwhile cause and hope the proceeds will make a difference to those workers helped by the charity . "
An eBay spokesman said they were working with the charity to " finalise payment " from the winning bidder .
Ah , but remembering to bring that bag is another matter altogether .
After all , New York is a place where people are almost programmed to do things impulsively , because it is so easy to just hop into a bodega or a deli or a 99 - cent store to buy anything , anytime , no forethought required .
“ You have to get used to using these , ” said Lauren Robertson , 54 , an occupational therapist who lives in Washington Heights , who was loading groceries in canvas bags into her car in the Fairway parking lot on 130th Street near the Hudson River on Thursday morning .
“ So many times I ’d get into the store and realize I forgot my bags in the car . ”
Bloomberg officials say the proposal remains a work in progress .
But for now , the plan is to charge customers 6 cents a bag at the point of sale , with 1 cent going to the store owner as an incentive to comply , said Marc La Vorgna , a Bloomberg spokesman .
The officials did not elaborate on the mechanics of how the money would be remitted to the city , or how the law would be enforced .

It sounds like a tax , but officials call it a fee .
The distinction is important : A fee requires approval only from the City Council , while a tax requires approval from the State Legislature .
Unlike a number of ideas that seem to have been inspired by experiments in other countries ( such as exploring wind power , based on windmills which Mr. Bloomberg saw off the coast of England , or temporarily closing off streets to cars , based on a program in Bogotá , Colombia , that the mayor had heard about ) , this one , city officials say , was hatched in the mayor ’s Office of Long - Term Planning and Sustainability .
The idea is not totally foreign to the metropolitan area .
The Ikea furniture chain , which opened its first New York City store in June , on the Brooklyn waterfront in Red Hook , began charging customers 5 cents for each plastic bag in 2007 ; since then , the store says , plastic bag use has been cut in half .
Several large supermarket chains in the region , like Whole Foods Markets , offer refunds when customers bring reusable bags .
Feature Envy is the smell ( anti- pattern ) in which one code fragment makes more use of another object than it does of itself .
reek currently ( version 0.2.3 ) includes a very naive check for Feature Envy :
For each method inspected , reek counts the messages sent to each recipient and also counts the references to self ; if self has the highest count , reek does n’t report feature envy .
Here ’s a contrived example :
class Parcel def addressee " #{@person.first _name} #{@person.last _name} " end end
When it sees this code , reek says :
[ Feature Envy ] Parcel #addressee uses @person more than self
That ’s because the method sends two messages to @person , so this code fragment should be moved onto that object :
class Parcel def addressee @person.
full_name end end class Person def full_name " #{first_name} # {last_name} " end end
Now fewer messages are sent overall , so the Feature Envy is gone .
The current algorithm is quite naive , and reek will certainly report false negatives sometimes .
I hope to be able to refine the algorithms and gradually make reek smarter ; for example , I ’ve considered adding a configuration option so you can turn off certain smells for certain methods , but somehow that feels like the start of a slippery slope .
This winter I hope to find the time to work on the algorithms a bit more , so if you do find reek reporting a false negative ( for any smell ) , please send me a code sample — or preferably a new test .
( CNN ) -- Barack Obama 's historic train ride to Washington on Saturday drew large , cheering crowds of people who braved freezing weather and gathered along the tracks in cities and small towns along the way in hopeful anticipation of getting a glimpse of the nation 's next president .
The crowd cheers as President - elect Barack Obama takes the stage in Baltimore , Maryland .
more photos »
In Baltimore , Maryland , alone , about 40,000 people stood shoulder - to - shoulder in the cold to greet Obama as he stopped on his way to his Tuesday inauguration .
His welcome was raucous and animated , as the sea of people cheered , waved and took pictures .
Tears rolled down one woman 's face as Obama spoke .
" We love you , Obama ! " another yelled out .
" I love you back , " Obama answered calmly , eliciting a roar from the crowd .
The same emotions were expressed up and down the tracks on the 137 - mile journey , a trip that started in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , and retraced the train ride Abraham Lincoln took on his way to becoming president in 1861 .
Watch Obama share the love »
As he did so often during his campaign , Obama drew upon American history in his remarks to pose a parallel to the country 's current challenges .
He noted the struggles of the colonials , the " first patriots , " against the British .
" They were willing to put all they were and all they had on the line , " Obama told the crowd in Baltimore .
" Their lives , their fortune , and sacred honor for a set of ideals that continue to light the world : that we are all equal .
That our rights to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness come not from our laws but from our Maker . "
Later he said , " the American Revolution was , and remains , an ongoing struggle in the minds and hearts of the people . "
Inauguration coverage Coverage of Obama 's inauguration continues Sunday with the debut of John King 's " State of the Union " and a three - hour special at 2 p.m. ET
Sunday , beginning 9 a.m. ET see full schedule »
And , as in Philadelphia , Obama alluded to , but did not name , the president who inspired his train journey .
The soon - to - be president used a call - to - action uttered by Lincoln in his inaugural address in 1861 , an appeal to Americans ' " better angels . "
Obama , who will take up what he called the country 's " enormous " challenges in fewer than 72 hours , noted that they will probably not be solved quickly .
" There will be false starts ; there will be setbacks , " he said .
" There will be frustrations and disappointments .
I will make some mistakes .
But we will be called to show patience even as we act with fierce urgency . "
He added , " So , Baltimore , starting now , let 's take up in our own lives the work of perfecting our union , " an appeal that brought forth a loud rumble of approval .
Obama arrived later in Washington , where he will take the oath of office Tuesday .
He did not have a speaking event there Saturday .
Before getting on board the train in Philadelphia , the president - elect implored Americans to commit to a new declaration of independence -- rejecting ideology and bigotry -- as he acknowledged that the nation faces severe challenges .
" Only a handful of times in our history has a generation been confronted with challenges so vast , " he said at a town hall meeting in Philadelphia 's 30th Street Station .
" An economy that is faltering .
Two wars : one that needs to be ended responsibly , one that needs to be waged wisely .
A planet that is warming from our unsustainable dependence on oil . "
" What is required is a new declaration of independence , not just in our nation but in our own lives -- from ideology and small thinking , prejudice and bigotry -- an appeal not to our easy instincts but to our ' better angels , ' " he said , using a phrase from Lincoln 's inaugural address .
The train stopped in Wilmington , Delaware , to pick up Vice President - elect Joe Biden and his family and then headed to Baltimore , Maryland , on its way to Washington .
The train made its first " slow roll " in Claymont , Delaware , allowing Obama to wave at cheering residents gathered near the tracks .
Claymont is also the town where Biden 's family moved in 1953 , when he was 10 years old .

Security for Obama 's train ride was tight .
Law enforcement officers from 40 jurisdictions provided protection from the ground .
The U.S. Coast Guard was stationed on waterways along the route as well .
The Federal Aviation Administration established " moving " flight restrictions that prevented private pilots , news helicopters , balloonists and others from getting anywhere near the train .
The FAA is imposing additional airspace restrictions in Washington on Sunday during pre-inaugural activities and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday , the day of the inauguration .
Watch how security will protect Obama on way to Washington »
Nearly 2 million people are expected to hit the streets of Washington on Tuesday .
Police will shut bridges across the Potomac River into the city , along with a huge chunk of downtown .
People coming from Virginia will have to walk or take public transport , such as the area 's Metro subway system .
Read about the times and places for inaugural events »
Two of the major routes coming into the city -- Interstates 395 and 66 -- will be closed to inbound traffic , at least for private vehicles .
Amtrak said it has increased the number and length of trains running to Washington on Inauguration Day .
Tickets are still available but are going fast , it said .

All About Barack Obama • Joseph Biden
When he enters the art world , Lauryssens knows little about his golden goose , except that Dalí means money .
As the months pass , and he disposes of works of ever - decreasing quality for ever - increasing prices , he realizes the Dalí market rests on a gigantic con : thousands of works are being certified that cannot possibly be by Dalí .
In one instance , he buys a stack of prints from one of Dalí ’s authorized dealers , only to discover that they are unsigned .
When he returns the next day , Dalí ’s signature is on every one .
Eventually , the titanic swindle , in which Lauryssens has only a small role , unravels , along with his extravagant lifestyle .
And it is here that the book gets most interesting .
After a cursory imprisonment , and a dark night of the soul that features some hilariously overwrought writing – “ I was a fox in a trap .
For the fox , the trap means death ” – Lauryssens hightails it to his girlfriend in Catalonia .
Here he finds himself both a neighbour of Dalí , and on the periphery of his circle , at last able to winkle out some of the truth .
And that truth is a sad business .
Originally , Dalí seems to Lauryssens like a mad genius , a showman whose career is a cheerfully orchestrated fraud on the world , whether it be signing blank canvasses , ordering muses to drink his urine “ to raise your genius level ” , or hosting orgies based around demands for “ 2,000 live ants , four transvestites , a white Arabian stallion , 300 dead grasshoppers , four dwarfs , four giants and the suit of armour of Jeanne d’Arc ” .
But the real Dalí is more pitiable – not just because of the crippled state in which Lauryssens finds him on their one meeting , but because of how he has become a prisoner of his greed and pathologies , to the extent that , according to Lauryssens , he maintained a “ secret studio ” of artists who did virtually every work of his final decades .
Even Dali's moustache was a fraud : hair extensions wrapped around drinking straws .
In an interview with The Herald newspaper , Lauryssens says he believes the famous painting " Christ of St John on the Cross " was in fact painted by one of Dali 's assistants .
He claims Dali did not have the artistic skill to paint the image of the body of Christ .
“ If you look at Christ of St John on the Cross , you can see that it is made by two different people .
It 's basically two different paintings .
The part below , the seascape – that is 100 per cent Dali .
But on top you have Christ seen from above – that is not a Salvador Dali painting .
It was painted by others because Dali could n’t paint living flesh . ”
Lauryssens says he ’s even seen film that shows an assistant drawing the life model who appears as Christ in Dali ’s masterpiece .
But art critics and the painting ’s owners , Glasgow City Council – which bought the painting now estimated to be worth upwards of £ 60 m for a bargain £ 8,200 – have rubbished Lauryssens ’s claims .
It is sensational stuff , fantastic in every sense .
And whether it is fact or fiction , it seems to capture two essential truths about Dalí : both his work and life could mean anything and everything , and that there is always a more astonishing story around the corner .

For all the tough talk and thuggish bravado Ricky Martinez exhibited while running with the Shalimar street gang in Costa Mesa , the nickname he was given by his fellow gangsters was inspired by his heartbreaking past , not his exploits on the street :
They called him “ Lonely Boy . ”
The moniker stemmed from the fact that Martinez did n’t seem to have any family at all .
When he was 5 , he and his two younger sisters were abandoned in a laundromat by their mother , Martinez recalled in a recent interview .
Advertisement
He and his siblings then bounced around from a group home to various foster homes until the girls were adopted together and Martinez was left on his own .
“ I was a good kid back then , ” Martinez said .
“ But they took everything I had from me .
I really did n’t care anymore . ”
He was then about 13 , he said .
“ I started to be real defiant , to yell back , to misbehave a lot , ” said Martinez , who turned 20 this month .

Foster parents quickly got fed up with him .
He moved from one house to another every few months , or so it seemed .
He took a car for a joy ride and spent six months in juvenile hall .
Then he fell in with the gang and “ started doing a lot of bad things , " including vandalism , graffiti and petty theft .
At the core of Martinez ’s rebellion , he said , was the sense that he was alone in the world .
“ I did n’t have nobody to turn to , ” he said .
That changed two years ago when Martinez , fresh from a yearlong stint in county jail for escaping from a juvenile facility , was referred to an Orange County child welfare group called Canyon Acres .
The nonprofit organization , established in 1980 , provides a host of services for abused , neglected and emotionally troubled youths and their families , including foster care and adoption referrals and a treatment center on a 4.6 - acre ranch in the Anaheim Hills .
Canyon Acres is one of a number of Southern California charities supported by The Times Holiday Campaign , part of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund .
Last year , the organization received $ 20,000 for its residential program for abused children .

In Martinez ’s case , Canyon Acres ’ social workers attempted to locate relatives of the troubled teen through its Creating Family Connections program .
Lawrence Murray , who took the lead in conducting the search , found an old letter from Martinez ’s father in the youth ’s social services file .
The father , who remains in prison , had requested that his sister look after the son he ’d abandoned .
All Murray had to go on was the woman ’s name -- no address or phone number , not even the region of the United States in which she lived .
Using online databases such as those used by private investigators , he was able to track down Martinez ’s aunt in Arizona .
Murray sent a message to Martinez through his probation officer and arranged to meet at a Mexican restaurant in Orange .

The social worker said that when he gave Martinez the news , the small but tough - looking youth was overcome with emotion .
“ He was trying to hold it in like a tough guy , but the tears were coming out , ” Murray said .
A week or so later , Canyon Acres paid for Martinez to fly to Arizona , where he was greeted by about two dozen relatives he never knew he had .
“ These people were coming up to him saying , ‘ I ’m your cousin .
I ’m your uncle .
I ’m your aunt , ’ ” Murray recalled .
Martinez moved to Arizona and began living with some of his relatives .
He got a job at a local Wendy ’s restaurant and was thinking about enrolling in community college .

But his newfound family was not a cure - all .
He began using drugs again and staying out late , both of which put a strain on the fledgling relationships he was trying to build .
Back in California for a visit , he was arrested for shoplifting clothes , he said .
His girlfriend became pregnant with his child and he is now preparing for his new role as a father .
“ That made me open my eyes and realize I need to straighten the [ expletive ] up , ” he said , adding that he has n’t used drugs since October .
As he tries to get back on track , Martinez said he no longer feels the despair and emptiness that accompanied previous setbacks .
“ My situation is better but there ’s always room for improvement , ” he said .
“ And now I ’ve got someone to turn to if I have problems . ”
Murray said he ’s noticed a huge difference in Martinez since he began establishing a relationship with his family .

“ When I look in his face , he does n’t look lost anymore , ” the social worker said .

For the second time in two weeks , a small earthquake has rattled an area of central New Jersey .
But like the last quake in Morris County , no significant damage or injuries were reported .
The latest earthquake , with a magnitude of 2.2 , was recorded shortly before 5:30 p.m. Saturday , said Scott DiGiralomo , a coordinator with the county 's office of emergency management .

Galileo's telescope .
For an excellent overview of the capabilities of Galileo 's telescope , visit Telescope1609.com
In 1609 , 400 years ago , Galileo revolutionized humankind 's understanding of our position in the Universe when he used a telescope for the first time to study the heavens and sketched radical new views of the moon and also discovering the satellites orbiting Jupiter .
To celebrate the International Year of Astronomy ( IYA ) , which marks the anniversary of Galileo 's discoveries , a group of astronomers and curators from the Arcetri Observatory and the Institute and Museum of the History of Science , both in Florence , Italy , are recreating the kind of telescope and conditions that led to Galileo 's world - changing observations , reports January 's Physics World .
Astronomers will be using the recreated apparatus to catalogue all the objects recorded in Galileo 's ' Sidereus Nuncius ' ( or , in English , " Starry Messenger " ) , the treatise that Galileo published in 1610 which included many of his early observations .
The team has already observed the Moon and Saturn and are now recording images of Jupiter 's moons and the phases of Venus , both of which provided crucial evidence to confirm the heliocentric hypothesis and prove that the Earth is not the centre of the Universe .
To recreate the apparatus , the team undertook a painstaking investigation of the nature of the lens of a telescope given to Galileo 's patron , the Grand Duke of Tuscany , Cosimo II , in 1610 .
That work involved measuring the shape and refractive index of the lens , and using X - ray fluorescence to determine the condition of the glass .
According to records , Galileo 's original telescope contained a 37 mm diameter plano - convex objective lens with a focal length of 980 mm .
The group now plans to put the images seen by the telescope online .
They could n't build a replica of the telescope actually used by Galileo to make the observations reported in Sidereus Nuncius as only one lens of that instrument survives .
The project , however , is more ambitious than just recreating one of Galileo 's telescopes .
The ultimate aim is to catch what Galileo himself might have seen .
It is known that Galileo died blind and the researchers are keen to open Galileo 's tomb to retrieve DNA and diagnose his optical affliction in order to create conditions that resemble looking through Galileo 's very own eyes .
At present , though , the Basilica of the Holy Cross in Florence , where the tomb lies , is refusing the researchers access to Galileo 's remains .
This project is just one of many activities being undertaken by professional and amateur astronomers during the International Year of Astronomy 2009 .
The Syrian press is claiming U.S. forces launched a helicopter raid inside Syrian territory today .
Ruh roh !
SANA , the country 's state - run news agency , said four US military helicopters ' violated Syrian airspace ' at 4:45 p.m. local time .
The report further claims that eight Syrian citizens were ' martyred ' in the attack , allegedly launched from across the border in Iraq .
The Los Angeles Times reports a non-denial from the Pentagon :
Details were sketchy .
In Washington , several military representatives asked about the operation did not deny that a raid had taken place .
Although they would not confirm the attack , they used language typically employed after raids conducted by secretive Special
Operations forces .
We contacted the duty officer at U.S. Central Command public affairs ; he said he had " no information " on the incident .
The latest update from SANA says that Syria 's deputy foreign minister summoned the chargé d’affaires * * of the US
Embassy in Damascus to protest the incident .
If the Syrian allegations are in fact true , the incident sounds very similar to some of the hot pursuit raids we 've seen inside Pakistan in recent months .
A helicopter - borne assault by U.S. and Afghan special operations inside Pakistan last month provoked a storm of protest from Islamabad , with Pakistan 's Foreign Ministry complaining of a " gross violation of Pakistan 's territory " and " a grave provocation . "
But beyond the rhetoric , there seemed to have been very little diplomatic fallout .
Lest we forget , there was also that Israeli air raid last September against a Syrian site that was supposed linked to clandestine nuclear activity .
The site of this latest attack , according to the Los Angeles Times , is in the same vicinity as that strike .

Some AT&T
Wireless customers have voted an emphatic no on a promotion for “ American Idol ” that popped up on their phones this week .
AT&T , a sponsor of the show , said it sent text messages to a “ significant number ” of its 75 million customers , urging them to tune in to the season premiere on Tuesday night .
But some recipients thought the message was a breach of cellphone etiquette , and gave it the kind of reaction that the “ Idol ” judge Simon Cowell might give an off - key crooner .
The online service Twitter had a steady stream of complaints .
“ AT&T just sent me a text message advertisement about ‘ American Idol . ’
Evil , ” a Twitter user named Joe Brockmeier wrote on Tuesday .
“ The economic downturn definitely means a spam upswing . ”
Concert promoter Live Nation and ticketing giant Ticketmaster Entertainment said this morning that they plan a merger of equals .
The combined company will be called Live Nation Entertainment .
Regulatory experts have said the deal could get delayed by an antitrust review .
Ticketmaster sells tickets for more than 80 percent of the major arenas and stadiums in the U.S. , according to concert tracking firm Pollstar .
Live Nation is the world 's No. 1 concert promoter and owns more than 140 venues .
It has comprehensive deals to the tours of such artists as Madonna , Jay - Z , U2 , Nickelback and Shakira -- and recently developed its own ticketing service .

Treasuries have rebounded somewhat since the beginning of the year , and there was tepid demand today for Five Year Treasuries , from Bloomberg : Treasuries Drop as Record Sale Draws Higher - Than - Forecast Yield
Treasuries plunged as the government sold a record $ 30 billion of five - year notes at a higher yield than forecast , indicating weak demand .
The auction , which caps a week when the Treasury raised $ 78 billion in notes and bonds , may signal investors will have trouble absorbing the as - much - as $ 2.5 trillion in debt the U.S. is likely to issue this year ...

Financial issuance accounted for almost all of the drop , falling $ 93.5 billion , or 12.7 percent , to $ 641.8 billion .
The decline in the commercial paper market signals improved conditions as financial companies find other funding sources such as government - backed corporate bonds , Tony Crescenzi , chief bond - market strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York , said in a note to clients today .

( CNN ) -- Nearly half of Americans would like to live someplace else , according to a national survey .
Most people who live in cities said they 'd rather live someplace else , according to a national survey .
And Denver , Colorado , was the top choice of people surveyed by the Pew Research Center .
Yes Denver , with its low humidity , eight professional sports teams and proximity to the Rocky Mountains .
Forty - three percent of those surveyed said they 'd prefer living in the Mile - High City .
San Diego and Seattle were other top locales among the nation 's largest 30 metropolitan areas .
Detroit , Cleveland and Cincinnati were the least favorite .
The study released Thursday asked people where they 'd prefer to live , whether they favor cities or suburbs , and what they think about American cities .
Researchers polled 2,260 adults during telephone interviews .
The study also found that Republicans would like to live in Phoenix and Democrats prefer San Francisco .
The survey also found that more men than women would like to live in Las Vegas .
Men living in rural areas said they are much happier living there than women .

The Joint Unmanned Combat Air System ( J - UCAS ) program is a joint DARPA , US Air Force and US Navy initiative .
The Boeing X - 45A demonstrator first flew in May 2002 .
The UCAV will be capable of carrying multiple , precision - guided munitions like JDAM .
The UCAV is intended to have experimental capability by 2008 and enter service after 2010 .
Boeing has built two demonstrator X - 45A UCAV air vehicles and a reconfigurable mission control station .
The program is designed to demonstrate the UCAV 's suitability for suppression of enemy air defences ( SEAD ) and strike missions .
UCAVs will be able to undertake dangerous missions without risking the lives of pilots .
Block 2 demonstrations will concentrate on the co-ordination of multiple air vehicles .
X - 45A is powered by a Honeywell F124 - GA - 100 engine , which provides 6,300 lb of thrust .
The X - 45A is an initial demonstrator in the spiral development of the UCAV program .
The Boeing joint unmanned combat air system X - 45 is an unmanned combat air vehicle being developed for strike missions such as Suppression of Enemy Air Defence ( SEAD ) , electronic warfare and associated operations .
Joint Unmanned Combat Air System ( J - UCAS ) programme
The Joint Unmanned Combat Air System ( J - UCAS ) programme began being managed by DARPA , but was handed over to a joint US Navy and Air Force office in October 2005 .
The two principle systems being developed under the first phase of the programme , the Spiral 0 phase , are the Boeing X - 45 and the Northrop Grumman X - 47 .
The J - UCAS program combines the programmes previously conducted under the DARPA , USAF and Boeing X - 45 UCAV program and the DARPA , USN and Northrop Grumman X - 47 UCAV - N program .
“ The Boeing
joint unmanned combat air system X - 45 is an unmanned combat air vehicle . ”
In March 2004 , the X - 45A completed a ten - day schedule of test flights including dropping a 250 lb inert Small Smart Bomb ( SSB ) at NASA ’s Dryden Flight Research Center , Edwards Air Force Base , California .
The X - 45A air vehicle released the unguided weapon from its internal weapon bay at an altitude of 35,000ft and speed Mach 0.67 ( about 442 m ph ) .
In August 2004 , the first test of multi-vehicle operations took place .
Two X - 45A demonstrators were controlled by a single operator / pilot .
X - 45A flight tests were successfully concluded in August 2005 .
Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstrator ( UCAS - D ) programme
In April 2007 , Boeing submitted a bid to the US Navy for the Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstrator ( UCAS-D ) .
Boeing ’s bid is based on a version of the X - 45C , the X - 45N which has been strengthened for carrier landings .
In August 2007 , Northrop Grumman was selected by US Navy with a version of the X - 47B .
X - 45A demonstrator UAV
In 1999 Boeing was awarded a demonstration phase contract by DARPA and the USAF .
Under the contract , Boeing Phantom Works completed two X - 45A demonstrator air vehicles .
The roll out ceremony of the first vehicle was in September 2001 .
The first flight was completed in May 2002 .
Boeing Company in Seattle is the principle contractor responsible for the X - 45 programme and is also responsible for the provision and implementation of the mission control aspects .
Boeing in St Louis is responsible for the development of the air vehicle
A series of block 1 tests on both X - 45A vehicles , including timing and positional navigation trials , autonomous taxiing and the integration of ground mission control elements , was completed in February 2003 .
Block 2 testing , which began in March 2003 , included integration of the unmanned vehicles with manned aircraft .
By March 2004 the block 2 software build was completed and the first flight tests of the block 2 software were successfully completed .
Block 3 testing includes mission replanning during flight , station keeping manoeuvres and the simulated deployment and dropping of inert weapons .
Block 4 testing completed in August 2005 , included the transfer of decision making to the air from the ground - based control station .
X - 45A air vehicle
The X - 45A air vehicle is of a swept - wing stealthy design and composite construction using foam matrix core and a composite fibre - reinforced epoxy skin , with a wingspan of 10.31 m and overall length 8.03 m .
There is no vertical or canted tail .
The low - mounted wing and blended fuselage have a straight leading edge and W planform trailing edge .
The fuselage carries two internally housed weapons bays and an internally mounted Honeywell F124 - GA - 100 non-afterburning turbofan engine .
The engine , rated at 28 kN , is equipped with a notched air intake and a two dimensionally yaw - vectoring nozzle exhaust .
The fuel load is 1,220kg .
“ The X - 45A air vehicle is of a swept - wing stealthy design and composite construction . ”
The vehicle carries a payload of 680 kg .
The air vehicle incorporates underwing hardpoints for carrying auxiliary fuel tanks for increased range or increased time on station or for additional weapon carrying capacity .
The air vehicle is fitted with fully retractable tricycle landing gear for conventional autonomous take - off and landings .
The air vehicle is capable of operating at an altitude of 10,670 m ( 35,000 ft ) and has a cruise speed of Mach 0.75 .
The X - 45 is air transportable to forward areas of operation .
The wings are detachable from the fuselage so the air vehicle can be stored and transported in a storage container .
A single C - 17 Globemaster can carry up to six X - 45A containerised UCAVS .
X45B and X - 45C UAVs
Boeing planned the development and construction of two UCAV prototype air vehicles , X - 45B , a larger air vehicle than the X - 45A with an integrated avionics system , increased weapon delivery capacity and increased operating range and altitude .
A fully operational version of the prototype X - 45B was designated A - 45 , for entry into service with the USAF in 2008 but the X - 45B program was superseded by the joint - UCAS programme and the development of the X - 45C .
In June 2003 DARPA announced the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems ( J - UCAS ) programme which combined the DARPA / USAF UCAV and the DARPA / USN UCAV-N programmes .
In early 2003 , DARPA announced the cancellation of the X - 45B and the approval for the development of a larger and improved UCAV system , comprising the X - 45C air vehicle , mission control , support and simulation systems .
The X - 45C has a larger payload performance ( 2,041kg ) , persistence and range envelope than the X - 45B .
The X - 45C has a similar fuselage design to that of the X - 45 B but with a new wing design that gives the X - 45C its distinctive arrowhead shaped profile .
Boeing began assembly of the first of three X - 45C demonstrators in June 2004 and first flight was in 2007 , followed by a two - year operational assessment .
Weapons
The air vehicle can carry advanced precision guided munitions , 2,000 lb bombs or other munitions and weapons systems .
“ The X - 45 carries auxiliary fuel tanks for increased range or increased time on station . ”
Sensors
The X - 45 air vehicle is equipped with a suite of sensors including an Active Electronically Scanned Array ( AESA ) Synthetic Aperture Radar ( SAR ) and an electronic support measures system developed by Raytheon .
The Raytheon synthetic aperture radar provides a resolution of 60 cm at a target range of 80km .
Control
The sensor suite allows detection , identification and location of fixed and mobile targets in near real time .
The battlefield situation and target data is downloaded via secure datalinks to the ground control operator station , to aircraft or to satellite datalinks .
The operator station is equipped with artificial intelligence decision aids to assist the operator in the assessment of the battlefield situation and in his decision to authorise UCAV weapons release .
The taxiing , take - off and landing are fully autonomous but a pilot - operator has the option of controlling these manoeuvres .
The UCAV ground control station has been designed by NASA .
BAE Systems Controls has been contracted to supply the computerised air vehicle management system .
The air vehicle is fitted with a Milstar satellite communications link .

Liu keeps his love for Dungeons & Dragons on the down low .
" I guess it 's the stereotype of playing it - they are usually fat , sweaty , hairy dorky men who are socially inept who happen to live in their mom's basement , " said Liu , 23 , of Somerville .
" It 's not the stereotype .
Vin Diesel played that game . "
That 's one way to look at the enduring phenomenon of Dungeons & Dragons , the iconic game that has come to symbolize both intellect and geekdom .
But for some players - adults well into their careers and married with children - the game has cast an undeniably cool and timeless spell on them .
Some of these warriors started playing when they were teenagers in the 1980s and can't stop .
In the confines of basements and living rooms in Greater Boston , these devoted players surface for a chance to role - play and quietly immerse themselves in the storytelling wonders of the 1970s - era game .
Many of these wannabe dungeon masters , druids , and sorcerers are closeted D&D players who delight in morphing into their otherworldly characters but are more than a little embarrassed about it .
They have plenty of company in fellow fanatics who are trying to shatter the stigma of their fellow brethren .
At least three new books - including one titled " Confessions of a Part - time Sorceress : A Girl 's Guide to the D&D Game " - illuminate this cultish phenomenon and attempt to explain why its followers are often a misunderstood lot .
Message boards on Facebook are filled with call - outs for fellow players who may not be conspicuous in their real - life roles as husbands and wives , parents , accountants , lawyers , and Web developers .
Liu is a member of a Boston MeetUp group that introduces players to one another with gatherings at Pandemonium Books & Games in Cambridge .
Why do these adults remain so charged about a game they learned to play decades ago ?
" I do n't think you ever shake it , " says Mark Barrowcliffe , author of " The Elfish Gene : Dungeons , Dragons , and Growing Up Strange , " a new memoir that chronicles his adolescent journey in playing D&D in his native England .
Barrowcliffe details how the game hooked him and his friends because it offered a social outlet and a sort of live theater .
Barrowcliffe , 44 , said he wrote the book to examine why he and millions of fellow dungeon masters worldwide can't let go of the game .
" It 's a story that you tell at the same time that you listen to .
It releases a sort of creative impulse . "
For the uninitiated , Dungeons & Dragons is a role playing game fueled by players ' imaginations .
It 's part acting , storytelling , social interaction , war game , and dice - rolling .
Players create characters who develop and grow with each adventure they embark on .
One player is the dungeon master , who controls the monsters and enemies as well as narrates the action , referees the game , and maps out the adventures through tunnels and caves .
The dungeon master and the other players take on the role of a character - such as a wizard , cleric , barbarian , knight , or archer - and follow them on journeys for hidden treasures .
Twitter intends to start testing ways to make money this year .
And co-founder Evan Williams promises it wo n't drive away the more than 6 million people who have set up accounts on the unconventional communications network .
" We do n't see any reason why this can't be a very large and profitable entity , " said Williams , the San Francisco - based company 's chief executive .
" We have enough traffic on our website that we could put ads on there and maybe we could make enough to pay our bills , but that 's not the most interesting thing we can do . "
Williams , 36 , wo n't say what he has in mind besides selling ads , but he and the handful of other people who own privately held Twitter seem confident the mystery strategy will pay off - even as a devastating recession destroys much - larger companies .
Just three months ago , Twitter rejected a $ US500 million takeover offer from an even bigger phenomenon , Facebook , the owner of the world 's largest online hangout .
Although shooing away Facebook was risky , Twitter still is n't under immense pressure to generate revenue .
The 29 - employee company has already raised $ US55 million , including a $ US35 million round recently completed with Benchmark Capital and Institutional Venture Partners .
Like Facebook , MySpace , YouTube and other communal websites that have become internet sensations , Twitter gives people a stage where they can express themselves and connect with kindred spirits .
Twitter 's twist is a more succinct approach , which has been likened to the 21st - century version of a telegraph .
Here 's how Twitter works :
After setting up a free account , people are encouraged to post frequent updates about what they are doing , seeing and feeling .
The messages , known as " tweets , " must be limited to 140 characters and can be sent from a mobile phone or a computer .
Although the updates are available for anyone to see , Twitter users usually set up their accounts to monitor the tweets of people they know or admire .
These " followers " are automatically fed tweets from the people they are shadowing .
With more than 265,000 people tracking his messages , President Barack Obama has the most Twitter followers even though neither he nor his staff have tweeted since he moved into the White House last month .
Many other politicians and celebrities , such as basketball star Shaquille O'Neal ( more than 72,000 followers ) and former rap music sensation MC Hammer ( more than 55,000 ) regularly share tweets .
Twitter also has become a way to peek at dramas unfolding behind closed doors .
When Yahoo laid off hundreds of workers last year , some of the casualties used Twitter to provide a blow - by - blow account of their final day at the office .
Surgeons at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit recently gave a rare glimpse inside an operating room by tweeting about the removal of a tumor from a patient 's kidney .
Twitter also has proven to be a valuable source for breaking news , sometimes even beating long - established media outlets to the punch .
When US Airways Flight 1549 made an emergency landing on the Hudson River last month , a picture of the accident scene was quickly posted on Twitter by Janis Krums , a Sarasota , Fla. , entrepreneur who was on one of the ferries that rescued passengers from the water .
In November , Twitter provided harrowing , first - person accounts of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai that killed 164 people .
But Twitter mostly amplifies the humdrum of ordinary folks with apparently nothing better to do but share their monotony .
There 's plenty of posts along these lines : " Sitting at Corner Bakery in Frisco , Texas .
Lunch was good . "
Or , " Another boring day at work , ugh . "
Or even , " I really do enjoy picking my nose . "
( A widely practiced pastime , based on recent tweets ) .
Finding out what 's happening on Twitter is getting easier through a search engine called Summize that the company snapped up for an undisclosed amount last summer .
Both Williams and another Twitter founder , Biz Stone , suggested the search technology could emerge as their company 's crown jewel .
Its value lies in its ability to quickly sift through a steady stream of tweets to provide almost instantaneous insights about what 's going on around the corner or around the world .
Not even Google 's internet - leading search engine can match that now .
Stone relates how he used Twitter 's search engine to ease his anxiety after he recently heard loud noises around his neighborhood .
A quick search on Twitter informed him it was just a local celebration down the road .
The search engine will become even more valuable if people keep flocking to Twitter .
The site attracted 2.7 million U.S. visitors in December , a nearly eight - fold rise from the end of 2007 , according to Nielsen Online .
But Twitter 's traffic increasingly is coming through mobile phones , making its usage more difficult to monitor .
Nielsen estimates 666,000 U.S. users accessed Twitter on mobile devices in December .
The service is especially appealing to people between 18 and 34 .
About one in every five people with Internet access in that age group used Twitter or a similar service to update their status at least once , according to a survey of more than 2,200 adults in November and December by the Pew Internet & American Life Project .
Meanwhile , usage of Twitter and rivals such as Jaiku , Pownce , FriendFeed and Plurk was seen in just 5 percent of respondents between 45 and 54 .
Only 2 percent of people older than 65 had tweeted , according to Pew .
This matters for Twitter 's financial future because most younger people do n't make a lot of money , which could make it more difficult for the company to appeal to advertisers .
Even so , corporate America is paying attention .
Several major companies , including JetBlue Airways , have set up Twitter accounts to monitor what people are saying about their brands .
The companies sometimes send out tweets offering to address a complaint .
All that chatter could yield a huge moneymaking opportunity if Twitter chooses to mine the data and sell the insights to marketers , said Marita Scarfi , chief operating officer for Organic , an internet advertising agency .
" It could be rich vein for brand analysis , " she said .
And though Twitter has n't sold any ads yet , it is being used as a marketing tool .
Computer maker Dell Inc. , for instance , is offering exclusive discounts to its more than 18,000 followers on Twitter after holiday promotions broadcast on the service produced more than $ US1 million in sales .
Both Williams and Stone hinted the company is exploring ways to charge for expanded commercial access to Twitter , but emphasised that all personal accounts will remain free .
Online retailer Zappos.com is a big fan of Twitter , using it for promotions and customer feedback .
But the Las Vegas - based company wo n't necessarily stay on board if Twitter starts imposing fees on businesses , said CEO Tony Hsieh .
" It would depend on what they 're charging for , " said Hsieh , who has attracted more than 58,000 followers since opening his Twitter account about a year ago .
" We do n't see it as a marketing channel , but as a relationship channel . "
Comments like that feed the doubts about Twitter 's future .
Its prospects are clouded even further by the resistance that Facebook and MySpace have faced as they have tried to inject ads into forums where people primarily goof off or fraternize .
" It 's the same kind of challenge for these sites , " said Peter Daboll , who has studied consumer behavior on the Internet for years , including in his latest job as CEO of Bunchball Inc .
" How do they build on their great audiences and keep them engaged , without alienating them with a bunch of crap ? "

COMMENTER OneAegis asks an excellent question regarding the stress tests federal banking regulators plan to run on banks .
When this simulation is run and the answer is 75 % of banks cannot survive this test , does the DOW fall to " merely " 6500 , or to the 5000s ?
And what about the simple hit to confidence over the numbers the test chooses to use ?
If there is one common refrain I ’ve heard from every credible financial or economic expert about the crisis , from Paul Volcker to George Soros , it ’s “ I never thought it would get this bad ” .
I am with them on that .
Yes , we had a big real estate bubble which set the stage for big losses at some financial firms , and of course , America and Britain were over - leveraged .
But that , it seems , should have set us up for a good old 1983 style recession .
A worse downturn than we ’ve experienced in the recent past , but fundamentally , financial markets did not have to collapse the way they did .
Markets will come crashing down when investors lose faith , but it takes an extreme series of events for that to happen .
We can , at least partially , blame ineffective , timid , and inconsistent government policy for inciting the outright panic which brought financial markets to a halt .
Most economists anticipated coordinated and clear policy reactions and markets that would price in an eventual turnaround .
At this point , I am beginning to find the people who claim they predicted how the crisis would unfold incredible .
It 's tantamount to claiming foresight that the government would save Bear , let Lehman fail , then nationalise AIG , and then markets would freak out .
So as OneAegis points out , can the stress testing accurately test stress ?
Do the tests imply an omnipotent government policy ?
Do they build in a major sell off if unemployment reaches 10 % ?
It may not feel like it , but things could get much worse than that .
Once one moves to the tails , correlations often go to one and humans ( including policymakers ) become unpredictable .
Perhaps the stress tests account for that .
I ’ll be mighty impressed if they do .
Unfortunately , the models and data we have are all we have .
They provide some roadmap of what might lie ahead for embattled financial institutions and are a better alternative than throwing our hands up and saying “ Citi is doomed ” !
( Though , perhaps , it is ) .
But in the end , they can not alert us to all the potential hazards down the road .
John Updike Dies
John Updike , 76 , a leading American writer of post - World War II suburbia , died of lung cancer Tuesday , Jan. 27 .
He lived in Beverly Farms , Mass .
Audio of Updike in October 2008 .
In an autobiographical essay , Updike famously identified sex , art , and religion as " the three great secret things " in human experience .
He won two Pulitzer Prizes , two National Book Awards and almost every other literary prize available .
Although himself deprived of a Nobel , he did bestow it upon one of his fictional characters , Henry Bech , the womanizing , egotistical Jewish novelist who collected the literature prize in 1999 .
Some critics , like John Cheever , consider Updike " the most brilliant and versatile writer of his generation . "
He was called America 's greatest poetic novelist , who skillfully wove metaphor , lyricism and detail into his narratives .
Others say that his prose is superficial and overly descriptive to hide the fact that his work is about nothing .
He captured , and sometimes embodied , a generation 's confusion over the civil rights and women 's movements , and opposition to the Vietnam War .
Updike was called a misogynist , a racist and an apologist for the establishment .
On purely literary grounds , he was attacked by Norman Mailer as the kind of author appreciated by readers who knew nothing about writing .
But more often he was praised for his flowing , poetic writing style .
Describing a man 's interrupted quest to make love , Updike likened it " to a small angel to which all afternoon tiny lead weights are attached . "
Nothing was too great or too small for Updike to poeticize .
He might rhapsodize over the film projector 's " chuckling whir " or look to the stars and observe that " the universe is perfectly transparent : we exist as flaws in ancient glass . "
He disliked interviews , but sat for a 2000 interview with Salon and one with the Washington Post last year ( see video / audio file above ) .
He also wrote for AARP , The Magazine , a meditation on aging :
With ominous frequency , I can't think of the right word .
I know there is a word ; I can visualize the exact shape it occupies in the jigsaw puzzle of the English language .
But the word itself , with its precise edges and unique tint of meaning , hangs on the misty rim of consciousness .
Eventually , with shamefaced recourse to my well - thumbed thesaurus or to a germane encyclopedia article , I may pin the word down , only to discover that it unfortunately rhymes with the adjoining word of the sentence .
Meanwhile , I have lost the rhythm and syntax of the thought I was shaping up , and the paragraph has skidded off ( like this one ) in an unforeseen direction .

Fox News Producer Aaron Bruns arrested on child porn charges
TVNewser is reporting that Fox News Channel producer Aaron Bruns has been arrested and charged with one count of possession of child pornography .
A Fox News spokesperson told TVNewser , “ We are aware of the arrest and he is currently suspended without pay . ”
Bruns has been with FNC in the Washington , D.C. bureau for over six years .
He was an embedded producer with the Hillary Clinton campaign last year .
FishbowlDC further reports that Bruns ’ was previously arrested on charges of distributing child porn in 1999 .
Fox News told TVNewser that his criminal record did not surface as he was hired in 2002 , one year before Fox News instituted background checks .
We usually end with a clever line here , but there ’s nothing funny about this .
All we ’ve got to say is , if he ’s quilty , hang him high .
Update : The Smoking Gun says , “ According to an arrest warrant affidavit filed in U.S. District Court , an FBI search of a Dell laptop in Bruns ’s Washington , D.C. home turned up several photos and videos showing the sexual abuse of children as young as five years old . ”
Update : The original video has been pulled , so we replaced it with a photo of him .
If anyone has a new link to the video ( not the one with Hilary ) , please let us know .
xbel stands for XML Bookmark Exchange Language and .recently - used.xbel file contains list of recently opened files .
This file is opened and parsed every time you open a file inside GTK application like eog ( Eye of Gnome Image Viewer ) .
This file could grow larger ( some times megabytes ) and affect the responsiveness of the GTK application .
I do n't know why GTK team chose XML format rather than something like SQLite which offers faster retrieval and lookup of entries .
Assumptions aside lets disable this fracking thing and make your GTK applications much more responsive .
Disable .recently-used.xbel
You should have either .gtkrc or .gtkrc - 2.0 in your home directory if not create a new file and add following line to it .
gtk-recent-files-max-age=0
Now restart your gnome environment for faster desktop environment .
Duane " Dog " Chapman Owes the IRS $ 2 Million
Oops , just when we thought that Duane Chapman aka Dog was back on track and on the right side of the law , reports have surfaced that the IRS is looking for a little money from the bounty hunter ... to the tune of $ 2 million .
Looks like mullet man has n't paid the IRS since 2002 .
They filed a lien on January 27th and this is how it shakes out : he owes $ 106,553 for 2002 , $ 99,235 for 2003 , $ 283,514 for 2004 , and a whopping $ 1.56 million for 2005 .
Dennis Duban , Chapman's L.A. accountant , says that most of the taxes had been paid and he is in the process of contacting the IRS .
TMZ was kind enough to provide the phone number .
Duban feels bad that Duane and his wife Beth have to deal with this .
What ?
What does that mean ... we all have to pay taxes , right ?

On behalf of the team I am proud to announce that Linux Mint 6 Felicia is now available in 64 bit !
I would like to thank all the people who helped us test the Release Candidate and who gave us some feedback .
This release comes with all the innovations featured in Linux Mint 6 Felicia and for the very first time with the 64 bit versions of the Adobe Flash and Sun Java plugins !
Introduction to the x64 edition :
The purpose of the x64 edition is to offer the same desktop features as the Main edition but in a 64 bit environment .
It aims to be as similar to the Main edition as possible .
More packages are available for i386 than they are for amd64 and the Main edition is also slightly more stable than its 64 bit equivalent .
The Main edition only recognizes a maximum of 4GB RAM though and even on computers with less than 4GB RAM the performance gain provided by x64 over the Main edition can significantly enhance the user ’s experience .
System requirements :
An X86_64 64 bit processor ( Intel Core 2 , AMD X2 64 , etc… ) .
A minimum of 512MB of RAM is recommended .
Once installed the system works fine with as low as 256MB RAM .
The installation process deals with 2.5GB of data compressed on a 700MB CD and it can hang or fail on systems with less than 512MB RAM .
If you have between 256MB and 512MB RAM you may have to try to install several times .

Tell us what you think :
Depending on your hardware x64 Edition could be faster and show better performance than the Main edition .
We ’re interested to know how both editions compare so do n’t hesitate to measure your boot time , and common scenarios and compare them on the same computer with the Main edition .
Changes since x64 RC1 :
No matter how good or bad their software actually is , one thing is for sure : Adobe ’s engineers appear to be utterly unable to design a proper Mac OS X software installer .
I have already written about Adobe ’s installers multiple times :
It ’s not really hard to detect a pattern here , is it ?
With every new major version of the software , there is always the ( admittedly very faint ) hope that Adobe ’s engineers have finally come to their senses and designed a reasonably user - friendly installation process .
Alas …
Ideally , of course , we should just be able to do drag - and - drop installs .
But that ’s never going to happen , because Adobe Creative Suite is a suite , and that means that it includes all kinds of components that Adobe ’s engineers are not able to get installed without asking for the user ’s help .
So instead of a simple drag - and - drop installation process , we get this :
Please note that , even in order to reach that point , I have already had to open the CD in a window manually myself .
Apparently , it ’s too much to ask that the CD ’s contents appear in a new Finder window as soon as the CD is mounted .
I am all for user choice , but in this case , other than open the CD in a window , what exactly is it that the user might want to do with the installer CD ?
Once the window with the CD ’s contents is open , “ What is this ? ” is a very valid question .
Is it a folder or an application ?
To me , it sort of looks like a box , or maybe a filing cabinet drawer half open .
I guess I ’ll just have to double - click on it and see what happens :
Nice .
So now we have a bunch of things , one of which is called “ Setup.app ” and is presumably the Adobe Creative Suite 4 Design Premium installer application .
Never mind that everyone else on the planet uses the verb to install rather than to set up .
Never mind that the file ’s name contains no indication of what it is that it is going to be “ setting up . ”
Never mind that there are all kinds of other things in this folder that the user does not need to see .
Never mind that the application in question has the exact same icon as the thing that you ’ve just clicked on , which was a folder .
At some point , I guess you just have to plug your nose and jump in .
Of course , the first thing that the Setup app asks for , before it even shows you anything about what it ’s going to do , is your admin password .
Talk about taking a leap of faith .
“ Yes , Adobe , here ’s my password .
Do whatever you please with my entire system .
I do n’t mind .
You obviously know what you are doing , do n’t you ? ”
And then the icon dance begins :
Wait !
There is more :
Delightful stuff !
After some more of this , you finally get to a “ Loading Setup ” window .
And then this :
Ah yes , of course .
It is common knowledge that Safari is an Adobe application and that it cannot be running while Adobe is installing its new stuff .
Besides , who on earth would want to read a few web pages while the Adobe CS4 installer is doing its thing in the background ?
It ’ll only take half an hour !
Might as well sit back and enjoy the show .
Of course , being the inquiring person that I am , I cannot help but wonder why on earth the Adobe CS4 installer would need me to quit Safari first .
I half - suspect that it might have to do with Adobe ’s PDF viewer plug - in for web browsers , which I do n’t use because it crashes and Safari has its own PDF viewing feature and I prefer to download PDF files and view them separately anyway .
But Adobe ’s never really bothered to ask me for my opinion first .
So let ’s have a look at what it says it ’s going to be installing :
No sign of a PDF viewer plug - in or anything that would warrant a “ quit Safari ” requirement here .
Again , nothing .
( I checked the contents of “ Acrobat.com , ” just in case .
Whatever it is , it does n’t mention a plug - in . )
Yet more obscure stuff that I ’ll never use but should probably still install just the same .
Might as well use all those extra gigabytes of free HD space , right ?
Now it ’s getting really interesting .
All these unattached “ supporting components ” are obviously essential to something .
Aha !
There it is !
“ Adobe Flash Player 10 . ”
That ’s an Internet plug - in , is n’t it ?
Nope …
It ’s actually a stand - alone player application that Adobe installs inside the Flash application folder :
( It also installs the Windows version of it for good measure , although that ’s not mentioned in the installer .
It ’s also interesting to note that the Windows version of the Flash Player application is only 4 MB , whereas the Mac version is 13 MB …
What does that tell you ? )
I could go on .
( There are more components . )
But the bottom - line is that there is no mention in the list of anything like an Internet plug - in that would warrant forcing me to quit Safari before installing CS4 .
Yet when I check my “ Internet Plug - Ins ” folder in my startup volume ’s library , there are indeed new versions of “ Flash Player.plugin ” and “ flashplayer.xpt ” in there .
But obviously , asking for my permission before installing the plug - in and letting me choose not to quit Safari at this time are not reasonable options for Adobe ’s engineers .
So I end up just selecting the default option to install everything , and I let the installer do its thing , without attempting to read any web pages during the process .
The installation takes a long time , as can be expected .
There is an on - going dance of Dock icons , but I have long stopped paying attention .
What I do notice , however , is that the installer keeps mounting tons of separate disk images .
And of course , since Mac OS X’s Finder likes to compete with third - party applications for buggy behaviours , I get this :
The disk images are automatically mounted and then unmounted by the Adobe CS4 installer , but for some reason the Finder fails to remove them from its sidebar once they have been unmounted !
( The Finder also keeps confusing disk images with actual hard drives and using the wrong volume icon , just for fun . )
I try quitting and relaunching the Finder , to no avail .
I do not fancy restarting my machine to get the Finder to clear this mess , so I end up dragging all the icons one by one out of the sidebar .
Nice touch .
And of course , at some point , the Adobe CS4 installer needs me to insert the second CD of applications to install .
But here again , Adobe manages to screw things up .
It automatically ejects the first CD and displays a custom alert asking for the second CD , but once the second CD is mounted , nothing happens .
Instead of automatically detecting the presence of the second CD and proceeding with the installation without further input , the Adobe CS4 installer actually expects me to go back to the installer application and press the “ Continue ” button .
Sigh .
It is finally over and , after more cleaning up in the Finder sidebar , I actually have an operational CS4 suite .
It asks for my registration information and registers me automatically , but I see no trace of the freebie that people who register are supposed to get .
( It says so in the box . )
At this point , though , I am way past caring .
( Update : I actually got an e-mail the next day with the offer .
So at least that ultimately worked , although it could have said something at the time of the registration . )
All in all , it is , once again , a pitifully bad installation experience .
Adobe ’s engineers have not learned any lessons from the experience with previous versions .
And I suspect that the experience with incremental updaters for CS4 is going to be just as bad as it was with previous versions .
( See list of links above . )
Just what will it take for them to address this ?
LYON , France
After a two - day marathon of cooking and judging that pitted chefs from 24 countries against each other , the chef from Norway won the Bocuse d'Or , the cooking competition known as the Olympics of Food .
The Swede took the silver , the Frenchman the bronze and the American came in sixth .
Paul Bocuse , who created the competition in his name 22 years ago , and many of the top chefs here , both French and foreign , were rooting for the American team to get the gold .
American victory would insure more American interest , investment and validation of the award .
But Timothy Hollingsworth , the 28 - year - old American chef who is the sous - chef at the Napa Valley restaurant , French Laundry , did not fulfill his hopes .
In the previous 11 contests since 1987 , a Frenchman has won the gold medal six times , a Norwegian three .
Sweden and Luxembourg both won once .
The Americans have never even won the silver or bronze ; the best an American placed was sixth in 2005 .
I continue to see many bloggers suggesting that bank nationalization is a fait accompli and that anyone who is n't on board right now is in denial .
It is far less common that bloggers give serious consideration to the difference between a bank and a bank holding company .
In fact I usually do n't see that critical distinction mentioned at all .
If the government nationalized ( or " pre-privatized " … whatever ) Citibank , Citicorp would go bankrupt and we would be back at a Lehman Brothers scenario again .
So the government would have to take over Citicorp too .
That goes way , way beyond anything the Swedes did or for that matter it goes well beyond WaMu .
Shall I turn the mike over to Wikipedia ?
Citigroup was formed from one of the world 's largest mergers in history by combining the banking giant Citicorp and financial conglomerate Travelers Group on April 7 , 1998 .
Citigroup Inc. has the world 's largest financial services network ,
spanning 107 countries with approximately 12,000 offices worldwide .
The
company employs approximately 300,000 staff around the world , and holds
over 200 million customer accounts in more than 100 countries .
It is
the world 's largest bank by revenues as of 2008 .
You can read about Travelers Group here .
Thinking through the implications of said nationalization for the counterparty positions of a bank holding company , or its role in the commercial paper market , is mind - boggling .
Neither the FDIC ( which generally does an OK job ) nor any other government agency is in any way prepared for this kind of management task .
It has very little to do with standard FDIC procedures .
All I hear about is " bank " this , " bank " that , etc . but again little or no talk of the bank holding company .
Of course this is only a problem for the five or six biggest financial institutions but those are precisely the issue at hand .
On nationalization , Bernanke is very much on the ball .
He said this :
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said this week , is “ that you tend
to lose the franchise value , that the counterparties and others do n’t
want to deal with you because they do n’t know your future . ”
I usually do n't like to speak so negatively , but it 's the advocates of nationalization who are in denial .
There is a belief that Obama , Bernanke , and / or Geithner are somehow spineless or in the pocket of the banking lobby .
The sadder truth is that they understand just how ill - prepared the U.S. government , or the Fed , would be to run such an enterprise .
I do understand that if all the water runs out of the sink , as it may , nationalization will come in some form or another , however disastrous that may be .
But the desire to postpone it until the last possible moment , and the desire to pursue even a small chance of avoiding nationalization , are signs of wisdom , not cowardice .
When you read about nationalization , and see only the word " bank , " and not " bank holding company , " be very afraid of the advice on tap .
Addendum :
Here is a different but related piece on banks vs. bank holding companies .
Here 's a little a little tool I wrote that automatically generates copyright headers for source files in a git repository based on the git history .
Run it like this :

And it will give you this :

New Orleans is a tricky city to navigate , even on the best of days .
At nearly 300 years old , the streets are very narrow , and in Orleans Parish ( or Orleans " County " ) , most are one - way .
Add a parade to the mix , and things get far more difficult .
Today is Fat Tuesday ( or Mardi Gras ) , the climax of Carnival season , and in Orleans Parish alone , there 's not just one parade , but dozens upon dozens of them -- some with floats , others are just walking parades , but all are exuberant and jammed with spectators .
Apart from hotels , restaurants , and drinking establishments , nearly every business in the city is shuttered , and families are venturing out into the streets to watch the floats and costumes roll by .
No one will be driving except the police , the float - pullers , and tourists who have to be back at their desks on Ash Wednesday .

The spray will be used in first division matches next season
The Argentine Football Association is to introduce an aerosol spray to stop defenders creeping closer to the ball during a free - kick .
From next year , referees will use the spray in first division matches .
Referees will mark a temporary white line 9.15 metres ( 10 yards ) from the ball , which defenders cannot cross .
The spray will disappear 30 seconds later .
Pablo Silva says he invented the spray and got the idea when he failed to score with a free - kick .
" In the 88th minute , we were losing 1 - 0 and won a free - kick on the edge of the area .
When I took the kick , the wall was three metres away , " the amateur player told Reuters earlier this year .
" The referee did n't book anyone and did n't do anything , " he said .
" We lost the game , and driving home later , with a mixture of anger and bitterness , I thought that we must invent something to stop this . "
The spray has been given a trial in second division matches and a similar spray has been used for several years in some competitions in Brazil .
Amazon S3は安いか高いかという議論を、この2日間で立て続けに3個所で耳（目）にした。
1人はネットサービスベンチャーのCTOで、クラウドへの移行を検討しているものの、Amazon S3やEC2の実際の価格や使い勝手がよく分からないという話だった。コスト的に見合うなら、もうサーバ運用に煩わされたくないと漏らしていた。
も う1つは、ベンチャーキャピタルとして知られるYコンビネーターの掲示板で見かけた「
Does Amazon S3 really save money ？ 」で始まる議論 。1GB 当たり1カ月で0.15ドルと聞くと安いようにも思えるが、1TBの月額は150ドル、2年にすると3600ドル（1ドル92円として約33万円）にもなる。しかも転送量に応じた課金もあるため、実際にはこれ以上になる。今や1TBのドライブ単価は1万円を割っていて、2年で3600ドルとは比較にもならない。「クラウドでコスト削減」というのはお題目でしかなく、ちっとも安くないじゃないかという。
Amazon S3は安いのかどうかという議論で、私が目にした3つ目は、テックバイザージェイピー 栗原潔氏の「クラウドコンピューティングは安上がりではない」と題するブログエントリだ。栗原氏はクラウドを使っても必ずしもコストを下げられないことを、上に似た計算で示し、今後企業のIT部門ではクラウドとオンプレミス（自社所有）の使い分けポートフォリオが重要になってくると指摘している。
栗原氏は計算で、単価の高いエンタープライズ・ストレージを想定している。さらに、TCOに占めるハードウェア価格は30％という経験則から逆算し、単なるハードウェア価格だけでなく保有コストを算出、オンプレミス型での1TB当たりのストレージ単価を60万円と概算している。これを5年で償却するとすれば月額1万円となる。つまり割高なエンタープライズレベルの製品を使い、運用コストまで含めても、まだAmazon S3より割安だという。
誰がAmazon S3を使っているのか？
個人PCユーザーとし てAmazon S3をバックアップ用に使おうと考えたことがある。しかし、まったく非現実的な料金となることが、すぐに分かった。聞き慣れていないために「1GB15円」と聞いてもピンと来ないが、Amazon S3はストレージ容量単価だけから考えれば、ふつうに市場に買えるドライブに比べて非常に割高なサービスなのだ。
Amazon S3が割高なことは、すぐ分かる。ではなぜ、Amazon S3を歓迎している人々がいるのだろうか？ いったい、どういう人々がクラウドサービスを利用しているのか。
上述した掲示板の議論に登場した写真共有サービス「SmugMug」のCEOで“ チーフ・ギーク” を名乗るドン・マカスキル（Don MacAskill）氏が、この疑問に答えてくれているので、彼の体験談を参考に、今後のAmazon S3の可能性を考えてみたい（マカスキル氏の主張は、掲示板からブログエントリや過去の講演用スライドなどをたどれるほか、業界紙のインタビューからもうかがえる）
数百TBのデータ をAmazon S3に預ける写真共有サイト
写真共有サービス のSmugMug
2007 年の講演資料によれば 、SmugMugがユーザーから預かっている写真は1億4000万枚。その192TB分のデータをすべてAmazon
S3に置いているという。データ量は年々倍増中というから、現在は300TBを超えている可能性もある。これは、月間7億枚の写真がアップロードされるというFacebookのようなマンモスサイトに比べると小さいが、それでも十分に大きい。
同社は最初 、Amazon S3をセカンダリのバックアップ用途として使い始め、その後に本番用として使うようになったという。プライマリとして使うようになった後も、レスポンスを上げるためにサーバパークの位置をアメリカの西海岸から東海岸に移してみたり（Amazon
S3はアメリカに2つ、ヨーロッパに1つサーバパークが計3つある）、トラフィックを抑えて従量課金を安く済ませるためにアクセス頻度の高いデータ（写真）については自社サーバにキャッシュしたりといった工夫を加えていったという。
独自ファイルシステムの実装によって、アクセス頻度の高いデータは手元の自社運用データセンターから出し、そうでないものはAmazon
S3にあるデータを取ってきてから出す、という階層アーキテクチャにしたことで、自社ストレージの台数を95％削減できたという。アップロードされるほとんどの写真は、あまり参照されないため、自社ストレージに置くまでもないということだ。この階層化によりAmazon
S3上に全データを保存、そのうちアクセスの多いものをキャッシュとして5％程度を自社サーバにキャッシュするという構成になっているわけだ。
これはエンタープライズストレージベンダが階層化ストレージと呼ぶアーキテクチャに似ている。企業内のデータでも、ほとんどアクセスされない古いデータが多い。そうしたデータは安価で低速なストレージに（自動的に）落とし、ディスクの回転さえ止めてしまうことで容量単価や消費電力を下げられる。階層化ストレージの分野ではサン・マイクロシステムズがDRAM、SSD、HDDといった物理デバイスの違いを完全に階層化、抽象化する革新的なストレージ・アーキテクチャを昨年末に発表してもいる（参考記事：ZFSでNASアプライアンスをつくるとこうなる）
Amazon S3はIDC 間のリアルタイムレプリケーションに相当
マカスキル氏はコスト面で自社サーバのストレージより、Amazon S3に優位性があるという。冒頭に上げた容量単価の計算は、いくつかストレージ運用において重要なポイントを見逃しているため的外れな計算だと指摘する。
1つはデータの冗長構成についてで、Amazonは地理的に離れた最低2つのデータセンターにまたがって3重の冗長度でデータを保持している。自前で同様のことをするには、RAID構成のストレージを2つのデータセンターに置き、それらの間でリアルタイムのレプリケーションを行う必要がある。
事業継続性の観点からは最も望ましい形だが、非常にコストがかかるため、このような構成でITシステムを運用しているのは、大企業でも一部に限られるだろう。東京・大阪など2地点間でリアルタイムでデータを二重化するとなると、その帯域費用もかかる。
Amazon S3のサービスと比較すべきなのは、秋葉原で売られているベアドライブではなく、エンタープライズ向けの中でも比較的贅沢な冗長構成で高可用性を実現するソリューションを組み合わせた“システム”だ。電気代、場所代、運用ソリューションのライセンス料、回線帯域の費用などがすべて含まれた上での価格だと考えればAmazon S3は高いものではない、というのがマカスキル氏の指摘だ。
マカスキル氏が指摘するもう1つの論点は、時間による容量単価下落の影響だ。Amazon S3のようなサービスなら、ドライブの容量単価が年々下がるにつれて課金が下がっていくと期待できる。アマゾンは、そのときどきで新しいドライブを買い増すからだ。
栗原氏は計算で、5年というライフサイクルを仮定しているが、例えば今から5年前、2004年1月のHDD価格を見ると、容量120GBのドライブが8000円程度となっている。過去5年で容量単価はざっと10分の1に下がっているわけだ。「18カ月で集積度が2倍になる」としたムーアの法則を当てはめると「2の（（5年×12カ月）／18）乗＝10.079」と、ムーアの法則が成立していることが分かる。
5年で容量単価は10分の1に下がる。つまり、5年前の2004年に割安だった120GBのドライブの月賦を、2009年の今になっても同額で払い続けたいか、ということだ。マカスキル氏によれば、実際に過去アマゾンが安価なストレージを買い足した際に、SmugMugに対する請求額が大幅に下がったという（より詳しいAmazon S3のコスト構造の議論は、Amazon Webサービスチームのジェームス・ハミルトン氏が個人ブログで論じている）。
アマゾンには、不当な利幅を確保できるほどロックインの力もない。いざとなればAmazon
S3からデータを引き上げることもあり得るが、その引き上げコストをマカスキル氏は、おおよそ1カ月の課金に相当する程度だと指摘している。
さらに同氏は 、Amazon EC2のインスタンスからだとS3との転送課金が発生せず、両者の相性が良いことや（当然といえば当然だが）、キャッシュフローや税制面からも一度に費用が発生するハードウェア購入より、クラウドの従量課金のほうが有利であることも指摘している。
これはもう指摘するまでもないことかもしれないが、容量設計が不要でスケールアップが容易という点も、クラウドのような従量課金サービスのメリットだ。特にスケールアップペースが読みづらく、しかも会社の規模の割に桁違いに大きな容量を扱うWeb系ベンチャーではそうだろう。
システム障害は起こるもの
気になるのはサービス停止などのシステム障害だが、この点についてもマカスキル氏は体験談や考察を述べている（ここやここ）。
2006年4月から2007年1月までの間に、Amazon
S3で4度、大きな障害に遭遇したという。最初の2度はコアネットワークのスイッチが落ちるほどの致命的な障害でシステムは15分〜30分間完全に停止し、SmugMugもその影響を免れなかったという（当然SmugMugの有料アカウントユーザーは怒った）。しかしまた、その晩はAmazon.comが落ちていた。確証はないものの、マカスキル氏は、アマゾンは自社プロダクトを自社の本番サービスで使う、いわゆる“ドッグフードを自分で食べる”タイプの企業ではないかとしている。
過去に4度あった大規模なAmazon S3の障害にうち、残りの2回はサービス停止ではなく、大幅な遅延の発生だった。そのうち1度についてはユーザーが気付くレベルの問題だったが、もう1回のほうは、すでに上に紹介した階層化アーキテクチャを採用していたためにほとんどのユーザーは気付かなかっただろうとしている。
グーグルも落ちるし、アマゾンも落ちる。オンラインバンキングのようなサイトですら落ちる。100％のアップタイムを持った大規模でスケーラブルな分散システムは、誰が設計や運用をやっても今のところ実現不可能だ。ましてベンチャーの自分たちは、インフラのイノベーションを継続しつつ運用するなど不可能なわけで、「ダウンタイムはあるものだ」と割り切り、コストとバランスして考えるべきだというのがマカスキル氏の論理だ。写真共有サイトという本業に注力し、インフラは世界のトップレベルのグローバル・ネットワーク企業に任せる、という分業だ。
日本から使えるか ？
SmugMugのようなITベンチャーならいざ知らず、アマゾンがクラウドを作り出す試行錯誤に付き合い、それに適したアーキテクチャを設計・実装するようなことは、一般企業のIT部門ができることではないかもしれない（とはいえ、RESTでオブジェクトをGETするだけ。SmugMugがやっているのもオブジェクトのアクセス頻度でそれを場合分けするだけのこと）。この意味ではクラウドで総称される技術は、まだ企業にとってその動向を静観するべきものでしかない。中長期的に見れば、ストレージアプライアンスとして提供される階層化ストレージの一番下のレイヤーに、いつの間にかクラウド上のストレージサービスが加わっていた、という形で企業ユーザーには浸透していくのかもしれない。
だから、まだアマゾンのクラウドは使いづらいというのは正しい。特に日本からとなれば、アマゾンがアジア向けサーバパークを上海辺りにでも開かない限り、Amazon
S3もEC2も遅延が大きいために日本からは使いづらいだろう。ただ、2008年11月にアマゾンが開始したCDNサービス「 Amazon CloudFront」（参考記事：アマゾンが従量課金CDNサービスを開始）は、東京にもエッジサーバがあるため、これをS3と組み合わせれば、すでにコスト、パフォーマンスの面で利用すべき用途があるかもしれない。例えば拠点数の多い企業が社内向けの動画配信のインフラとして利用するといったことも考えられるだろう（あまりにも新しいサービスのために、Amazon S3 とAmazon CloudFrontの組み合わせの実用性はもちろん未知数だが）。
Amazon S3に限った話ではないが、クラウドサービスにはプラスもマイナスもあり、冷静に検討すればまったく割に合わないケースも多いだろう。そうした意味で、当初クラウドという言葉を誰もが口にするようになった頃にバラ色の幻想が生まれたとすれば、それは一旦は棄却すべきだ。しかし、本当の意味でITを活用しようという利用者なら、そろそろ日本からでも実験を始めてもいい時期だ。

Webcams on Texas border costing $ 2 million for 1 arrest Border cameras worth the cost ?
Internet site nets one big drug bust , but advocates say payoff is deterrence
More than a month after the launch of a state - funded Web site that allows people to monitor footage from surveillance cameras along the Texas border , the effort has netted one drug bust of more than 500 pounds of marijuana , officials said .
Since the Internet site went live Nov. 19 , more than 21,000 people have signed up as " virtual deputies " and Web traffic has topped more than 5 million hits , according to BlueServo , the company that runs the site .
The program allows " virtual deputies " to monitor activity on 13 cameras in South Texas and report suspicious activity through www.BlueServo.net, which automatically notifies local sheriff 's departments via e-mail of the reports , said Donald Reay , executive director of the Texas Border Sheriff 's Coalition .
The surveillance program , funded with a $ 2 million grant from Gov. Rick Perry 's office , scored its first and only drug seizure Nov. 28 with the discovery of 540 pounds of marijuana and the arrest of a suspected drug smuggler , Reay said .
He declined to disclose the location of the bust or the agency involved , saying that would provide too much information about the camera 's location .
Reay said the program is designed to focus primarily on border crime , not illegal immigration .
The system does not directly notify U.S. Border Patrol of illegal activity , although deputies with the local sheriff 's departments may call them if they choose , Reay said .
The program does not track the number of referrals involving suspected illegal immigrants .
Reay also cautioned against just focusing on the number of seizures as a measure of success , saying the program is designed to have a deterrent effect .
" When people think there are cameras out there , they hesitate before they act , " Reay said .
" That means our communities are safer on our side of the border .
To me that 's a win-win . "
But with its $ 2 million price tag , some critics have questioned whether taxpayers are getting results for their money .
El Paso Mayor John Cook said the program , so far , is " not a very good return on the investment . "
" I really do n't know of that many people who are going to spend their time monitoring a camera on the border as a pastime , " Cook said .
" Most people have something better to do . "
The public response to the program so far has been " extraordinary , " said Joe Milam , a spokesman for BlueServo , which runs the Web site and retains the rights to any advertising proceeds from the site .
" Virtual deputies are signing up from all over the United States , " Milam said , citing a list that includes states from California to Florida to Ohio .
Most of the deputies , some 55 percent , live in Texas , according to survey information provided by the company .
Houston ranks third - highest for the number of volunteers in Texas , after El Paso and Mission , the company reported .
Milam said the biggest measure of success is the satisfaction of the local sheriff 's departments .
" It 's going well enough that the sheriff 's are smiling , which is a good thing , " Milam said .
The Texas Border Sheriff 's Coalition , which includes 20 sheriffs along the border , partnered with BlueServo to get the virtual border watch effort up and running .
Hudspeth County Sheriff Arvin West said Tuesday that his department is participating in the program , and will soon have a camera up and running in a known drug - trafficking area .
Allison Castle , a spokeswoman for Perry 's office , said Tuesday that the governor is pleased with the new program so far .
She said it 's designed to deter crime , much like a surveillance camera in a bank lobby , or a police car parked on the side of the road .
" If you try to measure its success on the number of people that are caught or pounds of marijuana seized , you kind of miss the point , " she said .
" We want to keep people from committing crime in the first place . "

Artist Daniel LuVisi posted tryout concept art for the movie adaptation of the zombie saga World War Z .
It 's a veritable Where 's Waldo of splattered zombie carnage , mutilated New Yorkers , and other hidden gems .
Advertisement
This gorgeously gory work created by the incredibly gifted concept artist and production designer LuVisi , was put together as a try - out to secure his role in Marc Forester 's World War Z. Titled " The Battle Of Yonkers , " the piece showcases how seriously LuVisi is taking his work .
There are millions of details , from the camera crew to the red tape wrapped around one soldier 's piece ( click to enlarge in the gallery ) .
According to the artist :
This is the image I did , to get on the film World War Z with Marc Forster , director of Quantum of Solace .
Ca n't say whats going on or what the outcome is right now , but it 's not in the negative zone :)
This was one of the most difficult images I 've ever done .
Incredibly challenging to the point where I wanted to quit .
But through thick and thin I forced myself to complete it .
Advertisement
Because we 're now officially in love with Dan LuVisis art , we 've also rounded up a few of his other stellar pieces .
And to those of you worried that World War Z is too intricate to be truncated into a mere feature , if they make the movie as compelling as this piece of art ( and should LuVisi truly be connected to the film ) then they 're winning me over .

UPDATE : We just got the chance to hear from Dan LuVisis himself and he let us in on a few arty details going on inside this masterpiece , sounds like our new favorite artist is going to be busy , busy .
While he could n't officially confirm he 's working on the movie , all signs point to yes .
And thank the gods , because it looks and sounds like he's got the goods to help make this picture a success .

What is your medium ?
I work in Photoshop CS4 , with a WACOM Cintiq tablet .
And my right hand of doom .
How long have you been a concept artist ?
Since I was 3 :)
Professionally , since I got out of high school at 18 .
Got hired by a German company , Acony Games .. then ever since then , just been busting my ass off .
Advertisement
What movies have you worked on ?
Not as many as I want to ..
Two foreign films , over in Japan .
FOX's They Came From Upstairs , and a new one for Universal which I can't disclose yet .
I feel very blessed for what I 've done so far , but I do n't feel like I 'm there yet .
When I 'm working with geniuses such as Richard Taylor , WETA , ILM , Ryan Church , Dylan Cole and the other 50 of my inspirations ... then I 'll know I 've done something right .
What can you tell us about this piece " The Battle Of Yonkers " ?
What can't I tell of it ?
Let 's start with the book , my girlfriend 's sister was reading World War Z one day , and I asked what it was .
She told me , sounded cool , but I never put too much interest into it .
Few months passed , read it ... and just instantly fell in love with it .
Max Brook 's take on Yonkers literally blew my mind .
I 'm a huge action fan and military nut ( do n't support the wars , but love technology and design ) and I just creamed when I read those pages .
Instantly , I saw the whole battle in my head .
Then my manager told me he had a connection with Forster and we could potentially get some work in front of him .
Advertisement
Right there my eyes shot open and I knew I had to do it .
So I sketched out my idea and started working .
Two hours into it , I knew I was in deep waters and felt as if I couldnt finish it .
Way too many characters ( Sorry for the ones who expected me to draw every single marine ! ) and just so much chaos , it just intimidated me .
Thankfully for two awesome friends , a very supporting girlfriend , a German manager and my cat 's undying company I just worked my heart off .
And hopefully it shows .
As for whats going on with the movie and myself ?
I 've heard back recently , but I can't disclose any information at this time as I feel it is not my place .
Yet . :)
What are the little bits and pieces that people might miss ( there 's so much amazing work going on inside the piece ) ?
Advertisement
The camera man is my friend Reid Southen , he 's a great young artist that you can check out at www.rahll.deviantart.com
Much potetional .
I wrote WAINO , the last name of the character who explains the battle on the main MARINE 's helmet .
( I know , he 's in a humvee half the time )

If you look closely , you 'll see a little homage to Shaun of the Dead 's zombies .
Quantum of Solace is advertised on the billboard in the right corner .
A lot of the marines are left handed .
I do n't know why I do this , I 'm a right handed artist .. but it 's some weird habit .

Thats about it , there 's other things .. but I 'd rather you guys look for them !
How long did it take you to make it ?
A week , straight .
Literally , every day from about 9 am till 3 am .
Just working and eating .
Huge picture - size wise .
About 6500x4500 pixels .

Are you currently working for the movie World War Z at all and did that art help you get in the door ?
We 'll see . :)

A detailed list of the errors in Monckton 's July 2008 Physics and Society article
This document and all opinions expressed here are purely my own , and do not represent the views of any organization with which I may be associated .
I have received no funding or support from any source for this analysis or any other work I have done on climate or energy issues .
Arthur Smith
Selden , NY
apsmith@altenergyaction.org
Substantially completed : September 6 , 2008 ( see below for updates )
The following critique has reference to the article " Climate Sensitivity Reconsidered " by Christopher Monckton published in the APS Forum on Physics and Society Newsletter " Physics and Society " , July 2008 .
Please note several other critiques of this article have appeared online , after I started collecting my own notes , and their analysis has informed mine to some degree , so I thank them for that .
In particular see the commentaries from Tim Lambert , Gavin Schmidt and Duae Quartunciae .
I felt compelled to write a more thorough critique based on my own interest and long history as a member of the APS Forum , having written several letters and an article for the newsletter on energy issues , and given that I have recently been closely involved in several email and online discussions on climate and thus have become quite familiar with most of the issues involved .
The list included here is not intended for publication in " Physics and Society " - it would overwhelm that small publication - and I have prepared a much shorter separate response for that venue , focused on the central issue of sensitivity .
Also please note that simply itemizing errors in an article does n't prove one way or another whether the central premise of the article is wrong or not ( the " fallacy fallacy " ) .
Monckton 's central question is on climate sensitivity .
The magnitude of that sensitivity is a central question of climate science as a whole , and in particular centers on the sign and magnitudes of various feedbacks to temperature increase in Earth 's climate system .
The most recent IPCC report ( AR4 , Working Group 1 , 2007 ) presented a robust collection of evidence from physical modeling , paleoclimate , and observed recent response of the climate system for their conclusions of a temperature response to CO2 doubling of between 2 and 4.5 K , with a best estimate around 3 K .
The substantial collection of errors in Monckton 's article renders his arguments against this IPCC conclusion quite unconvincing .
September 11 , 2008 : formatting fixes : added greek character entities and replaced non-ASCII characters that came in via cut-and - paste .
September 12 , 2008 : added a linked table of contents , and expanded references section with more of the cited papers ( now rather randomly ordered ... )
Errors or fallacies in the text are categorized and denoted under the following headings :
Errors of fact : " Wrong "
Irrelevant conclusions and non sequiturs : " Red Herring "
Other errors of logic : " Nonsense "
Errors of interpretation or misunderstanding : " Confused "
Arguments that only work for specially selected data : " Cherry Picking "
Other arguments that have no scientific validity : " Invalid "
Statements that contradict or conflict with other statements in the text : " Inconsistent "
Monckton : ( IPCC , 2007 ) concluded that anthropogenic CO2 emissions probably caused more than half of the " global warming " of the past 50 years
Confused .
The relevant statement from the IPCC AR4 WG1 SPM is " Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations . " ( p. 10 ) .
Note Monckton has substituted " more than half " for " most " ( " most " is an approximate term , but generally implies more than " more than half " ) , " CO2 " for " greenhouse gas " ( incorrect but irrelevant ) , " probably " for " very likely " ( strong reduction in implied certainty ) , " past 50 years " for " since the mid-20th century " ( inconsequential ) and " global warming " ( in quotes ) for " observed increase in global average temperatures " ( Monckton 's change loses the IPCC 's implication that warming has in fact been observed ) .
Monckton : global mean surface temperature has not risen since 1998 and may have fallen since late 2001 .
Wrong and Cherry Picking : Both of these claims , no warming since 1998 and cooling in 2007 / 2008 are familiar to anybody who has watched online discussion of climate in recent years .
1998 as a whole was anomalously warm in all temperature measurements , and some months in 2008 appear to have been anomalously cool .
If you look at 8 - or 11 - year trends rather than 7 or 10 as of mid 2008 , temperature is up .
This is hardly unexpected given the complexity of Earth 's coupled oceans and atmosphere , and it is worth referring back to the definition of climate itself to see what 's wrong with this sort of argument based on looking at the temperature in any given month or year .
From the IPCC AR4 WG1 Glossary ( Annex 1 ) , p. 942 :
IPCC : Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the average weather , or more rigorously , as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years .
The classical period for averaging these variables is 30 years , as defined by the World Meteorological Organization .
The relevant quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature , precipitation and wind .
Climate in a wider sense is the state , including a statistical description , of the climate system .
In various chapters in this report different averaging periods , such as a period of 20 years , are also used
When you look at 20 - year or 30 - year averages , the temperature rise through the present is extremely clear .
Monckton : the failure of the IPCC 's models to predict this and many other climatic phenomena
Wrong and Red Herring .
See the above definition ( E2 ) of " climate " from the IPCC .
Phenomena on less than a 20 - year time scale are not relevant to a climate discussion .
Nevertheless , the IPCC referred to many climate models that included patterns of temperature variation very similar to the plateau or dips on less than 10 - year time - scales observed recently .
The IPCC AR4 individual realisations figure in the linked RealClimate article shows models with all variety of behavior on a decadal scale .
See below on the " many other climate phenomena " .
Monckton : Some reasons why the IPCC 's estimates may be excessive and unsafe are explained .
Invalid and Nonsense .
Safety or lack thereof is not discussed in Monckton 's paper , nor is it a topic of the IPCC's " Working Group 1 " which discusses the science under review here .
Working groups 2 and 3 focus on impacts ( safety ) and adaptation or mitigation .
The errors in the remainder of the article make the " excessive " claim not logically follow .
And why the " may be " qualifier ?
Monckton :
More importantly , the conclusion is that , perhaps , there is no " climate crisis " , and that currently - fashionable efforts by governments to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions are pointless , may be ill - conceived , and could even be harmful .
Nonsense .
There is no valid logic in the article supporting these claims .
And why the definitive " are pointless " , while all else is modified by " perhaps " , " may be " , or " could even be " ?
The level of certainty seems very inconsistent .
But let 's move on to the article itself .
Monckton : GLOBALLY - AVERAGED land and sea surface absolute temperature T S has not risen since 1998 . [...]
For almost seven years , T S may even have fallen .
Wrong and Cherry Picking - a repeat of the claims in the abstract addressed above ( E2 ) .
To reiterate , climate is long - term , not short term , and in terms of 20 - year averages , the temperature has continued to rise .
Monckton :
There may be no new peak until 2015
Confused .
The reference is to a 2008 Keenlyside et al article in Nature , but this paper looked only at decadal average temperatures ( a reasonable climatic measure ) , not annual averages which Monckton is talking about here ( " peak " presumably referring to 1998 ) .
Furthermore , Keenlyside 's prediction gave only a plateau in the 2005 - 2010 time - frame ( decadal averages centered on those dates ) , certainly not a decline in temperatures .
For an example of another prediction , one could refer to the Hadley Center 's 2007 paper in Science : " at least half of the years after 2009 predicted to exceed the warmest year currently on record . "
Monckton :
The models [...] had not projected this multidecadal stasis in " global warming "
Wrong and Nonsense .
Wrong on two counts actually : first , there is no " multidecadal stasis " in observations ; the only statement on longer than a decade for any sort of " stasis " is Monckton 's misinterpretation of Keenlyside 's prediction ; it is hardly relevant to claim this misinterpreted prediction constitutes a failure of projection .
Second , the models do indeed show periods of a decade or less with " stasis " , simply because the projected 0.2 degrees per decade temperature rise is within the natural year - on - year variability of measured temperatures ( and there are some long - term cycles like El Nino that have that level of impact ) .
[ The models had not projected ] the fall in T S from 1940 - 1975
Wrong and Red Herring : there were no realistic climate models predating 1940 or even 1975 , so there was little possibility of projection .
These years predated satellite measurements so many of the input parameters to models have to be estimated and are hard to calibrate .
There is also some dispute over the sea surface temperature records during this period .
Nevertheless , present climate models are quite capable of matching this period 's temperature record with reasonable estimates for aerosol levels and the known measurements of greenhouse gases .
See also these notes on the " ice age scare " and the reliability of climate models ( graphs there show the matching of model results in the 1940 - 1975 period and throughout the 20th century ) .
[ The models had not projected ] 50 years ’ cooling in Antarctica [...] and the Arctic
Wrong , Cherry Picking , and Red Herring : Cooling in eastern Antarctica is a regional , not global effect ; models that do n't get to that level of detail obviously wo n't project it .
West Antarctica has experienced some of the fastest warming on Earth in the last half - century , as has the Arctic .
Nevertheless , even some early models did project a delay in warming or even a cooling of Antarctica to this point : see Stephen H. Schneider and S.L. Thompson ( 1981 ) J. Geophysical Research 86 : 3135-3147 ; also Kirk Bryan et al. ( 1988 ) J. Physical Oceanography 18 : 851-67 .
See also this discussion of Antarctic cooling .
[ The models had not projected ] the absence of ocean warming since 2003
Red Herring and Confused .
See above ( E2 ) on 1998 and friends : 5 years of records is insufficient to form any conclusions on climate , and the measurement techniques are themselves still being refined .
[ The models had not projected ] the onset , duration , or intensity of the Madden - Julian intraseasonal oscillation , the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation in the tropical stratosphere
Red Herring : intra-seasonal changes are weather , not climate , by definition .
Quasi-Biennial oscillations are similarly well below the timescale relevant for climate .
Any oscillation contributes nothing to climate ( long - term ) averages , though it may alter slightly the variability of quantities that is part of the full description of a climate state .
Also , see IPCC AR4 WG1 section 8.4 ( more on this in the next item ) .
[ The models had not projected ] El Nino / La Nina oscillations , the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation , or the Pacific Decadal Oscillation that has recently transited from its warming to its cooling phase
Wrong , Confused , and Red Herring : most of the models used by the IPCC exhibit significant oceanic oscillations of these sorts : in particular see section 8.4 of IPCC AR4 WG1 ( p. 620 and following ) - " Evaluation of Large - Scale Climate Variability as Simulated by Coupled Global Models " .
Once again , oscillations contribute nothing in the long term to actual climate measures ( like average global temperature ) , although long - period oscillations would add additional variability in the 20 - or 30 - year timeframe traditionally used for averaging .
Another interpretation here is that Monckton is attacking the models because they do n't specifically predict the detailed evolution of these oceanic oscillations .
But they are not intended to and this is a misinterpretation of the purpose of climate models and the definition ( once again ) of climate .
The ocean oscillations are not strictly periodic , and their evolution is most likely chaotic as the coupled ocean and atmosphere respond to one another and external forcings .
Projecting their detailed evolution would be impossible if they are actually chaotic , and pointless for the purposes of assessing climate since climate is defined by long - term averages , not short - term oscillations .
oceanic oscillations which , on their own , may account for all of the observed warmings and coolings over the past half - century
Wrong and Confused :
This refers to a paper by Tsonis , Swanson , and Kravtsov , Geophys .
Res. Lett.,34 : L13705 , which looked at the correlation between indexes of the oceanic oscillations and modeled the chaotic processes through variations in coupling and occasional synchronization .
They argue that the oceanic oscillations account for temperature variations after you subtract out a trend for anthropogenic warming - see for example the difference in global temperature curves between their figure 1 and 3 .
The oceanic oscillations emphatically do not account for the observed overall warming of the 20th century .
[ The models had not projected ] the magnitude nor duration of multi-century events such as the Mediaeval Warm Period or the Little Ice Age
Wrong and Red Herring : once again , no climate models predate the MWP or LIA , so " projecting " them would have been rather astonishing .
Nevertheless , see IPCC AR4 WG1 section 9.3.3 , " What Can be Learned from the Past 1,000 Years ? " , p. 680 .
For example , " all simulations show relatively cold conditions during the period around 1675 to 1715 in response to natural forcing , which is in qualitative agreement with the proxy reconstructions . "
[ The models had not projected ] the cessation since 2000 of the previously - observed growth in atmospheric methane concentration
Red Herring : atmospheric methane is almost entirely anthropogenic , so it would be an input , not an output , of climate models .
Monckton may here be complaining that none of the emissions scenarios predicted this , but emissions scenarios are very different from climate models , and not the subject of this discussion at all .
[ The models had not projected ] the active 2004 hurricane season ; nor the inactive subsequent seasons ; nor the UK flooding of 2007
Wrong and Red Herring : Weather is not Climate .
On the other hand , the climate models have long predicted an increase in weather variability caused by increasing temperatures and higher water vapor levels in the atmosphere , so these sort of events are hardly unexpected in a warming world .
[ The models had not projected ] the solar Grand Maximum of the past 70 years , during which the Sun was more active , for longer , than at almost any similar period in the past 11,400 years
Red Herring , Confused , Inconsistent , and Invalid : Solar irradiance is an input to the climate models , not an output .
Estimating solar irradiance in the past based on sunspot or radiocarbon variations is a shaky extrapolation of the science at best , though it has some foundation in recent measurements .
There has certainly been no significant change in what we receive from the sun since satellite measurements started , but that has been the period of fastest temperature increase on the surface .
IPCC estimated very little change in solar irradiance over the past 250 years .
If these very small irradiance changes have caused the temperature changes observed , then the climate is more sensitive to small forcing changes , not less .
See also the following commentary on the sunspot - TSI issue .
[ The models had not projected ] surface " global warming " on Mars , Jupiter , Neptune 's largest moon , and even distant Pluto
Red Herring , Cherry Picking and Invalid
It seems odd to claim that models of Earth 's climate would project climate on the other planets in the solar system - but perhaps Monckton has forgotten the start of his sentence by this point .
At any given time , one might expect some of the bodies in the solar system to be warming up , some to be cooling down , and some to stay about the same , for a variety of reasons .
In fact , Uranus has been observed to be cooling .
If this is supposed to be some argument for changes in the Sun causing warming , see the previous section ( E18 ) on sunspots and TSI .
In fact , none of the changes observed in the planets can be explained by the minor solar changes in the period under observation , and they all have other logical causes , from changing albedo on Mars to natural orbital variations ( Neptune and Pluto have n't even completed a third of a full orbit since we 've had good observations ) .
See discussion of the claims for Mars , Jupiter , and Triton and Pluto .
[ The models had not projected ] the eerily - continuing 2006 solar minimum
Red Herring and Inconsistent
Why would climate models predict sunspots ?
TSI is input , not output .
Also see above ( E18 ) on TSI .
What happened to the " Grand Solar Maximum " ?
Global temperatures in 2006 and 2007 were among the highest ever recorded according to satellites and ground measurements ;
There is no relevance of this lack of sunspots to the subject under discussion .
[ The models had not projected ] precipitate decline of ~ 0.8 °C in T S from January 2007 to May 2008 that has canceled out almost all of the observed warming of the 20th century
Cherry Picking , Confused , and Red Herring .
First , Weather is not Climate .
A drop as large as 0.8 K for that period is seen in only one of the temperature records ( UAH MSU ) - the Hadley curve which Monckton also plots shows a drop in that period of about 0.35 K .
Just like the whole year 1998 , the month January 2007 was extraordinarily warm - if we were looking at monthly records instead of yearly ones for our earlier discussion of " peaks " , the absolute peak in monthly temperature anomalies was then , January 2007 .
Not so long ago .
So it 's not surprising that temperatures would drop from that point .
And to repeat , climate models are n't designed to predict 16 month temperature behavior : weather is not climate .
Finally , to have " canceled out almost all the observed warming " one would think the measured temperature anomalies would have to have returned to their early 20th century values , but in fact even the precipitous drop seen in the UAH MSU record is still above where that measurement was in the early 1980s , and the May 2008 temperature measurement for Hadley was almost 0.3 K above its 1961 - 1990 reference period .
Monckton :
Since the phase - transition in mean global surface temperature late in 2001 , a pronounced downtrend has set in .
Red Herring , Cherry Picking and Nonsense First note that the figure shows temperatures starting in 2002 , not 2001 .
However , this data is irrelevant because 6 - 7 years is not a sufficiently long period of time to obtain the averages that define climate .
Weather is not climate .
It also constitutes cherry picking because while the 6 - and 7 - year trends are flat or slightly down , the 8 + year trends are up .
The figure is also missing any estimate of error bars on the trends , essential for any claim of science - based analysis .
Whether calculated from the observed temperature variations of the past seven years or from a longer history of temperature variation , those error bars are known , and anybody with experience in such estimations can see from the image that the calculated trends are not inconsistent with an underlying rising trend , given the large variations in monthly temperature numbers .
The decline in the trend lines shown is just over 0.1 K over 7 years , well within the large yearly average variations .
Calling this a " pronounced downtrend " is vastly overstating the case .
Finally - what " phase transition " is referred to here ?
Monckton appears to be basing his claim on the oceanic oscillation work of Tsonis et al ; there is certainly no other claim or consensus of a " phase transition " in the global climate system in that year .
Monckton :
In the cold winter of 2007 / 8 , record sea-ice extents were observed at both Poles .
Wrong and Red Herring :
As can be seen from this image , the Northern Hemisphere sea ice last winter was still well below typical winter extents from 2003 and earlier , no record .
Antarctic ice extents have been gradually increasing over time , so it 's not surprising when records ( for which we only have a 30 year history ! ) are broken there .
Monckton : The January - to - January fall in temperature from 2007 - 2008 was the greatest since global records began in 1880 .
Cherry Picking
For a 100 - year record with no underlying trend , any given year will have a 1 % chance of breaking that record , up or down .
Furthermore , Monckton 's statement is true only for the GISS temperature record which he does not explicitly cite here ( but which does start in 1880 , as opposed to the satellite records that start in the 1970s , and the Hadley center data which starts in 1850 ) .
For the Hadley center data which he cites and shows in his figure , a far larger drop of 1.1 K is given from January 1863 to January 1864 .
Year - over - year temperature drops larger than January to January 2007 - 2008 are also present in the Hadley data for January 1860 - 61 , December 1861 - 62 , February 1869 - 70 , January 1874 - 75 , December 1891 - 92 and February 1892 - 93 , August 1945 - 46 , and February 1973 - 74 .
The temperature drop was unusual , but not that unusual .
Weather is not climate .
Monckton :
In 1988 , Hansen showed Congress a graph projecting rapid increases in T S to 2020 through " global warming " ( Fig. 2 )
Confused and Inconsistent : Hansen did indeed show Congress a graph in 1988 , but not quite this one .
The original ( at least the published version of the paper the congressional testimony was based on ) can be downloaded from GISS - see Figure 3a in the scanned PDF .
Monckton has changed the graph in the following ways :
truncated the graph from the left by starting in 1988 instead of 1958 , and from the bottom by starting at 0.1 instead of - 0.4
further shrunk the vertical scale - the effect reduces the visual slope by changing the aspect ratio of the graph
switched the labeling of Hansen 's scenarios A and C
replaced dashed lines with colored lines - the effect visually underweights the B and C ( A in Monckton 's ) curves compared to A ( C ) , which were equally weighted in Hansen 's version .
Hansen 's scenario A ( Monckton 's C ) is known to have significantly overestimated the increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gases over the past 20 years ; the reality has been much closer to B. Hansen actually testified in 1988 that his " B " was the most likely scenario .
added a title and various other curves and labels
Also , Monckton has been stating the central point of his article is an analysis of sensitivity : Hansen 's 1988 analysis found a climate sensitivity of 4.2 K for doubled CO2 ( see section 6.1 of the paper ) ; this is at the very high end of the range in the latest IPCC report , so the detailed comparison with Hansen 's predictions addresses a significantly different number than the recent IPCC estimate that Monckton claims here is too large .
Monckton : IPCC ( 1990 ) agreed ( D )
Nonsense : Monckton does n't describe where he got this IPCC ( 1990 ) projection .
The 1990 ( first ) IPCC report did present a " best estimate " of a roughly 3 K rise from 1990 to 2100 , but this was hardly expected to be the straight line ( with no error bars ! ) that Monckton plots here .
Monckton : these projections proved well above the National Climate Data Center 's outturn ( E - F ) , which , in contrast to the Hadley Center and UAH records ( Fig. 1 ) , show a modest rise in temperature from 1998 - 2007 .
Wrong and Nonsense : Monckton projects a straight line from the observations to 2020 ( point F ) , but temperatures in 2020 have nothing to do with actual observations to this point .
In fact , the difference between the observed temperatures and Hansen 's scenario B has never been more than 0.3 degrees , and it was already 0.2 degrees high in 1989 .
In 1998 the observed temperature was almost 0.2 K above Hansen 's scenario B .
So even Hansen 's over - estimated projection is hardly " well above " observations as yet .
Also , the Hadley and UAH data also show a rise almost exactly matching the NCDC numbers .
Monckton 's Fig. 1 shows monthly temperatures from 2002 , not annual averages from 1998 !
Monckton : If McKitrick ( 2007 ) ( G, H ) is correct that temperature since 1980 has risen at only half of the observed rate , outturn tracks Hansen 's CO2 stabilization case ( A ) , although emissions have risen rapidly since 1988 .
Confused and Red Herring : This appears to be a reference to McKitrick and Michaels , ( J. Geophys .
Res. , 112 , D24S09 ) which claimed that land temperature anomalies may be overestimated by a factor of two based on a statistical correlation argument and claims of Urban Heat Island effects .
This is despite the fact that the temperature records are already corrected for such effects , and earlier analyses ( Parker , David E. ( 2004 ) , " Large - scale warming is not urban " , Nature 432 ( 7015 ) : 290 and David E. Parker ( 2006 ) .
" A demonstration that large - scale warming is not urban " .
Journal of Climate 19 : 2882-2895 ) found no residual impact .
Even if this disputed claim were correct , it would only affect 30 % of the Earth 's surface , and Monckton is completely unjustified in dividing the entire record in half here .
The claim that surface temperature records are unreliable is a common one ; follow the link for further discussion .
Additionally , the comparison to Hansen 's scenario C ( Monckton 's " A " ) is also irrelevant , as Hansen 's projections for temperature under the B and C scenarios do n't start to significantly diverge from one another until 2010 .
Most of the recent warming is residual warming from increased CO2 in years past , not directly from the most recent few years worth of emissions .
Monckton :
There is no good statistical basis for any such quantification , for the object to which it is applied is , in the formal sense , chaotic .
The climate is " a complex , non-linear , chaotic object " that defies long - run prediction of its future states ( IPCC , 2001 )
Confused and Red Herring :
This is in reference to IPCC ( AR4 ) 's quantified estimates of confidence ( " very likely " or " likely " ) in various statements .
However , these estimates have nothing to do with " long - run prediction of future states " of the Earth .
IPCC 's confidence estimates are explained in box TS.1 in the technical summary of AR4 WG1 , p. 22 - 23 .
Some of these assessments are based on stastitical analyses , and where that is not possible , on expert judgment .
See the IPCC statements for details .
Furthermore , the quoted phrase " a complex , non-linear , chaotic object " does not actually appear in the 2001 IPCC assessment , not to mention the longer unattributed phrase regarding long - run prediction .
In fact , as described clearly by the IPCC , climate is reasonably well - defined as an average state ; the complex non-linearity and chaos of weather ( the subject of Lorenz ) is simply averaged over when it comes to climate , and the impact of the chaos is seen only in the statistical distribution of variables that defines the climate .
Once again , climate is not weather .
There is always a concern that , with such a complex underlying system , we may not end up with stable averages over the 20 or 30 - year periods that define climate , or more importantly that the response of this complex underlying system to our forced changes will be in some unanticipated direction simply because it is so complex .
Those " unknown unknowns " feed into the uncertainty estimates of the expert authors of the IPCC reports .
Science is never fully certain of anything .
Nevertheless , these authors have clearly stated their level of confidence , and Monckton has no real argument against that here .
Monckton : The Summary for Policymakers in IPCC ( 2007 ) says - " The CO2 radiative forcing increased by 20 % in the last 10 years ( 1995 -2005 ) . "
Wrong and Confused :
This statement as written does not appear in the SPM .
The closest statement to this ( p. 4 of the AR4 SPM ) is part of a paragraph , the full context of which is :
IPCC : The combined radiative forcing due to increases in carbon dioxide , methane , and nitrous oxide is +2.30 [ +2.07 to + 2.53 ]
Wm - 2 , and its rate of increase during the industrial era is very likely to have been unprecedented in more than 10,000 years ( see Figures SPM.1 and SPM.2 ) .
The carbon dioxide radiative forcing increased by 20 % from 1995 to 2005 , the largest change for any decade in at least the last 200 years .
{ 2.3 , 6.4}
Monckton : insertion , after the scientists had completed their final draft , of a table in which four decimal points had been right - shifted so as to multiply tenfold the observed contribution of ice - sheets and glaciers to sea - level rise
Confused :
This apparently refers to table SPM.1 ( p. 7 of AR4 WG1 SPM ) , which is a copy of Table 5.3 in the full report and which shows identical numbers .
The scientists wrote up chapter 5 , not the " bureaucrats " , so Monckton 's claim appears very strange , but of course I do n't have access to whatever drafts he is talking about .
The confusion is most likely because sea level rise is often shown in meters per century , rather than mm per year as in this table , and the difference in numerical value with those units is indeed a factor of 10 in the direction indicated .
Perhaps the table was originally shown in meters per century units , and changed between draft and final publication .
There have been no allegations from the scientists that the published numbers are wrong .
Monckton : heavy reliance upon computer models unskilled even in short - term projection , with initial values of key variables unmeasurable and unknown , with advancement of multiple , untestable , non-Popper - falsifiable theories ,
Wrong , Red Herring , and Nonsense : Weather is not climate , so short - term projection is not the purpose of the models at all .
Nevertheless , several of the computer models used are closely related to numerical weather - prediction codes which people apparently find reasonably reliable these days .
Climate models are run with a wide variety of initial states ( ensemble averaging ) which is a standard statistical technique since climate is defined by statistical averaging .
The " unmeasurable and unknown " initial values are irrelevant to climate .
And Monckton has even made a case already that some of Hansen 's 1988 projections were wrong , so the theories are hardly non-falsifiable .
Fortunately , the theories have improved since 1988 .
Monckton : quantitative assignment of unduly high statistical confidence levels to non-quantitative statements that are ineluctably subject to very large uncertainties
Confused and Red Herring : see above ( E29 ) on confidence .
Monckton : the now - prolonged failure of T S to rise as predicted ( Figures 1 , 2 ) ,
Wrong : climate - relevant ( long - term ) averages continue to rise .
See above ( E2 ) on temperatures since 1998 .
Monckton : [ the above ] raise questions about the reliability and hence policy - relevance of the IPCC 's central projections .
Monckton : Dr. Rajendra Pachauri , chairman of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , has recently said that the IPCC 's evaluation of climate sensitivity must now be revisited
Almost certainly Wrong or Confused : I could find no such statement by Pachauri , and Monckton cites none .
It is , however , a reasonable statement for Pachauri to make , in the context of the IPCC 's main purpose every few years to re-evaluate the science , they will most certainly revisit their assessment of sensitivity .
But I find it very unlikely Pachauri made this statement in relation to just a few months of temperature records : he is also quite aware that Weather is not Climate .
Until the next report , the IPCC 's AR4 WG1 assessment of sensitivity is the most well - grounded set of numbers we have .
Monckton :
The IPCC defines climate sensitivity as equilibrium temperature change [...] in response to all anthropogenic - era radiative forcings and consequent " temperature feedbacks " - further changes in T S that occur because T S has already changed in response to a forcing - arising in response to the doubling of pre-industrial CO2 concentration ( expected later this century ) .
Confused .
Although Monckton is close , the differences between this and the real definition lead to further errors later in Monckton 's article .
Here are the IPCC 's actual statements defining sensitivity in the AR4 WG1 report : from section 8.6.1 :
IPCC : equilibrium global mean surface temperature change following a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration
IPCC : equilibrium globally averaged surface air temperature change for a doubling of CO2 for the atmosphere coupled to a non-dynamic slab ocean
The definitions also do not refer to " pre-industrial " CO2 levels .
The radiative forcing is close to logarithmic in CO2 concentration , and the response terms are close to linear for relatively small forcings , so the equilibrium response should be roughly the same for doubling from any starting point within a few factors of 2 of present values .
The IPCC definitions also do not refer to any time period ( Monckton 's " later this century " ) - in particular , the meaning of " equilibrium " is a long - term , century - scale equilibration of the ocean , atmosphere , and land surface system under the different CO2 conditions .
IPCC also defines a shorter - term sensitivity , the " transient climate response " or TCR , which does refer to time periods and rates of change ( see chapter 10 executive summary , p. 749 ) :
TCR , defined as the globally averaged SAT change at the time of CO2 doubling in the 1 % yr - 1 transient CO2 increase experiment
Monckton : To [ CO2 radiative forcing ] is added the slightly net - negative sum of all other anthropogenic - era radiative forcings , calculated from IPCC values ( Table 1 ) , to obtain total anthropogenic - era radiative forcing [...] at CO2 doubling ( Eqn. 3 ) .
Note that forcings occurring in the anthropogenic era may not be anthropogenic .
Confused and Invalid :
This would indeed be a way to calculate the " total anthropogenic - era radiative forcing at CO2 doubling " , but that quantity is not the forcing relevant to examining IPCC 's studies of sensitivity .
As noted above ( E37 ) , sensitivity is defined specifically by the equilibrium response to a doubling of CO2 with all other forcings held fixed .
That means the forcing related to sensitivity is simply what Monckton computed in Eq. 3 ( 3.7 Wm - 2 ) , not what he ends up with in Eq. 4 ( 3.4 Wm - 2 ) .
Given that radiative forcings depend on atmospheric profiles which have to be averaged over , they are only believed to be known to within about 10 % , so Monckton 's error here is of little real consequence .
However , Monckton 's use of 4 digits in his calculations implies far greater precision than is warranted .
Even his calculation of the 3.4
Wm - 2 value is invalid , however .
The correct value for " total anthropogenic - era radiative forcing at CO2 doubling " would be the 3.66 Wm - 2 of the second - last line in his table 1 .
Monckton then adjusts this by an unexplained and unreferenced " IPCC probability - density function " to get his final number .
What does this " probability density function " have to do with anything , and where did it come from ?
Update
It was pointed out to me that Duae Quartunciae seems to have figured out where Monckton got his " probability density function " , from another IPCC table .
It makes no more sense than any of the rest of his analysis here , but the numbers seem to fit .
Go read the source for details .
Monckton :
To preserve the focus on anthropogenic forcings , the IPCC 's minuscule estimate of the solar forcing during the anthropogenic era is omitted .
Red Herring : and this is actually an important point .
Once again , IPCC 's estimate for climate sensitivity is based on a forcing change only in CO2 doubling .
Everything else , including solar forcing , is held fixed .
Monckton has correctly shown ( in Eq. 1 ) that the temperature change in response to forcing is believed to be independent of the type of forcing .
Therefore , the surface temperature response to a change in solar forcing should be essentially the same as the response to a change in CO2 levels that gives an equivalent forcing in terms of energy flux at the tropopause ( the temperature response at different altitudes and latitudes is , however , dependent on the type of forcing as we 'll see later ) .
What that means is that , if climate sensitivity is low to CO2 , then it will be low to solar changes as well .
Since the satellite era , solar forcing changes are measurable and known to be very small .
That is why changes in the Sun cannot explain changes in Earth 's surface temperature over at least the past few decades .
ΔT κ is the response of T S to radiative forcings ignoring temperature feedbacks [...] b is the sum in Wm - 2K - 1 of all individual temperature feedbacks [..] κ = ΔT λ /( ΔF 2x + b ΔT λ ) KW - 1m2 ( 6 ) [...]
ΔT κ , [...] is the change in surface temperature in response to a tropopausal forcing ΔF 2x , ignoring any feedbacks .
Confused : it is helpful to quote the definition of Bony et al ( Journal of Climate 19:3445 ( 2006 ) ) , appendix A , to get a fuller understanding of what " no feedbacks " means .
In particular , it is a physical quantity defined by the atmospheric temperature profile and radiative properties , and has no dependence on the feedbacks ( b ) :
The most fundamental feedback in the climate system is the temperature dependence of LW emission through the Stefan - Boltzmann law of blackbody emission ( Planck response ) .
For this reason , the surface temperature response of the climate system is often compared to the response that would be obtained [...] if the temperature was the only variable to respond to the radiative forcing , and if the temperature change was horizontally and vertically uniform [...]
IPCC AR4 WG1 ( ch. 8 as noted by Monckton ) similar defines it as the " uniform temperature radiative cooling response " .
I.e. " No feedbacks " in Monckton 's ( and common climatological ) terms means this bare " Planck response " of the atmosphere where the temperature at every altitude and around the globe is increased in a uniform fashion , while the other physical properties ( density and molecular constituents , etc. ) are held constant , to bring about a return to radiative equilibrium under conditions of a forced energy flux at the tropopause .
This is a well - defined physical quantity that is simply computed from radiative properties under typical atmospheric conditions ( as is the forcing term above ) .
What Monckton has done with his equation ( 6 ) is find a way to calculate something he states is unobservable ( κ ) from an observable temperature change ( delta T λ , which nevertheless he claims is " subject to great uncertainty " ) , combined with two other unobservable numbers ( forcing change , and the feedback parameter b ) .
Aside from any difficulties in measuring temperatures , Monckton 's feedback parameter b is also not known to any great degree of accuracy .
The simpler straightforward definition in ( 5 ) defines κ in terms of two purely theoretical numbers which are well - defined for given atmospheric conditions .
ΔT κ , estimated by Hansen ( 1984 ) and IPCC ( 2007 ) as 1.2-1.3 K at CO2 doubling
Monckton : A " temperature feedback " is a change in T S that occurs precisely because T S has already changed in response to a forcing or combination of forcings .
Confused :
While for the most part Monckton 's use and examples of feedback here are correct and quite coherent , this definition incorrectly implies a time - dependence via the word " already " .
Bony 's definition is the clearest I have read , although it is given mathematically by partial differential relationships ( see discussion around equation A3 of the article refered to above - E40 ) .
The basic issue is that the full response is defined by a return to radiative equilibrium , and some of the things responding ( water vapor for instance ) have dependencies on others ( temperature change over water ) .
To get to radiative equilibrium , all the feedbacks ( including the " Planck " or uniform - temperature one ) work simultaneously , it is not as if one goes first , and then another .
However , there is a time - scale issue in defining what is included among the " feedbacks " and what is considered " forcing " .
For the WMO definition of climate at 30 years , and in IPCC terminology , long - term feedbacks that may change CO2 , methane , and other long - lived greenhouse gas levels are not included , and the levels of these gases are assumed to be controlled ( forced ) .
On much longer time - scales ( paleoclimate studies ) where tens of thousands of years are considered , the levels of these long - lived greenhouse gases are themselves a feedback to other forcings .
Needless to say , this is a frequent source of confusion , and likely explains Monckton 's attempt to include CO2 feedback later on .
Monckton : IPCC ( 2007 : ch.8 ) defines f in terms of a form of the feedback - amplification function for electronic circuits given in Bode ( 1945 )
Confused : IPCC never mentions Bode , not in chapter 8 or in any other chapter I examined .
The partial differential equations described by Bony et al ( Appendix A ) force you to the same mathematical structure upon linearization as for Bode 's , but there is no underlying assumption here of some sort of mapping from one system to the other .
Bony 's paper does mention Bode at the start of Appendix A :
Bony et al :
The concept of feedback , which has long been used in electronics to characterize the behavior of a perturbed system ( Bode 1945 ) , is also used in climatology to characterize the response of the climate system to an external radiative forcing ( Hansen et al. 1984 ) .
Monckton : f = ( 1 - b κ ) - 1 ( 8 ) [...] f = ( 1 - b κ ) - 1 [...] ( 9 ) [...]
ΔF κ ( 1 - κ b ) -1 = ΔF κ f [...] ( 10 ) [...]
Figure 3 - Bode ( 1945 ) feedback amplification schematic [... ] [...] the base or " no- feedbacks " climate sensitivity parameter κ is successively amplified round the feedback - loop by feedbacks summing to b .
Nonsense : Actually , I do n't know what to make of this .
Perhaps argument by verbosity is what 's being attempted .
Monckton appears to be going around in circles with his math .
Most charitably I think he is trying to relate one IPCC statement to another , or one of the ones from Bony , with the Bode approach , but he certainly does n't explain what he 's trying to do here .
Other than repeatedly , in at least four different ways , to show that the feedback parameter f is equal to the inverse of 1 minus b times κ.
Yes , we got that , you did n't need 13 lines of elementary algebra to prove it .
To these we add the CO 2 feedback , which IPCC ( 2007 , ch. 7 ) separately expresses not as Wm - 2K - 1 but as concentration increase per CO 2 doubling : [ 25 , 225 ] ppmv , central estimate q = 87 ppmv .
Confused and Wrong : IPCC does not express the carbon cycle feedback as concentration increase per CO 2 doubling ( as that would make no sense on its face , also see the above discussion ( E37 ) on definition of sensitivity ) - the relevant discussion is in section 7.3.5.2 " Coupled Climate - Carbon Cycle Projections " , p. 533 and following of the IPCC AR4 WG1 report .
See table 7.4 and the discussion below it , on p. 535 .
In particular , where Monckton 's numbers appear to come from is the statement " This translates into an additional CO2 concentration of between 20 and 224 ppm by 2100 , with a mean of 87 ppm ( Table 7.4 ) . "
In other words , the IPCC discussion on CO2 feedback was about CO2 levels by the year 2100 , not CO2 levels when CO2 concentrations are doubled ( that is obviously a fixed number ! )
More importantly , anthropogenic CO2 causes both this positive feedback due to temperature , but also strong negative feedbacks from absorption by land and ocean as CO2 levels increase , as table 7.4 demonstrates in detail .
The net effects of emitting enough CO2 to add 280 ppm to the atmosphere can be calculated from the table : land and ocean sinks would absorb 700 +- 224 GtC due to the increase in CO2 levels directly , while ( with transient sensitivity 2.1 degrees ) releasing 229 +- 60 GtC due to the temperature rise .
Both effects would work together with anthropogenic emissions to reach the doubled atmospheric CO2 level used by models to estimate sensitivity .
However , Monckton is correct that this CO2 feedback should be included when discussing ( at least longer - term ) climate response to other forcings such as changes in solar irradiance .
But it is simply wrong to add it in , as he does in his eq. 12 , to the sensitivity - relevant feedback parameter ' b ' , which he then uses to estimate " Final climate sensitivity " in the next section .
The corrected equation 12 would gives b roughly 1.9 Wm - 2K - 1 , and equation 13 then gives feedback factor f of about 2.5 .
Monckton 's seemingly small addition of the CO2 feedback gives a 25 % error in his calculation of this number .
Thus , at CO2 doubling , -
ΔT λ = ΔF 2x κ f = 3.405 x 0.313 x 3.077 = 3.28 K ( 14 )
IPCC ( 2007 ) gives dT λ on [ 2.0 , 4.5 ] K at CO2 doubling , central estimate dT λ = 3.26 K , demonstrating that the IPCC 's method has been faithfully replicated .
There is a further checksum ,
ΔT κ = ΔT λ / f = κ ΔF 2x = 0.313 x 3.405 = 1.1 K , ( 15 )
sufficiently close to the IPCC 's estimate ΔT κ = 1.2 K , based on Hansen ( 1984 ) , who had estimated a range 1.2-1.3 K based on his then estimate that the radiative forcing ΔF 2xCO2 arising from a CO2 doubling would amount to 4.8 Wm - 2 , whereas the IPCC 's current estimate is ΔF 2xCO2 = 3.71 Wm - 2 ( see Eqn. 2 ) , requiring a commensurate reduction in ΔT κ that the IPCC has not made .
A final checksum is provided by Eqn. ( 5 ) , giving a value identical to that of the IPCC at Eqn ( 7 ) :
κ = ΔT λ / ( ΔF 2 x + b ΔT λ ) = 3.28 / ( 3.405 + 2.16 x 3.28 ) = 0.313 KW - 1m2 . ( 16 )
Wrong , Confused , Inconsistent and Invalid : Let 's start by correcting Monckton 's 3 equations here for the actual values , rather than his misestimations above .
Kappa of course we are in agreement on , at ( 3.2 ) - 1. ΔF 2x , the forcing at CO2 doubling , should be 3.7 Wm - 2 , not 3.405 .
f should be 2.5 rather than 3.077 , and the value of b should be 1.9 rather than 2.16 .
That gives us corrected versions as follows :
ΔT λ = ΔF 2x κ f = 3.7 x 2.5/3.2 = 2.9 K ( 14 )
ΔT κ = ΔT λ / f = κ ΔF 2x = 3.7/3.2 = 1.2 K ( 15 )
κ = ΔT λ / ( ΔF 2 x + b ΔT λ ) = 2.9 /( 3.7 + 1.9* 2.9 ) = 0.31 ( 16 )
Note in particular that Monckton 's " final checksum " ( 16 ) works just as well for the correct numbers as for his wrong ones - it's an algebraic tautology .
Completely invalid as a verification for anything other than that he punched numbers into his calculator correctly .
Let 's examine both of the other numbers , and Monckton 's claims for getting them right .
First , Monckton makes much of the fact that his result , 3.28 K , is close to the " central estimate " of the IPCC 's range from 2.0 to 4.5 K .
However , IPCC not only published a range , but a " best estimate " , which was 3.0 K , not 3.26 .
The reason the " best estimate " is distinct from the center of the range is primarily because the largest uncertainties are in the feedback parameter , Monckton 's ' b ' , which has that inverse relationship to sensitivity .
If 'b ' is larger than its central estimate , that disproportionately pushes the sensitivity to larger numbers ; if ' b ' is smaller , that has a lesser effect on sensitivity .
So using the central estimate for the feedback parameter ' b ' , as Monckton has done here , ought to produce a sensitivity value that is lower than the central estimate for the sensitivity , because of this inverse relationship .
Monckton 's result is , despite the superficial resemblence , significantly inconsistent with the IPCC numbers .
Using the correct numbers gives a consistent result ( to within the 2 - digit accuracy of the numbers presented ) .
On the equation ( 15 ) number for no-feedback ( Planck ) response ; obviously Monckton 's number is 10 % too low because he has used the wrong value for the forcing from doubled CO2 .
Note also that this is the same issue mentioned above ( E41 ) that gives an inconsistent estimate for κ relative to those found in Monckton 's table 2 .
In any case , using the correct value for forcing gives exactly the right number for no -feedback response .
Monckton then claims that IPCC 's estimate of this 1.2 K is based in some way on Hansen 's early calculations , rather than the more recent work he himself cited ( Bony et al , see E40 ) - there is absolutely no need for a " commensurate reduction " in estimates of the no-feedback response , it stands on its own .
He also misquotes Hansen 's estimate of forcing from the 1984 paper , which treated two different situations : doubled CO2 , and a 2 % increase in solar irradiance .
From p. 135 of Hansen 's article , we find :
The 2 % S 0 change corresponds to a forcing of 4.8 Wm - 2 .
The initial radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere due to doubling CO2 is only ~ 2.5 Wm - 2 , but after CO2 cools the stratosphere ( within a few months ) the global mean radiative forcing is about 4 Wm - 2 ( Fig. 4 , Hansen et al. 1981 ) .
Note also Monckton is again being strangely inconsistent by here quoting IPCC 's current estimate for ΔF 2xCO2 of 3.71 Wm - 2 , while in equations 14 - 16 using his own value of 3.405 .
Why ?
None of these three factors is directly mensurable .
For this and other reasons , it is not possible to obtain climate sensitivity numerically using general - circulation models : for , as Akasofu ( 2008 ) has pointed out , climate sensitivity must be an input to any such model , not an output from it .
Inconsistent and Nonsense : Monckton is correct that neither the forcing , the no-feedback response , or the feedback factor are directly measurable from observations .
But each of them is determined by physical constraints on the system .
Both forcing and the no-feedback response are determined by the spectroscopic properties of atmospheric constituents and the distribution of temperature profiles through the atmosphere .
Each component of the feedback terms is given by its own physical properties in the context of Earth 's surface and atmosphere .
For example the water vapor feedback is strongly governed by the temperature dependence of the saturation pressure for water , and the impact of increased evaporation on latent heat transport is determined by the value of water vapor 's latent heat .
Since the purpose of a numerical model of the system such as one of the General Circulation Models ( GCM's ) is to use these underlying physical properties to analyze the whole system , each of the terms individually and the sensitivity as a whole are straightforward to calculate from the detailed model results .
Monckton even quoted the results of these GCM's on feedback values just a few paragraphs before , from the IPCC quote stating " In AOGCMs , the water vapor feedback ... " .
The " draft " paper that Monckton refers to to support the astonishing claim that " climate sensitivity must be an input " to the GCM 's is by a Dr. Akasofu and can be downloaded here .
Despite the many obvious flaws in this paper , which has not been subjected to any peer review , I could not find any claim in it that even supported Monckton 's statement that sensitivity must be an input to GCMs .
Akasofu appears not to discuss sensitivity or feedbacks at all , rather the discussion relating to GCMs concerns the regional distribution of temperature changes .
To reiterate - sensitivity is in no way an input to the GCM's , it is one of their primary output values , and all three terms under discussion here can be readily calculated from the properties that the climate models keep track of in their simulations .
In fact , Monckton himself used the outputs of climate models in discussing feedback earlier in this article .
We cannot even measure changes in T S to within a factor of two ( McKitrick , 2007 ) .
Confused : See above ( E28 ) on McKitrick - Monckton has mis-stated McKitrick and Michaels ' dubious urban heat - island claims as if they put both land and ocean temperatures in doubt .
The models draw upon results of laboratory experiments in passing sunlight through chambers in which atmospheric constituents are artificially varied ; such experiments are , however , of limited value when translated into the real atmosphere , where radiative transfers and non-radiative transports ( convection and evaporation up , advection along , subsidence and precipitation down ) , as well as altitudinal and latitudinal asymmetries , greatly complicate the picture .
Wrong , Red Herring , Confused :
The start of this sentence appears to be a reference to spectroscopic measurements , though the phrasing significantly downplays the unparalleled experimental precision that has been routine in spectroscopy for many decades .
The " models " in fact draw upon large databases of the spectroscopic parameters of atmospheric constituents to understand their effects on thermal radiation .
One of the most frequently used is the HITRAN database from Harvard - Smithsonian , which contains details on close to 2 million spectral lines for 37 different molecules .
A summarized version of this detailed spectroscopic data is used in the " moderate resolution " ModTran program , which calculates radiative forcings based on specific atmospheric profiles and can be run online here .
Modern climate models may use either the HITRAN data ( line by line calculation ) or a simpler version as ModTran does .
In particular , there is no question that these spectroscopic details and calculations used by the models very accurately portray the behavior of thermal radiation as it passes through the atmosphere , and satellite and air - borne measurements confirm that they indeed apply to the " real atmosphere " .
Monckton 's list of non-radiative terms - " convection " , " evaporation " , " advection " , " subsidence " , " precipitation " - is completely irrelevant to radiative transport and forcing : those factors certainly play a role in determining the temperature profiles of the atmosphere at different " latitudes " and " altitudes " , but those temperature profiles are input to the radiative calculation .
Remember , the definition of forcing is the effect on the balance of energy flux at the tropopause when the term at issue ( here CO2 concentration ) changes , all else being held constant .
In short , the forcing from CO2 or other greenhouse gases is determined by taking the current profile of temperatures , pressures and constituent concentrations throughout the atmosphere , averaged over suitable climatic time periods , along with averages of cloud cover and similar factors , and applying these well - known detailed spectroscopic databases .
The uncertainties ( at about the 10 % level ) come from uncertainty in measuring those atmospheric temperature profiles and similar factors , not from the inapplicability of the spectroscopic data , nor from any influence of " convection " or other non-radiative factors .
Using these laboratory values , the models attempt to produce latitude - versus - altitude plots to display the characteristic signature of each type of forcing .
Confused , Cherry Picking : there is a vast quantity of information that can be gleaned from the models , both statistical ( means and distributions ) , and more detailed ( regional changes in temperature , precipitation , etc. ) .
Much of the IPCC AR4 WG1 content ( chapters 8 through 11 ) is devoted to what models can tell us about the climate response to changes in various forcings .
The earlier chapters of the WG1 report discuss what observations tell us about changes thus far , and some of the later sections compare models with observations in some detail .
This " latitude vs altitude " plot is but one of hundreds of indicators of change that can be compared between models and observations .
This particular comparison is discussed in section 9.2.2.1 ( p. 674-676 ) , " Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Response " in the WG1 report .
The signature or fingerprint of anthropogenic greenhouse - gas forcing , as predicted by the models on which the IPCC relies , is distinct from that of any other forcing , in that the models project that the rate of change in temperature in the tropical mid-troposphere - the region some 6 - 10 km above the surface - will be twice or thrice the rate of change at the surface
Wrong and Red Herring : Monckton 's Figure 4 is a relabeled copy of the IPCC's Figure 9.1 ( p. 675 ) and as he himself notes in his caption to the figure , it is the modeled response to the actual forcings believed to be relevant for the period 1890 to 1999 .
Since the forcing from well - mixed greenhouse gases during this period ( the third image ) is many times larger than any other forcing , it will of course show the strongest response .
Nevertheless , the fact is , all the images show an enhancement in warming or cooling in the mid-troposphere region in response .
This is hard to see in Monckton 's reproduction of the images where some of the color contours are washed out , but in the original IPCC figure 9.1 , the small solar forcing shows a stronger response in the tropical mid troposphere ; the ozone forcing also shows patches of additional warming in the mid troposphere , and the direct aerosol forcing shows enhanced cooling in the same place , the tropical mid troposphere .
In particular , the contours in the original figure 9.1 for the solar forcing show a warming of 0 to 0.2 K at the surface and 0.2 to 0.4 K in the tropical mid-troposphere , an amplification perfectly compatible with the 2 to 3 factor Monckton claims is unique to greenhouse gas forcing .
When the solar forcing is scaled to the same value as the greenhouse gas forcing , the tropical mid-troposphere region looks almost identical , as can be seen for example in the images shown in this RealClimate discussion of the mid-troposphere predictions .
So , far from being a unique signature of greenhouse gas forcing , an enhanced response in the tropical mid troposphere is a characteristic of all of the forcings .
It is in fact a consequence of the change in the adiabatic lapse rate ( the decline in temperatures with altitude ) expected for an atmosphere with higher water vapor levels .
The more water vapor , on average , the slower the rate of temperature decrease as you rise through the atmosphere , on very general basic physical principles .
Therefore , if the surface temperature rises and the lapse rate declines , the temperature for some distance above the surface will rise faster than at the surface .
The exact same mechanism arises whatever the cause of the surface warming .
The comparison of this basic theoretical prediction with observations is made in section 9.4.4.4 " Differential Temperature Trends " in the IPCC report ; more on this below ( E53 ) .
However , there is a unique signature for one of the forcings - not greenhouse gases , but solar forcing .
As the text of section 9.2.2.1 states : " Solar forcing results in a general warming of the atmosphere with a pattern of surface warming that is similar to that expected from greenhouse gas warming , but in contrast to the response to greenhouse warming , the simulated solar - forced warming extends throughout the atmosphere . "
You can see this signature in the images of figure 9.1 and perhaps more clearly in the RealClimate images linked just above .
For solar forcing , the warming is everywhere from surface to stratosphere .
For all the others , whatever the surface does , the stratosphere ( above about 20 km ) does the opposite .
In particular , the greater emissivity associated with increased greenhouse gas concentrations directly causes a cooling of the stratosphere , even before any warming seen at lower altitudes .
The observation of stratospheric cooling is strong proof that the sun cannot be responsible for recent changes in global surface temperatures .
The fingerprint of anthropogenic greenhouse - gas forcing is a distinctive " hot- spot " in the tropical mid-troposphere .
Figure 4 shows altitude - vs. - latitude plots from four of the IPCC 's models : [...]
- Figure 5 - Fingerprints of anthropogenic warming projected by four models
All show the projected fingerprint of anthropogenic greenhouse - gas warming : the tropical mid-troposphere " hot - spot " is projected to warm at twice or even thrice the surface rate .
Wrong , Confused and Red Herring : Aside from getting his own figure number wrong , see the commentary above ( E51 ) on why Monckton has completely confused the nature of the " fingerprint " shown in these images .
All four images do clearly show the true fingerprint : cooling of the stratosphere .
Warming of the tropical mid-troposphere is , as discussed above , due to changes in the lapse rate predicted from an increase in water vapor levels in a warmer world .
It is unrelated to the cause of the warming and is in no way a " fingerprint " of any one of them , so this is a complete red herring .
the projected fingerprint of anthropogenic greenhouse - gas warming in the tropical mid-troposphere is not observed in reality . [...]
In the tropical mid-troposphere , at approximately 300 hPa pressure , the model - projected fingerprint of anthropogenic greenhouse warming is absent from this and all other observed records of temperature changes in the satellite and radiosonde eras : - Figure 6 - The absent fingerprint of anthropogenic greenhouse warming - [...]
The greater rate of warming in the tropical mid-troposphere that is projected by general - circulation models is absent in this and all other observational datasets , whether satellite or radiosonde .
Wrong , Nonsense and Inconsistent : Monckton repeats his unfounded assertion that enhanced warming of the tropical mid-troposphere is a " fingerprint " of greenhouse warming half a dozen times here and in the previous few paragraphs , indicating the centrality of this false notion to his whole argument in this section .
On the actual observations , first note that they do demonstrate the actual fingerprint of greenhouse ( non-solar ) warming : cooling of the stratosphere while the surface and lower atmospheric layers warm .
So we can be quite certain just from these observations that the sun is not responsible for recent warming of the Earth .
Second , note that the time period for these observations is much shorter than in the graphs of projections ( figure 4 and 5 ) : Figure 4 referred to the forcings over about 100 years , from 1890 to 1999 .
Figure 5 looked at the modeled responses to a doubling of CO2 , roughly 300 years from from 1780 .
Figure 6 , in contrast , refers to observational data from " the satellite era " , the late 1970s to the present , or at most 30 years .
As discussed in E2 , 30 years of averaging is barely long enough to define climate , and for detailed features such as these altitude vs latitude averages , one would still expect significant noise .
Error bars and uncertainties for these radiosonde and satellite observations are discussed extensively in the IPCC reports - see section 9.4.4 and section 3.4.1 ( " Temperature of the Upper Air : Troposphere and Stratosphere " ) of IPCC AR4 WG1 :
Within the community that constructs and actively analyses satellite - and radiosonde - based temperature records there is agreement that the uncertainties about long - term change are substantial .
Changes in instrumentation and protocols pervade both sonde and satellite records , obfuscating the modest long - term trends .
Historically there is no reference network to anchor the record and establish the uncertainties arising from these changes - many of which are both barely documented and poorly understood .
Therefore , investigators have to make seemingly reasonable choices of how to handle these sometimes known but often unknown influences .
It is difficult to make quantitatively defensible judgments as to which , if any , of the multiple , independently derived estimates is closer to the true climate evolution .
This reflects almost entirely upon the inadequacies of the historical observing network and points to the need for future network design that provides the reference sonde - based ground truth .
Karl et al. ( 2006 ) provide a comprehensive review of this issue .
The radiosonde record extends back much further than the satellite one ( starting in the 1940s ) but there is much uncertainty about long - term calibration , for instance ( sec 3.4.1.1 , p. 266 ) :
Sherwood et al. ( 2005 ) found substantial changes in the diurnal cycle in unadjusted radiosonde data .
These changes are probably a consequence of improved sensors and radiation error adjustments .
Relative to nighttime values , they found a daytime warming of sonde temperatures prior to 1971 that is likely to be spurious and then a spurious daytime cooling from 1979 to 1997 .
They estimated that there was probably a spurious overall downward trend in sonde temperature records during the satellite era ( since 1978 ) throughout the atmosphere of order 0.1 C per decade globally .
The assessed spurious cooling is greatest in the tropics ( 0.16 C per decade for the 850 to 300 hPa layer ) and least in the NH extratropics ( 0.04 C per decade ) .
Randel and Wu ( 2006 ) used collocated MSU data to show that cooling biases remain in some of the LKS and RATPAC radiosonde data for the tropical stratosphere and upper troposphere due to changes in instruments and radiation correction adjustments .
They also identified problems in night data as well as day , indicating that negative biases are not limited to daytime observations .
However , a few stations may have positive biases ( Christy and Spencer , 2005 ) .
The radiosonde data set is limited to land areas , and coverage is poor over the tropics and SH .
Accordingly , when global estimates based solely on radiosondes are presented , there are considerable uncertainties ( Hurrell et al. , 2000 ; Agudelo and Curry , 2004 ) and denser networks - which perforce still omit oceanic areas - may not yield more reliable ' global ' trends ( Free and Seidel , 2005 ) .
Section 9.4.4.4 ( p. 701 of IPCC AR4 WG1 ) discusses the central issue of the apparently missing warming in the tropical mid-troposphere in some more detail :
Since 1979 , globally averaged modelled trends in tropospheric lapse rates are consistent with those observed .
However , this is not the case in the tropics , where most models have more warming aloft than at the surface while most observational estimates show more warming at the surface than in the troposphere ( Karl et al. , 2006 ) .
Karl et al. ( 2006 ) carried out a systematic review of this issue .
There is greater consistency between simulated and observed differential warming in the tropics in some satellite measurements of tropospheric temperature change , particularly when the effect of the cooling stratosphere on tropospheric retrievals is taken into account ( Karl et al. , 2006 ) .
External forcing other than greenhouse gas changes can also help to reconcile some of the differential warming , since both volcanic eruptions and stratospheric ozone depletion are expected to have cooled the troposphere more than the surface over the last several decades ( Santer et al. , 2000 , 2001 ; IPCC , 2001 ; Free and Angell , 2002 ; Karl et al. , 2006 ) .
There are , however , uncertainties in quantifying the differential cooling caused by these forcings , both in models and observations , arising from uncertainties in the forcings and model response to the forcings . [...]
A systematic intercomparison between radiosonde - based ( Radiosonde Atmospheric Temperature Products for Assessing Climate ( RATPAC ) ;
Free et al. , 2005 , and Hadley Centre Atmospheric Temperature ( HadAT ) , Thorne et al. , 2005 ) and satellite - based ( RSS , UAH ) observational estimates of tropical lapse rate trends with those simulated by 19 MMD models shows that on monthly and annual time scales , variations in temperature at the surface are amplified aloft in both models and observations by consistent amounts ( Santer et al. , 2005 ; Karl et al. , 2006 ) .
It is only on longer time scales that disagreement between modelled and observed lapse rates arises ( Hegerl and Wallace , 2002 ) , that is , on the time scales over which discrepancies would arise from inhomogeneities in the observational record .
Only one observational data set ( RSS ) was found to be consistent with the models on both short and long time scales .
While Vinnikov et al. ( 2006 ) have not produced a lower - tropospheric retrieval , their estimate of the T2 temperature trend ( Figure 3.18 ) is consistent with model simulations ( Karl et al. , 2006 ) .
One possibility is that amplification effects are controlled by different physical mechanisms on short and long time scales , although a more probable explanation is that some observational records are contaminated by errors that affect their long - term trends ( Section 3.4.1 ; Karl et al. , 2006 ) .
This is clearly a scientific question with considerable uncertainty in its resolution at the time of the writing of the latest IPCC report in early 2007 ( and for the most part papers had to be published well before the report came out to be fully considered ) .
There have been several more recent papers on the topic , both re-evaluating the calibrations of the different data sets and looking additionally at wind shear numbers from the radiosonde measurements to get better long - term temperature reliability .
This is discussed in considerable detail in this RealClimate article on the subject , and there is good reason to believe that the observations , not the models , need to be corrected to reach agreement on this .
In fact , Monckton refers directly to one of these new papers , " Allen et al ( 2008 ) " in subsequent paragraphs which illustrate why the observations are certainly not clearly definitive on this ( red herring ) issue at this point .
One final note here - Monckton is relying on satellite measurements of the temperatures of layers of the atmosphere .
This can only be done through measurements of thermal emissions observed at satellite altitudes , and comparing that in detail to the " results of laboratory experiments in passing sunlight through chambers " - the spectroscopic characteristics of the emitting species in the atmosphere ( molecular oxygen lines near 60 GHz are typically used ) .
Translating the observed spectra into an averaged atmospheric temperature profile is a tricky business , but Monckton expresses no doubt in its validity .
So how can one possibly explain , except through willful ignorance , his doubts about applying essentially the same theoretical analysis to calculation of the forcing from greenhouse gases in the first place ?
There are two principal reasons why the models appear to be misrepresenting the tropical atmosphere so starkly .
Nonsense : the models are n't , see above ( E53 ) .
the concentration of water vapor in the tropical lower troposphere is already so great that there is little scope for additional greenhouse - gas forcing
Wrong , Confused , and Inconsistent : the limit on water vapor concentration is determined by the Clausius - Clapeyron relation under which the saturation vapor pressure increases roughly exponentially with temperature .
Monckton himself points this out later in this very article , in the discussion on non-linearity : " The increase in water - vapor concentration as the space occupied by the atmosphere warms is near - exponential " .
So there is plenty of scope for more water vapor as the surface ( and near - surface atmosphere ) warms .
As to the effect of this increase in water vapor on greenhouse - gas forcing , changes in the water vapor component of the greenhouse effect are never considered as a part of the forcing , rather they are part of the feedback response .
Additional water vapor in the atmosphere most certainly does have an effect on the radiative properties of the atmosphere ; the water vapor component of the atmosphere is an important part of the total greenhouse effect , and changes in water vapor are the most important part of the feedback process .
But more than this , the " hot spot " from the models is , as discussed above ( E53 ) , caused by changes in the " lapse rate " , the temperature decrease with altitude that balances the pressure reduction with height due to gravity .
The higher the water vapor content of the atmosphere , the lower the lapse rate .
This has absolutely nothing to do with radiative forcing or the greenhouse properties of water vapor .
Monckton continues to completely misrepresent the basic questions here .
Secondly , though the models assume that the concentration of water vapor will increase in the tropical mid-troposphere as the space occupied by the atmosphere warms , advection transports much of the additional water vapor poleward from the tropics at that altitude .
Invalid :
There is no reason changes in advection in a warmer world would somehow transport the " additional water vapor " only ( or mostly ) .
In any case , this would be an issue for estimation of feedbacks , not radiative forcing , the supposed topic of this entire section .
the great majority of the incoming solar radiation incident upon the Earth strikes the tropics
Wrong and Red Herring :
The tropics are usually defined in climate discussions as from 20 degrees S to 20 degrees N.
The fraction of incoming sunlight striking that part of the globe at the top of the atmosphere is about 43 % , less than half .
Even using the full tropical range of 23.4 degrees N and S gives only about 49 % .
Hardly the " great majority " .
Moreover , the relevant factor for radiative forcing ( supposedly the topic of this section of the article ) is the outgoing thermal flux , not incoming solar , and that comes simultaneously from all parts of the globe , day and night .
You need to expand the definition of tropics to 30 degrees S to 30 degrees N ( as is sometimes done ) to include half of Earth 's surface area ; 20 S to 20 N is just 34 % .
any reduction in tropical radiative forcing has a disproportionate effect on mean global forcings .
On the basis of Lindzen ( 2007 ) , the anthropogenic - ear radiative forcing as established in Eqn. ( 3 ) are divided by 3 to take account of the observed failure of the tropical mid-troposphere to warm as projected by the models
Invalid and Nonsense : Lindzen 's claim ( hardly supported by much evidence , given the above discussion ( E53 ) on the tropical troposphere observations ) is concerned with the feedback effect of water vapor levels in the tropical atmosphere , and has nothing to do with the radiative forcing calculated for greenhouse gases .
So the factor of three applied here might be more correctly applied to the feedback factor discussed later - it clearly has absolutely nothing to do with the value of the greenhouse gas forcing number ΔF 2 x that Monckton attributes it to here .
Even if this factor of 3 is real it cannot be applied to the entire globe - it applies only to the tropics .
As noted above ( E53 ) , the models and observations agree well outside the tropics .
Monckton is claiming the unlikely factor of 3 reduction in tropical water vapor feedback can be applied globally based on the preceding erroneous claim about the " great majority " of incoming solar radiation .
One would have to slice this reduction at least in half since the " great majority " is itself less than half .
In the end , if the models are wrong about the tropical troposphere by overestimating water vapor levels as Monckton is arguing here , the final effect on the water vapor feedback term would be on the order of a 30 % reduction , rather than the claimed factor of 3 .
Such a 30 % reduction is well within the existing range of estimates of the water vapor feedback from different climate models anyway - see figure 8.14 in IPCC AR4 WG1 ( p. 631 ) .
In any case , Monckton 's equation 17 is wrong and of no value ; the arguments here have absolutely no bearing on the forcing from greenhouse gases .
The base climate sensitivity parameter ... is the most influential of the three factors
Invalid - the statement is meaningless .
What criteria would make one factor more influential than others ?
Monckton 's argument seems to be that the heightened influence comes from the parameter appearing in more than one place in the equations , but what relevance does that have ?
If all three parameters were unknown to an equal degree , then one could argue that the equations imply a greater variability of the final sensitivity to the variability in this parameter , which may be what Monckton is trying to imply .
But the fact is , as we will see below ( E72 ) , this no-feedbacks parameter is the most tightly constrained of the three .
The forcing is nearly as tightly constrained , while it is in the feedbacks that by far the largest uncertainties , and all the real scientific questions at this time , are present .
So whatever the base climate sensitivity parameter 's " influence " , we know pretty precisely what it is , and any remaining questions about its exact value are inconsequential to the sensitivity compared to the unknown factors in the feedback parameter .
Yet κ has received limited attention in the literature .
In IPCC ( 2001 , 2007 ) it is not mentioned .
However , its value may be deduced from hints in the IPCC 's reports .
Confused and Invalid : Monckton's κ ( the inverse of Bony et al 's Planck response noted in E40 ) is a somewhat artificial construct not particularly relevant for the discussions in the IPCC reports .
Climate models do n't use anything resembling Monckton 's " κ " in working out the full temperature response , they use the actual radiative properties of the atmosphere under the modeled conditions .
Nevertheless , the bare uniform temperature response is mentioned in the 2007 ( AR4 ) report , section 8.6.2.3 ( p. 631 ) :
In the idealised situation that the climate response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 consisted of a uniform temperature change only , with no feedbacks operating ( but allowing for the enhanced radiative cooling resulting from the temperature increase ) , the global warming from GCMs would be around 1.2 degrees C ( Hansen et al. , 1984 ; Bony et al. , 2006 ) .
The program Monckton here embarks on to try to extract his " κ " parameter from statements about other quantities in the IPCC reports and other sources is a pointless exercise in textual archeology ( which , unsurprisingly , he completely flubs anyway : see E76 and related entries below ) .
This may be of interest in validating the self - consistency of various statements in the reports , but it is not a scientifically valid way of discovering what value some real physical parameter should have !
Since λ = κ f = κ ( 1 - b κ ) -1 ( Eqns. 1 , 2 ) , where λ = 0.5 KW - 1m2 and b ≈ 2.16 Wm - 2 K - 1 ( Eqn. 12 ) , it is simple to calculate that , in 2001 , one of the IPCC 's values for f was 2.08 .
Invalid : First , see above ( E45 ) - b should be 1.9 , not 2.16 .
Also , this value for the feedbacks comes from the 2007 AR4 IPCC report , so why is Monckton applying it to the 2001 report ?
Second , the quoted statement from IPCC 2001 puts the value of λ at " about 0.5 KW - 1m2 " , for " one-dimensional radiative - convective models " , quoting a 1985 paper , which was the basis for thinking that the surface temperature response would usually be independent of the forcing .
The point is that whatever the cause of the change in power delivered to the top of the troposphere ( the forcing ) , whether from solar irradiance changes , aerosols , or greenhouse gases , the temperature response at the surface of the Earth is expected to respond in close to the same way for all .
That is the reason this separation into different feedback factors makes sense at all .
This value of 0.5 was not some magically precise value for the response for the 2001 IPCC report .
Given the doubling forcing of about 3.7 Wm - 2 , the IPCC TAR ( 2001 ) sensitivity range of 1.5 to 4.5 K gives values of λ in the range 0.4 to 1.2 , far from being precisely the 0.5 that Monckton clings to .
Monckton 's formulas are useless for deriving the feedback parameter f appropriate to this range , because the primary cause of variability in the sensitivity is uncertainty in the value of Monckton 's ' b ' .
For the established value of κ around 0.3 , however , this gives values of f in the range from 1.3 to 4 , and the corresponding values of b would be in the range about 0.8 to 2.5 Wm - 2 K - 1 .
For more discussion on some of these issues from the perspective of the 2001 IPCC report ( TAR WG1 ) , see for example section 7.2.1.1 on the water vapour feedback , giving an f for water vapour of roughly 2 .
Thus the value f = 3.077 in IPCC ( 2007 ) represents a near - 50 % increase in the value of f in only five years
Wrong and Invalid : See above ( E45 ) - the correct value of Monckton 's f for the 2007 IPCC report is actually 2.5 ( best estimate of feedbacks ) , not 3.077 .
Given that AR4 tightened the sensitivity range to 2.0 to 4.5 K from the TAR 1.5 to 4.5 K , a slight increase in the feedback parameter is not unexpected .
But even by this odd analysis ( based on the dubious claim that 0.5 was the best value for λ in the 2001 report ) the increase is about 25 % , not 50 % .
Where f = 2.08 , κ = λ / f ≈ 0.5 / 2.08 ≈ 0.24 KW - 1m2 , again substantially lower than the value implicit in IPCC ( 2007 ) .
Invalid : to the single - digit precision implied but probably not even relevant for the " 0.5 " value , this ratio with f roughly equal to ( and slightly below ) 2 gives a value of κ approximately equal to 0.3 KW - 1m2 .
Little more can be said - it is certainly within the range of the real κ , as of course it has to be .
The fundamental equation of radiative transfer at the emitting surface of an astronomical body , relating changes in radiant - energy flux to changes in temperature , is the Stefan - Boltzmann equation ... ( 18 )
Confused : First , this stuff does n't just apply to astronomical bodies .
Second , the true fundamental equation for thermal radiation is the product of frequency - dependent emissivity with the Planck black - body spectrum .
The Stefan - Boltzmann equation , Monckton 's equation 18 ( other than the extraneous Wm - 2 which should be part of the definition of the Stefan - Boltzmann constant ) comes from integrating the Planck spectrum assuming emissivity is independent of frequency .
This is n't a bad approximation for Earth 's surface which is close to a black body at thermal frequencies , but the spectral dependence of emissivity is critical for understanding radiative transfer in the atmosphere , which this expression obviously ignores .
Note also that Monckton has used the variable name ' F ' here for the radiant flux - which is fine , but easily confused with the F used previously for " forcing " at the tropopause .
He immediately compounds this with :
κ = dT/dF ... ( 19 )
Confused and inconsistent : this is a new definition of κ - see Monckton 's equation 5 for the original , and note that there the delta T in the numerator is surface temperature , while the delta F is the ( forcing ) change in radiative flux at the tropopause .
In Monckton 's equation 19 the flux and temperature are associated with the same emitting surface .
In other words this κ is not the same as the earlier κ .
Why use the same variable name , except to cause confusion ?
Monckton himself notes the problem , but blames the IPCC for his confusion about κ in his comment a few paragraphs down which deserves its own out - of - order discussion here :
E66
However , the IPCC , in its evaluation of κ , does not follow the rule that in the Stefan - Boltzmann equation the temperature and radiant - energy flux must be taken at the same level of the atmosphere .
The IPCC 's value for κ is dependent upon temperature at the surface and radiant - energy flux at the tropopause
Nonsense and Inconsistent : Monckton previously asserted that the IPCC made no mention of his " κ " - yet now he blames them for " not following the rule " .
It is Monckton who has provided two inconsistent definitions of κ here , not the IPCC .
No wonder Monckton 's numbers on this do n't make any sense .
λ max = 2897 / T S = 2897 / 288 ≈ 10 micron . ( 20 )
Inconsistent : this should also be labeled " sloppy " - he 's missing units on the " 2897 " ( should be x 10 ^ - 6 m K ) .
More importantly , the Wien law comes from differentiating the Planck spectrum , while he is otherwise consistently ignoring the issue of spectral dependence here .
the Earth / troposphere system is a blackbody with respect to the infrared radiation
Wrong : Uh , no it is n't .
That 's sort of the whole point of the influence of greenhouse gases on radiative transfer .
If Earth was a black body this would be much simpler .
Earth 's surface ( not including any atmosphere ) is n't far from a black body ( though it does n't ever carry a single uniform temperature , another issue for this ) , but Monckton specifically includes the troposphere here .
Wrong .
At the Earth 's surface , T S ≈ 288 K , so that κ S ≈ 0.185 KW - 1m2 .
At the characteristic - emission level , Z C , the variable altitude at which incoming and outgoing radiative fluxes balance , T C ≈ 254 K , so that κ C ≈ 0.269 KW - 1m2 .
Red Herring and Confused : at least Monckton implicitly acknowledges through the subscript labels " C " and " S " that these κ's are not the same as the κ associated with climate sensitivity .
The one associated with climate sensitivity is in particular defined by flux at the tropopause .
Since by definition the temperature change in this bare " Planck " response is assumed to be uniform , the response change in temperature delta T S at the surface would be the same temperature change at the tropopause .
Therefore , to the extent it has any validity for this purpose , one could use the Stefan - Boltzmann approach Monckton has outlined here provided the temperature used is the one that follows the " rule " he lays out : " the temperature and radiant - energy flux must be taken at the same level of the atmosphere " .
I.e. the relevant temperature is not at the surface , nor at the " characteristic - emission " level , whatever that 's supposed to be , but at the tropopause , because that 's the altitude at which radiative forcing is defined .
Now , the average temperature of the tropopause is quite a bit lower than either of the two temperatures Monckton cites , at roughly 220 K .
Plugging that into Monckton 's equation 21 we find a value for κ at the tropopause of about 0.41 KW - 1m2 .
Of course the black - body assumption that went into equation 21 is wrong as noted above ( E68 ) ; the actual value for κ is lower thanks to the frequency dependence of emissivity and the atmospheric layering and temperature and pressure variations with altitude that contribute to the outgoing thermal radiation spectrum .
Hansen says dF 2x is equivalent to a 2 % increase in incoming total solar irradiance ( TSI ) . [...]
Thus a 2 % increase in F C is equivalent to 4.72 Wm - 2 , rounded up by Hansen to 4.8 Wm - 2 , implying that κ ≈ 1.25 / 4.8 ≈ 0.260 KW - 1m2 .
However , Hansen , in his Eqn. { 14} , prefers 0.29 Wm - 2 .
Invalid and Confused : See above ( E46 ) - in 1984 Hansen cites a radiative forcing of about 4 Wm - 2 , not 4.8 .
This is about 1.7 % of net TSI , or when rounded to one significant figure , about 2 % .
The 1984 paper also does not claim that the two forcings studied are " equivalent " , rather that they have " similar magnitudes " .
Once again Monckton is using low - precision numbers to try to derive high - precision consequences , a completely invalid process .
For a forcing of 4
Wm - 2 we naturally find κ close to 0.31 KW - 1m2 ( between 0.30 and 0.325 given the 1.2 - 1.3 K range Hansen estimated for the bare response ) , as it must be .
Bony takes T C ≈ 255 K and F C ≈ 235 Wm - 2 at Z C as the theoretical basis for the stated prima facie value κ- 1 ≈ T C / 4F C ≈ 3.8 Wm - 2K - 1 , so that κ ≈ 0.263 KW - 1m2 , in very close agreement with Hansen .
However , Bony cites two further papers , Colman ( 2003 ) and Soden &Held ( 2006 ) , as justification for the value κ- 1 ≈ 3.2 Wm - 2 K - 1 , so that κ ≈ 0.313 KW - 1m2 .
Wrong and Confused : the zero- dimensional uniform - temperature atmosphere - free Earth represented by Monckton 's " C " subscripts is a common reference frame for climate parameters - it is of course the basis for claims of 33 K of warming from the greenhouse effect as a whole .
Bony 's use of it is only as a plausibility argument for the rough order of magnitude that this κ value should have , it is clearly not a coherent scientific derivation of what the parameter should be for the real Earth - Bony 's paper describes specifically how it is calculated , and as it was calculated long ago .
There is no claim here by Bony that the value of the inverse of κ should be 3.8 , the paper very specifically cites the agreed value of 3.2 .
Also , Monckton claims this atmosphere - free Earth number ( 0.263 from inverting Bony 's 3.8 ) is " in very close agreement with Hansen " by which he can only mean Monckton 's erroneous derivation of 0.260 above ( E70 ) ; Hansen never states such a value and neither does Bony .
The agreement here is only in Monckton 's imagination .
Colman ( 2003 ) does not state a value for κ , but cites Hansen et al. ( 1984 ) , rounding up the value κ ≈ 0.260 KW - 1m2 to 0.3 KW - 1m2 - " The method used assumes a surface temperature increase of 1.2 K with only the CO2 forcing and the ' surface temperature ' feedback operating ( value originally taken from Hansen et al. 1984 ) . " Soden& Held ( 2006 ) likewise do not declare a value for κ .
However , we may deduce their implicit central estimate κ ≈ 1 / 4 = 0.250 KW - 1m2 from the following passage - " The increase in opacity due to a doubling of CO2 causes [ the characteristic emission level Z C ] to rise by ~ 150 meters .
This results in a reduction in the effective temperature of the emission across the tropopause by ~( 6.5K / km ) ( 150 m ) ≈ 1 K , which converts to 4 Wm - 2 using the Stefan - Boltzmann law . "
Thus the IPCC cites only two papers that cite two others in turn .
None of these papers provides any theoretical or empirical justification for a value as high as the κ ≈ 0.313 KW - 1m2 chosen by the IPCC .
Wrong and Invalid :
This assertion that the sources referenced by Bony et al do not provide detailed evidence for the - 3.2 W / Km2 value for the uniform temperature response is simply false .
The Soden and Held paper can be downloaded here .
Table 1 provides feedback parameters including the " no- feedback " " Planck " response for 14 different coupled ocean - atmosphere models , and Table 2 provides similar numbers from the coupled model intercomparison project ( CMIP II ) .
The entire range of the numbers is from - 3.13 to - 3.28 W/ Km2 , with a mean of - 3.216 and standard deviation of 0.04 .
See also the discussion of this parameter , referred to as λ 0 , in the paper .
In other words , Monckton 's " κ " is well known from these calculations to within about 1 % , and there is no significant scientific question about what the value should be for Earth 's real atmosphere .
Monckton claims to quote a passage from Soden and Held ( 2006 ) which does not in fact exist in that article .
Wherever he got it from , it sounds like it was a calculation done to get a rough estimation of the forcing due to doubling of CO2 , and certainly not intended as a precise calculation of " κ " or the no-feedback response .
" Roughly 1 K " and " roughly 4 Wm - 2 " does not allow you to quote κ to 3 significant figures !
And to one significant figure , 0.25 is the same as 0.3 because the uncertainty in the numbers justifies no distinction between them ; Colman 's " rounding up " under similar circumstances is perfectly appropriate .
Kiehl ( 1992 ) gives the following method , where F C is total flux at Z C :
κ S = T S / ( 4F C ) ≈ 288 / ( 4 x 236 ) ≈ 0.305 KW - 1m2 . ( 23 ) Hartmann ( 1994 ) echoes Kiehl 's method , generalizing it to any level J of an n-level troposphere thus :
κ J = T J / ( 4F C ) [...]
≈ T J / 944 KW - 1m2 . ( 24 )
Confused : Neither of these ( 14 + years old now ) are intended as precise calculations of the no-feedbacks response .
They merely give a heuristic formulation for that sensitivity based on a re-writing of the derivative of the Stefan - Boltzmann law similar to Monckton 's equation 19 , but resolving the issue of the distinction between tropopause and surface ( or another layer ) in a different manner , under the assumption that the effect of greenhouse gases is essentially to give a uniform increase in surface temperature ( or temperature of another atmospheric layer ) proportional to the radiative forcing , relative to the no-greenhouse - gas case .
This is not strictly true , but note that the true effect consists of two components which this heuristic roughly captures - first , the increase in height of the tropopause ( mentioned by Monckton a few paragraphs before ) , and second the uniform increase in temperature under the assumption of no feedbacks .
These particular arguments are certainly not why the Bony et al paper or IPCC picked their number for Monckton 's " κ " , that number came from detailed calculations of the uniform temperature response .
The greatest value , chosen in IPCC ( 2007 ) , is 30 % above the least , chosen in IPCC ( 2001 ) .
Wrong : First , note that Monckton has ignored several even larger " largest values " that could be derived from similar textual archeology .
For example , in the definition of Monckton 's equation 5 , using the IPCC ( 2007 ) no-feedbacks response of 1.2-1.3 K and forcing of 3.7 Wm - 2 we get κ values of 0.324 to 0.351 !
Not to mention the 0.41 value we obtained above ( E69 ) using the actual temperature of the tropopause .
Second , the lowest number in his " table 2 " that actually appears in the literature regarding the real Earth ( as opposed to imaginary atmosphere - free planets ) is Hansen 's 0.29 from 1984 .
Both IPCC 2001 and IPCC 2007 agree that the number is close to 0.3 , and Bony 's number of 0.31 or so appears to be pretty definitive .
As noted above ( E72 ) , the range from actual largest to smallest value in model calculations is at most 1/3.13 to 1/3.28 , a total range of about 5 % with a standard deviation only a little over 1 % , nowhere near Monckton 's 30 % .
because the feedback factor f depends not only upon the feedback - sum b ≈ 2.16 Wm - 2 K - 1 but also upon κ , the 30 % increase in κ nearly doubles final climate sensitivity
Nonsense :
You would think that a doubling of climate sensitivity from the 2001 to the 2007 IPCC reports due to such a large change in the value of this " κ " would have been noticed before !
Clearly the climate models do n't care what Monckton 's " κ " is ...
In any case , since the actual range of possible values for κ is at most 5 % , and with the correct central value for b of 1.9 Wm - 2 K , one gets a range of sensitivity parameters λ for this range of κ values of 0.73 to 0.81 Km2/W , or about 11 % , not 100 % !
Table 2 - [...]
The range of values for κ in the IPCC 's assessment reports and in the papers which it cites is substantial .
The value of κ implicit in IPCC ( 2007 ) is some 30 % above that which is implicit in IPCC ( 2001 ) : consequently , the value of the climate - sensitivity parameter λ is almost doubled .
Invalid and Nonsense :
Of the nine " value of κ " entries in this table , only two are explicitly stated in the citations Monckton gives here : the 0.29 of Hansen ( 1984 ) and the 0.3 of Colman ( 2003 ) ; the largest two are given in terms of their inverses , while the lowest five values are from one or another of the misinterpretations Monckton himself has made as noted above ( E63 , E69 , E70 , E71 , E72 , etc. ) .
Monckton 's use of the word " implicit " indicates how divorced these numbers are from the actual assumptions of the cited works .
One example of this is Monckton 's use of Bony et al ( 2006 ) 's " atmosphere - free Earth " number ( 0.263 from Monckton 's inversion ) as if it was ever intended as a realistic estimate for Earth .
See the above notes on the other examples , and on the impact of the actual small variation in κ on climate sensitivity .
In reality , other than Hansen 's 0.29 from 1984 , all the cited works actually agree on a value for κ of roughly 0.30 to 0.32 , with the model calculations agreeing now with a standard deviation of only about 1 % .
Though it is usual to assume a constant temperature lapse - rate , and hence to use the value of κ that obtains at the characteristic - emission level , where inbound and outbound radiative fluxes balance by definition , the IPCC 's current value for κ assumes that the lapse - rate increases as temperature rises .
Also , the IPCC does not sufficiently allow for latitudinal asymmetry in distribution of the values of κ .
Wrong , Nonsense , and Inconsistent : IPCC , as Monckton has noted before , does not cite any " current value for κ " .
What he is talking about is Bony 's Planck response number , but Bony describes quite explicitly how that is calculated .
This is the bare response , it is under the assumption that the only response to forcing is a uniform increase in temperature throughout the atmosphere .
That means the lapse rate , the change in temperature with altitude , is unchanged when κ is calculated .
There is no assumption that lapse rate increases .
In any case , the lapse rate is expected to decrease ( causing the tropical mid-troposphere hot - spot discussed at length above - E53 ! ) under warming conditions due to higher water vapor concentrations , once the water vapor response is included .
But the water vapor feedback is obviously not included in the no-feedbacks response - lapse rate remains constant .
Monckton talks about a " value for κ " that " obtains " at the " characteristic emission level " , and " latitudinal asymmetry in distribution of the values for κ " , but again he defined κ explicitly via equation 5 as the ratio of the average surface temperature change , with no feedbacks , to the forcing at the tropopause .
This is a single number for the entire planet , not something that depends on either altitude or latitude .
Whatever he is talking about here , it is yet another " κ " that has no relation to the actual no - feedbacks climate sensitivity for our planet .
Bony 's κ ( stated as an inverse ) meets Monckton 's definition from equation 5 ; whatever he is talking about here clearly does not .
it is possible to calculate κ using Eqn. ( 6 ) , provided that the temperature change ΔT λ , radiative forcings ΔF 2x , and feedback - sum b over a given period are known .
Invalid and Wrong : First , Monckton is proposing to determine a value that cannot be observed but can be readily calculated ( κ ) by combining observations ( which he in any case asserts are wrong ) with two more values that cannot be observed : the radiative forcing ( which also can be readily calculated , though Monckton has just asserted again that the number is badly wrong ) , and the feedback sum , the value of which is very complex to determine theoretically given its dependence on clouds in particular .
This is hardly a prescription for finding an accurate value for the no-feedback response !
Second , Monckton refers to " a given period " , but the definitions associated with the temperature change ΔT λ in Monckton 's equation 6 are relevant to the equilibrium response .
The equilibrium response is the change in surface temperature after a very long period of time has passed to allow all the various responses to stabilize .
If you are looking at a shorter " given period " of time than the multiple century - scale needed for equilibrium , then the responses will naturally be different - generally smaller .
This is known as the transient response .
According to IPCC AR4 WG1 , the range for the transient sensitivity to doubling is expected to be 1 K and 3.5 K ( see section 9.6.2.3 ) , as opposed to the 2 K to 4.5 K sensitivity range at equilibrium .
This reduces the central value for the feedback sum b from 1.9 Wm - 2 K - 1 to about 1.3 Wm - 2 K - 1 for transient ( decadal - scale ) vs. equilibrium ( century - scale ) response .
Monckton acknowledges this assumption with a citation in the follow - on paragraph : " We assume that Chylek ( 2008 ) is right to find transient and equilibrium climate sensitivity near - identical " - but this citation is to one paper that , attributing much of the coldness of the most recent glacial maximum to aerosols ( dust ) , determined climate sensitivity to be on the very low end of the IPCC range .
This is hardly a review of
I do n't remember the exact day Colin ( not his real name ) became part of my life .
A fleetingly glimpsed neighbour I 'd sometimes nod to , I knew he was a long - distance truck driver and I think he knew who I was .
When our paths crossed , he would seldom meet my gaze .
I do n't even remember when I first heard his name .
A familiar voice uttered it , though : my wife 's .
It was n't by way of an introduction , although years later I did wonder how that might have gone .
" Honey , you 've seen that handsome man with the blond hair , broad shoulders and light tan who lives at number 18 ?
His name 's Colin . "
But no .
Rather more mundanely , she referred to him matter - of - factly in conversation .
" Colin took the remains of that old fence to the dump for me today , honey . "
Or , " Oh , by the way , Colin mended the lawn mower .
Then he mowed the lawn . "
Colin was indeed the helpful friend who lived down the road .
It is easier now to see that he was a more astute people - watcher than he seemed .
He must have known that my job often took me abroad , and he probably had me profiled as a workaholic , as insensitive to my wife 's needs as I was trusting of her fidelity .
By then we'd been married for some time and had two young children .
While I was away , my wife stayed at home taking care of the kids .
I thought we were happy but , in truth , I was too wrapped up in my job to know .
Life went on .
And secretly , day by day , it was written down : my wife was a meticulous diarist and spent 20 minutes every evening logging the day 's events .
One afternoon I walked into our bedroom and noticed she 'd left her diary on the bed .
This was unusual but , stranger still , it was open .
I went to put it in her bedside drawer , but as I closed the pages I caught sight of the word " Colin " .
My immediate impulse was to slam the diary shut and try to forget I 'd seen his name before it had a chance to sink in .
Instead , I started to read .
The entries stretched back months , detailing their covert liaisons - romantic , practical , but mostly sexual .
The descriptions ranged from the relatively tame ( " Kissed and cuddled today , it was lovely " ) to the kind of things you get in the racier passages of a Mills & Boon novel - nothing too graphic , but surprisingly comprehensive .
My jaw ached with panic and I felt the sudden flush of adrenaline .
Of course , I confronted her .
I wanted to yell at her , but my initial anger was quickly anaesthetised by shock .
I felt numb , confused .
With tears in her eyes , she said she had n't been happy for years and that Colin provided an escape .
At that moment , I did n't know what to say .
It was four or five hours before we could sit down and talk .
We discussed the usual options , including divorce , but decided to stay together for the sake of the children , make a fresh start .
Next day , she told Colin it was over .
We did n't see him for a couple of weeks after that - he'd been driving his lorry on the continent .
But Colin never did return .
The news that he had gone missing on a ship , presumed lost overboard , was broken to us by his next - door neighbour .
My wife 's first reaction was stunned disbelief , as was mine .
Then she turned away and covered her mouth , trying to stifle any sobs .
Thoughts and emotions more tangled than ever , I tried to comfort her .
Colin 's death was confirmed by the positive identification of a body washed up on the beach .
Some weeks later , my wife asked if we could drive to the crematorium so she could lay some flowers and say her final farewells .
It felt strange but , in the hope of her finding some kind of closure , I told myself it was the right thing to do .
Somehow , and completely irrationally , I felt involved in Colin 's death , as if a personal timeline had been derailed on my behalf and destiny rewritten to rescue a failing relationship .
Slowly we tried to put it behind us and his name was never mentioned again .
A few years later we had another child and our marriage entered a new , happier phase .
I vowed to be a more attentive husband and adjust my work - life balance .
But I could n't forget the affair , especially how close it had happened to home .
I should have trusted my instinct : 12 years later , my wife ran off with my best friend .

CIA director nominee Leon Panetta gave startling testimony in his confirmation hearings this week by retracting a statement critical of the Bush Administration ’s rendition policy and proclaiming that CIA employees will not be punished for any war crimes that they committed .
I discuss the testimony on this segment of Countdown .
Panetta made the statements before the Senate Intelligence committee and in an interview with AP .
He stated that
“ [ i[t was my opinion we just ca n’t operate if people feel even if they are following the legal opinions of the Justice Department . ”
While he did not address the prosecution of those who ordered the war crimes , he categorically dismissed the idea that you could be prosecuted for just following orders .
Of course , that is precisely the defense that we rejected after World War II and executed those who made the “ just following orders defense . ”
We do not apply the same standard to terrorism : we will prosecute the head of Al Qaeda or Libyan intelligence service in a terrorism case but not the individuals who carried out the orders .
Like other crimes , you are not allowed to commit torture and you are expected to refuse .
Some did refuse in this country and those who did not committed a war crime .
None of this means that low - level CIA employees were likely to be prosecuted or that they had no defense .
As I have said before , these employees can make an estoppel defense argument .
However , such defenses are made in the course of an investigation .
No reasonable leader should state that there is some irrebuttable presumption that an alleged torturer cannot be prosecuted if he was just following orders .
The harm done from such careless statements to international law is incalculable .
Moreover , by starting with such statements , you remove any leverage of investigations in seeking the cooperation of low - level individuals , who are less likely to cooperation if they know that they cannot or will not be prosecuted for their roles .
President Obama and now Panetta have created a new American rule that , so long as a lawyer tells you to commit a war crime , you are immune from prosecution .
Finally , there is the problem of a future CIA director making such an announcement .
While Panetta said he would “ leave to others ” the question of whether high - ranking officials might be prosecuted for war crimes , he could assure the committee that the actual torturers would be given immunity .
It is a dangerous and presumptuous claim for an agency head to make .
Even an attorney general nominee would be unwise to make such a categorical claim .
A CIA director has no part in the decision whether one of his people should be charged as a war criminal — a legal question .
On the renditions question , Panetta was equally baffling .
When pressed by Sen. Kit Bond ( R. , Mo. ) on his prior statement that there was a policy to rendition individuals for torture , Panetta conceded that he was “ not aware of the validity of those claims ” and retracted the statement .
Bond then publicly spanked him for “ making statements or making judgments based on rumors and news stories , ” saying that this was just rumors put out by “ liberal blogs ” and journalists .
However , it was not liberal blogs and journalists who put out these statements .
Various people involved in the case admitted that they routinely used rendition for this purpose and many such cases show precisely this pattern .
Panetta should have said that we can debate the meaning of an “ official policy . ”
However , where there is such a pattern and understanding , many would view it as a policy .
Policies are not formed like legislation or regulations with a record of committee reports or federal register events to mark its creation .
Many an administration routinely renditions individuals , who are tortured , there is ample reason to call it a de facto policy .

Remember my odd curiosity with taxidermy animals in museums ?
I know ... it's totally weird , but for some reason it intrigues me .
Please tell me I 'm not alone and morbid , and that you may be a little curious too ?
Now we can thank Richard Barns for feeding our inquisitive minds .
In the Animal Logic series Barns provides a behind the scenes look into the animal displays at a museum .
What fascinates me about these animals is how close you can see them , which would normally be impossible or deadly .
Even though I 'm curious about taxidermy and museums I hope these animals are n't purposely killed for display .
Anyone know the laws of taxidermy ?!
It would be interesting to work in a museum and help create wonderful displays , but for now we can pretend with these interesting photographs .

INVESTORS are told that the value of their shares may go down as well as up .
Rarely , however , do they plummet as far as they did in 2008 .
The total return of the S&P 500 index fell by nearly 40 % last year , the second - worst performance by America 's stockmarket since 1825 , according to calculations by Value Square , a Belgian asset - management firm .
Comparisons to the Depression are clear : only in 1931 and 1937 were there similarly abysmal losses .
The firm looked at various predecessors of the S&P 500 from 1923 onwards , and for earlier years took data from a working paper by Yale Management School on the returns of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange .
Since 1825 , 129 years saw rising returns , whereas 55 suffered falls — four of them in this century .

The February issue of Vanity Fair has an interesting article on the politicking associated with the Fannie / Freddie debacle .
Toward the end of the story ( p. 146 ) , the author , Bethany McLean , describes a late - stage episode in this tale that nicely exemplifies the concept of regime uncertainty .
I proposed the idea of regime uncertainty in a 1997 article about the extraordinary duration of the Great Depression .
I argued there that the Roosevelt administration ’s overt hostility toward investors as a class , especially after 1935 , created fears about the security of private property rights and , indeed , about whether the economy would continue to be based on such rights or , instead , would be subjected to some species of collectivist takeover or dictatorship .
The idea of regime uncertainty , however , may also be applied in many other contexts where the same kind of uncertainty tends to paralyze long - term investors , as it did in the latter half of the 1930s .
McLean relates how “ on July 13 , [ Treasury Secretary Henry ]
Paulson announced a plan under which Treasury would backstop all of the G.S.E. ’s debt and buy equity if needed .
‘ If you ’ve got a bazooka , and people know you ’ve got it , you may not have to take it out , ’ Paulson told lawmakers . ”
Paulson ’s plan was enacted into law shortly afterward .
But , as Robert Burns ’s poem warns us , “ The best laid schemes o’ mice an’ men / Gang aft a - gley . ”
Paulson ’s bazooka to help Fannie and Freddie failed .
. . .
Investors were unsure what their eventual losses would be .
Both companies announced terrible 2008 second - quarter results , with Fannie losing $ 2.3 billion and Freddie losing $ 821 million .
But investors were also unsure what the new legislation meant .
No one wanted to risk putting money into the G.S.E. ’s , only to have the government radically raise capital requirements — or step in and wipe the shareholders out .
And so , as if the second - quarter results had n’t caused enough alarm on their own , the legislation had the perverse effect of ensuring the companies would be unable to raise new capital , even as everyone began to say that they had to do so .
For the past six months or more , the entire U.S. economy has been subject to increasing regime uncertainty , as the government has adopted , almost daily , gigantic new schemes to subsidize , bail out , prop up , take over , recapitalize , guarantee , stimulate , or otherwise interfere with formerly private enterprises , markets , and other arrangements .
It seems likely that the recession ’s continued worsening may be attributed in substantial part to the regime uncertainty the government ’s frantic actions have created , and bid fair to continue creating .
When private parties need reassurance the most , the government continues only to roil the waters .

What a great American John McCain is .
Unquestionably , as President Clinton said earlier this week , he gave almost everything but his life for this country .
And a tremendous hero and a tremendous role model … a nd he was supposed to be on the show .
So at the last minute he calls up and says , “ Uh … I ca n’t make it . ”
And I said , “ What is the problem ? ”
And he said , “ Well , the economy .
The economy is about to crater . ”
And I do n’t know if you folks regularly get calls from United States senators , but I ’m telling you , you feel like you ’ve been deputized .
And so he says , “ I have to race back to Washington , D.C. … the nation ’s capital . ”
I said , “ I know that , Senator . ”
How dumb do I look ?
He says , “ I have to race back because the economy is about to crater . ”
And , of course , I said , right away , “ Whatever you need to do . ”
Am I gonna be the reason people are standing in bread lines ?
No .
“ Well , we ’d have saved it , but I had to go on Letterman ’s show … Everything would have been fine , but he would n’t let me out of the gig .
That ’s why it cratered .
It ’s Letterman ’s fault .
There he is .
Get him ! ”
So I do n’t need that .
So I ’m scared .
I ’m starting to tremble a little bit because he said , “ I ’ve got to race back to D.C. ”
And I thought , holy gosh . …
OK , everything ’s fine .
Do n’t worry about it .
The senator is on his way back to D.C.
So , not only did he not go back right away , he stopped by to see Katie Couric on his way out .
And then , OK , we looked at it and we said , “ OK , I understand that .
That ’s news and this is nonsense . ”
But then after Katie Couric , wham - o , right to the airport … no .
No. No .
We found out today that he did n’t really leave until this morning .
( Boos from the audience . )
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
So what we learned today is that the economy held on long enough –- just barely held on long enough for him to get back there .
Whereas , you can see , 24 hours ago , I felt like a patriot .
I felt like I was helping out .
I felt like I was doing my part .
Part of the cause .
Fighting the fight .
Not part of the problem , I was part of the solution .
I was going to help in my own little way get this economy out of the crater .
And now I ’m just feeling like an ugly date .
That ’s what I feel like .
I feel like an ugly date .
I feel used .
I feel cheap .
I feel sullied .
I feel cratered .
Earlier this past month , the final version of the Apple - backed OpenCL specification was delivered to standards group participants for vetting , and the final OpenCL 1.0 specification has now released .
Simultaneous with the final spec's release , NVIDIA announced full support for it in its GPU products .
Now we know why Apple has standardized on NVIDIA GPU hardware across its entire product line .
In a nutshell , OpenCL is a so - called " GPGPU " specification that enables programmers to tap the power of the GPU as a data - parallel coprocessor without having to learn to speak the specialized language of graphics , i.e. , OpenGL or a DirectX flavor .
NVIDIA had been pushing things in this direction for some time with C for CUDA , and Microsoft is also headed there with DirectX 11 Compute , so it was natural that Apple would move to ensure that its forthcoming " Snow Leopard " version of Mac OS X would sport comparable capabilities .
Apple and NVIDIA collaborated heavily on the development of OpenCL , but ( as its name implies ) the standard is open and has been vetted and put out under the auspices of the Khronos Group , a consortium of companies that have banded together to develop and promote royalty - free media APIs .
AMD has also promised OpenCL support on its hardware ; Intel is a Khronos Group member , so it will presumably support OpenCL with Larrabee , as well .
Many of the industries that stand to benefit the most dramatically from GPGPU have been extremely reluctant to invest a lot of development labor in a single vendor 's toolchain ( i.e. , NVIDIA 's C for CUDA , which has been the only real game in town ) .
OpenCL gives them an open , multivendor alternative to C for CUDA , although the two specs are n't quite interchangeable .
The following comparison of the two was taken from a slide in NVIDIA 's OpenCL presentation :
C for Cuda OpenCL C with parallel keywords Hardware API — similar to OpenGL C runtime that abstracts driver API Programmer has complete access to hardware device Memory managed by C runtime Memory managed by programmer Generates PTX Generates PTX
( Note : PTX is assembler for CUDA .
It 's the layer that sits closest to NVIDIA 's GPU hardware . )
The official spec launches today , and NVIDIA plans to have a beta of it running on its hardware by the first quarter of the coming year , with the final release arriving in the second quarter .
OpenCL memory model
I 'm going to speculate that we 'll see support for this on consoles before long , with the PlayStation 3 being the most obvious candidate ( since it 's powered by an NVIDIA GPU ) .
This will give game developers who want to go nuts rethinking the standard SGI render pipeline ( I'm thinking of Epic 's Tim Sweeney ) a cross-platform way to access GPU horsepower .
In connection with this , it 's also worth mentioning that OpenCL can take a regular CPU as a target , as one of the design goals listed on slide 13 the OpenCL slide deck ( PDF ) is to
Enable use of all computational resources in a system
Program GPUs , CPUs , Cell , DSP and other processors as peers
Support both data- and task - parallel compute models
Note also the support for " task - parallel compute models . "
Task - parallel compute models are n't exactly a good fit for a conventional GPU , but they are for Cell and Larrabee .
Quick note : Apple and OpenCL
I 've mentioned before that Apple has an internal " GPGPU " group that serves the company 's in - house app developers by giving them ways to use the GPU to boost performance .
Apple announced that an OpenCL implementation will be a major feature of Snow Leopard , so third - party developers will be able to get the same kinds of GPU - based speedups that internal Apple developers see .
This is good for developers , and it's also good for Apple , because having the Mac ecosystem 's collective eyes on the code means more improvements in the company 's implementation .

Disgraced Lehman Brothers CEO
Dick
Fuld is n’t the only embattled corporate bigwig to pass off a pricey house to his spouse – Chrysler CEO Robert Nardelli and ousted Merrill Lynch chief Stanley O’Neal did it , too , property records show .
Nardelli , head of Detroit ’s flailing No. 3 automaker , transferred a $ 3.8 million , four - bedroom , five - bath Los Angeles spread to his wife , Susan , on Jan. 17 , 2008 , according to deed records filed in Los Angeles County and recorded with the Assessor ’s Office on Feb. 5 , 2008 .
The record lists Robert Nardelli as the seller , but strangely identifies him as a married woman .
It lists Susan Nardelli as the buyer and describes the sale as an “ interfamily transfer and dissolution . ”
A spokeswoman for Nardelli early today insisted the records were incorrect and no transfer took place .
O’Neal – booted from Merrill in late 2007 with a $ 161 million golden parachute – deeded a $ 4.5 million Westchester manse to his wife , Nancy Garvey , that December , records show .
O’Neal also handed over a $ 20 million Park Avenue duplex to Garvey .
A source close to O’Neal has said the exec ’s property transfers are part of “ an estate - planning process drawn up years ago . ”
Tax lawyer Gary Botwinick told The Post , “ There are a couple scenarios in which you might transfer a deed to a spouse .
It ’s not uncommon to do it for estate planning or estate - tax purposes .
You also might – if you are concerned about potential legal action – move it for creditor protection purposes . ”
Fuld sparked outrage last month with news that he transferred his $ 13 million Florida waterfront mansion to his wife , Kathleen , for $ 100 .
They had been joint owners since 2004 .
The handoff by Fuld – who got $ 22 million in retirement compensation after running the bank into the ground – was seen by some as a pre-emptive move to protect his assets from potential creditors .
“ If the transfer is made before there ’s any potential [ legal ] claim , you ’re OK , ” Botwinick said .
“ If it ’s a subsequent transfer , you run the risk of it potentially being a fraudulent conveyance . ”
Fuld has been named in a suit in California .
O’Neal has been named in suits against Merrill .
Public records show the Nardelli family bought a 4,550 - square - foot Laurel Canyon home with his wife in 2007 – the year he resigned under shareholder pressure as CEO of Home Depot with a $ 210 million severance deal .
In 2007 and 2008 , Nardelli was named in suits filed by Home Depot shareholders and employees .
He and his wife still jointly own an $ 8.4 million Atlanta home , records show .
Property records reviewed by The Post also show that Fuld and his wife continue shared ownership of their $ 21 million Park Avenue apartment and a $ 9 million Greenwich , Conn. , home .
He also has 30 acres of Idaho property , worth at least $ 7 million , in a trust in his name , records show .
Lori McTavish , Nardelli ’s spokeswoman , said , “ The documents obtained by the New York Post reflect several inaccuracies .
Mr. Nardelli ’s name was never on the deed .
Therefore , a transfer of the property did not take place .
“ Any suggestion of impropriety is completely unfounded and inappropriate . ”

I love the discussion that this work has gotten , and I also love the poster itself .
I agree that although Obama may not be a descendant of slaves , he is still someone who would have been highly discriminated against in the ( not too distant ) past .
I agree with the calls for posters of women 's struggles and the Asian - American idea .
It would n't necessarily be so lengthy for an Asian - American poster - the most notable incidents of discrimination against Asian - Americans were 1 ) the fact that the Chinese were harshly discriminated against ( alongside the Irish ) during the construction of the railroads , and 2 ) internment of people of Japanese descent ( and the public mistreatment of anyone that looked like " a Jap , " including other Asian ethnicities ) .
Women 's issues would be even more lengthy than this poster , if we consider a world - wide view of the problem .
Technically female suppression has occurred since antiquity .
However , I hope that in the celebration of how far we 've come in our attempts in equality , we do n't go to the other extreme and treat the ones of the type " who discriminated against us in the past " as we have been treated .

Teamster , Local 399 Hollywood
New measures to bar tens of thousands of foreign workers from outside Europe coming to work in Britain as the recession bites deeper were outlined by the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , today .
The package includes possible moves to prevent the families of skilled migrants working in Britain and restricting skilled migrants to taking jobs only in occupations with shortages .
It represents a significant tightening of the new Australian - style points - based immigration system only four months after its introduction last November in the face of mounting " British jobs for British workers " protests and fears that the far - right British National Party , will win seats for the first time in June 's European elections .
The government has already banned the legal movement of unskilled economic migrants from outside Europe to Britain and the package outlined by the home secretary represents the first move to cut the number skilled migrants coming to work .
Smith signalled that raising the qualification levels for tier 1 – the most highly skilled migrant route – could cut the numbers from 26,000 to only 14,000 a year .
The new criteria will require a master 's rather than a bachelor 's degree and a job offer with a minimum salary of £ 20,000 rather than £ 17,000 .
Smith has also asked the government 's migration advisory committee to assess the economic case to restrict skilled workers under tier 2 to shortage occupations only .
This could cut the numbers from an estimated 80,000 to only 20,000 to 40,000 a year .
The migration advisory committee , chaired by LSE professor David Metcalf , has also been asked to assess the economic impact of banning the spouses and other dependants of foreign workers from taking jobs in Britain .
This move could also affect tens of thousands of people who come to work each year mainly from India , Pakistan and parts of Africa .
" These measures are not about narrow protectionism , " Smith said .
" Just as in a growth period we needed migrants to support growth , it is right in a downturn to be more selective about the skill levels of those migrants , and to do more to put British workers first . "
The home secretary said the action she was taking " to be more selective " combined with the economic circumstances .
As migration levels tend to fall during periods of recession she expected the number of migrants outside of Europe to fall during the next financial year .
The points - based immigration system does not cover the movement of workers from within the European Union to Britain but official immigration figures to be published on Tuesday are expected to confirm that the number of Poles and other eastern Europeans coming to work continues to fall , especially since the decline of the pound against the Euro .
Other measures outlined today / yesterday include :
• Employers must advertise tier 2 skilled jobs in JobCentres before they can bring in a worker from outside Europe .
• Migration advisory committee to assess economic contribution made by dependants of those who come under the points - based immigration system and their role in the labour market .
• Each shortage occupation declared by the committee to trigger a skills review of the British labour force and how they can be developed to meet the shortage .
Damian Green , the Conservatives ' immigration spokesman , said Smith was just " tinkering around the edges " of the system and said if she wanted to control migrant numbers she should introduce an annual limit .
CRAPSTONE , England —
When ordering things by telephone , Stewart Pearce tends to take a proactive approach to the inevitable question “ What is your address ? ”
He lays it out straight , so there is no room for unpleasant confusion .
“ I say , ‘ It ’s spelled “ crap , ” as in crap , ’ ” said Mr. Pearce , 61 , who has lived in Crapstone , a one - shop country village in Devon , for decades .
Disappointingly , Mr. Pearce has so far been unable to parlay such delicate encounters into material gain , as a neighbor once did .
“ Crapstone , ” the neighbor said forthrightly , Mr. Pearce related , whereupon the person on the other end of the telephone repeated it to his co-workers and burst out laughing .
“ They said , ‘ Oh , we thought it did n’t really exist , ’ ” Mr. Pearce said , “ and then they gave him a free something . ”
People in the “ public engagement ” community often talk about how scientists should do more to communicate with the media .
I take a different line : scientists have good grounds to be extremely nervous , and some entities and journalists could quite fairly be blacklisted .
Here ’s just one more example .
It does n’t stand out , I get sent plenty every week , and when I get a moment I ’ll find a way to archive the tips efficiently online : but I ’m posting this one here because the Telegraph have misrepresented a scientists work , refused to correct it when he writes to them , and then refused even to let him post an online comment on the article which misrepresented his own work .
This strikes me as harsh .
So , on the 1st of January the Telegraph ’s science correspondent wrote this piece : “ Greenhouse gases could have caused an ice age , claim scientists ” was the headline .
“ Scientists have warned ” that “ filling the atmosphere with Greenhouse gases associated with global warming could push the planet into a new ice age ” .
Wrong .
And I ’ve posted the whole article below , in case they quietly change it , because the entire story was bullshit from start to finish .
The work showed nothing of the sort .
The Telegraph did n’t speak to Prof Ian Fairchild ( they call him Dr ) , and their authoritative quote from him in the article was copied and pasted out of context .
Worse than that , Prof Fairchild has tried to post comments on the article which flatly misrepresents his own research , twice , but his comments have been rejected by the Telegraph ’s online comment moderators , while 23 other comments have appeared .
It ’s quite hard to understand both the intellectual and moral reasoning behind this kind of behaviour .
He also sent the following letter on Monday , which they have not deigned to print .
It is now Thursday and it has not appeared .
That means it will not .
Sir , Contrary to the headline about our scientific work that appeared last week on the Telegraph website , high levels of greenhouse gases did not trigger an ice age .
In our paper in Science we provided independent evidence for a theory that a hot atmosphere rich in greenhouse gases could coexist with a cold , glacial Earth surface .
A planet largely covered in ice and snow ( a Snowball Earth ) would allow carbon dioxide emitted from volcanoes to build up in the atmosphere over millions of years .
We show that this actually happened at a time in the Earth ’s history prior to the evolution of animals .
Perhaps it was the prolonged cold snap over Christmas that set the headline writer ’s mind racing , but the contemporary relevance of our work is rather different .
A Snowball Earth could be re-created , in spite of greenhouse warming .
For example , a nuclear war would generate a pall of dust , reflecting sunlight away from the Earth .
Also , a proposed technological fix to global warming – launching a mass of tiny sulphate aerosol particles in the atmosphere – could be overdone with the same result .
Barring these horrors , we are left with the physical reality of greenhouse warming , despite the vagaries of our wonderfully capricious British weather .
best wishes , Ian Ian J. Fairchild

To my mind this is poor quality journalism followed , more importantly , by cowardly editorial decision - making .
This article could very easily be retracted or corrected , clearly and unambiguously , in the newspaper .
I honestly do n’t understand why they would n’t do this .
People make mistakes .
What distinguishes you from the morons is what you do when the mistakes get pointed out .
A proper lay summary on the work is available here :
www.gees.bham.ac.uk/staff/fairchildresearchglacial.shtml
You can read the academic journal article on the work here :
www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/323/5910/119
The Press Association managed not to get the story wrong :
www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5gTxL07eoayqwyXcqkpQyShNb9cFw
Tim Lambert already spotted this :
scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2009/01/telegraph_takes_lead_from_aust.php
And finally here is the Telegraph piece :
Greenhouse gases could have caused an ice age , claim scientists Filling the atmosphere with Greenhouse gases associated with global warming could push the planet into a new ice age , scientists have warned .
By Richard Alleyne , Science Correspondent
Last Updated : 6:51 PM GMT 01 Jan 2009 Comments 23 | Comment on this article Researchers at the University of Birmingham found that 630 million years ago the earth had a warm atmosphere full of carbon dioxide but was completely covered with ice .
The scientists studied limestone rocks and found evidence that large amounts of greenhouse gas coincided with a prolonged period of freezing temperatures .
Such glaciation could happen again if global warming is not curbed , the university ’s school of geography , earth and environmental sciences warned .
While pollution in the air is thought to trap the sun ’s heat in the atmosphere , causing the planet to heat up , this new research suggests it could also have the opposite effect reflecting rays back into space .
This effect would be magnified by other forms of pollution in the earth ’s atmosphere such as particles of sulphate pumped into the air through industrial pollution or volcanic activity and could create ice age conditions once more , the scientists said .
Dr Ian Fairchild , lead investigator , said : “ We came up with an independent test of a theory that the earth , like a baked Alaska pudding , was once hot on the outside , surrounding a cold , icy surface .
“ It happened naturally in the past , but the wrong use of technology could make it happen again . ”
The limestones studied were collected in Svalbard in the Arctic Ocean , which is covered in ice and snow .
And lastly , if you are an academic , and you have been misrepresented in the media , it ’s not the first time , and it wo n’t be the last , so get in touch .
I am always very keen to hear from you .

Drug decriminalization , marijuana legalization , medical marijuana , and psychedelic reform initiatives have all already qualified for the ballot this year , and more still may .
Apple , Google , and Palm
M.G. Siegler has an intriguing report today regarding the lack of multi-touch support in the current Android OS :
Apple , which of course makes the signature multi- touch mobile device , the iPhone , apparently asked Google not to implement it , and Google agreed , an Android team member tells us .
Further , the Android team member went on to say that they were relieved that Google did n’t go against Apple ’s wishes , given the legal storm that appears to be brewing between Apple and Palm , which is using multi - touch technology in its new Pre phone .
Even if Apple ultimately decides not to pursue legal action against Palm ( it ’s not yet clear how likely that is , but Apple does have an impressive array of patents ) , the situation has likely soured the relationship between the two companies .
Google , it seems , wants no part in ruining its relationship with Apple .
This jibes with a story I heard several months ago from a source who works at Apple , which is that Google showed Apple legal a pre-release prototype of the HTC G1 , specifically to avoid patent - related disputes .
According to my source , in addition to multi-touch , the other feature that Apple objected to was using a standard headphone jack .
Apple apparently owns a patent on controlling software using buttons connected by a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack ( at least for music and video playback controls ) , and would not grant Google a license to the patent .
Hence the G1’s use of a proprietary ExtUSB port rather than a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack .
My source ’s information was third - hand , and I found the idea that Google would show Apple the G1 before it was released a little hard to believe , so I did n’t publish it .
( You know there ’s no way that Apple is showing pre-release iPhone hardware or software to Google — so why would Google do this ? )
But now Siegler has an “ Android team member ” telling a similar story .
Siegler adds :
While the connection between Apple and Palm would seem like it should be strong , given how many former Apple employees now work at Palm , Google and Apple are actually more aligned .
Not only does Google specially tailor a ton of its products for the iPhone ( both with apps like Maps and Google Search , and specially formatted webpages ) , but its chief executive , Eric Schmidt , is on Apple ’s board of directors .
And do n’t underestimate the fact that both share a chief rival : Microsoft .
Google and Apple do have a sort of kinship .
They compete very little overall —
Apple makes money by selling computing hardware products ;
Google makes money through search advertising .
Android -vs. -iPhone OS is the biggest exception , and Schmidt has stated that he recuses himself from iPhone - related matters in Apple board meetings .
But Google did not write the iPhone ’s built - in Maps or YouTube apps ; Apple did .
Google and Apple collaborated to some degree on how these apps talk to Google ’s back - end , but the iPhone apps themselves were designed and written by Apple .
Google ’s own iPhone apps , like the Google Search app , have a decidedly Google - ish aesthetic .
Unlike Siegler , I think the large number of recent Apple employees now working at Palm on the Pre suggests that the relationship between the two companies is cold — ice cold .
What I heard last month at Macworld Expo is that Palm has a standing offer for engineers at Apple to jump ship , with a starting salary of 1.5 times their current Apple salary .
More obviously , Palm ’s core business — selling handheld computing hardware — is directly competitive to one of Apple ’s core businesses .
I would n’t hold my breath waiting for Palm CEO Ed Colligan or former Apple senior VP Jon Rubinstein to get a seat on Apple ’s board .
Who Will Tell the People ?
It Is n’t Cholesterol !
by Bill Sardi by Bill Sardi

Doctors are breaking ranks to tell a story to the world .
You may stand in disbelief as you read it here .
The sudden disclosure by a Harvard Medical School doctor in the British journal Lancet ( Jan 20 , 2007 ) , that cholesterol - lowering drugs are of no benefit for three - quarters of the people who take them , has been followed by an even more stunning revelation in the New York Times where Dr. Arthur Agatston MD , a Florida cardiologist who is better known as the author of a diet book ( The South Beach Diet ) , stated that " my patients do n’t have heart attacks any more . "
Dr. Agatston is not known as the cholesterol - lowering doctor , he is better known professionally for having developed the severity scoring sheet for calcification of the arteries , now known as the Agatston score .
[ New York Times , Jan. 24 , 2007 ]
The skeptics of the cholesterol theory of heart disease are growing and Dr. Malcolm Kendrick of Aberdeen , Scotland , has just published a book , The Great Cholesterol Con , wherein he calls the cholesterol theory " an amazing beast " and cites an investigation conducted by the US Surgeon General ’s Office in 1988 that was launched to quiet the cholesterol nay - sayers .
Dr. Kendrick says that investigation was cancelled 11 years later for lack of evidence .
[ Daily Mail UK , Jan 23 , 2007 ]
According to Dr. John Abramson , of Harvard Medical School , in his article titled “ Are Lipid- Lowering Guidelines Evidence - Based ? ” in Lancet , no studies have shown statin cholesterol - lowering drugs to be effective for women at any age , nor for men 69 years of age or older , who do not already have heart disease or diabetes .
Better than 50 adults have to take a cholesterol - lowering drug for 1 patient to avoid a mortal heart attack , and that figure only applies to high - risk patients .
There is a vanishing benefit to lowering cholesterol for healthy adults .
Dr. Abramson calls for cholesterol treatment guidelines to be revised .
[ Lancet 2007 ; 369:168-169 ]
What to tell patients ?
Dr. James M Wright of the University of British Columbia , Vancouver , co-author with Dr. Abramson , thinks physicians should be honest with their patients about the lack of evidence for the use of cholesterol - lowering drugs in low - risk patients .
Says Dr. Wright : " If you take a male who is 50 years old , a smoker , with high blood pressure , who eats the worst diet in the world . . . then if I were an honest physician , I would tell him that maybe he should be taking a statin .
And if he asked how much would that reduce his risk , I would have to tell him that it would only reduce his risk by 2 % over the next five years .
If he understood that information , he would say , You ’re expecting me to take a pill everyday for five years ?
And it ’s going to cost me two dollars a day ?
You ’re crazy !
I ’m not going to do it . ”
If physicians were truly honest with their patients , the doctor says , “ I think there probably would be very few people being treated for primary prevention with a statin drug . ”
[ HeartWire Jan. 27 , 2007 ]
The cholesterol theory of cardiovascular disease is far from explaining what causes most heart attacks and strokes .
Some 500,000
Americans die of a sudden - death heart attack annually with low - to - normal cholesterol .
Dr. Harumi Okuyama of Nagoya City University in Japan , writing in the World Review of Nutrition and Dietetics , says the direction of modern medicine needs to move away from the cholesterol hypothesis of coronary heart disease .
Once cases of genetic / familial high cholesterol are removed from population statistics , he claims that high cholesterol is not found to be a causal factor for coronary heart disease .
High total cholesterol is not positively associated with high coronary heart disease mortality rates among general populations more than 40 — 50 years of age , says Dr. Okuyama .
Okuyama points out that higher total cholesterol levels are associated with lower cancer and all - cause mortality rates where the incidence of familial high cholesterol is low ( ~0.2 % ) .
He notes that the rate of heart attacks differs by approximately 4 to 8 - fold at the same total cholesterol level in some populations .
Dr. Okuyama says while Western countries have accepted the cholesterol theory of heart disease and the use of statin drugs , " little benefit seems to result from efforts to limit dietary cholesterol intake or to total cholesterol values to less than approximately 260 mg / dL . "
Dr. Okuyama says there is an urgency to change the direction of current medical practice away from cholesterol - controlling medications .
[ World Review Nutrition Dietetics , Basel , Karger , 96 : 1— 17 , 2007 ]
Is it calcium ?
It was cardiologist Dr. Stephen Seely who in wrote , in his treatise entitled " Is calcium excess in western diet a major cause of arterial disease ?
published in the International Journal of Cardiology in 1991 , that excess calcium intake is a major cause of atherosclerosis in Western countries .
He contended that young adults need only 300— 400 mg of calcium daily , and older adults need even less .
In countries where the daily calcium intake is 200— 400 mg , arterial diseases are non-existent and blood pressure does not increase with age .
Dr. Seely said , in countries where the daily calcium intake is 800 milligrams ( USA , New Zealand , Scandinavian countries , Ireland ) , arterial disease is the leading cause of mortality .
Dr. Seely pointed out that cholesterol only represents 3 % of arterial plaque , while calcium makes up 50 % .
[ International Journal Cardiology 1991 Nov ; 33 ( 2):191—8 ]
Do n’t think the American Heart Association ( AHA ) is n’t paying attention .
After six years of debate , the AHA has finally approved CT scanning for arterial calcifications for high - risk individuals .
Just a few years ago the AHA dismissed the use of CT scanning for any reason , so this is a big change .
The accumulation of calcium plaque in coronary arteries continues despite aggressive cholesterol reduction ( — 53 % LDL cholesterol ) with a statin drug .
[ Heart 2006 ; 92:1207 — 1212 ]
Dr. Stephen Seely recommended the best remedy for this problem would be prevention , by reducing calcium consumption only to the level needed by the body .
“ This could be achieved only by drastic cuts in consumption of milk .
Failing that , we could utilize nature ’s own calcium antagonist , IP6 phytate ( rice bran extract ) , ” he said .
The author argues that currently available calcium antagonist drugs are less desirable .
IP6 phytate is available as a dietary supplement , extracted from rice bran by Tsuno Foods & Rice Co. in Wakayama , Japan , and sold under various brand names ( Source Naturals , Jarrow Formulas , Purity Products ) .

Prevalence of Coronary Artery Calcification by age and sex Coronary Artery Calcification Begins Earlier in Males With Onset of Menopause , Women Lose Calcium From Bones and Increase Their Risk For Cardiovascular Disease by 360 %
Other natural antidotes to arterial calcifications include vitamin K , vitamin D and magnesium .
Groups who consume the highest amounts of vitamin K from dietary sources exhibit more than a 50 % reduction in coronary heart disease mortality and aortic calcium scores .
[ Journal Nutrition 134 : 3100 — 05 , 2004 ] Vitamin K is naturally rich in spinach , broccoli and turnip greens .
Vitamin D has also been shown to be correlated with the absence of extensive arterial calcification .
[ Circulation 96 : 1755 — 60 , 1997 ]
But the public is going to have to overcome mistaken advice usually offered by health professionals about vitamin D .
Most physicians , pharmacists and dieticians will warn the public away from so - called high - dose vitamin D supplements because of the false notion that vitamin D actually induces calcifications .
But this effect has only been demonstrated in animals at lethal doses ( ~2.1 million units of vitamin D ) .
[ Current Opinion Lipidology 18( 1) :41 — 6 , 2007 ]
Dr. Reinhold Vieth , PhD , at the University of Toronto , says the toxicity of vitamin D does n’t begin till 40,000 units are consumed .
[ American Journal Clinical Nutrition 1999 May ; 69(5 ) :842—56 ]
Dr. Vieth notes that an hour of total - body skin exposure to unfiltered sunlight in the summer at a southern latitude would produced about 10,000 units of vitamin D without any known side effects .
He says the risk for toxicity is remote .
Vitamin D is a vitamin / hormone produced in the skin upon sun exposure .
It is widely known that more heart attacks occur in winter months when vitamin D levels are low .
Dr. Joe Prendergast , a practicing endocrinologist in Redwood City , California , now treats his patients with 5000 units vitamin D and a blood - vessel widening amino acid ( arginine ) to successfully reverse hardening of the arteries .
Vitamin D’s anti-calcifying effects are working for this doctor ’s patients .
Magnesium is a natural calcium blocker and is another natural antidote to arterial calcification .
[ The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2004 Oct ; 23(5) :501S — 505S ]
Magnesium is rich in foods like almonds , spinach and pumpkin seeds .
Magnesium oxide in dietary supplements is poorly absorbed and other forms ( citrate , glycinate , malate ) should be consumed .
The most convincing evidence
The most convincing evidence for the calcium theory of heart disease is this .
In a study of adults over age 55 years , coronary artery calcifications were ranked by the Agatston scoring method .
Blood pressure , cholesterol , smoking and blood sugar , all common risk factors for cardiovascular disease were measured over a 7 - year period along with the calcium artery scores .
Disturbingly , 29 % of the men and 15 % of the women who had no cardiovascular symptoms and exhibited no other common risk factors ( elevated cholesterol , hypertension , etc. ) , had extensive coronary artery calcification .
[ European Heart Journal 25 : 48—55 , 2004 ]
This is alarming .
These patients had a low - to - normal cholesterol number and mistakenly thought they were at low risk for a heart attack
An angiogram ( an x - ray / dye photo of coronary arteries ) , commonly used by cardiologists , cannot detect calcifications .
Ultrafast computed tomography ( CT scanning ) and intravascular ultrasound can measure arterial calcification .
Better than 90 % of patients who experience a heart attack have coronary artery calcifications .
It ’s a tradition as stale as the beer in the town ’s lowliest tavern :
“ You ’re at the inn .
Suddenly an old guy walks up and offers you a job . ”
Or , “ You ’re at the inn .
Suddenly a bunch of orcs rush in and start busting up the place . ”
Or , “ You ’re at the inn .
A drunk guy bumps into you , and you realize your coin purse is lighter . ”
Now , there ’s nothing inherently wrong with starting your adventure at the inn .
But sometimes you just need a change of pace to keep your players on their toes .
If you ’re running low on inspiration , you ’re in luck !
Here are 10 unconventional ways to set your game in motion .
# 1 – The Worst Hangover Ever
The PCs awaken to find themselves seated around an opulent table full of exotic foods and wines .
The food is beginning to mold , and insects have gathered .
Nobody can recall what they ’ve done in the past few days , and nobody knows where they are or who hosted the dinner .
But there is the small matter of a well - dressed corpse with a dagger between its shoulder blades .
And is that the sound of guards coming …?
# 2 – Escape from the Gallows
One of the PCs has been wrongly convicted of a heinous crime .
Their sentence is death by hanging .
The objective is to rescue them before the hangman ’s work is done .
This should provide a great opportunity for swashbuckling adventure , ala Pirates of the Caribbean .
How will the party pull off the rescue , and how will they prove their friend ’s innocence while living on the run ?
# 3 – Kidnapped !
The party members find themselves in a wagon , traveling over rough terrain .
Their vision is obscured by black hoods , and their hands are bound behind their backs .
They could be on their way to an audience with a powerful and super - secretive personality , or they could be on their way to certain death .
Will they escape their bonds , or stay the course and see where fate leads them ?
As a twist , you could have the PCs awaken in a sealed room and struggle to find their way out .
Picture by Picture by August Rush
# 4 – Murder at the Masquerade
The PCs are guests at a masquerade ball .
Everyone who ’s anyone has been invited .
Have the PCs choose their costumes and enjoy a fun evening of drinking , dancing , and maybe a tryst or two .
At midnight , a servant runs screaming into the room .
The host has been slain .
She was last seen strolling toward her private garden with someone in costume – the exact same costume that one of the PCs is wearing .
Watch them scramble to come up with an alibi .
# 5 – The Message
The party is hailed by a small child holding a bound scroll .
The seal looks familiar .
In fact , it appears to be from someone very important .
Just as the child draws near , a cloaked figure knocks him aside and snatches the missive .
Watch the party frantically chase the thief through the city streets , and witness an urban landscape ( with all its crowds , hazards , and hiding places ) in its full glory .
Picture by Picture by Alex Rouvin
# 6 – Disaster Strikes
Ever wanted to end the world ?
The PCs will certainly feel like their world is ending when a disaster ( magical , natural , or war - driven ) strikes their base city .
There will be droves of deaths , massive destruction , and possibly flaming , falling debris .
Survival is the goal of this harsh opening scenario .
# 7 – The Prophecy
The party is ambushed by a band of assassins .
They manage to capture one and interrogate him .
It turns out that the killers were hired to slay one of the PCs in order to prevent a terrible prophecy from being fulfilled .
The PC and his pals will have starring roles in what might turn out to be a series of world - shaking events .
# 8 – The Chase is On
You know how some action flicks start with a car chase ?
You can do the same thing in D&D .
Open the game with the PCs on horseback , ducking and dodging their way through a thick forest while their enemies give chase .
If riding at breakneck speeds through hostile terrain is n’t exciting enough , you could always throw in the obligatory cliff .
# 9 – Rude Interruption
The PCs have come to pay their last respects to a fallen hero of legend .
Hundreds have gathered for the public funeral service .
It ’s a touching scene until something goes horribly wrong .
This untoward event could be an invasion , a disastrous wizard duel , or the dead hero rising as an undead monstrosity .
Your choices are only limited by your imagination .
# 10 – Dreams and Visions
Dreams and visions can be used in many ways .
In this case , they can be used to kick off your campaign in style .
Give your PCs a dream so real it hurts – literally .
Maybe they get wounded in the dream , only to wake up and find very real marks on their bodies .
Or give them a premonition of future events so vivid that the PCs believe they ’re actually living through those events right now .
Have you ever kicked off a campaign in an unorthodox way ?

, 4.1 out of 5 based on 14 ratings
John Harrington came upon an obvious case of copyright infringement by the Gizmodo blog last week .
The gadget site , owned by Gawker Media , had created a photo illustration that incorporated one of photographer Jill Greenberg ’s famous crying baby images without her permission .
But more interesting than the infringement — which , frankly , is the rule rather than the exception on blogs today — were the reactions John received in comments .
First , Robert Green , Jill ’s husband , reported with some level of satisfaction that Gizmodo had removed the photo when the infringement was pointed out : “ to gizmodo / gawker ’s credit , they immediately took the image down when they were asked to without a second ’s hesitation . ”
Commenter Ian Evans then took exception with Robert ’s response , which he apparently viewed as tepid :
Okay , let ’s rewrite that sentence in a different context : ‘ to the car thief ’s credit , he immediately returned my vehicle to me without a second ’s hesitation . ’
The crime was still committed .
The exchange seemed to me a succinct summation of the ongoing debate among photographers on the subject of copyright and the Web .
Should photographers be satisfied when Web sites remove copyrighted work upon request — which has become more or less standard practice — or should they fight harder to prevent their images from appearing in unauthorized uses — such as taking infringers to court as a deterrent ?
Car Theft vs. Speeding
I certainly understand the logic of the car thief analogy .
But when half the drivers on the road are “ car thieves , ” does the term retain its meaning ?
If the majority of bloggers — and blog readers — do n’t believe these blogs have “ stolen a car ” when they lift a picture from Google Images , is n’t the battle already lost ?
Maybe a better analogy , at least in terms of public sentiment , would be to compare unauthorized photo use with a lesser offense , like speeding .
People know they should n’t speed , but they do it anyway ; it gets them somewhere faster , in the same way that yanking a picture off Google gets their blog post finished faster than trying to find an appropriate image on iStockPhoto or Flickr .
In the mind of the blogger , it ’s rarely about stealing — after all , you ’re only saving a buck or two by not using microstock — it ’s about “ speeding . ”
When people are caught speeding , they expect to pay a fine of some kind — something not too crazy , but enough to make them think twice ( or at least look twice ) before doing it again .
I ’m wondering if photographers who liken infringers to car thieves and want them “ sent to jail , ” as another of John ’s commenters wrote , would be better off staking out more moderate — and obtainable — objectives ?
An Arms Race with Technology
To see what photographers are up against , just look at what happened in federal court last week .
The video - sharing site Veoh slapped down Universal Music Group ’s copyright infringement claims , with the judge stating that Veoh was fine as long as it “ expeditiously remove[ d ] or disable [ d ] access to [ infringing ] material . ”
Sounds a lot like what Gizmodo did , does n’t it ?
Granted , video - and photo - sharing sites are one step removed from the actual infringement — so they do n’t have “ actual knowledge ” of it — but to the layperson that ’s a minor distinction .
And then there is the larger issue : even if the courts were siding with photographers at every turn , would this battle be any more winnable in the end ?
Jacob Andreas frames the issue this way :
This arms race between technology and copyright protection … has been a continued feature of the American copyright debate ; what is new is that technology has effectively reached the point where users may make an infinite number of copies at no cost .
Every Google search , every website visited and every email forwarded creates copies ; all computer technology relies on the fact that every day billions , perhaps tens of billions of copyright infringements go unprosecuted …
We can never design a copyright for the Internet age , because is not just impractical , but impossible , to prevent the copying of digital information .
What ’s Worked — and What Hasn’t
We ’ve seen different segments of the media take polar - opposite approaches to this issue — with less than stellar results .
The newspaper industry has done virtually nothing to prevent its copyrighted content from appearing on blogs — and of course , we see how well that ’s worked out for them .
But at the other end of the spectrum , has the RIAA really done itself any favors with its draconian approach ?
Perhaps what we should really be focusing on is finding a place in the middle .
YouTube ’s approach , for example , is an interesting one .
The other day I got an e-mail telling me that one of my YouTube videos contained copyrighted music , and that because I had infringed on the copyright , they were going to add advertising to the video — the proceeds of which , I presume , would go to the copyright holder .
Fortunately , I was given the opportunity to protest the decision , and I did — sending back proof that I had actually purchased the music from a stock site .
But if I had n’t , I would ’ve been OK with YouTube adding the advertising — a low - hassle solution for all involved .
Kind of like getting a speeding ticket .
TO SOME there is nothing so urgent that it cannot be postponed in favour of a cup of tea .
Such procrastination is a mystery to psychologists , who wonder why people would sabotage themselves in this way .
A team of researchers led by Sean McCrea of the University of Konstanz , in Germany , reckon they have found a piece of the puzzle .
People act in a timely way when given concrete tasks but dawdle when they view them in abstract terms .
Dr McCrea and his colleagues conducted three separate studies .
First they recruited 34 students who were offered € 2.50 ( $ 3.30 ) for completing a questionnaire within the subsequent three weeks .
Half of the students were then sent an email asking them to write a couple of sentences on how they might go about various activities , such as opening a bank account or keeping a diary .
The others were asked to write about why someone might want to open a bank account or keep a diary .
For their second study , Dr McCrea and his colleagues recruited 50 students , who were offered the same sums and timespans as the first lot .
Half of these students were asked to provide examples of members of a group , for example , naming any type of bird .
The task was inverted for the other students , who were asked to name a category to which birds belong .
Finally the researchers asked 51 students , who were again offered cash and given a deadline , to examine a copy of “ La Parade ” by Georges Seurat , a 19th - century French artist .
Half were given information about pointillism , the technique Seurat used to create the impression of solid colours from small dots of paint .
The others were told that the painting was an example of neo-impressionism in which the artist had used colour to evoke harmony and emotion .
Both groups were then asked to rate the importance of colour in 13 other works of art .
As the team report in Psychological Science , in all three studies , those who were presented with concrete tasks and information responded more promptly than did those who were asked to think in an abstract way .
Moreover , almost all the students who had been prompted to think in concrete terms completed their tasks by the deadline while up to 56 % of students asked to think in abstract terms failed to respond at all .
Theories abound for why people procrastinate .
Some psychologists think that those who delay completing tasks do so because they have low confidence that they will succeed in that task .
Perhaps procrastinators are perfectionists or they may just be depressed .
Others believe they are impulsive and lack self - control .
Earlier research has shown that people defer tasks that are unappealing , difficult or expensive , which is no great surprise .
Dr McCrea and his colleagues , however , are the first to show that the way in which a task is presented also influences when it gets done .
Those seeking to cajole a colleague , friend or spouse into action might ponder the finding , though perhaps not for too long .
It might be better to offer a procrastinator a concrete choice — Lapsang Souchong or Darjeeling ?— rather than asking him just what sort of a person it is who would drink tea when time is of the essence .
“ FAST 31 , Whiteman Tower , Cleared for take off Runway 19 .
REAPR 21 is 10 miles initial for Runway 19 . ”
And so the adventure of a lifetime began .
Four months ago , while on a ten hour KC - 135 flight from Chile to Texas , I asked a crazy question : “ Hey Candy , what would it take to get me in the backseat of a T - 38 and chase the B - 2 ? ” Paperwork , Persistence , Patience , and the hard work of dozens of people .
With the strong support of the Whiteman AFB leadership and the dedication and foresight of the Public Affairs office , a lifelong dream of mine was fulfilled today .
I got to fly in a United States Air Force T - 38 Jet .
And if that was n’t cool enough , I got to “ chase ” a B - 2 Stealth Bomber .
Many of you have been following my adventures over these past couple of days as I prepared for my T - 38 Ride .
Egress / Parachute training , life support fitting of my flight suit , helmet , regulator , G - suit , and the Flight Doctor approvals .
And today it all culminated for one of the coolest photo shoots of my career .
My day started early at 8 am .
I met with Lt. Miller from Public Affairs , a superior photographer in his own right , and had a nice , light breakfast .
I was quite nervous as this was my first ever ride in a fast jet .
How does one deal with the exposure , what lenses & bodies to bring , how do I deal with canopy reflections , where to store all the unused equipment , spare compact flash cards and batteries .
What formations were we going to do , how were we going to position the aircraft so that we get the most dynamic shots , safe altitudes , and light angles .
Miller and I went to the 394th CTS ( Combat Training Squadron ) and met up with my T - 38 pilot Capt Luke “ Deuce ” Jayne , and Capt Nichoas “ Willy ” Adcock and Maj Jared “ Evel ” Kennish ; the B - 2 Spirit pilots .
They were flying the Spirit of Ohio this afternoon for my photo shoot before heading out on a 4 training mission .
The briefing part of our mission is like any other mission the men and women of the 509th Bomb Wing fly .
Planning and Preparation is the key to success .
And working with these professionals , I know I was going to get some awesome shots .
So as we accelerated down the runway , Deuce yanked the plane to the left and we began our rendezvous with the REAPR 21 .
150 feet off the B - 2’s 8 o’clock , the gear of the B - 2 lowered and the photo shoot had begun .
Just an hour earlier , I was sitting in the ready room of the 394th CTS with Deuce going over the final checklists for our flight .
Emergency procedures , discrete frequencies , weather , airspace restrictions , etc .
This was now feeling very real !
At $ 15,000 an hour to have the B - 2 Stealth Bomber in the air , there was little room for error .
And as the Col. had mentioned earlier in the week , “ No Pressure . ” 🙂
But with all of the training , preparations , and briefings , this shoot went off without a hitch .
And even more important then those aforementioned items , were the pilots : Deuce , Willy and Evel .
Without their help , none of these shots would have been possible .
Those pilots placed their planes exactly where I needed it to be : 360 degree turns , straight and level , echelon turns , and rolling over and aft of the B - 2 .
These were just some of the shots that we briefed for our hour flight .
And after our shoot was done , it was time to enter the MOA and get an orientation flight in the T - 38 with Deuce at the controls .
Loops , rolls , and being weightless were just some of the maneuvers that we did .
It was so cool !
I ’ve been in many planes , but when you are doing Mach 0.98 , you ca n’t help but smile .
And before I knew it , it was time to return to base .
2 touch and goes in the right hand pattern and then it was “ FAST 31 , Whiteman Tower , Check wheels down , cleared to land Runway 19 . ”
Floating to the ground was like landing on silk .
Slow down , exit on Charlie and taxi back to the ramp . ”
It was simply amazing .
A rare occasion ; and the first person in 5 years to fly chase with the B - 2 .
Just like that it was all over and it ’s time to head back to Life Support .
Gear back and stowed , it was time for a beer .
But this adventure is far from over .
Stay tuned for my final day at Whiteman AFB tomorrow .
This spring , after Bulgaria recalled Meglena Plugchieva from her ambassadorship in Berlin to clean up widespread corruption and misuse of European Union funds , she warned fellow ministers they must act to prevent the loss of massive funding from Brussels .
But Ms. Plugchieva also vowed to stand up to Western criticism that singles out her nation 's ills .
" Bulgaria is not the cradle of corruption , " she said .
" Germany also has its corruption - related scandals . "
The " double standard " defense , though , was n't enough to deter a stinging financial slap delivered last month by a European Commission angry after millions of euros in development assistance had been siphoned off and a string of high - profile corruption and murder investigations resulted in no convictions .
Bulgaria 's case was putting the credibility of EU enlargement at stake : Brussels needed to send a message to those arguing against further expansion and to candidates banging on the door , including Croatia , Serbia , Albania , and Turkey .
Just last month , EU officials warned Croatia that its failure to crack down on organized crime and corruption jeopardizes its chance to join the EU next year .
" Brussels needed to get serious , to show they 're not just taking a country 's word for fighting corruption , " says Katinka Barysch , deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London .
" If they can't do that with Bulgaria , how are you going to do that with the countries still queuing outside ? "
In late November , Brussels slapped Sofia with an unprecedented penalty , withdrawing € 220 million ( $ 315 million ) in development assistance – less than the initial threat of €500 million , but still a huge sum for the poorest EU member .
" This is not the most pleasant day of my life , " said EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn , announcing the verdict .
" As they say , the man 's gotta do what the man 's gotta do . "
From the start , the accession of both Bulgaria and Romania to the EU raised eyebrows .
During the postcommunist transition of the early 1990s , the Central European states of Poland , Hungary , and the Czech Republic swallowed bitter pills of democratic , free - market reforms .
Romania and Bulgaria , meanwhile , started at a lower level of development and reforms were slowed by foot dragging , experts say .
As the economy worsened here , so , too , did corruption , says John Heck , who runs an EU - funded , anticorruption project in Sofia .
The problems are ingrained deeply into modern Bulgarian society , he says , " Integrity – if you look in the Bulgarian dictionary , you wo n't find the term . "
Although critics argued that Romania and Bulgaria would be allowed into the EU too soon , strategic benefits won out .
Many Bulgarians were also eager to join , so Brussels dangled a carrot and stick to pressure authorities into complying with EU laws and standards .
Still , enforcement lagged and corruption continued .
When Bulgaria and Romania were finally admitted to the EU in January 2007 , they became the first to enter with strings attached :
They were given several months to clean up their legal systems and to develop methods of tracking EU funding .
Promises were made , but deadlines were missed , prompting a growing litany of threats from Brussels .
Romania soon launched several high - profile public prosecutions against corruption , but Bulgarian efforts struck EU officials as disingenuous , says Irina Novakova , Brussels correspondent for Bulgaria 's leading newspaper , Dnevnik .
The EU officials " see other new members react quickly to criticism , yet in Bulgaria a political umbrella prevents prosecutions , " says Ms. Novakova .
" Officials complain ' the Bulgarians come to Brussels , tell us to our face they 'll solve things .
But it always continues , like they think they can get away with anything . ' "
In July , the EU antifraud office shamed Sofia when , for the first time ever , it revoked accreditation of two government agencies entrusted to handle EU funds .
Also in July , a European Commission report accused Bulgaria of failing to " translate words into deeds . "
The report noted modest progress in judicial reform and the curbing of low - level corruption , but it went on to identify a smorgasbord of sleaze , including alleged vote - buying during 2007 elections , shady financing of political parties , money laundering , and the failure to seize financial assets of purported gangsters .
The final straw was an investigation of 35 EU - funded projects in Bulgaria – it found financial irregularities in all but one .
Brussels then announced it would freeze € 500 million ( $ 700 million ) in aid and give Sofia until late November to show significant strides .
Enter Meglena Plugchieva , whom one local newspaper dubbed " Iron Meggy . "
After 15 years as a forestry inspector , followed by stints as a parliamentarian and deputy minister of agriculture , Plugchieva earned respect in Western circles as Bulgaria 's emissary to Germany .
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung hailed her appointment as Bulgaria 's " guardian of virtue . "
Some progress was marked over the summer : the Interior Minister was forced to resign , several new investigations were launched to find stolen EU funds , and 10 parliamentarians were stripped of immunity from prosecution .
Bulgaria also talked of passing tougher conflict - of - interest laws and requiring top government officials to fully disclose property ownership and other business interests .
Once again , though , in the end there were no prosecutions .
Lack of political will paralyzes the process , say observers , and Plugchieva herself often sits across the same table from colleagues suspected of criminal ties .
Her hands are tied , without the power to fire anyone .
Besides , outing a corrupt official can be a death sentence ; several have been gunned down in mafia disputes already .
The next EU evaluation of Bulgaria is due in January .
Another $ 15 billion in assistance that Bulgaria stands to receive from the EU over the next few years could be pulled .
A greater humiliation , says Ruslan Stefanov , an analyst with the Center for Study of Democracy in Sofia , would be internal shunning : Brussels could bar Bulgaria from joining both the eurozone of shared European currency and the visa - free travel area known as the " Schengen . "
Something has to give .
Bulgarian lawmakers , up for reelection next year , find little sympathy at home .
Opinion polls indicate greater support for Brussels than their own leaders .
" A friend of mine said , ' I feel schizophrenic , as if I 'm two people : one is that as a Bulgarian , of course you should be offended by not getting the money , ' " says Stefanov , the analyst .
" At the same time , Bulgarians know Brussels is right , that they should stop the money . "
Acknowledging the discontent , Plugchieva says serving the public outweighs pleasing Europe .
" For many years , Bulgarian citizens have borne great costs of the transition , with little to show for it , " she says .
" It should be up to the government to make people here happy , not left to outsiders . "
A friend of mine and I like to show off to each other little Emacs tips and tricks we learn .
Today , he introduced to me the very cool AutoComplete.el package .
AutoComplete.el is intriguing to me because , unlike ropemacs mode which I 've blogged about before , the completions AutoComplete.el provides are inline with your code in a dropdown box instead of in a seperate window ( windows in Emacs are what most people call frames ) .
However , AutoComplete is only a completion framework , it does n't know anything about Python .
Instead , it allows the user to plug into it , feeding it whatever sorts of intelligent completion you want , including Rope .
Setup
The two most important completions I want to integrate into it are Rope and yasnippet .
AutoComplete can handle both of them nicely .
You 'll need to install the very latest development version ( as of December ' 08 ) of Rope , Ropemacs and Ropemode :
sudo apt - get install mercurial mkdir / tmp / rope && cd / tmp / rope hg clone http://bitbucket.org/agr/rope hg clone http://bitbucket.org/agr/ropemacs hg clone http://bitbucket.org/agr/ropemode sudo easy_install rope ln -s ../ ropemode / ropemode ropemacs / sudo easy_install ropemacs
You 'll also need to install Pymacs and Yasnippet if you have n't already :
mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d/vendor && cd ~/.emacs.d/vendor wget http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/archives/Pymacs-0.23.tar.gz tar xfv Pymacs-0.23.tar.gz cd Pymacs - 0.23 make sudo easy_install .
cd ~/.emacs.d/vendor wget http://yasnippet.googlecode.com/files/yasnippet-0.5.9.tar.bz2 tar xfv yasnippet-0.5.9.tar.bz2 cd ~/.emacs.d ln -s vendor / yasnippet -0.5.9/snippets / .
Make sure Pymacs and Yasnippet get into your load path , in your .emacs :
( add - to - list ' load- path " ~/.emacs.d/vendor " ) ( progn ( cd " ~/.emacs.d/vendor " ) ( normal - top - level - add - subdirs - to - load - path ) )
Install AutoComplete.el 0.1.0 ( 0.2.0 is now out , and is not compatible with this post , I 'll try and update later ) :
cd ~/.emacs.d/vendor wget http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action = browse ; id = auto - complete.el ; raw = 1 ; revision = 5
Now to add some more elisp to your .emacs somewhere :
( require ' python ) ( require ' auto - complete ) ( require ' yasnippet ) ( autoload ' python - mode " python - mode " " Python Mode . " t ) ( add - to - list ' auto - mode - alist ' ( " \\.py\\ ' " .

Initialize Pymacs ( autoload ' pymacs - apply " pymacs " ) ( autoload ' pymacs - call " pymacs " ) ( autoload ' pymacs -eval " pymacs " nil t ) ( autoload ' pymacs - exec " pymacs " nil t ) ( autoload ' pymacs - load " pymacs " nil t ) ;; Initialize Rope ( pymacs - load " ropemacs " " rope - " ) ( setq ropemacs - enable - autoimport t ) ;; Initialize Yasnippet ; Do n't map TAB to yasnippet ; In fact , set it to something we 'll never use because ; we 'll only ever trigger it indirectly .

Github
These changes are also applied to my Emacs environment on Github .
I 'm continuously trying to improve my emacs setup , so if you 're reading this a few months / years after this post was made , you may want to check there for improvements .
Update Jan 30 2009 : I made some modifications to the tab complete order , a regular indent is applied first before autocompletion .
Autocompletion is also not applied unless you are at the end of a word .
This is useful when you press Tab at the beginning of a line to indent / outdent .
Usage
Once you got everything setup , usage is real easy :
Open up a python ( .py ) file Press TAB when you want to use code completion or to insert a snippet .
The first time you attempt to use code completion you 'll be prompted to enter the root of your project directory .
Future
It was n't too long ago when Python code completion inside Emacs was just a pipedream .
So now that we have it , let 's make some more pipedreams : I 'd like to popup some nice contextual help for method arguments as well as python documentation for the current method / class being completed .
The possibilities are pretty much endless .
I love Emacs .
Red Dwarf won a Bafta for best British comedy series
Cult comedy Red Dwarf is returning to TV , 21 years after its initial launch .
The show has been resurrected by digital channel Dave for a two - part Easter weekend special , which sees the cast finally return to Earth .
Written and directed by Red Dwarf co-creator Doug Naylor , the new show reunites the line - up , including Coronation Street 's Craig Charles .
The hit show , which ran for eight series on BBC Two between 1988 and 1999 , won an International Emmy award .
' No holds barred '
Set three million years into the future , the show followed the exploits of Dave Lister , slovenly crew member of the mining ship Red Dwarf - and the last man in the universe .
He was joined in his weekly attempts to make it back to Earth by a cast of oddballs including human hologram Arnold Rimmer , mechanoid servant Kryten and Cat - a preening half - man , half - animal who evolved from the ship 's cat .
At its peak , Red Dwarf pulled in around eight million viewers and was broadcast in more than 25 countries .
It has sold more than seven million DVDs and videos .
The new two - part series Red Dwarf : Back to Earth will be followed by a " no holds barred " episode without sets , special effects or autocue .
The weekend will climax with Red Dwarf : the Making of Back to Earth , a behind - the - scenes special from the new episodes .

A masked assassin with a silencer on his gun crept up behind Stanislav Markelov , a human rights lawyer with an insurgent spirit and a penchant for underdogs , and shot him dead in broad daylight on Monday .
A freelance reporter with Russia ’s Novaya Gazeta newspaper was also killed in the attack .
Markelov had just given a news conference about Thursday ’s early release of Yuri Budanov , the former Russian colonel whose imprisonment for killing an 18 - year - old Chechen woman riveted and polarized the country .
Markelov was a lawyer for the Chechen family ; he was fighting to get Budanov back behind bars .
Markelov was killed just half a mile from the Kremlin amid the bustle of a business day .
His death shocked Moscow ’s tight - knit community of human rights groups and defense lawyers .
The brazen strike , heavy with a sense of impunity , was reminiscent of the 2006 slaying of outspoken journalist Anna Politkovskaya .
“ A very simple and efficient mechanism to get rid of anyone they do n’t want in their way is in effect , ” said Svetlana Gannushkina , a lawyer with Moscow ’s Civic Assistance organization and a colleague of Markelov .
“ Anybody can be killed like this , in broad daylight , in the center of town .
I think the plan was not only to kill a particular person but also to terrify the rest of society . ”

Media reports identified the journalist shot along with Markelov as Anastasia Baburova .
She reportedly died on an operating table .
Markelov had been deeply embroiled in the Budanov case in recent days , lobbying angrily for the former officer to be sent back to prison .
The lawyer had filed an appeal to the Supreme Court to block Budanov ’s release , and was also pushing for the former colonel to be tried anew based on evidence that Kheda Kungayeva had been raped before she was killed in 2000 in Chechnya .
Meanwhile , rare protests shook Chechnya , where Budanov was seen as a symbol of the largely ignored stories of torture , disappearance and rape of civilians during the two Chechen wars .
In other corners of Russia , Budanov was regarded as a hero by some military and ultranationalistic circles .
Markelov had received death threats in text messages and a telephone call in recent days , said Vissa Kungayev , the father of the slain teen .

“ He told me , ‘ Vissa , I am being threatened ; they want me to drop the Budanov case and they said if I do n’t , they will kill me , ’ ” Kungayev said by phone from Norway , where he fled with his wife and remaining children after his daughter ’s death .
“ Some people say he was killed because he was conducting some other cases connected to Chechnya , ” Kungayev said .
“ But I am 100 % sure he was killed because of my case . ”
In the Chechen capital , Grozny , the republic ’s human rights ombudsman , Nurdi Nukhazhiyev , also linked the killing to the Budanov case .
“ This is a bold and impudent murder related to Markelov ’s activity as a defense lawyer for the Kungayev family and his attitude to military crimes in Chechnya , ” Nukhazhiyev told the Interfax news agency .
Advertisement
Others were less certain .
“ I do n’t have the slightest doubt that this was connected to his professional activities , but the horrible thing is that any group could be behind it , ” said Gannushkina , the fellow lawyer .
“ He worked on a lot of sensitive cases .
This shot could have come from any direction you pick . ”
Markelov was also defending a Chechen man who accused Ramzan Kadyrov , the Kremlin - backed president of Chechnya , of detaining him in a secret prison .
Kadyrov has denied the existence of the extrajudicial prisons , which have come up repeatedly in allegations gathered by human rights groups .
Last summer , after the man testified in court about Kadyrov ’s alleged secret prison , he disappeared .
He still has n’t been found .
Advertisement
There were also reports that neo -Nazi groups in Russia had threatened to kill Markelov for his work defending people who opposed their activities , including members of the Antifa , or anti-fascist , movement .
Markelov had also begun an independent investigation into the severe beating of Mikhail Beketov , a newspaper editor and conservationist who was attacked late last year .
The federal prosecutor opened an investigation into Markelov ’s assassination , and police sources told Russian state news agencies that nearby security cameras had probably captured pictures of the killer .
“ The investigation is analyzing different motives of the Markelov murder , including the motive concerned with his professional activity , ” Anatoly Bagmet , head of the Moscow investigation department , told Interfax .

Meanwhile , Kungayev vowed to find another lawyer and continue the struggle to put his daughter ’s killer back behind bars .
“ I will see this case through to the end , ” he said .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
The brother of the journalist now famous for hurling his shoes at President Bush said his sibling 's actions were " spontaneous " and represented millions of Iraqis who want to " humiliate the tyrant . "
TV reporter Muntadhar al - Zaidi , in a file photo , was jailed after throwing his shoes at President Bush .
Dhirgham al - Zaidi , who sometimes worked as his brother 's cameraman , described the reporter 's hatred for the " material American occupation " and the " moral Iranian occupation . "
Muntadhar al - Zaidi's feelings were influenced by watching the agony suffered by everyday Iraqis .
Most of the reporter 's stories focused on Iraqi widows , orphans , and children , said the brother .
Sometimes the 29 - year - old journalist would cry .
Moved by the tales he reported of poor families , he sometimes asked his colleagues to give money to them .
On most nights , he returned to his home in central Baghdad after reporting from Sadr City , one of the country 's most violent slums and the epicenter of several of the war 's pitched battles .
Muntadhar al - Zaidi's reporting for Egypt - based independent television Al - Baghdadia was " against the occupation , " his brother said .
The journalist would occasionally sign off his stories " from occupied Baghdad . "
Yet Dhirgham al - Zaidi said he was " shocked " when he saw his brother hurling his shoes at President Bush at a Sunday news conference after a surprise visit by Bush to Baghdad .
Watch Muntadhar al - Zaidi throw his shoes at Bush »
Bush swiftly ducked the flying footwear and later told reporters aboard Air Force
One that the " bizarre " incident was not a sign of popular opinion in Iraq .
" These journalists here were very apologetic , " Bush said .
" They ... said this does n't represent the Iraqi people , but that 's what happens in free societies where people try to draw attention to themselves . "
The reporter called his shoe - throwing -- a traditional insult in Arab culture -- a " farewell kiss " to a " dog " who launched the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
Watch Arab reaction to the incident »
Dhirgham al - Zaidi said Iraqi journalists told him after the incident that U.S. security stopped Iraqis from hitting the reporter .
The journalist was hustled out of the room and arrested .
He remains in jail and has been tested for for alcohol and drugs to determine his state of mind , said a government official , who requested anonymity .
The al - Zaidi family plans to retain Egyptian lawyers to defend Muntadhar al - Zaidi .
The reporter 's brother said the family has not been contacted by the Iraqi government .
Dhirgham al - Zaidi said he is " proud " of his brother whose act , while rash , was a statement of behalf of " millions " of other Iraqis .
Dhirgham said the shoe throwing was " Iraq 's reaction " to the war and years of U.S. sanctions against Iraq before the conflict began .
The reporter was not motivated for personal reasons , or because he has " anything against the American people , " he said .
Dhirgham al - Zaidi says his brother started working for al - Baghdadia in 2005 as one of its founding staff members .
Al - Baghdadia is devoting round - the - clock coverage to the incident and calling for the immediate release of the reporter whose co-workers describe him as usually " calm and polite . "
In a statement read on the air , Al - Baghdadia said al - Zaidi should be freed " in accordance with democracy and freedom of expression Iraqis were promised by the new era and American authorities . "
The channel also ran the reporter 's image with what it said were messages of support from viewers in a crawl at the bottom of the screen and called on Arabs , Muslims and Iraqis to support " your brother . "
Dhirgham al - Zaidi , who worked with his brother but is now employed by another channel , said his brother was kidnapped in November 2007 as he was heading to work .
The kidnappers tied his hands and covered his head , feeding him just two meals in three days .
He was released after three days , " in very bad shape , " he said .

March of the Facebook mob :
The full chilling story of a precocious girl and a ruthless internet gang
Sylvia Hobday says her daughter will never be allowed another party
The first Sylvia Hobday knew that all was not well was when her husband 's mobile phone rang .
It was a police officer , with bad news about the party their 15 - year - old daughter , Georgina , was throwing at the family 's £ 1.5 million Brighton home .
' He told my husband that we had to get back home immediately , ' recalls Sylvia , a successful advertising consultant .
' He said that our house was being destroyed . '
Abandoning their restaurant meal , Sylvia and Michael jumped in a taxi .
Five minutes later they arrived at their Grade II - listed four - storey home - and realised that the policeman had n't been exaggerating .
' There were so many people , they were wedged in , unable to move , like at a carnival , ' says Sylvia .
' There must have been 500 of them and the noise was incredible , a huge crowd of people yelling .
' Alcohol was everywhere , and two boys were trying to head - butt my mirror in the hall .
I did n't recognise anyone and just kept thinking who on earth were all these people in my home ?
' There were 12 police vans and cars outside .
I was shell - shocked and totally scared . '
Sylvia 's shock at what she saw was all the more acute , because when she had left an hour earlier the first of the 100 guests were arriving and everything had seemed so under control .
Like her daughter , known as Georgie to her family , most of those invited were from good backgrounds and attending private schools .
There was to be no alcohol and four adult family friends had agreed to act as bouncers .
How did it all go so wrong so quickly ?
The answer provides a deeply depressing insight into the mindset of some of Britain 's youth - one that will send shivers down the spine of any well - meaning parent agreeing to a similar celebration .
For the army of rowdy gatecrashers that descended on her home learned about Georgie 's 16th birthday party from the internet .
Talking frankly to the Mail , 52 - year - old Sylvia reveals that her daughter advertised the party on her Facebook site precisely because she was determined to get as many people there as possible , has expressed no remorse for what happened and thinks that last Saturday 's mayhem will only enhance her street credibility .
' Kids wants to be cool , and to her friends this is cool , ' says Sylvia .
' Sadly , they consider having the police round a complete success because of the heightened drama .
Georgie says : " It could have been a lot worse . "
She just does n't understand - it 's devastating .'
Sylvia 's story is far from unique .
Every few weeks there seems to be yet another story in the press about a respectable home trashed after a teenage party spins out of control .
But significantly , in Georgie 's case , her desire to be noticed brought her into the orbit of one Steve O'Brien .
The £ 1.5 m home in Brighton was wrecked after hundreds of uninvited guests gatecrashed the party
He is also from Brighton , but from a very different background .
Raised on a notorious council estate less than two miles from Georgie 's elegant residence , O'Brien is a hard - drinking , 25 - year - old amateur boxer .
His favourite pastime is ' getting wrecked out of my brains ' , and to facilitate this he has set up something called The Facebook Republican Army .
A group of like - minded friends , the gang scan the internet looking for forthcoming parties .
When they find one , they hop aboard their own private coach and arrive mob-handed .
Chaos generally ensues .
' When things get out of hand and a house starts getting trashed , nine times out of ten it's some of our lads involved , ' O'Brien boasts .
' I personally do n't go around smashing things up , but when you 've got 40 lads all off their heads , something 's bound to happen . '
On his own Facebook page , O'Brien writes that his main ' interest ' is ' drinking myself into oblivion ' ; that his favourite movie is the defiantly low - brow Dumb And Dumber ; and that his favourite quotation is ' Your ( sic ) here for a good time not a long time . '
O'Brien first came to the attention of the press in March when he and members of the Facebook Republican Army attended a party thrown by 15 - year - old Gemma Johnson at her parents ' home in Worthing , West Sussex .
It descended into a drug - fuelled orgy , during which more than £ ; 5,000 worth of damage was caused .
The family 's pet dog was left comatose after apparently swallowing ecstasy tablets .
According to friends , that party and Georgie 's party ticked all the boxes for O'Brien and his chums .
' They 're in their late teens and early 20s and they are quite intimidating , ' one said .
' When they turn up at a teenage party , they know that no one will dare say anything to them , so they can just barge in and do what they want .
Once they 've found a party , they put the word out through texts and news spreads fast . '
It is also the case , of course , that Georgie 's party in Brighton was geographically convenient for O'Brien .
But , as he explained to the Mail earlier this week , distance is no object .
' Most of us have known each other since school and we started off just going to parties that were local , but now we go all over the country , ' said O'Brien , who works as a plumber and gas fitter with his younger brother , Shaun .
' We all chipped in and bought a coach and we pay a bloke £ 500 to be our driver for the weekend so we can all get off our heads .
He 's 52 , single and on the dole , so he needs the money .
' One of the lads is a whizz on the computer and he finds us the parties , then we just jump in the coach and turn up . '
Of course , the fact that they are gatecrashers means that entry does not always happen .
So how do they react then ?
' We 're not the kind to back down from trouble , ' he says .
' If they let us in and it 's a good party , there 's no need to cause trouble .
It 's only when they try to kick us out that it all goes pear - shaped .
' But we can look after ourselves and there 's been a few pretty nasty fights .
Once it kicks off , all hell breaks loose and that 's when houses start getting trashed .
I suppose you could say we 're every parent 's worst nightmare . '
O'Brien and his cronies are gleefully feeding off a new teenage sub-culture that revolves around raucous parties .
Which brings us to the satellite station MTV - required viewing for Britain 's adolescents - and in particular a show called My Super Sweet 16 .
Steve O'Brien : ' Every parent 's worst nightmare '
The programme follows some of Britain 's most spoilt and demanding teenagers as they prepare to throw a ' landmark ' party .
Every week , pampered little rich - girls or boys are filmed stamping their feet and badgering their parents until they fork out tens of thousands of pounds to throw a bash - and the more vulgar it is the better .
Significantly , Georgie Hobday , who attends £ 8,394 - a- year girls ' school Brighton and Hove High , is a big fan .
And with her 16th birthday fast approaching , she was desperate to have a party to remember .
At first , her parents ' idea had been to hire a nightclub , but this idea was rejected by Georgie .
' I found one that would charge £ 850 and provide security , but it would be between 6 pm and 10 pm - so Georgie refused that , ' says her mother .
' There 's a church hall nearby , but when I suggested that Georgie said : " Do you think I 'm three ?
No way am I having a party there . " '
So Sylvia was persuaded to let her daughter have the party at home .
Her husband , a professor of economics , told her she was mad , that she should refuse .
But Sylvia , whose career saw her rise to the board of Saatchi's by the age of 31 , felt pressured to agree .
' You feel you 're a rubbish parent if you do n't deliver , because you promise them things and see the TV programmes they watch , ' she says .
' Kids see celebrities having things and want them too .
' It 's true of everyone I know .
Georgie is n't excessively demanding .
Kids are older younger now , and they want things sooner .
It 's difficult parenting when there is such emphasis on materialism . '
Sylvia , who is the daughter of Swiss - German immigrants and a mother - of - two , adds : ' There is also more pressure as a parent because people have fewer children nowadays and spoil them more as a result .
' The Government is always going on about " every child counts " and , of course , every child is precious to their parent .
But this emphasis on kids having an incredible childhood is so extreme .
' It 's like you must be showing how precious your children are with parties and gadgetry . '
While Sylvia acknowledges many will consider her naive for trusting a 15 - year - old to organise a party responsibly , she did take a number of precautions - she spent the preceding week packing away valuables in the loft .
Alcohol was banned - all that was provided were plastic cups , fizzy pop and some loaves .
And Sylvia also arranged for four male acquaintances to attend the party as ' security ' .
All were in their 40s and two had experience working as bouncers .
So , she admits , she was caught totally off guard when the police called last Saturday night .
' When we got back , I asked the bouncers what had happened , ' she said .
' They said to me : " We could n't contain it . "
They told me people came in waves .
' The first lot were Georgie 's friends , then those of sixth - form - college age , then older people , then just random people walking past .
' Within an hour of my leaving , I was told , people had broken the front window and were climbing up the balcony and through the window into the house .
I just kept thinking what an idiot I 'd been .
My husband was furious .
He did n't say much , but just gave me a withering look as he had warned me not to allow the party .
' I sat on the sofa with the bouncers who I asked not to leave .
The police warned us that sometimes gatecrashers hide then carry on once the coast is clear . '
That the internet helped publicise the party is beyond dispute .
Georgie has admitted it .
Despite her being told that 100 was the limit , more than 150 friends accepted an invitation through her Facebook site .
After that , the word just spread .
' I knew Georgie was on Facebook , but I did n't understand what that meant , ' says Sylvia .
' People were also calling and texting their friends and sending messages via Bluetooth technology [ a wireless messaging system popular with teenagers ] across the city - one of the bouncers picked up one saying " hot party just off the Seven Dials " ( their location ) .
' That these people moved in so fast is terrifying .
Had the party gone on for its planned course till 2 am , the house would have been totally destroyed .
The damage is just what happened in the space of an hour . '
But that damage is expected to run into thousands of pounds .
The beautiful wooden floors have been soaked in alcohol and caked in mud and need re-sanding and re-varnishing .
The kitchen lino is marked with cigarette burns and needs replacing .
A window is broken , the lawn is a sea of mud and a fountain has been smashed to pieces .
On the night of the party , Sylvia was so cross with Georgie that all she could do was order her to bed .
The next day , she was made to clean up , mopping and picking up bottles , which she did with ' stereotypical teenage resignation ' .
' She 's never allowed another party , and she 's getting a book for her birthday today , instead of a designer handbag , ' says Sylvia .
Exasperated , she adds : ' I am very angry with her , but she just shrugs .
She thinks I 'm fussing .
It seems to be that parties now have three aims for success - to completely trash the venue , to get everyone blind drunk and to have the police round . '
As well as being infuriated by Georgie 's attitude , Sylvia cannot understand the wanton destruction perpetrated by the gatecrashers .
' What I do n't understand is this desire young people have to trash places , ' she says .
' There have always been parties , but there has never been this desire for destruction .
' I put it down to the need youngsters have to fight against something - they need something to bat against and last week it was my house . '
Fortunately , while damage was done to the property , no one appears to have been hurt .
The police , however , say that sorting out the melee tied up a number of officers for several hours .
While they say they do not intend to take any action against any of the party - goers - and there is no suggestion O'Brien caused any damage at the house - a number of Facebook users feel the time has come to give O'Brien a taste of his own medicine .
' I do n't think it would be that hard to fine his house - maybe 400 people should pay him a visit , ' suggested one message posted last week .
As for Georgie , the prospects for her future birthdays are looking pretty grim .
Ask her mother how her daughter will celebrate next year and the reply comes :

Why You Should Do the Right Thing , and How to Do It
Image by DownTown Pictures ( license ) .
One of the hardest things to do in life is to do the right thing .
What you think is the right thing .
Not what you friends , family , teachers , boss and society thinks is the right thing .
What is the right thing ?
Thatâ€™s up to you to decide .
Often you have a little voice in your head that tells what the right thing is .
Or a gut feeling .
It might tell you to get up from the couch , stop eating those snacks and go to the gym instead .
Sometimes you will put on your exercise clothes and go .
Sometimes you will not .
It might tell you to stop sulking and feeling like a victim with everything against you and instead look at the opportunities and take action .
Sometimes you will .
Sometimes you will not .
Now , why should you do the right thing ?
Here are three excellent reasons :
1 . You tend to get what you give .
By doing the right thing you tend to get the same things back .
Give value to people , help them and they will often want to help you and give you value in some form .
Not everyone will do it but many will .
Not always right away but somewhere down the line .
Things tend to even out .
Do the right thing , put in the extra effort and you tend to get good stuff back .
Donâ€™t do it and you tend to get less good stuff back from the world .
2 . To raise your self - esteem .
This is a really important point .
When you donâ€™t do the right thing you are not only sending out signals out into your world .
You are also sending signals to yourself .
When you donâ€™t do the right thing you donâ€™t feel good about yourself .
You may experience emptiness or get stuck in negative thought loops .
Itâ€™s like you are letting yourself down .
You are telling yourself that you canâ€™t handle doing the right thing .
To not do the right thing is a bit like punching yourself in the stomach .
3 . To avoid self - sabotage .
A powerful side effect of not doing the right thing is that you give yourself a lack of deservedness .
This can really screw up you and your success .
If you donâ€™t do the right thing in your life then you wonâ€™t feel like you deserve the success that you may be on your way towards or experiencing right now .
So you start to self - sabotage , perhaps deliberately or through unconscious thoughts .
If you on some level donâ€™t think that you are a person who deserves the success you want then you will probably find a way to sabotage that success .
You may rationalize it as being about something else or what someone else did .
But oftentimes itâ€™s just you standing in your own way .
By doing the right thing your can raise your self - esteem and feel like a person who deserves his / her success .
How to do it
Here are a few suggestions that can hopefully help you to do the right thing more often .
Review the reasons why you are doing it .
Whenever you feel unsure about doing the right thing remind yourself of the powerful reasons above ( or any other that you can come up with ) .
They might give you that extra push of motivation you need to spring into action .
Go for improvement .
Not perfection .
Iâ€™m not saying you will do the right thing all the time .
I certainly donâ€™t .
But Iâ€™m saying that we can strive for gradual improvement .
If you for instance do the right thing 10 percent of the time right now then try to doing it 20 percent of the time .
And then 30 percent .
Or you can try to do the right thing at as many opportunities as you find this week .
Try some stuff and see works best for you .
My point is just to not get stuck in thinking about perfection or being some kind of saint .
This can paralyse you from taking any action at all .
Or leave you with negative feelings despite doing the right thing many , many times ( since you are still not feeling like you are not quite perfect ) .
If you seldom do what you feel / think is the right thing now then you will probably not be able to change this completely over the weekend .
It might take some time .
Just do it .
The more you think about these things , the more often you tend to come up with reasons to not do it .
You need to think but not over think since that often traps you in analysis paralysis .
To raise your self - esteem and get a spiral of positive action spinning in your world and with the people around you need to start moving and take action .
Taking the route of doing the right thing takes more effort and can be more painful .
Itâ€™s often seemingly the harder thing to do .
But when you understand how you are hurting yourself it gets a lot harder to just avoid doing the right thing .
The perceived advantages of not doing the right thing â€ “ such as it being easier â€ “ tend to lose their power and are replaced with a more clearer understanding of what you are doing to yourself and others .
Taking this – perhaps a little less travelled – path is a lot more rewarding than taking the easy way out .
Both for you and for the world around you .

Ads target 3 Republicans , Lincoln
The National Republican Trust PAC , which in the final days of the presidential campaign spent some $ 7 million airing an ad featuring Jeremiah Wright , is attacking three Republican Senators and one Democrat for their votes for Obama 's stimulus plan in new radio ads .
The ad , citing the Wall Street Journal and ( more tendentiously ) the Congressional Budget Office says the plan " just wo n't work " and that it's " packed with pork - barrel programs " including " bail for criminals " and money for ACORN .
" Senator Blanche Lincoln is backing the shocking Obama - Reid - Pelosi plan , " says the Lincoln version of the ad .
" Stand up to Obama and Lincoln . "
The ads target Republicans Arlen Specter , Olympia Snowe , and Susan Collins , as well as Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas , " because she resides in a conservative state and is vulnerable during the election season next year , " a spokeswoman for the group said .
The ads are on air in Pennsylvania and Arkansas , and will be up in Maine soon , she said .
The other three ads can be heard here .

When I heard that Kate was hosting a Pig Blogging Weekend I was beside myself .
I love pork .
By far , the hardest part of giving up red meat ( 1992 - 2001 ) was missing pork .
I was delighted to learn recently that I was actually a bacoterian because though I ate it rarely , I never really gave up bacon and procscuitto .
This recipe for Breakfast Cookies , given to me by a wonderful retired woman who owns horses and grows fabulous vegetables next to her New Jersey home , was always the hit of our church coffee hours .
They look like what might be cranberry raisin cookies but are instead a sweet and savory crunchy cookie studded with bits of applewood - smoked bacon , raisins and multi-grain cereal .
With a cup of coffee or a nice black tea ( I'm loving Rishi's Golden Yunnan right now ) , these are a complete meal .
And what a great way to start the day .
Breakfast Cookies
1/2 pound bacon
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup sugar
1 egg
1 cup of flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups of multi-grain flakes or corn flakes
1/2 cup raisins
Preheat oven to 350 degrees .
Cook bacon until very crisp , drain well and break into 1/2 inch pieces .
Beat together butter and sugar till light and fluffy .
Beat in egg .
Combine flour and baking soda ; stir into butter mixture .
Stir in bacon , mult - grain flakes and raisins .
Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheet .
Space 2 inches apart .
Bake for 15 - 18 minutes .
Remove to rack to cool - - about 2 minutes , then remove from rack .
The frozen consumer credit markets all but shut down auto sales in October , and despite Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's dumping of hundreds of billions of dollars into banks ' coffers , lending did not ease significantly in November , so auto sales remained on ice .
A second factor that might have dampened consumers ' enthusiasm for new - car shopping is the fact that more than half a million Americans lost their jobs last month .
It 's no surprise , then , that auto sales continued to flat - line .
Adding considerably to the automotive gloom was the omnipresent background noise caused by the Detroit Three auto chiefs begging Congress for emergency loans .
That makes it seem like Detroit alone is in the ditch , but as far as November goes , the American automakers have got plenty of company :
( all figures compare November 2008 sales with November 2007 ) Chrysler - 47 % GM - 41 % Ford - 31% Toyota - 34 % Nissan - 42%Honda - 32 % Mazda -31 % Hyundai/Kia - 39 % Volkswagen Group - 22 %BMW
Group ( including Mini ) - 27 % Mercedes - Benz ( including Smart ) - 30 %
One thing that was clear in all the chatter about Detroit 's dire straits is that America 's automakers would not be in their current predicament if they were only willing to make the small , fuel - efficient cars Americans want .
The problem with that analysis is that , in November at least , with gas prices drifting below $ 2 a gallon , Americans did n't really want small , fuel - efficient cars anymore .
A look at the 10 best - selling models in November reveals a far more traditional lineup than the topsy - turvy world of last May , when Americans all but left their SUVs idling by the side of the road as they ran to dealerships demanding something - anything - that would rescue them from the pain of $ 100 fill - ups :
May 2008
November 2008
Ford F-series Chevrolet Silverado Toyota Camry Toyota Corolla / Matrix Honda Civic Honda Accord Dodge Ram Chevrolet Impala Honda CR - V Nissan Altima
It may surprise many media pundits to see how sales of the fuel - efficient favorites from the fervid , $ 4 - a - gallon days last spring and summer have swooned in November .
( And these drops are versus one year ago ; they'd be much steeper compared to the inflated levels of May and June . )
{{{Toyota Prius}}} - 48 % ( the gold standard stumbles ) Toyota Corolla / Matrix - 13 % {{ {Toyota Yaris}}} - 17 %Scion ( all ) - 45 % Honda Civic - 30 % {{ {Honda Fit}}} -8 % VW Rabbit - 44 % {{ {Nissan Versa}}} - 18 %{{ {Nissan Sentra}}} - 39 % Ford Focus - 38 % {{ {Chevrolet Aveo}}} - 36 % Chevrolet Cobalt - 54 % {{ {Pontiac Vibe}}} - 14 %{{{Kia Spectra}}} - 33 %{{{Hyundai Accent}}} - 11 %
Where 's the bright spot ?
There is one - one pinpoint of sunshine in an otherwise leaden gray sky .
The single , smiley - faced bright spot was Mini. Mini ( +43 % ) was the lone nameplate whose November sales were ahead of last year's .
Although Mini was aided by the addition of the Clubman , posting any kind of sales increase in this environment has got to be considered an accomplishment .
In electronics , it is common to talk about single sided circuit boards .
The most common type is a circuit board that only has printed wiring on one side , and components on the other side .
There are also surface - mount boards , where all the wiring and components sit on one side .
But are n’t all of those reallyjust two - sided circuit boards where you only put components on one of the sides ?
Here we present a method of making your own authentic single - sided circuit board .
Our solution ?
A circuit board in the shape of a Mobius strip .
While it is possible to have your own flexible circuit boards commercially fabricated ( at a remarkably high cost ) , we ’re executing a much cheaper DIY version here .
There are a number of ways that you might go about making your own flexible circuitry – we ’re using a paper strip as our substrate and conductive ink for wiring .
One of the reasons for this is that our wiring can stay strictly on the one surface of the paper strip , without punching through it .
( Maintaining topological integrity is a strong motivation . )
We picked up two different silver - filled “ conductive pens ” at our local Fry ’s Electronics .
While the pens look identical , and both make about the same claims , one has 8.5 g of filling and the other has 5 g .
One pen produced matte silver traces , the other glorious shiny traces , and at different viscosities .
Both types of ink dry impressively quickly and conduct reasonably well for this sort of project .
( Expect to lose a few tens of ohms here and there . )
One word of warning :
This stuff is unforgiving .
There is no good way to recover if you should accidentally cross two lines when wiring with conductive ink .
Make sure that your paper is thick enough that the conductive ink will not soak through ; we used an 11 ″ strip of watercolor paper , which worked admirably .
For our circuit , we decided to make an LED chaser that would light up LEDs in sequence along the length of the Mobius strip .
To do this we chose a smallish AVR microcontroller , the ATtiny2313 , which is a 20 - pin device with 17 available output pins .
With each output we drive a single red LED , and the whole thing can be powered by a 3V type CR2032 lithium coin cell .
Here are the components that we will need to mount on our board :
The socket for the ATtiny2313 , a coin cell holder , and small red surface mount LEDs .
We began our layout by placing the socket for the ATtiny 2313 – with its pins bent out for surface mounting – in the middle of the paper strip , tracing paths outwards from its pins in pencil , and placing the LED locations somewhat uniformly along the length of the strip :
All of our LEDs have their cathodes connected to the ground pin of the microcontroller , pin 10 ( on the lower left ) .
Pin 20 ( on the upper right ) is the +V input , and pin 1 ( upper left ) is the reset pin that we ’ll leave unconnected .
All of the other pins lead directly to the nearest , most direct LED .
This all looks a lot better once the socket is superglued to the paper and the pencil marks are all written over with the conductive silver ink :
On the reverse side of the strip ( which is still two sided at this point ! ) we install the battery holder , directly across the paper from the microcontroller .
This keeps both the chip and the battery well away from the seam where we ’ll join the two ends .
The battery holder is basically a retaining clip that contacts the “ + ” terminal of the coin cell .
It ’s up to us to draw a “ - ” terminal beneath the clip , which we connect to the ground pin of the chip and LEDs .
And here ’s how it looks once the holder is glued in place , the LEDs are added , and it ’s all wired up with conductive ink .
Now , we fit it all together .
Our paper strip is 11 × 1.75 ″ in size .
On the side with the microcontroller , we ’ve reserved one inch on each end for glue overlap .
On the back side , the full 11 inches is used .
Test fitting the strip with a half twist to overlap the two glue flaps lets you see how to connect the lines on the front and back before it ’s actually glued together .
( Use the pencil to figure out where you ’re going to wire before you get out the ink ! )
To complete the Mobius strip , attach the two glue flaps together .
We used superglue gel , and used clothespins to hold the ends together while it set .
Connect the wires across the seam with carefully applied conductive ink .
The last step is to program the microcontroller .
We wrote a very simple slow “ LED chaser ” program that lights up the 17 LEDs in sequence , slowly .
The firmware for the AVR is being released under the GPL .
You can download it here ( 10 kB . ZIP file ) and install it through your favorite interface .
All done and how does it look ?
Pretty neat !

Australia may get lucky and avoid a recession in 2009 , although some analysts say possible further downgrades of state sovereign credit ratings could affect confidence in the broader economy .
The world 's premier economies of the US , Japan and Germany are already in recession , along with 11 other industrialised countries that contracted last year .
But CommSec chief economist Craig James says Australia could enjoy its 18th consecutive year of growth as big interest rate cuts and Federal Government stimulus programs support the economy .
" While the global downturn is far bigger than the 2001 slowdown , it is not out of the question that Australia could avoid recession yet again , '' Mr James said .
" No other country has received the same economic boost from all three factors - government spending , lower interest rates and a cheaper Aussie dollar .
Official : Israeli forces shell UN headquarters in Gaza , white phosphorus suspected David Edwards and Diane Sweet

CNN 's John Roberts talked with John Ging who is the director of United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) in Gaza .
Ging believes that Israeli shells that recently struck the U.N. complex contained white phosphorus .
" It looks and smells like phosphorus and it's burning like phosphorus .
That 's all I can say .
That 's why I 'm calling it phosphorus , " said Ging .
The complex under fire is the U.N. central distribution facility in Gaza .
" We 're trying to deal with our whole transport compound .
It 's on fire and now have some danger spreading into the warehouse , where all of the food and thousands of tons of food and medicine .
This is a hub of the whole operation , the whole United Nations operation in Gaza , this is the hub , where it all comes to , gets distributed from , " he said .
Three people have been reported as injured in the attack .
The Associated Press also reports that a hospital , several high - rises , and media building was hit by Israeli shelling and wounded several journalists .
A building housing the Associated Press offices was hit by bullets , with no reports of injuries at that location .
" It is absolutely true that we were attacked from that place , but the consequences are very sad and we apologize for it , " Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said .
" I do n't think it should have happened and I 'm very sorry . "
The AP adds , " A senior Israeli military officer had also said Israeli troops shelled the compound after coming under fire from Palestinian militants there - an account dismissed by a U.N. official there at the time as ' nonsense . ' "

A passenger was injured in the firing A number of senior Indian politicians have protested against the killing of a migrant job seeker by police in the city of Mumbai ( Bombay ) .
Police said Rahul Raj , from Bihar , shot and injured a bus passenger as he tried to hijack the vehicle , demanding to meet local politician Raj Thackeray .
Mr Thackeray has been accused of inciting violence against migrants .
Some senior politicians have demanded an investigation , saying police could easily have disarmed him .
Rahul Raj , who was in his early 20s , had come to Mumbai recently to look for a job , according to his father , Kundan Pratap Singh .
Mr Singh denied that his son had hijacked the bus , and that there was " something more " to the incident .
PM 's concern
News channels showed footage of the man brandishing a revolver and asking for a mobile phone from passengers in the half - empty bus .
At least 15 passengers were travelling in the bus at the time .
Mr Thackeray says jobs should be given to locals
The police said he fired inside the bus , injuring one passenger .
Senior politicians from Bihar state , including the federal railway minister , Laloo Prasad Yadav , expressed shock at the shooting and demanded a judicial probe into the incident .
" The boy did not look like a terrorist .
So [ the police ] could have captured the boy .
The police could have spoken to him on the phone and negotiated with him , " Mr Yadav said .
Bihar 's chief minister Nitish Kumar has said the boy could have been disarmed and arrested .
But Maharashtra 's interior minister , RR Patil , defended the police action , saying that no " unstable person can hold hostages with the help of a revolver " .
Some reports said that Indian PM Manmohan Singh had expressed concern over the incident and spoken to Maharashtra 's chief minister " to ensure " the security of migrant workers in Mumbai .
Raj Thackeray is the leader of the right - wing Maharashtra Navnirman Sena ( MNS ) party and was granted bail last week after being accused of incitement .
His party has been accused of several attacks on migrant workers in recent months .
Students in Bihar paralysed rail services last week in protest at the ill - treatment they say Biharis have received from the MNS .
The unrest in Maharashtra has forced many migrants to leave their neighbourhoods , but Mr Thackeray has consistently denied inciting it .

If , as expected , a record crowd turns out for Barack Obama ’s inauguration , Washington will be ready with the largest number of security people ever assembled in the nation ’s capital .
The U.S. Secret Service is overseeing a security force of more than 40,000 people , including 7,500 active duty soldiers , 10,000 National Guard troops and 25,000 law - enforcement officers .
That surpasses the 31,000 troops serving in Afghanistan .
Intelligence officials say there are no specific threats , but they acknowledge that the high visibility of the inauguration , the presence of dignitaries and the significance of swearing in the first black president make it a vulnerable target .
“ We have to be prepared for the lone individual who will try to interrupt the event all the way up to a terrorist organization , ” Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan told FOXNews.com .
The Metropolitan Police Department will deploy 4,000 officers , and it will have help from an additional 4,000 officers from 99 federal , state and local law - enforcement agencies across the country .

By detecting the delay from different watermarked audio signals in a movie recording , a new technique can locate the recording position in a movie theater .
Image credit : Fernando de Sousa .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Camcorder piracy - which occurs when moviegoers bring a camcorder into a theater to record a movie from the screen - is a rapidly growing illegal activity .
In the US , camcorder piracy has been illegal since 2005 , when the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act banned the use of recording devices in theaters .
Nevertheless , according to the Motion Picture Association , camcorder piracy causes an annual loss of $ 6.1 billion to the movie industry .
In an attempt to deter camcorder piracy , researchers have been developing watermarking techniques that embed a secret message into a movie indicating when and where the movie was shown .
Once the movie is posted on the Internet , this secret message can be extracted to reveal the movie theater and showtime , and the theater can implement additional surveillance to deter piracy .
However , these watermarking techniques cannot identify the recording location in the theater .
Now , a newly proposed position estimation system can use an audio watermarked signal embedded into a movie soundtrack to estimate the camcorder 's location in a theater to within half a meter - basically down to a specific seat .
Yuta Nakashima , Ryuki Tachibana , and Noboru Babaguchi of Osaka University have developed the new technique , and their results will be published in an upcoming issue of IEEE Transactions on Multimedia .
As the researchers explain in their study , the position estimation system works by taking advantage of the different channels of the soundtrack , called " host signals . "
A watermark embedder generates a watermark signal for each host signal , generating a " watermarked host signal " ( WHS ) .
Separate loudspeakers emit each WHS , and a camcorder will record the audio as a mixture of all the WHSs as a single recorded signal .
In this monaural recorded signal , the watermarked host signal from each loudspeaker is delayed in proportion to the distance from its loudspeaker ( the source of origin ) to the camcorder 's microphone .
The watermark detector can calculate these delays by determining the strengths of each watermarked host signal .
Specifically , the detection strength of each watermarked signal will have a peak at a particular time dependent on the delay times .
As the researchers explain , this audio watermarking method could be combined with a conventional watermarking method , which together could determine the move theater , showtime , and the seat in the theater .
Then , a person identification system - such as a ticketing system or video surveillance - could identify the pirate .
Although the researchers performed experiments with the system , they plan to investigate the technique further .
One challenge they face is ensuring that the acoustic quality remains high in the midst of various environmental factors and background noise .
The researchers also plan to investigate the robustness of the system against attacks that may cause the system to estimate an irrelevant position , and to detect these attacks and account for them , if necessary .

The US Army brings us back to the future , returning to WWI ’s “ cult of the offense ”
Analogies are fudge , as TE Lawrence says .
Esp historical analogies , since every era is unique .
We use them anyway , mining the past for comparisons to help us better understand the present .
While analogies cannot be accurate ( different times are incomparable ) , they can illustrate aspects of the present that we might otherwise overlook .
This sketch looks at one element of America ’s grand strategy .
Like the great powers before WWI , we love the offense .
Pre-emptive warfare and fighting on foreign soil are the bread and milk of our military thinking .
Future generations might consider this daft , just as we consider daft the WWI “ cult of the offense . ”
America , today
Brilliant , charismatic figures like John Nagl take us back to the future .
As I explain in Nagl gives a profoundly wrong vision for the US military ( 22 June 2008 ) , he gives us a clear and appealing vision , but one that is deadly wrong IMO .
Only a first rate mind could have conceived it something so attractive and yet destructive — like this ( FM note : this section was slightly expanded on 13 Feb ) :
In the twenty - first century , wars are not won when the enemy army is defeated on the battlefield ; in fact , there may not be a uniformed enemy to fight at all .
Instead , a war is only won when the conditions that spawned armed conflict have been changed .
… The soldiers who will win these wars require an ability not just to dominate land operations , but to change entire societies — and not all of those soldiers will wear uniforms , or work for the Department of Army .
The most important warriors of the current century may fight for the US Information Agency rather than the Department of Defense .
Decisive results ’ in the twenty - first century will come not when we wipe a piece of land clean of enemy forces , but when we protect its people and allow them to control their territory in a manner consistent with the norms of the civilised world .
Thus victory in Iraq and Afghanistan will come when those nations enjoy governments that meet the basic needs and garner the support of all of their peoples .

This is the core theme of counter - insurgency theory , COIN .
FM 3 - 24 is its handbook , showing how to use social science terminology and analytical frameworks to manipulate foreign societies .
This will likely fail on several levels , as the goal of ending the “ conditions that spawned armed conflicts ” is beyond our means ( we can “ change ” conditions , just not consistently for the better ) .
(1) It will not work , as the social sciences are as yet immature .
Its practitioners cannot wield their theories as can chemists and physicists .
Twentieth century history is largely a series of failed attempts at social engineering .
Consider how Watts and Harlem have deteriorated since 1960 , despite forty years of expensive intervention .
(2) If US social scientists were able to do so at home , that does not mean that they could do so in foreign lands .
Traveling thousands of miles to foreign lands may make the task seem easier , as one loses sight of its complexities .
In many cases the locals will reject our neo-colonial presumptions .
That ’s just good sense , as the great successes of the past century were , in general , nations who ignored both our advice ( e.g. , most of Southeast Asia ) .
(3) If social engineering was possible to do in foreign lands , the US military might not have the necessary organization or talent to do so .
This probably requires something like Thomas Barnett ’s “ System Administrators “ , a 21st century organization of colonial civil servants ( the sorcerer ’s apprentices of the 21 century ) .
(4) Note that this passage implies very different concepts of “ soldiers ” and “ warriors ” than used today .
And perhaps a different set of “ laws ” for war to accommodate them .
Someday the social sciences might provide the abity to successfully manipulate our society , and even later still do so to foreigners .
Today they are in an early stage of development .
Ahead lie years , probably generations , of lab work , gathering data , and constructing simple theories .
If there was a government agency regulating social engineering — as the FDA regulates pharmaceuticals — they would declare these tools unready for human trials .
But it is being used now , as America borrows vast sums in the attempt to mold foreign societies to meet our needs and frustrate our enemies .
It is the cult of the offense , polished up for the 21st century .
It is an error with deep roots in western history .
Looking back to France , a century ago
From Barbara Tuchman ’s
The Guns of August ( not the most scholarly work on the era , but one of the best written ) , Chapter 3 – The Shadow of Sedan :
{ Folch ’sideas} were taken up with particular enthusiasm by { French} Colonel Grandmaison , “ an ardent and brilliant officer ” … who in 1911 delivered two lectures at the War College which a crystallizing effect .
Colonel Grandmaison grasped only the head and not the feet of Foch ’s principles .
Expounding their elan ( will ) without their surete ( protection ) , he expressed a military philosophy that electrified his audience .
he waved before their dazzled eyes an “ idea with a sword ” which showed them how France could win .
Its essence was the offensive a outrance , offensive to the limit .
Only this could could achieve Clausewitz ’s decisive battle which “ exploited to the finish is the essential act of war ” and which “ once engaged , must be pushed to the end , with no second thoughts , up to the extremes of human endurance . ”
Seizure of initiative is the sine qua non . …
Liberty of action is achieved only by imposing one ’swill upon the enemy .
“ All command decisions must be inspired by the will to seize and retain the initiative . ”
The defensive is forgotten , abandoned , discarded ; its only possible justification is an occasional “ economizing of forces at certain points with a view to adding them to the attack . ” …
Within a few months of Granmaison ’s lectures , the President of the Republic , M. Fallieres , announced “ The offensive alone is suited to the temperament of French soldiers . …
We are determined to march straight against the enemy without hesitation . ”
The new Field Regulations , enacted by the government in October 1913 , as the fundamental document for the training and conduct of the French Army , opened with a flourish of trumpets :
The French Army , returning to its traditions , henceforth admits no law but the offensive . ” …
The offensive alone leads to positive results . ”
Few or none of the generals on either side in WWI were stupid .
Nonetheless , overconfidence about the efficacy of their plans contributed to the bonfire of civilization called WWI .
It is an inevitable risk of modern military theory , which can not be tested in any meaningful way .
Comparing then and now
Mistakes of the past so often seem obvious — poorly reasoned bouts of emotional myopia — while our misfortunes result from “ black swans ” — unpredictable blows of fate .
Yet it need not be so .
Our “ cult of the offensive ” , tinkering with foreign societies , might be seen by future generations as folly — attempting things obviously beyond the current state of the social sciences or American wisdom .
And as an esp bizarre strategy for a over - indebted hegemonfrantically attempting to stay afloat with money borrowed from creditors of dubious loyalty .
An alternative : playing defense
There is an alternative strategy : focusing on defense , not offense .
For more on this see Thoughts on FMFM 1 - A , an important tool for survival in the 21st century and esp William Lind ’s Strategic Defense Initiative .
Of course “ offense ” and “ defense ” are just shorthand labels for concepts of extreme subtlety — beyond the scope of this already too - long essay , to be discussed in a later post .
A few quite notes to illustrate this :
In 4GW the “ home court advantage ” might be a more useful concept than “ defense ” .
Rretaining the initiative at all timesis vital ( as it is in 3GW , maneuver warfare ) .
As the late John Boyd ( Colonel , USAF ) said , offensive / defensive are attributes of the destructive forms of war ; there are more effective ways for nations to win conflicts .

The empty highway stretches straight out to the horizon , so I take a moment to peek at the electronic display down in the car ’s center console .
I read out the numbers on the screen swiftly and glance back to the windshield , when I see ... nothing .
A dense fog has swallowed the roadway , and I am driving blind .

That came alongside worse , but just as familiar , news : that the performance of AOL and Time Inc. , the company ’s other ailing arm , which publishes magazines like Fortune , Time and Sports Illustrated , is weak and will result in worse - than - expected earnings at the company when it reports 2008 numbers on Feb .

AOL and Time Inc. have been twin encumbrances for some time ; before Wednesday , Time Warner had already taken more than $ 100 billion in write - downs to reflect the steady erosion of value at AOL .

Scientists are studying complex wiring of the brain to build the computer of the future , one that combines the brain ’s abilities for sensation , perception , action , interaction and cognition and its low power consumption and compact size .
Understanding the process behind these seemingly effortless feats of the human brain and creating a computational theory based on it remains one of the biggest challenges for computer scientists .
Illustration by : D. Modha , IBM
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Suppose you want to build a computer that operates like the brain of a mammal .
How hard could it be ?
After all , there are supercomputers that can decode the human genome , play chess and calculate prime numbers out to 13 million digits .
But University of Wisconsin- Madison research psychiatrist Giulio Tononi , who was recently selected to take part in the creation of a " cognitive computer , " says the goal of building a computer as quick and flexible as a small mammalian brain is more daunting than it sounds .
Tononi , professor of psychiatry at the UW - Madison School of Medicine and Public Health and an internationally known expert on consciousness , is part of a team of collaborators from top institutions who have been awarded a $ 4.9 million grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) for the first phase of DARPA 's Systems of Neuromorphic Adaptive Plastic Scalable Electronics ( SyNAPSE ) project .
Tononi and scientists from Columbia University and IBM will work on the " software " for the thinking computer , while nanotechnology and supercomputing experts from Cornell , Stanford and the University of California - Merced will create the " hardware . "
Dharmendra Modha of IBM is the principal investigator .
The idea is to create a computer capable of sorting through multiple streams of changing data , to look for patterns and make logical decisions .
There 's another requirement :
The finished cognitive computer should be as small as a the brain of a small mammal and use as little power as a 100 - watt light bulb .
It 's a major challenge .
But it 's what our brains do every day .
" Our brains can do it , so we have proof that it is possible , " says Tononi .
" What our brains are good at is being flexible , learning from experience and adapting to different situations . "
While the project will take its inspiration from the brain 's architecture and function , Tononi says it is n't possible or even desirable to recreate the entire structure of the brain down to the level of the individual synapse .
" A lot of the work will be to determine what kinds of neurons are crucial and which ones we can do without , " he says .
It all comes down to an understanding of what is necessary for teaching an artificial brain to reason and learn from experience .
" Value systems or reward systems are important aspects , " he said .
" Learning is crucial because it needs to learn from experience just like we do . "
So a system modeled after the neurons that release neuromodulators could be important .
For example , neurons in the brain stem flood the brain with a neurotransmitter during times of sudden stress , signaling the " fight - or flight " response .
" Every neuron in the brain knows that something has changed , " Tononi explains .
" It tells the brain , ' I got burned , and if you want to change , this is the time to do it . ' "
Thus , a cat landing on a hot stovetop not only jumps off immediately , it learns not to do that again .
Tononi says the ideal artificial brain will need to be plastic , meaning it is capable of changing as it learns from experience .
The design will likely convey information using electrical impulses modeled on the spiking neurons found in mammal brains .
And advances in nanotechnology should allow a small artificial brain to contain as many artificial neurons as a small mammal brain .
It wo n't be an easy task , says Tononi , a veteran of earlier efforts to create cognitive computers .
Even the brains of the smallest mammals are quite impressive when you consider what tasks they perform with a relatively small volume and energy input .
" I would be happy to create a mouse brain , " Tononi says .
" A mouse brain is quite remarkable .
And from there , it should n't be too hard to scale up to a rat brain , and then a cat or monkey brain . "

US to comply with Iraq ban on Blackwater RAW STORY
Published : Thursday January 29 , 2009
Print This Email This Guards will be able to keep jobs if they switch employers " The Iraqi government has informed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that it will not issue a new operating license to Blackwater Worldwide , the embassy 's primary security company , which has come under scrutiny for allegedly using excessive force while protecting American diplomats , Iraqi and U.S. officials said Wednesday , " The Washington Post reported from Mosul early Thursday .
" Iraq 's Interior Ministry conveyed its decision to U.S. officials in Baghdad on Friday , in one of the boldest moves the government has made since the Jan. 1 implementation of a security agreement with the United States that sharply curbed American power in Iraq , " the Post added .
" Blackwater employees who have not been accused of improper conduct will be allowed to continue working as private security contractors in Iraq if they switch employers , Iraqi officials said Wednesday ...
" When the work of this committee ends , " Interior Ministry spokesman Maj .
Gen. Abdul - Karim Khalaf said , private security companies " will be under the authority of the Iraqi government , and those companies that do n't have licenses , such as Blackwater , should leave Iraq immediately . "
The US State Department said Thursday it will comply with Iraq 's ban on controversial US security outfit Blackwater but still had to decide on the " next steps " to ensure security for its employees .
Iraq said Thursday it scrapped the license for Blackwater , the firm at the forefront of a booming private security business in Iraq , over a 2007 Baghdad shooting involving its guards in which 17 civilians were killed .
" We 're going to comply with the Iraqi decision .
We have no choice but to do that , " State Department acting spokesman Robert Wood told reporters .
" So we 're just right now trying to formulate how we 're going to go forward , " he said .
" But I just wanted to make clear that we 're going to do everything , you know , to make sure that our embassy employees have the security they need , " Wood added .
" We 're looking at next steps . "
When pressed on whether the next steps would involve another contractor , Wood replied : " We 're looking at a variety of possibilities .
But I 'm not here to outline those possibilities at this point . "
Blackwater Worldwide , a multi-million dollar US State Department contractor in Iraq , is being expelled over the deaths of civilians at Nisur Square , a busy Baghdad intersection , on September 16 , 2007 , the Iraqi interior ministry said .
An Iraqi investigation found that 17 civilians were killed and 20 wounded when Blackwater guards opened fire with automatic weapons while escorting a US diplomatic convoy through Baghdad .
US prosecutors say 14 civilians were killed .
The firm and its wealthy founder Erik Prince maintain its guards were responding to fire and acting in self - defense , but residents adamantly rejected such claims .

Matt says to lay off the post office :
As for the US Postal Service , at the end of the day it does a pretty darn good job .
Want to send a letter somewhere ?
Put it in an envelop and stick it in a box , and it 'll go where you wanted it to go .
They 'll pick the letter up from your house if you want it , and hand - deliver it to the destination .
For not much money !
Anywhere in the country !
What you can say about the Postal Service is that in the modern day it 's not clearly necessary to have a public agency guaranteeing the availability of this service in the way that it was before phones and email .
But for quite a long time this was a really mission - critical element in our communications infrastructure and it still works just fine .
I suspect that the real problem here is that Matt does not remember what the Post Office was like before FedEx and email -- before , in short , the salutary effects of capitalist competition had made it clear that the organization had better shape up if anyone who worked for it wanted to continue enjoying their dizzyingly boring , but steady and lavishly benefitted , jobs .
Or what the phone company was like before there were cell phones and long distance competition .
These references to the post office are a bit of carryover from a worse era .
But importantly , they 're a bit of carryover from a worse era in which government was bigger and had more power over the market .
This is worth remembering in a discussion about expanding government 's brief -- if we 're old enough to remember .
WASHINGTON , Jan 24 ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama pledged on Saturday to create jobs , improve healthcare and lay the groundwork for a clean energy future as he sought to build public support for an $ 825 billion stimulus plan some lawmakers fear is too costly .
Saying more people filed for unemployment this week than at any time in the past 26 years , Obama warned in his weekly radio address that joblessness could hit double digits and the economy could fall $ 1 trillion short of its full capacity if nothing was done .
“ If we do not act boldly and swiftly , a bad situation could become dramatically worse , ” the new U.S. president said in his first weekly radio address .
He said he expected to sign an economic recovery plan into law within a month .
The White House said a report outlining the impact of the stimulus plan would be put on its website , www.whitehouse.gov, at 6 a.m. ( 1100 GMT ) on Saturday .
Aides said the report began to put “ meat on the bones ” of Obama ’s previously stated goals .
Obama took office on Tuesday with the United States in its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression .
The radio address on Saturday continued the push he began this month to win quick congressional approval of the $ 825 billion spending bill he hopes will lift the economy out of recession .
Obama met with Republican and Democratic leaders at the White House on Friday and planned to meet Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Tuesday in a bid to build consensus for the stimulus and bridge the partisan divide that has divided Washington for years .
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
He said in his radio address the economic recovery plan would save or create 3 million to 4 million jobs while investing in priorities like clean energy development , education and improving healthcare efficiency .
Obama said he intended to double the U.S. capacity to generate energy from renewable sources like wind , solar and biofuels , and also discussed building a new electricity grid with 3,000 miles ( 4,828 km ) of transmission lines .
“ We ’ll save taxpayers $ 2 billion a year by making 75 percent of federal buildings more energy efficient , and save the average working family $ 350 on their energy bills by weatherizing 2.5 million homes , ” Obama said .
The plan also includes a Clean Energy Financing Initiative with loan guarantees and other financing mechanisms that aim to encourage $ 100 billion in clean energy financing in three years , an aide said .
The president said the economic recovery program included funds to computerize the nation ’s health records in five years , which he said would save “ billions of dollars in health care costs and countless lives . ”
The recovery program includes what one aide said was “ the single largest investment in preventative health care in our nation ’s history ” to ensure people receive immunizations and get help to stop smoking and reduce obesity .
Officials did not place a dollar figure on the program .
Obama said the stimulus plan included financing to modernize or renovate 10,000 schools and provide grants for 4 million university students .
Funds also would be used to repair U.S. roadways and expand the country ’s mass transit systems , to provide better security at 90 major U.S. ports and to build more effective communications networks for police and other safety officials .
“ I know that some are skeptical about the size and scale of this recovery plan , ” Obama said .
He said to ensure accountability and transparency , the administration would post details of the spending programs on a website called recovery .gov .

Hi all , Quaid here .
It seems Slumdog Millionaire just can’t rack up enough kudos .
Now its D.P. , Anthony Dod Mantle , has picked up the feature film prize from the American Society of Cinematographers .
I have no clue if this award is an indicator for the Oscars , but since Slumdog has won top honors at the awards for SAG , the DGA and the WGA , I think it is 100 % the frontrunner this year .
In the Cinematography category this year , though , I ’d like to see Benjamin Button win , as it deserves it .
But that ’s about all I want that film to win .
I think we are probably gearing up for Oscar predictions at this point .
So why not start now ?
Feel free to leave some picks below , and let others tell you why you are wrong .
( CNN ) --
Plagued by record budget deficits and massive job losses , local and state officials are looking to the federal government for immediate help .
Construction was halted on a new roadway near Wilmington , Ohio , because of budget problems .
It sounds like an obvious statement given the daily onslaught of bad news coming from Wall Street .
But as the U.S. Senate debates the nearly $ 900 billion economic stimulus package before it this week , time is slipping away , and help can't come soon enough for politicians desperately trying to help their constituents .
Their message to Congress : Stop the partisan bickering and show us the money .
" Time is of the essence ... we have to get the money out as quickly as we can , " said Republican Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas during a meeting with President Obama in the Oval Office on Monday .
" I think we need to find some common ground .
We need to pass a bill that works . "
Watch how funding delays affect state and local governments »
Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , also a Republican , said Tuesday that while governors have virtually no say in what goes into the stimulus bill , Obama 's outreach to the nation 's governors is a power play to speed things along .
" What I think President Obama is trying to do is show that it is a bipartisan effort or to indirectly pressure the Congress in that regard , " Pawlenty said .
The demand on state services is causing budget deficits in nearly every state and city across the country and has officials trying to stop the hemorrhaging of jobs and falling tax revenue .

Governors , especially , are trying to keep their states from collapsing under the weight of the recession , and have taken their case to the top .
In early December , governors from across the country met with then - President - elect Obama during their annual National Governors Association meeting in Washington .
The governors asked for nearly $ 136 billion for " ready - to - go projects , " such as water and sewer projects or building roads and bridges .
They also want an additional $ 40 billion for Medicaid programs .
This week , the Senate took up debate on its version of the economic stimulus bill , which the president says will create up to 4 million jobs and reinvest money into infrastructure projects and social services like Medicaid and K - 12 education .
Last week , the House passed an $ 819 billion package that fell along party lines ; not a single Republican voted for it .
Watch more on the stimulus debate in Congress »
Douglas , who supports Obama 's economic package , said all governors can really do is anticipate what might come their way -- at least until the president is able to sign the bill into law .
" I anticipated a conservative amount from the recovery package , for Medicaid in particular .
If that does n't come out well , we 'll certainly make the adjustments .
It 'll be serious , draconian budget cuts , and that is n't right in a time when the American people are really hurting , " Douglas said after his meeting with the president .
" We 're not asking for a handout from the federal government .
We 're doing heavy lifting at the state level .
We need a good partnership , especially in these challenging times . "
For Douglas , the budgetary woes hit home .
" It 's not just a matter of the bigger picture or numbers , it 's really quite personal in many cases , " he said during a photo opportunity at the White House with Obama .
" On my floor alone in the office building where I work , four relatives of employees had lost their jobs in the last couple of weeks .
So this is a serious matter .
It 's the kind of recession that is deep . "
Obama on Monday pledged his full support for local and state officials trying to cope .
" Nobody understands this better than governors and mayors , county officials who are seeing the devastating effects on the ground of this economy , " he said .
" The recovery package that we are moving forward is designed to provide states relief , to make sure the people who are laid off from their jobs are still able to get unemployment insurance , still able to get health care , and that we are putting in place the infrastructure , rebuilding roads , bridges , waterways , other projects at the state levels that allow us to put people back to work . "
Pawlenty says more money needs to be allocated for more immediate projects like infrastructure rather than unnecessary spending like STD prevention and anti-smoking programs that were recently scrubbed from the Senate version of the bill .
" It 's gone [ stimulus spending ] into areas that I do n't think that many people would consider the most immediate , direct and timely stimulus , " he said .
" Most people agree that one reasonable aspect of the spending bill should be infrastructure like roads and bridges . "
Michigan 's Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm , whose state has been especially hard hit by the recession and the near - collapse of its auto industry , says job creation is paramount to turning the economy around .
" We see the impact of this every day , and I 'm speaking not just for Michigan , but for governors across the country .
We need help .
We need it now .
And it 's not about budgets , it 's about creating jobs in our states , " she said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union with John King .
Watch more of Granholm 's interview »
That sentiment is echoed by nearly every governor , as witnessed by an urgent statement put out by the Governors Association last week .
" States are facing fiscal conditions not seen since the Great Depression -- anticipated budget shortfalls are expected in excess of $ 200 billion .
To address these shortfalls and meet balanced budget requirements , states have begun taking action to cut government services or increase revenue .
Absent federal action , states will have to take even stronger actions that will make the recession more severe and slow the nation 's economic recovery , " the group said in a letter released January 27 .
The association says governors support key items of the stimulus package , including aid for private investment , job creation and federal support for Medicaid , education , infrastructure and help for small businesses .
It 's not just governors feeling the pinch on their states .
Mayors and other officials also are trying to cope with businesses closing , programs being cut and families being forced out of their homes .
Minnesota 's Senate has taken the budgetary breakdown to a new level by asking state residents to weigh in on where the money should go .
Residents can leave comments at http://budgetforum.senate.mn/
" This is an online community designed to invite you to contribute your ideas on the state budget .
Your ideas will help the Senate develop a budget that reflects the values and needs of our communities , " according to the Web site .
" In order to create a balanced budget for the next two years , we will need to consider all ideas and be creative in finding solutions .
All Minnesotans will need to be a part of the decision - making process . "
One place where especially tough decisions are taking place is New York City , the country 's financial hub .
On Friday , Mayor Michael Bloomberg , an independent , said the city may have to cut tens of thousands of jobs -- and increase the sales tax -- to deal with the city 's $ 4 billion budget shortfall for fiscal year 2009 that begins in July .
" We had prepared for a downturn , but I think it 's safe to say nobody prepared for the severity of the downturn that we have been experiencing , " Bloomberg said .
The Big Apple has faced a tougher time than most cities because the bulk of its economy depends on Wall Street viability .
The financial industry was rocked last year by the crisis in the credit industry and home mortgage meltdown , which led to the collapse of major investment houses and the loss of jobs
In other cities around the country , the cuts in jobs and proposed tax increases weigh heavily on vulnerable small businesses , a vital asset to a municipality 's economy .
On January 26 , Miami Mayor Manny Diaz , a Democrat , issued an urgent call to Congress asking it to help cities like his stay afloat .
" Mayors across America are very concerned about the small businesses in their communities who are unable to borrow the funds they need to keep their businesses operating , " he wrote in a letter to House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank , D - Massachusetts , and House Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel , D - New York .
That concern for businesses , working families and governments during the recession will undoubtedly pressure politicians in the nation 's capital to act fast .
They are beholden , after all , to the same constituents who are feeling the pinch -- and fear tomorrow could bring even more bad news .

NASA 's Constellation program , established in 2005 , continues its work toward the building the future of manned space exploration in the U.S.
The first test flight of the Ares I - X rocket - a functional mockup of the actual Ares I rocket , similar in shape and mass - is scheduled for July , 2009 .
The stimulus bill just passed by the U.S. Congress will be sending an additional $ 1 billion to NASA , $ 400 million of which is for its manned space program .
Engineers are now busy refitting old facilities , running tests , building the infrastructure and working towards a planned first launch of a crew to the International Space Station in 2014 .
Collected here are photographs of various parts of the Constellation program coming together , including parts of the Orion crew vehicle , the Ares I and Ares V rockets , and supporting systems .

A while back , my friend Michael contacted me , he said , “ I am sending you some “ shootpacks ” ( 18″x18 ″ )
The one condition is that you not mention my name or the supplier .
Because your setup is informal , they would not want to have their name connected with the testing since you do n’t have a NIJ - certified laboratory setup .
For your information , body armor material is designed to work when worn by a human .
Humans are compressible .
IIIA material will work when put on a person or over 4 ″ of ballistic clay , but if you just put IIIA material over concrete or over boards , it will fail . ”
Is this a great job or what !
The box contains Modeling Clay from Hobby Lobby .
I hung the armor over the front .
First 9 mm .
I shot 115 gr. JHP out of my Glock 34 .
It flattened it out on the third sheet .
The “ shoot pack ” had 28 sheets or layers .
Notice how it did not “ fill ” the hollow point , but just flattened it out .
This is the dent in the clay .
Then .45 ACP , Hydrashock JHP .
Again , it was flattened completely .
And notice the dent in the clay .
How about a .40 S&W ?
It was stopped in the second layer .
But it made a nasty dent .
We decided to try a round of 9 mm
Ball because that is most commonly used in the Sandbox .
Notice how it flattened out the ball .
This armor is n’t designed to stop rifle fire , but why not try the trusty AR15 ?
You can see that Tman has just hit the target and blown it up .
Notice the orange clip in the air .
How ’s that for a kill shot ?
We did n’t set this up , but look at the jacket laying in the hole .
How about 12 gauge 00 Buck ?
Here I am turning it loose .
It only penetrated 2 layers .
The pellets were caught between the second and third layers .
Well , what about a 12 gauge Slug ?
It penetrated several layers , but flattened out completely .
How about , as Gunny Highway said , “ The prefered weapon of our enemy ” , the 7.62 X 39 .
It went right through the armor , just as expected .
It only made a small entry .
But it was clear that there was a larger hole beneath .
So , I dug away the top layer , and this is what I found .
Ugly .
Lessons learned :
Level IIIA armor stopped the handgun bullets tested , just as designed .
Either JHPs or Ball .
Once again , “ Rifles are rifles and pistols are pistols ” .
Rifles went right through , just as expected .
The armor stopped 00 Buck and Rifled Slugs .
If your adversery is wearing armor , do n’t depend on pistols or shotguns .
Go for a rifle .
As Clint Smith says , “ The only purpose for a pistol is to fight your way back to the rifle you should have never laid down ” .
And , as always , shooting stuff is fun .
Thanks to Michael for the armor , and thanks to Tman for the photo help .
The Economist published a Buttonwood column entitled " In Praise of Volatility " in its January 17 , 2009 , which complements nicely the danger of low volatility described in The New York Times 's " Risk Mismanagement " ( more on that here ) - if you do n't remember the article in the Times , the danger is that models fed numbers with low volatility will assume this state of low fluctuations will continue into the future and put insufficient amounts of cash in reserve , although periods of extreme calm often precede ferocious crashes .
The Buttonwood columnist briefly mentions the well - publicized Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Bernard Madoff ( " Low volatility was a large part of Bernard Madoff 's appeal " ) , before connecting volatility aversion with the way fund managers ' performance is analyzed : since investors ' preferences on the matter are so well - known , it is tempting to game the system by creating fake low volatility , for instance by ( 1 ) investing in illiquid assets ( rarely re-valued , because rarely traded ) , ( 2 ) selecting small - gain strategies , which in the end tend to go wrong spectacularly , and wipe out the fund when they do ( in other words , the fund has a stellar track record until just before it goes out of business , which bears a striking similarity with what happened to the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous period ) , and ( 3 ) " resort[ing ] to fraud when things go wrong " , especially due to the pressure for companies to meet their quarterly forecasts .
The columnist argues that life is not linear , so people should make their peace with volatility ( " Markets do not rise at a steady pace and business conditions do not allow for a smooth rise in profits . " )
It of course leaves out a big part of the story , as one would expect given the limited amount of words the column has on the page .
Too many investors , starting during the heyday of the dot - com boom , have entered the market with their eyes on the ups without being able to stomach the downs .
If their neighbors made a good return on their investments , or at least professed to make one , they wanted in too .
That statement also applies to real estate , and people who did not have the means of becoming homeowners but did so anyway , fooled by the banks ' happy reassurances until their mortgage rates adjusted .
Just like Bernard Madoff 's investors , first - time homeowners and investors all longed to be part of the in -crowd .
( A Bethlehem resident who lost millions in the scheme described the situation as follows : " We 'd been on a waiting list for six months because he just did n't have room for new clients , and finally they accepted us .
We felt like we were entering an exclusive fraternity .
We felt lucky . "
[ Morning Call , December 16 , 2008 ] )
The situation is about more than telling people that volatility is a part of life , or warning some who really are averse to losses that they should n't invest in high - return instruments , because high returns come with high risks these investors can't afford .
In the country of self - made men , where stories abound of entrepreneurs retiring at 40 , investing in the stockmarket or owning a house is a sign of status , and people will believe almost anything to hang on to their dreams - the rules have changed , the house bubble wo n't burst , the prices will just keep on increasing forever , etc .
An older article in The Economist raises the issue of learning the lesson too well : will people stop on investing because of the amounts they lost in the stock market ?
( When the golden egg runs out , December 4 , 2008 ) The author argues that would be a mistake , using well - known arguments .
I particularly liked the following sentences : " The problem is that investors do not regard financial assets as they do other goods ; lower prices do not encourage them to buy more , but simply reduce their confidence .
Past returns are the main determinant of flows into the stockmarket ; investors buy when prices have gone up , not down . "
In the end , we are just one big pendulum , swinging from one extreme to the next with unbridled enthusiasm .
The problem is n't low volatility - it 's the herd mentality that sets in when people do n't understand what 's going on and yet do n't want to admit they do n't have a clue , hiding behind a crowd in the hope no one will notice their ignorance .
( If everyone is buying this stock , they must know something I do n't , right ? )
A lot of good it did .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Britain 's Royal Air Force scrambled a huge military transport plane to a remote island off the coast of Scotland to save twin babies born two months prematurely .
The operation began Sunday night when the hospital in Stornoway , in the Western Isles , requested a specialist pediatric team from Glasgow , Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman John Morton told CNN .
Initially , a Royal Navy Sea King helicopter was stripped to the bone to make room for the medical evacuation team and the two babies in incubators .
But wild weather hitting the island , off Scotland 's northwest coast , forced controllers at Aeronautical Rescue Coordination to send a C - 130 Hercules transport plane from the southern England , hundreds of miles away .
" We stripped out the inside of a Navy Sea King helicopter -- pulled out all the seats and equipment " to make room for the medical team and its equipment , and to bring down the weight of the aircraft , said Michael Mulford , a spokesman for British military search - and - rescue .
The Hercules could better handle the winds and is capable of carrying 42,000 pounds ( more than 19,000 kg ) in cargo and normally used for missions like dropping relief aid , Mulford said .
" They would be flying into heavy winds , " he said , adding the Sea King would have been near its weight limit with four medical staff and " one ton of equipment , " including two incubators .
" The Herc came from Lyneham in Wiltshire .
It flew 500 miles straight into Stornoway , " he said .
" It landed and waited until the two ambulances arrived , each with an incubator and baby . "
Three hours later , the plane lifted off again for the final leg of its flight , a 40 - minute trip to Glasgow , where the Scottish Ambulance Service met it with a specially designed neo-natal transport unit early Monday .
The whole operation took just under 12 hours and involved " quite probably 40 or 50 people working flat out for many hours , " Mulford said .
" It was a lot of effort by a lot of people , " he said .
" But no one complains about flying through some very difficult weather .
It was a chance at giving some very newborn babies a chance at life . "
The twins -- a boy and a girl who have not been identified due to patient - confidentiality laws -- are in stable condition , a National Health Service spokeswoman told CNN .
Major Oliver Luneau , a pilot with Armee de l'Air ( ALA ) , the French air force , who is serving with the RAF on an exchange program , told the UK Press Association he was proud to have been involved in the rescue .
A spokeswoman for the Western Isles Health Board told PA the mother , who had been around 27 weeks pregnant , was in " good health " following a normal delivery .

GENEVA / DAVOS , Switzerland ( Reuters ) - Hundreds of people rallied in Geneva and Davos Saturday to protest against the World Economic Forum , saying the elite gathered for it annual meeting are not qualified to fix the world ’s problems .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
Carrying banners reading ‘ You are the Crisis ’ and throwing snowballs , several hundred protesters marched to fences surrounding the heavily guarded Hotel Seehof in the Davos ski resort , where many world leaders and business people stay during the forum .
Protester Alex Heideger , a member of the Davos Green Party , said these were the people to blame for the economic mess .
“ It ’s the same people who came last year and said the world economic situation is fine , and now we ’re in a financial crisis .
Now it ’s the taxpayer who has to solve the whole problem .
“ It ’s people like you and me who have to pay for it with their tax money , ” he said .
In Geneva , where the WEF has its headquarters , police in riot gear fired tear gas and water canon to disperse a crowd that had gathered in a square near the train station , sending people running in all directions .
Witnesses said there did not appear to be any violence by the protesters .
The rally in the city ’s normally staid streets was not formally permitted by local authorities .
Geneva police spokesman Jean - Philippe Brandt said that about 60 people were detained temporarily for checks but there have been no arrests .
About 30 have been released and the rest are due to be released soon , he said .
“ There are small groups of people who are clashing with police but there have not been any injuries on one side or the other , ” Brandt said , saying there were also no reports of damage to buildings or businesses so far .
Florence Proton of ATTAC
Suisse , one of the Geneva organizers , said it was important for outside voices to be heard in debates about how to resolve the crisis .
“ The people meeting in Davos are the ones responsible for this economic crises that is becoming , and is now , global , ” she told Reuters , speaking in French .
How A Web Newspaper Should Be Built February 27 , 2009
Every day lately you read about newspapers in trouble or being shut down .
The old model of news + ads + printing + delivery simply does n't work in the current webified world .
Many existing newspaper companies are trying to be on the web with limited ( financial ) success while they continue to live in the old world as well .
It 's not going to work .
So what should a web newspaper be like ?
Let 's go back to what a newspaper is for .
I the reader want to know what is happening around me , around the region , around the nation , around the world .
I do n't have time or expertise or contacts to do it myself .
I want to know if Mayor Quimby is spending my tax dollar on hookers , what the politicians are doing to my wallet , how my local teams are faring and how the world is screwing up again .
Somewhere someone has to dig into these stories , get the facts , write them up and get paid for the work .
Then whatever of this information I am interested in needs to get to me .
That in a nutshell is what I want .
I do n't want to see ads unless its something I am interested in .
I do n't want to go to 100 different sites to read the articles .
I do n't want to see things I am not interested in until I become so .
I want to get news and information from specific places or categories or keywords and change them whenever it suits me .
I want my news my way and entirely in one place .
I 'm willing to pay 25 ¢ per day for this .
That does n't sound like enough money to support a bloated newspaper company with printers and ink and trucks and delivery people and ad salesmen and massive infrastructure .
It 's is n't and it should n't be .
First forget print and delivery .
Second forget everything but reporting and media and editorial .
Third forget redundancy and overlap .
Fourth forget web access .
Finally forget ads unless they are content .
This is the model for what a " newspaper " system should be .
The top layer organization can be local , city , state , regional , national , specialized , whatever .
They gather news and generate content .
They range in size from the neighborhood gossiper to international in scope .
All they have is reporters and media ( photography etc ) and editors , computers and maybe some vehicles .
They create this content at whatever pace makes sense .
There are no deadlines .
When it 's done it 's ships .
But where to ?
Thats what an aggregator is for .
The industry defines a standard content format ( XML or whatever ) for content , media and meta -data .
Everyone makes all content ( note all content not headlines and snippets ) available to the aggregator on a continuous basis ( when it 's ready ) .
The aggregator saves everything , indexes everything , and keeps track of everything , and manages whatever the payment arrangement is ( page views whatever ) .
So how do I read all this ?
That 's what a displayer is for ( note this can be the same company as the aggregator but does n't have to , just define a standard API ) .
The displayer provides a new ajax web interface for me to read .
It provides complete controls for me to determine what I want to see .
I am in control of everything I see .
There are no ads unless they are content ( such as local Craigslist ads for lawnmowers in my zip ) .
I see a nicely organized set of synopsis's of articles available with controls and filters .
When I want to see a whole article it expands in the same space .
Then when I am done it closes up and the page adjusts .
I can change the layout and filters at any time .
I can save preset views at any time ( National , Baseball , Mongolian Sheep Herders , whatever ) .
I 'm willing to pay 25 ¢ per day for this .
Not enough you say ?
With 400,000 subscribers to this " newspaper " paying 25 ¢ per day that comes to $ 36,500,000 per year .
Remember that covers no printing , no deliverly , basically nothing but paying news reporting outfits , servers and bandwidth .
Instead of 10,000 newspapers all over the country ( much less the world ) you have 10,000 news reporting outfits who have little to do but gather news and collect payments .
How the payment system is defined of course is important and probably should be based on some formula like # readers or other measurable criteria .
Of course this means that traditional newspaper companys and media conglomerates go away .
You can't have thousands of aggregators or it defeats the purpose .
You could have more viewers to allow for different user experiences but the aggregator is really a utility , a proverbial series of tubes .
This whole scenario is exactly what I want .
Will I ever see it ?
Probably not .
Existing media companies want to hold on to their content , their image , their brands , their printing plants , all the way to complete ruin .
It would take some money , but more importantly some real balls to convince the media companies to downsize and agree on a common delivery format and payment system that works for everyone from Global News Monsters to the local gossiper .
If I had money ( I do n't ) and time ( not without money ) I 'd find this a fascinating thing to work on .
The biggest need is the might to roll the whole industry up , which clearly one person not named Steve Jobs simply does n't have .
If this does happen as a Phoenix out of the ashes of the newspaper industry I am ready with my quarter .
I am not holding my breath .
And now , let ’s look at the .nanorc file .
Here , i’ll go through the .nanorc config file , try to explain parts of it and set the syntax highlight on .
See the first part for shortcuts .
You can use the sample nanorc from / usr / share / nano / , a copy from / etc / nanorc , or even from the sample nanorc in /usr / share / doc / nano / examples / .
A blank one is just fine too .
If in doubt , do nano - V to see if it was compiled with the proper flags .
here ’s mine :
nano -V
GNU nano version 2.0.4 ( compiled 12:23:22 , Jun 22 2007 )
Email : nano@nano-editor.org
Web : http://www.nano-editor.org/
Compiled options : –disable -wrapping-as-root –enable - color –enable-multibuffer –enable - nanorc –enable-utf8
auto indent : ( Meta - I ) to toggle
set autoindent
so the next line starts after the same number of spaces / tabs as the previous line .
nano does n’t know how to properly indent code lines .
brackets :
set brackets " " ' ) > ] } "
to be able to justify paragraphs after one of those characters .
Use ctrl+j to justify the paragraph , meta+j to justify all the file , and ctrl+u to undo the justification
Match Brackets
set matchbrackets " ( ] } "
use meta+altgr+9 ( i.e meta + ] ) to switch between the matching brackets
Remove empty first line ( Meta - O ) to toggle
set morespace
as said in the manual : “ Use the blank line below the titlebar as extra editing space . ”
Hide the help shortcuts at the bottom ( Meta - X )
set nohelp
“ Do n’t display the help lists at the bottom of the screen . ”
Mouse support ( Meta-M )
set mouse
Well , i’m still giving a 2nd change , because it ’s not that useful .
With it enable , nano will allow you to move the cursor , set a mark ( see below ) and use the helpful shortcut list at the bottom .
To use the mark , double click and drag , or double click and move the cursor with the arrow keys .
You can them , cut ( ctrl+k ) , and to paste it , ctrl+u .
Those are the good things .
the bad , it wo n’t let you middle click and thus paste things into the current position inside the editor .
Also , copying text with the mouse to use outside the editor is disabled .
So basicly , we get a more featured editor , but with less integration with the surrounding environment .
Completely useless in text mode .
If only it had the ability to scroll up / down with the mouse wheel …
Allow multibuffer ( Meta-F )
set multibuffer
This is actually extremely useful .
If this option is n’t active , the crtl+r ( read file )
just adds the file into the same buffer .
With it , it opens a new buffer !
You can cicle through the buffers with Meta + < and Meta + >
set smooth
Text will scroll line - by - line , instead of the usual chunk - by - chunk behaviour .
Save automatically on exit ( without prompt )
set tempfile
Although this might seen a time - saver , beware to not enable this on a normal user .
When enabled , if nano opens a file which the user does n’t have permission and modifies it , nano wo n’t ask for the option to not save it , and thus you ’ll be stuck inside nano forever ! :P
( you can ofc , save it on a proper directory : / home / you / thatevilfile )
Aparently , the bug is said to be fixed on the version2 , but i guess not quite .
i’ve to check upon that …
Next the include files for the syntax highlighting .
just comment the include lines you ’ll think wont be useful .
i ’m using this ones :
## Nanorc files

they are a collection taken from the gentoo foruns .

That ’s all for now ..
Hope you ’ll find it useful to bring more “ shiningness ” to your nano .
A jaguar was caught and collared with a satellite tracking device for the first time ever in Arizona on Feb. 18 , 2009 .
The once - common jaguar has become a rare sight in North America , thanks to hunting and habitat fragmentation .
Now two were spotted in exceedingly rare and unrelated events this month .
The Arizona Game and Fish Department caught and collared a wild jaguar in Arizona for the first time , officials said Thursday .
While a handful of the big cats have been photographed by automatic cameras in recent years , the satellite tracking collar will now help biologists learn more about this animal 's range .
Meanwhile , a jaguar was spotted in central Mexico for the first time in a century .
Scientists photographed the cat with an automatic camera set alongside a trail thought to be frequented by the spotted felines .
Jaguars ( Panthera onca ) once ranged from southern South America to the southern United States .
By the late 1900s , none were thought to exist north of Mexico , but two independent sightings in 1996 confirmed jaguars still reached as far north as Arizona and New Mexico .
Remote cameras have also photographed jaguars in the Amazon .
The species has been protected outside of the United States under the Endangered Species Act since 1973 .
That protection was extended to jaguars in the United States in 1997 , the year after their presence here was confirmed .
Details of the sightings below .
{{ video = " LS_121508 _CatWalk " title= " How Cats Walk and Stalk " caption =
" Unlike dogs and humans , cats do n't conserve energy when they move . "
}}
The Arizona cat
The male cat in Arizona was captured southwest of Tucson during a study aimed at monitoring habitat connectivity for mountain lions and black bears .
The healthy beast weighed in at 118 pounds with a thick and solid build .
Satellite tracking showed the cat traveled more than 3 miles from the capture site in the first day after its release , officials said .
" While we did n't set out to collar a jaguar as part of the mountain lion and bear research project , we took advantage of an important opportunity , " said Terry Johnson , endangered species coordinator for the Arizona Game and Fish Department .
" More than 10 years ago , Game and Fish attempted to collar a jaguar with no success .
Since then , we 've established handling protocols in case we inadvertently captured a jaguar in the course of one of our other wildlife management activities . "
Biologists are trying to determine if the collared jaguar is Macho B , a male cat that has been photographed by trail cameras periodically over the past 13 years .
In 1997 , a team was established in Arizona and New Mexico to protect and conserve the species .
The Jaguar Conservation Team ( JCT ) began working with Mexico two years later , recognizing that the presence of jaguars in the United States depends on the conservation of the species in Mexico .
Interestingly , the project set up to do all this is funded by Arizona Lottery ticket sales .
The Mexico cat
No jaguars had been spotted in central Mexico since the start of the 20th century .
Scientists trying to find footprints , excrement or any other signs of the jaguars had in recent years interviewed residents , none of whom had ever seen one .
Nonetheless , the researchers now report having obtained three photographs of a male jaguar and ten excrement samples that have been attributed to the jaguar , said Octavio Monroy - Vilchis of Autonomous University of the State of Mexico .
In a statement , researchers explained there are 15 areas in Mexico in which it is unknown whether jaguars still exist , whether their populations are stable , and if their habitat is adequate .
These areas are important for scientific studies , because they could include crucial zones for the felines ' long - term survival .
" The photographs provide information about new recording sites , and allow us to deduce that the area where the animal was observed may be a corridor connecting jaguar populations , " Monroy - Vilchis said .
Largest cats
Jaguars are the only cats in North America that roar .
They 're considered the largest cats in the Western Hemisphere .
Adults commonly weigh up to 211 pounds ( 96 kg ) , though 300 - pounders have been reported .
In the northern range they typically weigh between 80 - 120 pounds , however .
Females breed year - round and have litters of one to four cubs that stay with their mother for nearly two years .
Jaguars can live in several types of forest , grassland and dry habitat .
They prey on a variety of animals , including fish , birds and reptiles .
The largest contiguous area of habitat now remaining for jaguars centers in the Amazon Basin .
You 've probably never heard of Picsel Technologies , but the Scottish company claims that its technologies are in over 250 m handsets worldwide from manufacturers like Motorola , Nokia , Palm , Samsung and Sony Ericsson -- and , if a lawsuit it filed today is to be believed , Apple .
Picsel says the iPhone infringes on a patented method of accelerated screen updating , and as usual , the answer is probably going to be for Uncle Steve to open his $ 25 billion piggy bank and dole out some cash .
On the other hand , Apple legal might take a little batting practice before they start hunting the big game , but honestly , that 's just us wishing for a little Friday night drama .
HOW to explain another week of bail - outs , billion - dollar losses and brutal bank sell - offs ?
Last week , the Irish government announced the full nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank , the country 's third - largest lender .
Early this week the British government unveiled a potpourri of measures to stimulate lending , including a guarantee scheme designed to protect banks against losses on bad assets and an increase in its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) to 70 % .
Markets worry that Barclays may also need state support .
On Tuesday January 20th , the French government agreed to provide another € 10.5 billion ( $ 13.6 billion ) of capital to its biggest lenders .
After its predecessor hastily pumped more money into Bank of America last week , the new American administration is working on fresh plans to immunise banks from the effects of their infected assets .
The Danes have also reached into their pockets again .
This burst of action comes just weeks after governments shored up the banking system with capital injections and sweeping guarantees for depositors and creditors .
Despite howls of protest , that money was not wasted .
The assurance that governments will not let important lenders fail continues to keep the fear of bank runs and bankruptcies at bay .
In marked contrast to the pounding that their shares have taken since the start of the year , credit - default - swap spreads on bank debt have remained relatively static .
Since the fall of Lehman Brothers , default risk appears to have largely shifted from the banks to the governments that back them .
That leaves two puzzles .
If governments have restored confidence in the banks ' ability to survive , why the renewed rush to intervene ?
And if governments continue to demonstrate support for the banks , why are n't shareholders also rejoicing ?
The answer to both questions lies in concerns that not enough credit is flowing .
Bankers themselves deny the charge that they are hoarding capital .
Jamie Dimon , the boss of JPMorgan Chase , told investors last week that his bank “ was making loans all the time ” .
Analysts at Credit Suisse reckon that British banks have increased their balance - sheets since June .
The problem is that even if individual institutions manage to grow their books , there is still a huge gap in financing capacity to fill .
Analysts at Citigroup reckon that domestic banks provided only half of the credit available to British households and companies in early 2008 , for example .
Foreign lenders are under pressure to focus on their home markets .
Last week America 's Treasury asked the banks in which it has injected capital to provide monthly reports on their lending activity : it is safe to assume that officials are more interested in loan growth at home than they are abroad .
Corporate - bond markets are much livelier than they were but other non-bank sources of finance , such as the securitisation market , remain stagnant .
Replacing this lost capacity would be tough at the best of times .
Right now , it is nigh on impossible .
Demand for credit is lower , as companies and consumers retrench .
Losses are surging as the economic climate worsens .
Regions Financial , an American regional bank , reported a record $ 6.2 billion quarterly loss on Tuesday on souring property loans .
Structured products still have the capacity to wound .
Shares in KBC , a Belgian bank , plummeted by more than half between January 15th and 20th on concerns that it would take big write - downs on corporate CDOs ( collateralised - debt obligations ) .
Even staid custody banks are finding unpleasant ways to surprise : shares in State Street lost almost 60 % of their value on Tuesday as it announced hefty losses on bond investments , among other things .
In these circumstances , the natural ( and sensible ) inclination of banks is to hold on to capital , not to run it down further by ramping up lending .
Hence the renewed efforts by governments to free up banks ' balance - sheets .
Hence , too , the violent sell - offs in many bank shares , as shareholders realise that the price of further intervention may be widespread dilution .
Public ownership may be unpalatable to many but it is just as difficult politically for governments to keep injecting money into banks without wiping out their owners .
Tactically , too , the approach of injecting capital in the form of preferred shares rather than common equity , has its limits .
The British government converted its preferred shares in RBS into ordinary shares on Monday because the former required such hefty dividend payouts .
America 's capital injections to date have imposed less onerous terms , but its banks still need a reasonable level of common equity to act as a credible first defence against losses .
With share prices so low , any more capital - raising is bound to be hugely dilutive ( thereby reinforcing the urge to sell ) .
It may not be imminent or desirable but the spectre of nationalisation haunts the sector .
Blackwater to change name to ' Xe ' Associated Press
Published : Friday February 13 , 2009
Print This Email This RALEIGH , N.C. - Blackwater Worldwide is abandoning its tarnished brand name .
Blackwater officials said Friday its family of two dozen business will now operate under the name Xe ( zee ) , pronounced like the letter " z. "
The decision comes as part of an ongoing rebranding effort that grew more urgent following a September 2007 shooting in Iraq that left at least a dozen civilians dead .
Blackwater president Gary Jackson said in a memo to employees the new name reflects the change in company focus away from the business of providing private security .

Google Earth has proven useful for a plethora of things — finding your house from space , checking out islands in the Pacific Ocean , and now , finding massive fields of weed .
At least that 's what happened in Switzerland , when Swiss police managed to come across a " large marijuana plantation " while using Google 's popular software .
( We 'll pause while fans of Mary Jane fire up Google Earth . )
Swiss police say that the marijuana field was discovered in Thurgau sometime last year while they were investigating a suspected drug ring .
Officers were apparently trying to use Google Earth to locate the exact address of two farmers they suspected of being involved in the ring , and came across the two - acre - large planation hidden in a field of corn in the process .
" It was an interesting chance discovery , " Zurich police 's specialist narcotics unit Norbert Klossner told the Associated Press .
No kidding .
The investigation had already yielded the seizure of 1.2 tons of hash and the arrest of 16 people .
The criminal investigation targeting the 16 suspects ( which we presume to include the two farmers ) is scheduled to wrap up in February , and Prosecutor Gabi Alkalay said that she plans to ask for prison sentences for all involved .
The police did n't acknowledge whether they did anything to the field they found , but we think it 's safe to say that it will probably soon disappear from Google Earth if it has n't already .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama forecast the biggest U.S. deficit since World War
Two in a budget on Thursday that urges a costly overhaul of the healthcare system and would spend billions to arrest the economy ’s freefall .
An eye - popping $ 1.75 trillion deficit for the 2009 fiscal year underlined the heavy blow the deep recession has dealt to the country ’s finances as Obama unveiled his first budget .
That is the highest ever in dollar terms , and amounts to a 12.3 percent share of the economy -- the largest since 1945 .
In 2010 , the deficit would dip to a still - huge $ 1.17 trillion , Obama predicted .
With that backdrop , his budget represents a gamble that Americans are ready for the sort of change they embraced by electing him in November -- a shift of wealth through higher taxes on the rich to pay for more government attention to healthcare , education , climate change and social programs .
The coming fight with Congress -- where the Republican opposition quickly opened fire on the plan -- will show whether Americans weary of paying for a raft of expensive bailouts for banks and the car industry can get on board with more hefty doses of big government .
Obama , a Democrat , promised to get the red ink under control even as he planned new spending priorities that veered sharply away from the policies of his Republican predecessor President George W. Bush .
“ I do n’t think that we can continue on our current course .
I work for the American people , and I ’m determined to bring the change that the people voted for last November , ” said Obama , who took office on January 20 .
Republicans condemned the plan as showing a dedication to “ tax - and - spend ” policies , presaging major political fights getting the budget passed .
“ I think we just ought to admit we ’re broke .
We ca n’t continue to pile debt on the backs of our kids and grandkids , ” said John Boehner , leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives .
The cost of extra borrowing to pay for the record budget deficit pushed U.S. stocks and government debt prices down on Thursday .
The budget ’s healthcare plans delivered a hit to shares in health insurers and drugmakers .
WORRIES OVER SPENDING
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat , praised Obama ’s spending priorities and chided Republicans for what she saw as their new found interest in limited government .
“ Perhaps ... they ( the Republicans ) have amnesia , ” Pelosi said , noting that with Bush at the helm they turned budget surpluses into deficits , in part through significantly higher government spending .
But some analysts questioned whether Obama ’s goals were realistic at a time when the economy is still in crisis and the surging deficits threaten to burden a future recovery .
“ There are some good things in this budget but a lot still seems very wasteful .
The market is crumbling around us and economies are in the tank , ” said Dan Cook , senior market analyst with IG Markets in Chicago .
Obama sought to push ahead with a campaign promise of expanding healthcare to the 46 million people who are uninsured in the United States .
His budget includes a 10 - year , $ 634 billion reserve fund to help pay for the president ’s proposed healthcare reforms -- much of it paid for by raising taxes on those earning more than $ 250,000 a year .
The budget also raises the possibility of more than doubling the government ’s aid to the battered financial sector .
The administration put in a “ placeholder ” to buy as much as $ 750 billion of assets from financial firms , which have been nearly crippled by an overhang of bad mortgage debt .
Assuming one - third is lost , the ultimate cost to taxpayers would be $ 250 billion , the budget said .

Obama has not decided whether to seek that money , but if he does , it would come on top of an existing $ 700 billion financial bailout program , which has been unpopular with many Americans who see it as rewarding Wall Street bankers who made risky bets on mortgages securities .
The proposed $ 3.55 trillion spending blueprint for the 2010 fiscal year that begins October 1 provides the broad outlines of a more detailed one to be released in April .
While Obama has broad support since Congress is controlled by Democrats , he could face a fight -- including among fiscal conservatives in his own party -- about spending goals .
The deficit figure reinforced concerns the government will need to sell record amounts of debt to pay for programs aimed at pulling the economy out of a deep recession .

Obama set a goal of slashing the deficit to $ 533 billion , or 3 percent of GDP by 2013 .
A rollback of the Bush tax cuts for wealthy Americans and a planned drawdown of U.S. troops from Iraq are expected to help rein in the shortfall .
WAR SPENDING
Obama is seeking an additional $ 75.5 billion for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan for the rest of the current fiscal year .
He is requesting $ 130 billion for military operations in the two wars for 2010 , which would be down from the roughly $ 140 billion he expects will be needed this year .
Washington spent about $ 190 billion on the wars in 2008 .
Obama looks likely to order U.S. combat troops to withdraw from Iraq over about 18 months , according to U.S. officials .
At the same time , he is ramping up the military effort in Afghanistan .
Obama ’s budget proposal lays out spending cuts in farm subsidies and other areas to meet the deficit - reduction goal .
[ ID:nN262396 ] .
But such programs are popular with lawmakers -- both Republicans and Democrats -- from states with big agricultural sectors who may be loath to allow cuts .
The budget includes billions in revenues , starting in 2012 , from a greenhouse gas emissions trading system .
That is central to Obama ’s proposals to fight global warming , which are a major departure from the policies of Bush , who was widely criticized by environmentalists for resisting action .
The $ 85 - billion U.S. college student loan business reeled from a budget proposal to axe the giant federally guaranteed student loan program .
In a major shift that severely undercut shares in top student lender Sallie Mae , the budget called for moving most student lending into the direct - loan program run by the U.S. Education Department .
The $ 1.75 trillion budget deficit forecast for this year reflects shortfalls accumulated under Bush as well as new spending proposals under the $ 787 billion economic stimulus package Obama signed earlier this month .
While Obama is still basking in high approval ratings from the U.S. public , his stimulus package and other efforts to revitalize the economy have done little to win over Wall Street .
U.S. stocks prices hit 12 - year lows this week .
“ We are making our steel at four mills instead of six , ” said John Armstrong , a spokesman for the United States Steel Corporation , adding that two mills were recently idled and the four still operating are running at less than full capacity .
“ The third quarter was one of the best in U.S. Steel ’s history , ” Mr. Armstrong added .
“ And it has been a very precipitous drop from there . ”
The cutback has been particularly hard on workers at the big integrated mills like those at U.S. Steel and Arcelor Mittal USA , with their blast furnaces and coke ovens converting iron ore and other materials into steel .
Operated at less than full capacity , these mills are less efficient than the equally large “ minimills , ” like Nucor , whose electric arc furnaces can be operated efficiently at lower speeds .
So the plant closings have been mostly at the integrated mills , whose 50,000 workers  roughly 40 percent of the nation ’s steelworkers  are represented by the United Steelworkers .
The union says that early this year it expects 20,000 workers to be on furlough .
Ten thousand already have been .
Kathleen Loepker , a millwright and mechanic , is among the most recent to join their ranks .
She was laid off on Dec. 19 from the U.S. Steel plant in Granite City , Ill. , which shut , putting more than 2,000 employees out of work .
With nearly 30 years seniority , Ms. Loepker , 48 , has worked through bankruptcies , union concessions and consolidations during which her mill was acquired by U.S. Steel in 2003 .
Her income today is tied more to incentive bonuses than in the past .
On layoff , she is collecting $ 20 an hour , which is 80 percent of her base pay of $ 25.12 an hour .
That base pay , rather than rising significantly , is fattened by incentive bonuses tied to amounts of steel produced and to profits .
It had been averaging an additional $ 7 an hour  money now gone until the mill reopens .
1. Elizabethtown ( Kirsten Dunst )
Ah , the Manic Pixie Dream Girl , that sentient ray of sunshine sent from heaven to warm the heart and readjust the attitude of even the broodiest , most uptight male protagonist .
In his My Year Of Flops entry on Elizabethtown , Nathan Rabin coined the phrase " Manic Pixie Dream Girl " to describe that bubbly , shallow cinematic creature that " exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer - directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures . "
In Elizabethtown , Kirsten Dunst plays the archetypal Manic Pixie Dream Girl , a flirty , flighty chatterbox stewardess who razzles and dazzles brooding sensitive guy Orlando Bloom .
Coked up , or merely high on life ?
You be the judge .
Though Dunst in Elizabethtown and Natalie Portman in Garden State epitomize the contemporary Manic Pixie Dream Girl , the strangely resilient archetype has its roots in the nutty dames of screwball comedy .
For every era , there 's a Manic Pixie Dream Girl perfectly suited to the times .
2. I Love You , Alice B. Toklas ( Leigh Taylor - Young )
Like the Magical Negro , the Manic Pixie Dream Girl archetype is largely defined by secondary status and lack of an inner life .
She 's on hand to lift a gloomy male protagonist out of the doldrums , not to pursue her own happiness .
In the late '60s and early ' 70s , MPDGs often took the comely form of spacey hippie chicks burdened with getting grim establishment types to kick back and smell the flowers .
In that respect , they mirrored mainstream culture 's simultaneous suspicion and fascination with the open sexuality of the emergent counterculture .
With the help of pot-laced brownies , I Love You , Alice B. Toklas ' groovy free spirit Leigh Taylor - Young helps transform uptight Jew Peter Sellers from a stone - cold square to a swinging proponent of free love and sense derangement .
But what does Taylor - Young ultimately want ?
As is usual with Manic Pixie Dream Girls , the filmmakers do n't seem to have given the matter much thought .
3. Garden State ( Natalie Portman )
Pharmaceutical companies have made billions peddling antidepressants to twentysomething white people who are , like , totally stressin ' over people not appreciating them enough .
Zach Braff did similarly well peddling two unusual but no less popular antidepressants in Garden State : The Shins and Natalie Portman .
Braff 's character is completely transformed when the latter introduces him to the former in a doctor 's waiting room , with the plucky , annoying promise , " It 'll change your life , I swear . "
Of course , anything sounds profound coming from such a dreamy woman .
Oh , Natalie , your unconventional ways are so inspiring , and your beauty is surprisingly non-threatening !
In Garden State , she 's a loveably eccentric little angel in the body of a smokin ' - hot goddess , spreading good cheer and tuneful indie rock to depressed boys everywhere .
4. Butterflies Are Free ( Goldie Hawn )
Hawn began her acting career playing the ditz on TV comedies like Good Morning World and Laugh - In , but by the end of the '60s , her bubble - headed persona became less a figure of fun and more a love - generation ideal .
She was the uncomplicated free spirit , unduly hassled by the establishment .
Hawn won an Oscar for bringing that character to film in 1969's Cactus Flower , and then in 1972 's Butterflies Are Free , she played a happy hippie who helps blind lawyer Edward Albert learn to live on his own and stand up to his fretful , frightful mother .
Hawn 's boyfriend does n't care for her friendship with Albert , but what can he do ?
Hawn is a butterfly , man .

5. Almost Famous ( Kate Hudson )
In Cameron Crowe 's gilded memories of being a teenage rock critic on assignment for Rolling Stone magazine , his protagonist 's muse is an idealistic groupie named Penny Lane .
With blinkered idealism , the boy - critic gets all starry - eyed at her visions of the power of music , the freedom of life on the road , and the fantasy of staying young and beautiful forever .
Even though Penny 's incandescent charisma gets tarnished by that sex she claims she is n't having , not to mention an overdose that might not have been accidental , Crowe 's stand - in has been transformed enough to defend her version of rock ' n ' roll against the cynicism , infighting , and weariness of the band who wo n't return her devotion .
6. Joe Versus The Volcano ( Meg Ryan )
Ryan plays three roles in 1990's Joe Versus The Volcano , only one of whom is a self - described " flibbertigibbet " ( a sort of antiquated version of the MPDG ) .
But since all Ryan 's characters are aspects of the same dream woman , they all sport a little flibber .
Their collective goal ?
To get mopey , nebbishy Tom Hanks to overcome his fears — including his concern that he 's about to die from a fatal " brain cloud " — and enjoy life for a change .
But if Hanks does n't make it out of the film alive , no worries .
The chipper , ever - life - altering Ryan will be waiting for him in Sleepless In Seattle and You 've Got Mail , too .

7. The Apartment ( Shirley MacLaine )
All Jack Lemmon wants to do is ascend the corporate ladder , even if that means loaning his bosses his terrific bachelor pad for their illicit trysts .
Then one day he comes home to find that the peppy elevator operator he likes is lying comatose on his sofa , feeling suicidal after an affair gone wrong .
He nurses her back to health and she turns his life upside down , talking a blue streak until she convinces him to adjust his values .
This kind of troubled , worldly , yet surprisingly ebullient character became Shirley MacLaine 's stock in trade throughout the late ' 50s and early ' 60s , in films like Some Came Running and Two For The Seesaw .
Three years after 1960's The Apartment , she reunited with Lemmon and director Billy Wilder for Irma La Douce , in which she played the ultimate MPDG : a prostitute who corrupts the policeman trying to save her from the streets .
8. Bringing Up Baby ( Katharine Hepburn )
For the bulk of her career , Katharine Hepburn played strong - willed patrician types who defied convention , but still maintained a baseline gravity .
But in Howard Hawks ' 1938 screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby , Hepburn let gravity go , playing a giggly , scatterbrained heiress who torments stuffy scientist Cary Grant with her crazy demands and pet leopard .
By the end of the film , Hepburn has turned Grant as nutty as she is , and as they hang from a crumbling dinosaur skeleton , he confesses that following her manic whims has led to the best day of his life .
[ pagebreak ]
9 . What 's Up , Doc? ( Barbra Streisand )
In Peter Bogdanovich 's 1972 homage to Bringing Up Baby and Looney Tunes cartoons , Streisand plays a pesky chatterbox who endeavors to help dreary musicologist Ryan O'Neal get the grant he 's after , but instead succeeds in driving a wedge between O'Neal and his fiancée , and getting him embroiled in espionage and jewel thievery .
Streisand 's character never really has any plausible motivation :
She 's just an anarchic change agent , pitched halfway between a screwball heroine and a cartoon character .
Yet after spending a weekend with her , O'Neal is in a better place financially , romantically , and career - wise .
Funny how things work out .
10 . Annie Hall ( Diane Keaton )
The grand champion of the MPDG fighting league , '70s division , just might be Diane Keaton as the title character in Woody Allen 's most good - natured film .
The fact that she pulled this off in a world that let Goldie Hawn run around loose is just a further testament to how completely Keaton filled out the role of what otherwise could have been a shallow wish - fulfillment fantasy .
Her character certainly does have wish - fulfillment elements .
But while it's hard to believe such a woman could exist , it 's very easy to believe that if she did , she'd be a perfect match for Allen 's prototypically nebbishy character , Alvy Singer .
If ever there was a comedian who needed to lighten up , it was him , and if there was ever a woman who could make him do it with just a " la - di- dah , " it was her .
11 . Breakfast At Tiffany 's ( Audrey Hepburn )
In Truman Capote 's short novel Breakfast At Tiffany's , Holly Golightly is a sexually adventurous woman who jumps from man to man , living off the gifts she extorts from them , and changing casually with the seasons .
In the film version , Audrey Hepburn plays Holly as a chaste party girl who shares her opinions easily , but keeps her affections to herself ( and her cat ) .
Nevertheless , Hepburn - Holly charms writer George Peppard to such an extent that he 's able to give up the rich older woman who helps subsidize his work , and instead offer his devotion to his erratic dream woman — who improbably , in contradiction to Capote 's book , accepts .
12 . Something Wild ( Melanie Griffith )
Straitlaced corporate drone Jeff Daniels desperately needs some screws loosened :
His life sucks , and his family is suffocating him .
But in the movies , there 's always a MPDG around to show the buttoned - up bores how to live .
In this case , it 's crazy Lulu— later transformed into demure Audrey — who kidnaps him and pushes him into a road trip , complete with assumed identities and murderous mobsters .
For a generation of young urban professionals , the indelible image of Griffith ripping her tank top apart while straddling a mortified but excited Daniels forever defined what kind of mania they wanted to see in their pixie dream girls .

13 . Sweet November ( Charlize Theron )
Terminally ill Earth mother Charlize Theron makes things easy for uptight business - dude Keanu Reeves in 2001 's Sweet November , an appropriately maudlin remake of the 1968 tearjerker .
She enters Reeves ' life , imbues it with meaning , then leaves , saving her new beau from the agony of watching her perish .
Theron promises to change Reeves ' life in a single month , and through highs , lows , and rampant quirkiness , she does just that .
By the time she 's exited his life , he 's regained his joie de vivre and has been blessed with a haunted , vulnerable look that will be catnip to future MPDGs looking for a man to inspire .
14 . Autumn In New York ( Winona Ryder )
See above .
Joan Chen 's directorial debut , Autumn
In New York , is a strange cross between Sweet November and the culture - clash square - dude - meets - hippie - chick romantic subgenre of the Woodstock era .
In 2000 's Autumn In New York , the square dude in question is uptight businessman Richard Gere , and the charming minx who breathes life into his sorry existence and reawakens his libido is delightful pixie / crazy free spirit Winona Ryder , who , like Theron , nurses the tragic secret that she 's terminally ill .
They live , they love , and then that whole tragic - early - death thing enters the equation .
Bummer city .
15 . The Last Kiss ( Rachel Bilson )
Noted MPDG magnet Zach Braff went to the wedding in the pivotal scene of The Last Kiss soaked through with 30s ennui , and with the oppressive , leaden weights of adulthood , responsibility , and attractive , utterly devoted girlfriend Jacinda Barrett hanging around his neck .
Clearly , he needed an escape from his prison of a life .
Trailed by a cloud of flowing brunette hair , in walks Rachel Bilson , a chatty , smiley , flirty college student who is actually so diminutive that she 's technically a regulation - size pixie .
They laugh , they chat , they exchange meaningful glances , and Braff discovers that she 's everything his girlfriend is n't : short , 22 years old , and carefree .
Unfortunately , Bilson is also manic , and her mania does n't surface until after they have sex in her dorm room , once Braff 's regret is in full , watery - eyed bloom .
16 . My Sassy Girl ( Elisha Cuthbert )
We 're speculating here , since this forthcoming MPDG movie is currently only available in trailer form , but if there were an assembly line for Manic Pixie Dream Girls — and there probably is somewhere — Elisha Cuthbert went straight from the manufacturing facility and onto a subway railing to be saved by Jesse Bradford in My Sassy Girl .
From the endearing way she slaps him without provocation to the adorable voices she seems to hear in her head , Cuthbert puts the " charming " in " charmingly mentally impaired . "
She 's just the dash of acute manic depression that a staid , sensible - sweater - wearing guy like Bradford needs .
As Bradford 's token chubby best friend reminds him , " She 's a nutjob ! " Bradford 's response , " But I love her . "
Those lines fully sum up the plot of any movie featuring a MPDG .
Stock Investing Tips For The Beginning Stock Picker
I remember when I decided that my normal savings account was n’t good enough any more .
I saw that my not quite 2 % interest on my savings account was being obliterated by the 5 % average inflation rate .
By keeping my long term savings in a savings account , I was actually losing money over time , so I set out to learn how to become an equity or stock investor .
As a first time investor , I knew that I had a lot of work to do .
More specifically , I had some learning to do .
As I gained more experience , I realized just how much we need to prepare before putting any money into the market .
Stock Investing Tips and Advice For The Beginning Stock Picker
1. Keep your investment costs low .
Many investors are paying out too large a part of their returns to investment management fees .
By watching your costs when you buy or sell ETFs , funds , stocks , bonds or options , you can actually keep more of your returns to yourself .
These days , you can minimize those costs by utilizing cheap online brokers — those brokerages that are low on fees and high on customer service .
There are a good number of online brokers that are highly affordable while also providing strong customer support .
These stock brokerages offer free tools , educational resources and even a built in online trading community for their account holders .
You can check them out further in our brokerage section .
Now if you ’re a mutual fund investor , stick to no load mutual funds — there ’s no reason to have your money in funds that charge you high loads , exorbitant management fees and 12 b - 1 fees when there are so many alternatives out there .
2 . Increase your knowledge about investing before you do anything .
Before committing your money to investments , spend a lot of time reading and learning about investing and stock picking by visiting online financial resources and reading books , periodicals and other educational material .
A lot of free investment videos are viewable in the educational sections of many good broker sites .
Read all of the relevant articles that you can , follow the headlines , watch the videos on CNBC and other financial networks , and devour investing books designed for the beginners .
In other words immerse yourself in the world of investing .
I did n’t invest a dime until I could actually listen to a couple of hours of CNBC stock market news and coverage , and understand everything they were talking about .
3. Learn how to analyze a stock .
The best way for the average investor to invest in the stock market is usually through mutual funds — particularly through index funds , especially if one is unable to track , manage or follow his or her investments on a regular basis .
If you are a passive , long term investor , it ’s best if you stick to no load mutual funds , index funds , target funds or index ETFs .
But for those of you who are interested in becoming stock pickers , or planning to add some individual stocks into your portfolio , then look into free stock tools like Morningstar or INO .
com ’s investment tools to help you with tracking and analyzing your stocks .
I do n’t think you need to be an absolute expert at stock picking in order to start investing , but you should always know why you are investing in an individual stock .
4 . Set up a fake portfolio .
I ’d also suggest spending a couple of months with a virtual portfolio .
Places like INO.com , Google and Yahoo !
have sections that allow you to track your investment portfolio .
Again , if you decide you want to own individual stocks , then get into the habit of researching your stocks regularly .
You should have some idea about what can affect your stocks before any news hits or anything happens .
I would make sure that my virtual portfolio is making some money first ( and I understand why it ’s doing so ) before I play with my real money .
Do n’t invest your real money until you ’re comfortable about making money via your practice portfolio .
Here ’s our list of virtual trading platforms .
5 . Get rid of your credit card debt .
A lot of people do n’t realize that if they are carrying debt , it may be best to first retire or control that debt before beginning to invest in earnest .
At the same time , although it would be ideal if you had no debt at all , for most folks , being able to get rid of debt completely is just not practical .
So if you have credit card debt , be careful — because of the high interest rates on credit cards and the relatively small amount of money that you may be willing to invest as a new investor , credit card interest will easily wipe out your gains .
If your annual interest rate on your cards is 15 % , there is a very high degree of probability that your new portfolio is n’t going to make 15 % .
Statistics show that the average American has $ 5,000 in credit card debt .
If this describes you , you ’ll probably be unable to afford investing in stocks while you manage your debt .
But I have an investment for you that has a 100 % chance of making you a 15 % profit .
Even better , it ’s 100 % safe .
You ca n’t lose your money on this investment .
What is it ?
It ’s the investment you make by paying down your debt as soon as you can .
6. Start conservatively .
Here ’s my last tip :
Be aware that as investors , we ’re always constantly learning .
There is much to learn and we actually do n’t know as much as we think we know .
So get into stock investing with the right attitude .
Make your first investments with the intent of understanding how stocks move in a real world environment .
Even more importantly , invest in blue chip stocks that are safe and boring .
If you were to play against someone on your first tennis match , would you pick Andy Roddick as your opponent ?
Do n’t get aggressive .
Just invest conservatively and learn .
There ’s plenty of time to make money .

AMD 's much - loved HD 4000 series debuted last summer and has slowly transitioned to cover the company 's entire desktop product line .
Mobile systems , however , have remained reliant on the aged HD 3000 series — until now .
AMD revealed its upgraded mobile series at CES this past weekend , including new options for the ultra thin - and - light segment .
Comparative statistics on the new parts are below :
The HD 4800 Mobility is obviously the crown jewel of the line ( the stats given here are for the highest - end 4870 ) , but the Mobility Radeon 4600 should still equal or surpass the Mobility 3850
Estimated TDP varies significantly , from 47 - 55 W on the HD 4870 ( 40 - 48 W for the 4850 ) , 30 W on the 4600 series , and 8 - 12W on the 4500 .
New this time around is the HD 4300 series with a TDP of just 7W .
The Mobility 4300 series will still carry ATI 's UVD2 HD decoding engine , but offers neither CrossfireX or Hybrid Crossfire support .
It may not offer much in the way of 3D performance , but the 4300's low power consumption should fit well when paired with AMD 's Yukon platform .
AMD representatives brought along samples of the various cards , as pictured below .
If you look closely , you 'll notice that all of the cards use the same style of connector .
That , ladies and gentlemen , is an MXM - II link — but the dream of upgradeable video solutions in laptops remains just that .
This Crossfire card brings back memories of the Voodoo5 series .
According to AMD , it designed a single - card Crossfire solution for one OEM in particular ; most companies that want Crossfire use two Mobility 4800 cards and link them via dongle .
The standard Radeon Mobility 4800 .
Note that elusive MXM - II connector , and feel free to lust .
It may be hard to tell , but the 4600 's die is noticeably smaller than that of the 4800 .
It also lacks the metal guard the latter chip carries .
Here we have the 4300/4500 card and die .
Again , the die on this chip is significantly smaller than that of its cousins .
The only system that 's confirmed as using the new Mobility Radeon series is HP 's upcoming dv2 .
We 'll presumably see more designs launch in a few months when OEMs update for spring .
In 1867 , the British Parliament debated what was to become one of the most important bills of the 19th century : the Representation of the People Act 1867 ( more commonly known as the Second Reform Act ) , which effectively doubled the number of Englishmen who were allowed to vote .
On May 20th of that year , the well - known philosopher and writer John Stuart Mill ( 1806 –1873 ) , Member of Parliament for Westminster , celebrated his 61st birthday by introducing an amendment to change the word " man " in the bill to " person . "
It was the first time a measure had been introduced in Parliament that would give women the right to vote .
Mill defended this change using arguments from a book he had already written but not yet published entitled The Subjection of Women , as well as introducing some humor regarding the assumption that women have no experience in politics and economics :
It is thought perhaps ... that those whose chief daily business is the judicious laying - out of money , so as to produce the greatest results with the smallest means , cannot possibly give any lessons to right honourable gentlemen on the other side of the House or this , who contrive to produce such singularly small results with such vast means .
( quoted in Richard Reeves , John Stuart Mill : Victorian Firebrand , Atlantic Books , 2007 , p. 388 )
Mill 's amendment received 73 votes , but it did not pass .
The women of England would not be allowed to vote on equal terms with men until 1928 .
John Stuart Mill took a lot of flak for supporting women 's rights in that long - ago era .
The satirical magazines referred to him as the " women 's member " of Parliament , and cartoons showed him wearing a dress .
Mill 's support of women 's suffrage was perhaps the major issue contributing to his loss in the election in 1868 , limiting his stint in Parliament to just three years .
( It also did n't help that he contributed money to the campaign of radical atheist Charles Bradlaugh . )
The tendency of John Stuart Mill to be much ahead of his time came at a young age .
Many years earlier , while walking through St. James 's Park , he had discovered an abandoned and dead newborn .
His response was to recruit a friend to help him distribute pamphlets about contraception to working - class families in London , and he was arrested for the promotion of obscenity .
The year was 1823 and Mill was 17 years old .
During his years in Parliament , John Stuart Mill was considered to be a political radical .
Nowadays his politics seem fairly mainstream in the Western world — who today would argue that women should n't be allowed to vote ? — and even sometimes horrifyingly reactionary ( his support of capital punishment , for example ) .
John Stuart Mill 's most significant contribution to our culture goes much deeper than specific political issues .
He was also responsible for developing a particular flavor of the philosophy of Utilitarianism that has become very influential , even if we do n't quite acknowlege it .
In a very literal sense , Mill was raised in Utilitarianism .
His father was good friends with Jeremy Bentham , and applied Utilitarian concepts to Mill 's childhood education , famously recounted in Mill 's Autobiography ( 1873 ) .
In Jeremy Bentham 's formulation , Utilitarianism ( basically , good is that which provides the overall greatest happiness ) was rather crude , cold , easy to parody ( Thomas Gradgrind in Charles Dickens ' Hard Times ) and downright scary in its implications .
( Aldous Huxley 's Brave New World is a society founded on sound Benthamite principles . )
John Stuart Mill knew the problems with Utilitarianism first hand : His Utilitarian education — and the mental collapse , despair , and depression that followed — nearly killed him .
Mill essentially rescued Utilitarianism by replacing the vague and slippery idea of " happiness " with a more modern concept of self - fulfillment .
As he emerged from his depression , " I , for the first time , gave its proper place , among the prime necessities of human well - being , to the internal culture of the individual . "
( Autobiography , ch. 5 ) In Mill 's Utilitarian universe , it is better to be smart , self - knowing , and not altogether happy rather than stupid , doped - up , and therefore blissful .
Self - fulfillment , in Mill 's view , is an on - going developmental process of personal growth and education that is unique to each individual .
I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions ; but it must be utility in the largest sense , grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being .
( On Liberty , ch. 1 )
John Stuart Mill 's reformulation of Utilitarianism seems very much to be the implicit philosophy that currently guides many Western civilizations in balancing the needs of the many members of their populations .
Even without much thinking about it , we feel that the best arrangement of society is that which allows people to become educated and cultured to explore their own individualistic paths .
Whether we acknowledge it or not , Mill 's philosophy is the one that dominates our culture .
John Stuart Mill , c'est nous .
John Stuart Mill 's most enduring book , On Liberty , was published 150 years ago this month , in February 1859 .
( I have not been able to determine the exact day of publication . )
It joins several other 1859 books in making that a pivotal year in the transition of Western society from a religious orientation to a secular one .
On Liberty is a very short book , readily available in annotated Penguin and Oxford World 's Classics editions , as well as several on - line versions , and there 's really no excuse for never having read it .
( I have not been able to find a first edition on Google Book Search but here 's a rather marked - up second edition published later in 1859 , just 207 pages with generous line spacing .
It is well known that Mill made no changes to On Liberty in its various editions . )
The book itself is not quite what you might expect .
You probably imagine a spirited defense of the freedoms of speech , press , and religion .
But the book really begins with the assumption that we are at last free of government control in these areas .
The second of the book 's five chapters begins " The time , it is to be hoped , is gone by , when any defence would be necesary of the ' liberty of the press ' as one of the securities against corrupt or tyrannical governments . "
Mill is in favor of liberty of a much less socially acceptable variety .
On Liberty is really an advocacy of extreme individuality , even eccentricity .
The book warns of the dangers of conformance to societal norms and pressures , and the " tyranny of the majority . "
Society ... practices a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression , since , though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties , it leaves fewer means of escape , penetrating more deeply into the details of life , and enslaving the soul itself .
( ch. 1 )
To counter this tendency , people should be allowed and encouraged to practice liberty " without impediment from our fellow - creatures , so long as what we do does not harm them , even though they should think our conduct foolish , perverse , or wrong . " ( ch. 1 )
Mill is an advocate of free speech , obviously , but interestingly enough , not so much because people have " natural rights " to express their opinions .
Mill advocates free speech from a Utilitarian perspective :
The suppression of speech is actually dangerous to society .
Without hearing contrary views , we never question our assumptions .
Dissenting opinons are valuable to a society regardless whether they 're right or wrong .
" If the opinion is right , they [ society ] are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth : if wrong , they lose , what is almost as great a benefit , the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth , produced by its collision with error . " ( ch. 2 )
It is in Chapter 3 , " On Individuality , as One of the Elements of Well - Being , " that Mill reveals the revolutionary nature of his book by extending the concept of free expression to individuals themselves :
As it is useful that while mankind are imperfect there should be different opinions , so is it that there should be different experiments of living ; that free scope should be given to varieties of character , short of injury to others ; and that the worth of different modes of life should be proved practically , when any one thinks fit to try them .
It is desirable , in short , that in things which do not primarily concern others , individuality should assert itself .
( ch. 3 )
There is , of course , much societal pressure not to engage in any " experiments of living " but to conform to pre-established modes .
This , to Mill , does not guarantee personal growth : " Human nature is not a machine to be built after a model , and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it , but a tree , which requires to grow and develope itself on all sides , according to the tendency of the inward forces which make it a living thing . " ( ch. 3 )
Again , however , it is not just the individual that benefits from this unique individual growth , but society at large :
In this age , the mere example of nonconformity , the mere refusal to bend the knee of custom , is itself a service .
Precisely because the tyranny of opinion is such as to make eccentricity a reproach , it is desirable , in order to break through that tyranny , that people should be eccentric .
Eccentricity has always abounded when and where strength of character has abounded ; and the amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius , mental vigour , and moral courage which it contained .
That so few now dare to be eccentric , marks the chief danger of the time .
( ch. 3 )
While it 's important for individuals to challenge societal norms of behavior and conduct , sometimes these norms have also been written into law , and it is in Chapter 4 ( " Of the Limits to the Authority of Society " ) that Mill examines legal regulation of what we now term " victimless crimes . "
Mill realizes that the urge to prevent people from harming themselves is a strong one , and " that to extend the bounds of what may be called moral police , until it encroaches on the most unquestionably legitimate liberty of the individual , is one of the most universal of all human propensities . " ( ch. 4 ) Yet it must be resisted .
Among the victimless crimes that Mill specifically mentions are drunkenness ( although he clearly acknowledges that some occupations should not allow drunken workers ) , working on the Sabbath ( even though abstaining from work one day a week " is a highly beneficial custom " ) , gambling , and " fornication " ( by which I 'm pretty sure he 's referring to prostitution ) .
What people do to themselves or by themselves is none of society 's business .
Mill 's arguments in On Liberty were influenced somewhat by Wilhelm von Humboldt 's Sphere and Duties of Government , first published in an English translation in 1854 .
Mill uses a quotation from the book as an epigraph to On Liberty and paraphrases von Humboldt 's observations about the contract of marriage : " [ Marriage , ] having the peculiarity that its objects are frustrated unless the feelings of both parties are in harmony with it , should require nothing more than the declared will of either party to dissolve it . " ( ch. 5 )
Mill , however , does not go quite this far .
He believes that divorce should be somewhat harder because the marriage might affect others besides the two married people .
The difficulty of divorce in Victorian England was an issue very close to Mill : For about 20 years , John Stuart Mill and a married woman , Harriet Taylor , were in love with each other , and they were only able to marry after her husband died .
They had seven years of married life together ( accompanied by ill health ) before she died .
Mill considered many of his later works , such as On Liberty and The Subjection of Women to have been collaborations with Harriet Taylor , and On Liberty is dedicated to her .
The Subjection of Women would not be published until 1869 , but Mill 's feminism is on full view in On Liberty as well :
The almost despotic power of husbands over wives needs not be enlarged upon here , beause nothing more is needed for the complete removal of the evil , than that wives should have the same rights , and should receive the protection of law in the same manner , as all other persons ; and because , on this subject , the defenders of established injustice do not avail themselves of the plea of liberty , but stand forth openly as the champions of power .
( ch. 5 )
One of the most interesting passages in On Liberty tackles a still volatile topic : plural marriage as practiced by Mormons .
Mill makes it clear that the current concept of marriage " far from being in any way countenanced by the principle of liberty , it is a direct infraction of that principle , being a mere rivetting of the chains of one - half of the community , and an emancipation of the other from reciprocity of obligation towards them . "
But given the existence of unequal marriage between two people , Mill can't see any problem extending the institution to more than two :
Still , it must be remembered that this relation is as much voluntary on the part of the women concerned with it , and who may be deemed the sufferers by it , as is the case with any other form of the marriage institution ; and however surprising this fact may appear , it has its explanation in the common ideas and customs of the world , while teaching women to think marriage the one thing needful , make it intelligible that many a woman should prefer being one of several wives , to not being a wife at all .
( ch . 4 )
Mill also takes a radical view of the interests of society over parents in the care of children .
He is rather against uniform State education ( being " a mere contrivance for moulding people to be exactly like one another " ) but very much in favor of compulsory education .
For the child 's ( and society 's ) benefit , he wants to coerce parents into providing that education along with other care .
It still remains unrecognized , that to bring a child into existence without a fair prospect of being able , not only to provide food for its body , but instruction and training for its mind , is a moral crime , both against the unfortunate offspring and against society ; and that if the parent does not fulfil this obligation , the State ought to see it fulfilled , at the charge , as far as possible , of the parent .
( ch. 5 )
Despite Mill 's bow towards the parents in this passage , he seems to have a decided leaning towards children 's rights , and it would have been interesting to hear him expound on some more modern issues regarding the relative rights of children and parents .
The provocative nature of On Liberty has kept the book controversial for the past 150 years .
The text remains unnerving to those who believe that government has a role to play in enforcing morals , including what goes on in private between consenting adults .
( It is worthwhile remembering that the Lawrence vs . Texas decision is only six years old , and affected laws in 14 states . )
Because Mill 's ideas arise from a Utilitarian - based morality , On Liberty is particularly abhorent to those who believe that morality comes from an external source , e.g. , a Supreme Being .
At the extreme fringe are those who wish a return to Biblical Law , including the half dozen thought - crimes that form a majority of the Ten Commandments .
On Liberty did n't quite make the Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th Centuries conducted by Human Events magazine , " Headquarters of the Conservative Underground , " but it did get an honorable mention .
On the other hand , conservatives of a more Libertarian bent sometimes find a kindred spirit in Mill .
Liberals more prominently claim Mill for their side , although the big parternalistic " welfare state " governments common in the Western world are quite foreign to his more laissez - faire politics .
In her introduction to an older Penguin edition of On Liberty , Gertrude Himmelfarb refers to this contradiction as a " schizophrenic " split of liberalism . ( p. 47 )
Everyone agrees that it 's necessary to maintain a proper balance between the rights of the individual and the needs of society , but setting the fulcrum for this balance remains extremely devisive .
The culture wars — abortion , gay marriage , drugs , pornography , guns — are all fought on the battlefield of On Liberty , and the book remains a bold assertion of the primacy of the individual over authority — whether that authority be religious , political , or even the collective coercion of others .
Oakland protests turn violent as victim's mother pleads for peace Diane Sweet

Angry protests turned to rioting Wednesday night in response to the January 1 shooting of an unarmed man at a subway station in California 's Bay Area .
Police made at least 105 arrests after cars -- including one police vehicle -- were vandalized , store windows were smashed , and fires blazed out of control on the streets .
Approximately 300 stores were damaged in the fray , according to published reports .
In response to the violence , " State Sen . Leland Yee , D - San Francisco / San Mateo , and Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , D - San Francisco , today announced their intent , with the support of San Francisco supervisor and former police commissioner David Campos , to author legislation requiring greater accountability and public oversight of BART police , " reported CBS 5 in California .
" Clorox Corp and other businesses in Oakland , California , were sending employees home early on Thursday due to fears of more violence , " said Reuters .
RAW STORY first reported the shooting of Oscar Grant , 22 , who was killed by a single gun shot to the back after being pulled from a train along with some friends amid reports of an altercation on Monday , Jan .
5 . Johannes Mehserle , identified as the officer who is alleged to have fired the fatal shot , has resigned amid alleged death threats .
The attorney for Grant 's family , John Burris , said the timing of the officer 's resignation did n't surprise him .
" He does n't want to give a statement because BART could 've ordered him to do so , and if he did n't , he could be terminated . "
Wednesday night , the streets turned into 1980s West Beirut after protesters left the station area .
Thursday , Grant 's mother pleaded with Oaklanders for peace .
" I am begging the citizens not to use violent tactics , not to be angry , " said Wanda Johnson , Grant 's mother , at a press conference .
" You 're hurting people who have nothing to do with the situation .
You 're vandalizing their property , hurting their cars and breaking their windows .
Please just stop it , please . "
NBC 's Bay Area
News reports , " The protest Wednesday began peacefully at the Fruitvale Bay Area Rapid Transit station , but forced the closure of that station from about 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. before protesters moved through the city .
At one point , reporter George Kiriyama was hit in the arm by a tear gas can .
He explained live on television , ' I 've been hit .
I 've been hit . '
Kiriyama suffered a bruise to his arm . "
One of the protest 's organizers , Evan Shamar , blamed others for stirring things up .
" He said a group of anarchists , who were not part of the organizations hosting the rally , smashed a police vehicle before setting a garbage can on fire , " the NBC affiliate reported .

Everything may be science ... but everything else is Woo !
Audience tracking surveys are hardly perfect , but rarely are they as far off the mark as when “ Paul Blart : Mall Cop ” arrived in theaters three weeks ago .
Having studied the various appraisals of moviegoer interest , executives at Sony Pictures concluded that , at worst , “ Mall Cop ” would gross $ 20 million in its first four days , with a high end of perhaps $ 25 million in domestic theaters .
The actual Martin Luther King Day weekend returns : $ 39.2 million .
Since its Jan. 16 release , “ Mall Cop ” has been a box - office sensation , winning not only that opening weekend by a wide margin but also remaining the nation ’s No. 1 film last weekend , when it slipped just 32 % ( most movies fall about 50 % in their second week of release ) to gross $ 21.6 million , sneaking past Sony ’s new Screen Gems genre film , “ Underworld 3 : Rise of the Lycans . ”
With more than $ 67 million in ticket sales so far , “ Mall Cop ” is well - poised to go beyond $ 100 million in domestic theaters .
It ’s a highly unexpected outcome for what was once a lowly regarded comedy with an untested lead actor ( “ King of Queens ” TV star Kevin James ) in the titular role .
Advertisement
The film ’s success says less about the fallibility of tracking surveys than it does about audience demand for feel - good stories and Hollywood ’s growing appetite for low - budget comedies with obvious marketing hooks .
While 2008 movie admissions were off about 5 % from the previous year , this year ’s box - office sales figures -- thanks largely to “ Mall Cop , ” “ Slumdog Millionaire ” and “ Gran Torino ” -- are running almost 15 % ahead of last year ’s pace .
“ You ’ve got a country that is willing to put their economic worries behind them and go to the movies , ” says Doug Belgrad , the Sony production executive who developed the movie with James based on the actor ’s own idea .
“ And people see themselves in this guy , ” Belgrad says of James ’ ne ’er - do - well shopping mall security guard , who foils a band of thieves who invade the mall he patrols on his Segway .
“ They love it when a guy who is n’t given credit for being good at anything succeeds . ”
James pitched actor - producer Adam Sandler , his costar in “ I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry , ” and Sony his idea for the movie in the summer of 2007 .
The idea was n’t fully formed , but the movie could easily be parsed into comprehensible Hollywood shorthand : “ Die Hard ” meets “ Home Alone ” with an overweight security guard .

Sony and Sandler ’s Happy Madison Productions -- which has made six movies for the studio that have grossed more than $ 100 million -- loved the idea but had several concerns .
First , a looming strike by the Writers Guild of America meant that James and screenwriter Nick Bakay had little time to work up a screenplay ( they finished a draft in about a month ) , and second , Sony had to beat another mall - cop comedy -- Warner Bros . ’ much less family friendly “ Observe and Report , ” from writer - director Jody Hill , due April 10 -- into theaters .
Equally important , “ Mall Cop ” could n’t be expensive .
Once the industry ’s low - budget alternative to expensive action films , comedies have grown progressively more pricey .
Paramount and DreamWorks spent so much production money ( $ 100 million ) and gave away so much gross profit ( about 25 % ) on “ Tropic Thunder ” that last year ’s Ben Stiller comedy , with a domestic gross in excess of $ 110 million , will barely make a profit .
But the potential rewards for low - budget comedies -- including Universal ’s $ 30 - million “ Role Models ” and Sony ’s $ 28 - million “ Pineapple Express ” -- are far more attractive .
So Sony budgeted “ Mall Cop ” at $ 26 million , deciding that in place of expensive action scenes it would focus on family - friendly gags .
“ The studio , and specifically Adam , felt that the movie would have its greatest potential as a PG movie , ” Belgrad says .

“ Paul Blart : Mall Cop ” and a Chicago Blackhawks hockey game
In addition to placing a “ Mall Cop ” trailer on almost every print of Sandler ’s Christmas comedy , “ Bedtime Stories , ” Sony also bought television spots that reached adults , especially sports broadcasts such as NBA games and the NFL playoffs .
Sony ’s promotions team flooded shopping malls nationwide the day after Thanksgiving , dressing up as mall cops and helping shoppers carry bags to their cars .
The result was not only that a large number of parents bought “ Mall Cop ” tickets with their kids ( rather than simply dropping off ) but also that the film played surprisingly well outside of major cities .
“ The other secret weapon was that it did proportionally even better in the middle of America than it did in Los Angeles and New York , ” says Jeff Blake , vice chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment .
“ There ’s an audience that maybe is n’t all involved in the Oscar movies . ”
Belgrad and his Sony production chief partner , Matt Tolmach , have a number of modestly budgeted comedies in the works , including Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler in “ The Ugly Truth ” ; “ Bad Teacher ” ; the demolition derby story “ The Precious View ” ; and “ Winter ’s Discontent . ”
What ’s less clear is when Paul Blart might save the day again .
James has been developing the comedy “ Zookeeper ” at MGM and may soon costar in a new Sandler comedy for Sony .

“ Happy Madison historically has been very reluctant to do sequels , ” says a hopeful Belgrad .
“ But we believe there is an opportunity to make another Paul Blart movie . ”

The T - 34 is designed to launch a net over intruders
Two Japanese companies have unveiled a security robot that can be commanded from a mobile phone to hurl a net that traps suspected intruders .
The prototype T - 34 was developed jointly by robot firm Tmsuk Co and security firm Alacom Co .
It moves at up to 10 km / h ( 6 mph ) , and can be controlled by someone seeing real - time images on a mobile phone .
The small robot is built on wheels and is equipped with sensors that can detect the movements of intruders .
" Security sensors often set off false alarms but examining the location with the robot will lead to more efficient operations , " said a statement from the companies .
Dog Running in his Sleep

I wish I could see what this dog was dreaming .
AWS signature version 1 is insecure
The important bit first : For example , if you allow users to add arbitrary " tags " to documents , and you use SimpleDB to store those tags , this means you .
( Amazon Flexible Payments Service ( FPS ) and Amazon Devpay also use the same insecure signature method , but they already require the use of HTTPS .
Amazon S3 and other services use different signature methods . )
I 've been sitting on this blog post since May 1st , when I was reading documentation in preparation for writing the accounting code for my tarsnap online backup service and I first noticed that AWS signature version 1 was insecure ; but now that the cat is out of the bag thanks to Amazon announcing the new signature version , it 's time to publish the details of how their signature version 1 is broken .
AWS signature version 1 signs an HTTP query string as follows :
Split the query string based on ' & ' and ' = ' characters into a series of key - value pairs .
Sort the pairs based on the keys .
Append the keys and values together , in order , to construct one big string ( key1 + value1 + key2 + value2 + ... ) .
Sign that string using HMAC - SHA1 and your secret access key .
When Amazon invented this signature scheme , they forgot about one of the foremost design principles relating to cryptographic signatures : Collisions are BAD !
In a well - designed signature system , it should be computationally infeasible to construct two different messages which have the same signature ; this prevents substitution attacks where an attacker convinces the key holder to sign a " harmless " message , and then attaches that signature to a different message .
Looking at how AWS signature version 1 is computed , it 's easy to see how to construct collisions :
Because there are no delimiters between the keys and values , the signature for " foo=bar " is identical to the signature for " foob=ar " ; moreover , the signature for " foo=bar&fooble=baz " is the same as the signature for " foo=barfooblebaz " .
To see how this could be exploited , let 's return to my earlier example of a website which allows users to add tags to documents .
Suppose that each document is identified as a single item in SimpleDB , and that each document has attributes associated with it including an " owner " and one or more " tags " ( Simple DB allows multiple values to be associated with each parameter name ) .
To add the tag X to a document , the website would normally issue the SimpleDB request
? Action=PutAttributes
& Attribute.0.Name=tags&Attribute.0.Value=X
... other stuff
ActionPutAttributesAttribute .0.NametagsAttribute.0.ValueX ...
? Action=PutAttributes
& Attribute.0.Name=tags&Attribute.0.Value=foo
Attribute.1.NameownerAttribute.1.ReplacetrueAttribute.1.ValueDr.Evil
... other stuff
ActionPutAttributesAttribute .0.NametagsAttribute.0.ValuefooAttribute .1.NameownerAttribute.1.ReplacetrueAttribute .1.ValueDr.Evil ...
? Action=PutAttributes
& Attribute.0.Name=tags&Attribute.0.Value=foo
& Attribute.1.Name=owner&Attribute.1.Replace=true&Attribute.1.Value=Dr.Evil ... other stuff
sdb.amazonaws.com
( whitespace added for clarity and to avoid page - width problems ) which would be signed with the HMAC of .
Now consider what happens if someone asks the website to add the tag " fooAttribute.1.NameownerAttribute .1.ReplacetrueAttribute.1.ValueDr.Evil " to a document .
The website issues the SimpleDB requestwhich is signed with the HMAC of -- which would also be the signature for the requestProviding that this request is sent over HTTP , Dr. Evil just has to capture this request ( via network sniffing or ARP / IP / DNS / BGP attacks ) and he can attach the signature from the real request to his fake request , whereupon he sets himself as the " owner " of the document in question .
If the request is sent over HTTPS , in contrast , Dr. Evil wo n't be able to see the signature ( unless he has an SSL certificate for , which is unlikely ) and so he wo n't be able to apply this attack .
I reported this issue to Amazon via an email to Jeff Barr , the " Lead Web Services Evangelist " at Amazon on May 1st , and while it took a long time -- 7.5 months -- for it to be fixed , I 'm happy to say that Amazon took this issue seriously at all times , and the lengthy timeline was simply because of the large amount of work involved .
Jeff forwarded my email to someone working on SimpleDB ( I 've been asked not to mention names ) , who confirmed that they agreed that this was a problem .
As part of their review of my findings , Amazon 's security people realized that this also affected EC2 and SQS -- in my initial investigation I had only looked at SimpleDB -- and at the beginning of July they agreed to send me their planned signature version 2 so that I could review it .
Aside from some minor clarifications to the documentation , I saw no problems with the new signature method , and at that point Amazon started the lengthy process of implementation , testing , and rolling out the new signature method .
In September , they allowed me to perform some basic interoperability tests between my code ( written based on the documentation ) and their back - end code ; this proved very useful , as it uncovered an ambiguity in the documentation .
Amazon then returned to their processes -- including updating their many client libraries in order to make sure that everybody would be able to switch to signature version 2 as soon as it was announced .
Now , in mid-December , they 've finished updating their servers , documentation , and libraries , and the new signature is finally being announced .
I must congratulate Amazon on a highly professional response to this issue .
Companies very frequently have difficulty handling externally - discovered security problems , both because of a temptation to downplay the significance of the issues , and also because of a desire to keep potentially sensitive information out of the hands of anyone outside of the company -- Intel 's response to the Hyperthreading information leakage problem is a good example of both of these .
The fact that Amazon not only accepted that there was a problem , but was willing to keep me informed during throughout the process of fixing it -- even going to the extent of allowing me to review their intended solution , which is more than the FreeBSD Security Team usually does -- is quite exceptional .
People inevitably make mistakes from time to time .
Security problems happen .
But when they do happen , Amazon 's response is a good example to follow .

Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio unveiled a plan Tuesday to avoid airport parking fees by transporting inmates on the Metro light rail , but officials claim that parking is already free .
Arpaio said he planned to transport extradited inmates using the light rail from 44th and Washington streets to the Fourth Avenue Jail in order to eliminate parking fees at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport .
MCSO estimates that the new system can save about $ 72,000 in transport fees .
Arpaio said free parking offered to law enforcement agencies was revoked several years ago and MCSO has been paying $ 25 per day for each car parked at the airport .
Sky Harbor officials said Tuesday that all state law enforcement agencies have access to free and secure parking as long as they notify the Airport Police Bureau in advance .
� Law enforcement officers park in a secure location at the airport and the officer and their prisoners are transported by Phoenix Police to their airline gate , � Deborah Ostreicher , Deputy Aviation Director for Sky Harbor , said in an e-mail .
� The Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office currently ( uses ) this service . �
Despite differing claims from both sides , Arpaio planned to move forward with the measure .
Arpaio said use of a rail system to transport inmates is not uncommon nationally and the plan will not present any danger to the public .
Under the new policy , inmates brought back to Arizona on warrants would be escorted on the light rail by two armed deputies , Arpaio said .
The inmates are not required to be separated from other commuters but Metro Light Rail officials are concerned that passengers may still object to the new arrangement and fear for their safety , Metro Light Rail spokeswoman Hillary Foose said .
Arpaio demonstrated the plan Tuesday evening by transporting an inmate on the light rail while surrounded by members of the media .
The unidentified inmate was being brought in on charges of fraud .
The scene immediately got the attention of light rail riders .
� It depends on if ( the inmates ) are violent or non-violent , � Phoenix resident and light - rail rider Nick Correa said .
� If they have a history of violence , I 'd have a problem with that . �
Arpaio said he would reconsider the plan only if he received written verification that his deputies would be able to park for free at the airport .
Sky Harbor officials maintained Tuesday night that free parking was available to all law enforcement agencies .
� If they need to come to the airport and pick up or transport a prisoner , they can still do that for free , � Sky Harbor spokeswoman Julie Rodriguez said .

But in some countries , it ’s even more important NOT to do what the Romans AREN ’T doing .
Disparaging the royal family in Thailand
Thailand takes its monarchy very seriously , to the extent that insulting the king or royal family , verbally or otherwise , carries a high price .
Just ask Oliver Jufer , a 57 - year - old Swiss expat who ran afoul of the lèse majesté law when he defaced portraits of King Bhumibol Adulyadej after a few too many Beer Changs .
A
Thai court handed him 10 years in jail ( out of a possible 75 ) , but his sentence was later commuted by the same king he had affronted .
Showing affection in Dubai
Technically , it ’s illegal to hold hands in public in this Emirati tourist hotspot .
Try rounding all the bases , as two British beachgoers did in July of this year , and you could find yourself in court at the epicenter of a culture war .
Smoking in Bhutan
Simply bringing tobacco into this tiny Himalayan country is costly — you ’ll pay a 100 % tax at customs .
Smoke in public and you ’ll be out $ 225 more .
But if for some reason you ’re caught selling tobacco products … that might just land you in a Bhutanese prison on smuggling charges .

Tagging in Singapore
Among the long list of legally defined no - no ’s in this tiny island nation — littering , jaywalking , and leaving a toilet unflushed , for example — is graffiti vandalism .

Then you probably also remember that he was jailed , fined , and given four strokes of the cane for his crime .
Romancing a local in Iran

So the only part about this curse of recruiting potentials for the marine corps that is n't utterly miserable is fucking with the people that have already signed up .
Now , we do n't want to scare them off entirely , so we can't just sit there and be like , " You 're going to die in bootcamp ! "
But we can be completely insane with each other in front of them , and let them draw that conclusion on their own .
So we 're told to take the poolees on a 1.5 mile run today .
No staff nco's there , so we 're like , " Fuckit .
There 's two recruits , there 's eight of us ... four mile run . "
So we start running and I had just had a monster energy drink , the lo ball kind , which is red .
That 's a dumbass 's recipe for disaster , but I really wanted one so I had one anyway .
It dehydrates you , gives you cramps , and makes you puke .
So we 've been running like half a mile and without breaking pace I casually puke onto the side of the road , and keep running .
Among marines this is normal behavior , so no one even says anything , but the recuruit is looking like , " Wtf , did that guy just puke without stopping ? "
geekryan : lol
yetiamchosen :
And he 's like , " Dude !
Are you alright ! "
I 'm like , " KEEP RUNNING ! " and I speed up a little bit , chuckling inside .
And then it really hits me and I 'm like , going full speed , just hurling all over the side of the road , wiping my mouth , running , hurling and he looks at the puke and he goes , " OH MY GOD ARE YOU PUKING BLOOD ! "
geekryan : HAHAHAHA
yetiamchosen : And I go , " THAT'S NOT BLOOD IT'S CONFIDENCE AAAAGGGHHHHH !!! "
And I just blast off like a little red streaming rocket ship .
I look behind me and this kid seriously look like he 's just about to piss his pants , like , " Oh my god , what the fuck have I gotten myself into ? "
I got up to the front and this marine looks at me and goes , " Were you really puking up blood ? "
I 'm like , " No devil , it 's monster , " and he just laughs , he 's like , " You 're going to hell . "
yetiamchosen : That 's it .
I was chuckling inside all the way home .
geekryan : that really is awesome
geekryan : I can't imagine how freaked out that recruit was
yetiamchosen : I hope he does n't sleep well again until he gets to boot camp .
Australia 's hugely controversial ISP filtering plan received a lump of Christmas coal in its stocking with the release this week of a new report that points out the many difficulties with such a scheme .
The current government 's response is to make clear that the report was commissioned by the previous government — which apparently makes it a bit suspect .
A live trial of the filtering system has been delayed into January , but it is still going ahead .
" The Government is aware of technical concerns raised in the report , and that is why we are conducting a pilot to put these claims to the test , " said Senator Stephen Conroy , Minister for Broadband , Communications and the Digital Economy .
The lengthy report was commissioned by the Howard Government back in 2007 and was conducted by the Internet Industry Association .
Not that the current government wants you to take the report 's points too seriously ; Conroy points out that " the report methodology was a literature review of existing studies as well as interviews and surveys .
It involved no empirical testing of filtering technology . "
The group did , however , conduct interviews with ISPs , content producers , filter vendors , telecommunications lawyers , and technical experts from Sydney University .
The project team also " visited and interviewed organizations in countries that have implemented content filtering schemes . "
What emerges from the report is a sense of the difficulties that Australia would have to face if it moves forward with implementation .
Not least among them are the legal questions .
The report identifies a huge list of potential problems , including :
Over - blocking and under - blocking content
Service degradation and the potential impact on existing service level agreements
Interception and hacking
Impairing freedom of expression
Privacy breaches
Contractual claims
Negligence
Misleading conduct
Breaching sale of goods legislation
Incorrect blocks , though they might prove uncommon , could prove costly .
The report notes that a single blocked site could result in multiple legal claims , including " defamation , due to the grave implication that the owner has been involved in the distribution of illegal content " and " loss of revenue during the time site was blocked , possibly as a result of degradation of product or brand awareness , or direct loss of potential earnings . "
The ISPs consulted for the report pointed out that the filtering scheme could be bypassed quite easily ; VPN and HTTPS traffic would be harder to filter , for instance , and the proposed scheme does n't appear to include e-mail , instant messaging , or P2P content .
If it 's not on the web , it wo n't be filtered .
The likely result ?
An arms race .
" There is an evident risk therefore that web filtering will suffer from the [ same ] high ongoing costs that e-mail filtering does , as web content providers seek to get their content in front of as many users as possible , " said one ISP .
" For instance , some sites use dynamically generated URLs for each page of content which would make filtering of exact URLs effective only .
Such a technique could be employed by such web content providers in order to stymie blacklist filtering . "
There 's also the question of the increased cost .
In the UK , BT recently spent around £ 500,000 to implement its " CleanFeed " system .
Australian ISPs said that increasing their service fees " even $ 1 / month will be too much . "
These ISPs expect the government to cover any costs they incur implementing the program .
And then there 's the question of performance , a key point of pride for ISPs .
Most ISPs believe that any scheme would slow speeds , since pulling the destination IP addresses from every packet that passes through the network is a terrifically intensive job ; matching those in realtime against a blacklist , then looking up whether the user in question has opted out of the second ( optional ) level of filtering , could take too much time .
The report quotes an unnamed analyst saying , " Broadband speeds in Australia are low and [ ISPs ] are concerned about any scheme which degrades existing performance , particularly as it relates to video streaming which has grown dramatically over the past 18 months .
Speed degradation would seriously impact that growth . "
Finally , the report takes a look at filtering schemes in European countries , many of which take steps to restrict access to child pornography .
Nearly all such schemes are voluntary , though , and ISPs can implement them any way they wish .
One odd approach was Sweden's , which uses a voluntary industry scheme but only addresses " commercial child pornography sites : i.e. , sites that offer child abuse images for sale . "
All such schemes were far more limited than Australia 's plan , but they do show that filtering is possible .
( If the government cared less about free speech and performance concerns , it could obviously adopt a system more like China 's , though this is n't the sort of reputation Australia is looking to acquire . )
In any event , the government is going ahead with the scheme .
A trial was supposed to begin this week ; for reasons not made clear , the trial has now been pushed into January .
The government is also signing up mobile operators for a future trial of their own .
“ The horsepower war is over , ”  AMG boss Volker Mornhinweg told AutoCar .
Mornhinweg said that AMG is now going to focus on pursuing higher fuel - economy for its future cars while trying to better performance levels .
He said that AMG will do that by cutting weight , optimizing the engine and using other alternative fuel - saving technologies .
According to Mornhinweg , we ’ll get to see those changes in the redesigned Mercedes - Benz E 63 AMG due out later this year .
He said that the new E 63 AMG will be lighter and will provide a little more “ grunt ” with better fuel - economy .
The boss of AMG also confirmed that the high - performance division was looking into producing compact AMG models .

We ’ll find out soon enough .

Stores , hospitals , entertainment venues , and other places where the public are together in large numbers , use secret codes to pass information between store employees .
These are meant to be a secret as they do n’t want to alarm the non -staff members or alert someone ( like a thief ) to the fact that they have been noticed .
Many stores have their own codes – for example WalMart , but there are a number that are nearly universal in application .
This is a list of ten secret codes that may prove useful to you in future , or at least dispel any curiosity you may have if you hear them .
10 Ten Codes
The Ten Codes are a list of codes used by law enforcement officers in the United States .
They are available on the Internet which would make them seem inappropriate for this list , but a large number of police departments have tried to have them made illegal for distribution , so they deserve a mention .
The codes were developed initially in 1937 and were expanded in 1974 .
The California Police use a variety of extra codes which predated the ten codes .
For example , a 187 ( one eighty - seven ) means homicide .
In the ten codes system , a 10 - 31 means that a crime is in progress , a 10 - 27 - 1 means homicide ( the 10 is usually not said when it is a three - number sequence ) , and a 10 - 00 ( ten double - zero ) means “ officer down – all patrols respond .
Wikipedia has a complete list of the police codes here .
9 Professional Codes
In computer support , a variety of codes can be used when referring to a customer .
One of these codes has become fairly well known on the internet : PEBKAC ( Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair ) but there are a variety of others that are lesser known .
One of these is used when reporting a fault which has been fixed : “ The fault was a PICNIC ” ( problem in chair – not in computer ) , or “ ID 10 T Error ” – ID 10 T is , of course , IDIOT .
Let us hope that you never see this noted down on your file when a serviceman is fixing your computer .
8 Time Check
Time Check ( usually taking a similar form to : “ Time check : the time is 12:00 ” ) can be a code in stores for a bomb alert .
It alerts the staff to follow the bomb procedure , which can be to either try to locate any suspicious packages , or to prepare to get the hell out .
If you hear a time check in a store , it is probably a good idea to start moving toward the exit .
Surprisingly – and shockingly , the majority of stores that use this code actually expect their staff to search for the bomb – certainly an aspect of the job that the majority of teenaged checkout operators were n’t expecting when they signed up I am sure .
7 Code 10
A code 10 in hospitals can refer to a mass casualty or serious threat ( such as a bomb alert ) , but the majority of people experiencing a code 10 will do so for another far more common reason : a “ code 10 authorization ” is made by a merchant when he needs to call a credit card company to enquire about your card .
This means that he is suspicious of you or your card and does n’t want you to know it while he gets it checked out .
When the credit card company hears that they have a code 10 , they will ask a series of yes / no questions to the merchant in order to find out what the situation is .
This will often result in the merchant keeping your card if they believe it is safe to do so .
This type of call often results in a call to law enforcement .
6 Doctor Brown
“ Doctor Brown ” is a code word often used in hospitals to alert security staff to a threat to personnel .
If a nurse or doctor is in danger from a violent patient or non-staff member , they can page Doctor Brown to their location and the security staff will rush to their aid .
In some hospitals , code silver is used to refer to a person with a weapon , and code gray can mean a violent person without a weapon .
Hospitals have a huge array of various codes to describe all manner of situations .
They often differ from hospital to hospital and they are usually not internationally recognized .

5 Code Oscar
On a ship , a code oscar means someone has gone overboard .
If the ship has to maneuver erratically to handle the situation , it must also send out blasts on the signal so that other ships nearby are aware of the fact that it is about to change its course .
It should be noted that ships do n’t have an internationally standardized set of PA signals and they can differ from place to place , but this is a fairly commonly used one .
Oh – and a code delta can mean that there is a biological hazard – though who knows what that might be on a passenger ship .
And finally , Code Alpha often means “ medical emergency ” .
4 Code Bravo
Code Bravo is the code phrase for a general security alert at airports .
Unlike most of the codes on this list , the code is meant to cause alarm – but not through knowing what it means : when this alert is raised , all of the security agents will begin to yell “ Code Bravo ” in order to frighten the passengers – this is supposed to make it easier for the agents to locate the source of the problem without interference from the general public .
For those of you who travel on ships from time to time , you may like to know that Code Bravo means “ fire ” and it is the most serious alert on a ship – if it burns , you either get off or burn with it .
Ships also often use sound signals , such as 7 short and 1 long , meaning “ man the lifeboats ” .
3 Inspector Sands
Inspector Sands ( or sometimes Mr Sands ) , is a code for fire in the United Kingdom .
Obviously it would not be appropriate for the service staff of a store to announce a fire publicly , so this code is used to alert the appropriate staff to the danger without upsetting customers .
The wording differs from place to place and in the Underground network a recorded “ Inspector Sands ” warning is automatically triggered by smoke detectors .
In some shops you will hear the code used in a phrase such as “ Will inspector Sands please report to the men ’s changing room ” if the fire is in the men ’s changing room .
It was played on a continuous loop through the underground during the July 7 , 2005 bombings , and has been incorrectly described as a code word for a bomb – the frequently used code for a bomb in the Underground is “ Mr Gravel ” – for example , “ Mr Gravel is in the foyer ” .
Mr Sands ( or sometimes Mr Johnson ) is also used in theaters in the case of fire .
You can listen to a recording of the Underground “ Inspector Sands ” warning here .
2 WalMart
WalMart gets its own item on this list because they have a large number of codes that are store specific .
Some of their codes should not worry you – for example a code 10 or a code 20 just means that there has been a dry spill or a wet spill – the biggest danger this poses to you is that you might slip over .
A code 300 calls for security and a code orange means there has been a chemical spill .
But here are the ones you really need to worry about :
Code red means there is a fire in the building – get the hell out if you hear this .
Worse still , a code blue means there is a bomb in the building .
Exit swiftly but do n’t run – in case they think you planted it .
A code green means there is a hostage situation and a code white means there is an accident .
The one you are most likely to hear is a code c which is simply a call for customer service ( usually meaning that more cashiers are needed ) .
And finally – the most famous WalMart code … well , it ’s so famous it needs its own item :
1 Code Adam
Code Adam was invented by Walmart but it is now an internationally recognized alert .
It means “ missing child ” .
The code was first coined in 1994 in memory of Adam Walsh , a six - year old , who went missing in a Sears department store in Florida in 1981 .
Adam was later found murdered .
The person making the announcement will state “ we have a code Adam , ” followed by a description of the missing child .
As soon as the alert is heard , security staff will begin to monitor the doors and other exits .
If the child is not found within 10 minutes , the police are alerted and a store search begins .
Also , if the child is found in the first 10 minutes in the company of an unknown adult , the police must be called and the person detained if it is safe to do so .
In 2003 , the US Congress passed legislation making a “ Code Adam ” program compulsory in all federal office buildings .
A similar alert is called an AMBER alert , a backronym for “ America ’s Missing : Broadcasting Emergency Response ” but initially named for Amber Hagerman , a 9 year old girl who was abducted and murdered .

Drag , dude .
Earlier today , Swiss police announced the discovery of a large marijuana plantation hidden amongst cornfields thanks to a chance encounter via Google Earth .
Thanks to the ever - popular eye in the sky of Google , 16 people and 1.1 metric tons of grass are now in custody of police .
The arrestees will likely face hefty jail sentences , while the marijuana will be burnt at the stake ( and if you listen carefully , you can hear a million sad stoners gasp in horror ) .
Our favorite part of this news piece ?
We can just imagine some paranoid Swiss dude trying to tell his buddies , “ I swear man , they got satellites watching us .
They ’re gonna come after us man ! ! ”
Sounds a bit like me in college …
That humorous brand of justice is poetic more than anything else , and frankly - we think the Swiss police have better things to do with their time .
It ’s a strange day for technology , a sad day for our smokey friends in Switzerland .

Denise Ogden , a teacher from Augusta , Ga. , has resigned from her position following an investigation into a suspected seven - person sex scandal centered at the middle school .
Denise Ogden ’s Accusations
Investigators say Denise Ogden , who taught seventh grade classes at Augusta ’s Spirit Creek Middle School , had been having sexual relations with other educators during the day on the school grounds .
In all , seven faculty members are under investigation .
Two others — principal Sharon McAlevy and public safety officer Ronnie Collins — have resigned from the school as well , according to local media reports .
The four remaining educators believed to be involved in some capacity include two other teachers , a PE coach , and a graduation coach .
They are all still employed by the district and the extent of their alleged involvement is not clear .
Teacher Sex Scandal Story
Officials say Denise Ogden actually exposed the whole thing herself by sending an e-mail to the school system , under a false name , revealing the details and also showing a photograph of another faculty member ’s underwear — apparently as “ proof ” of what had happened .
As for what did happen , officials at the school district believe some of the faculty had set up an inflatable mattress inside the school ’s Public Safety office .
A second room is also believed to have been used .
To further complicate things , school leaders have indicated a love child has also resulted from the various trysts , though it ’s not yet clear to which couple it might belong .
The Spirit Creek Middle School Investigation
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has been working to sort out the facts and has even conducted some polygraph tests , TV stations in the area say .
A full report is expected to be released next week .
The Georgia Professional Standards Commission will ultimately decide whether Denise Ogden and the others will be able to keep their teaching licenses .

Officials spoke about the Spirit Creek Middle School scandal and the involvement of Denise Ogden , Sharon McAlevy , and the other faculty members this week .
Below is a news report with highlights from their discussions .
ATHENS , Greece ( CNN ) --
A manhunt was under way Sunday for two inmates who escaped a maximum - security prison when a helicopter plucked them from the roof , Greek officials said .
The escape played out like a Hollywood action film and was the second such flight to freedom by one of the men .
It began at about 3:30 p.m. when two men hijacked a helicopter from Athens International Airport , ordering the pilot to fly to Korydallos Prison , located in a suburb of Athens , Greek state media reported .
The helicopter hovered over the roof of a prison compound where inmates Nikos Paleokostas , 42 , and Alket Riza , 34 , were located , and rope ladders were unfurled .
The prisoners climbed into the helicopter and escaped , Greece 's Justice Ministry said .
Prison guards shot at the helicopter during the escape , witnesses told local media .
No injuries were reported .
The pilot was found gagged near the helicopter north of Athens , a state - run media report said .
The inmates and the unidentified accomplices had not been located , Greek authorities said .
" I will not tolerate this embarrassment and all necessary measures will be taken , no matter how stringent they may be , " Justice Minister Nikos Dendias told CNN .
The prison break by helicopter is the second for Paleokostas , who was convicted for abducting a businessman and escaped the prison the first time in June 2006 .
He was recaptured several months later .

Federal and state authorities are reporting a growing number of financial scams that echo the alleged Madoff fraud , as strapped investors seek access to their cash amid increasingly hard times .
At least six suspected multimillion - dollar fraud cases have emerged this month alone , many of them alleged Ponzi schemes , in which investors are lured by promises of lofty returns but are actually paid off from new victims ' funds .
On Tuesday , authorities arrested Arthur Nadel , the missing Florida hedge - fund adviser , who was accused by federal authorities of defrauding clients of millions of dollars .
His arrest came as Spanish banking giant Banco Santander SA said it would offer thousands of its private - banking clients € 1.38 billion ( $ 1.82 billion ) in compensation for losses arising from investments in Bernard L. Madoff 's alleged $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme , the first financial company to do so .
Todd Foster , a lawyer for Mr. Nadel , says his client voluntarily surrendered to the authorities and is cooperating with them .
He says " we are n't in a position to comment on the criminal charges now , " adding that investment " losses do n't necessarily equate with fraud . "
In the latest case to emerge , Nicholas Cosmo , a Long Island , N.Y. , investment - firm owner , surrendered to federal authorities Monday .
Mr. Cosmo allegedly raised more than $ 370 million between 2006 and 2008 by promising investors 48 % annual returns from funding commercial loans , according to a federal affidavit in support of his arrest .
( CNN ) --
The alleged victim in a 1977 sexual assault case against director Roman Polanski has filed court papers seeking dismissal of the charges against him .
Oscar - winning director Roman Polanski has lived in exile in France since fleeing the United States in 1978 .
The woman 's declaration seeking dismissal was filed Monday in Los Angeles , California , in connection with Polanski 's efforts to have the 31 - year - old case dismissed .
Polanski , 75 , has lived in exile in France since fleeing the United States in 1978 after pleading guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse .
Polanski admitted to having sex with a 13 - year - old girl , and an arrest warrant against him remains in effect .
In her declaration , Samantha Geimer said , " I am no longer a 13 - year - old child .
I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim , have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception .
" Every time this case is brought to the attention of the Court , great focus is made of me , my family , my mother and others .
That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety , the continuation of the case . "
Geimer , who has spoken publicly about the case before , including a 2003 appearance on CNN's " Larry King Live , " added , " I have survived , indeed prevailed , against whatever harm Mr. Polanski may have caused me as a child . "
She chided the district attorney 's office for not dismissing the case earlier and for " yet once again ( giving ) great publicity to the lurid details of those events , for all to read again .
True as they may be , the continued publication of those details cause harm to me ... I have become a victim of the actions of the District Attorney . "
The Los Angeles County District Attorney 's office had no immediate response to Geimer 's declaration .
Lawyers for the Oscar - winning film director filed a motion for dismissal of the sex offense case against him in December , citing what the defense called " extraordinary new evidence " of " repeated , unlawful and unethical misconduct " by the Los Angeles district attorney 's office and the judge in Polanski 's case .
The December motion also argued that Polanski should not be required to return to the United States to appear in court for the dismissal motion to be considered .
In her declaration , Geimer said if Polanski cannot appear in court , she will do so to seek dismissal .
" My position is absolutely clear , " she said .
Polanski's motion for dismissal is scheduled for a hearing on January 21 .
Polanski , a native of Poland , won the Academy Award in 2003 for his Holocaust drama , " The Pianist . "
Among his other films from earlier in his career are " Rosemary 's Baby " and " Chinatown . "
His first wife , actress Sharon Tate , was murdered by the Charles Manson family in 1969 .

Albatross and other birds can get caught in fishing lines and drown
The outlook for endangered seabirds looks better thanks to a scheme that reduces the numbers accidentally killed by the fishing industry .
Three - quarters of albatross species are at risk of extinction , largely due to the way long lines are deployed to catch fish such as tuna .
The animals are attracted to the baited lines and can become entangled and pulled underwater to their deaths .
A South African initiative shows how the lines can be made safer .
The Albatross Task Force ( ATF ) project was launched in 2006 and last year it cut the number of birds killed in South African fisheries by 85 % .
FROM THE BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC World Service The UK Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) now hopes the scheme could be expanded to other countries .
One of the organisers Meidad Goren said : " Fishermen now understand that in order to continue fishing they must avoid killing seabirds , and are very cooperative . "
Permit conditions
The task force - which is a joint effort by the RSPB and Birdlife International - placed specialist instructors on fishing boats to show fishermen how to prevent birds becoming entangled .
Changing entrenched attitudes and practices is a slow process
Dr Ross Wanless
Birdlife International
The main technique involves attaching brightly coloured streamers known as tori lines to the back of vessels .
These flap in the wind and scare the birds away from the baited lines .
Fishermen are also encouraged to set their lines at night , when bird activity is limited , and to find new ways to weigh the lines down more effectively so that bait sinks out of reach more quickly .
Crews have an added incentive to comply because since last year the conditions for obtaining a fishing permit stipulate that no more than 25 birds may be caught as " by - catch " during trips .
Dr Ross Wanless , coordinator of the Birdlife programme in Africa , said : " We have to adopt an ecosystem approach to fisheries to minimise the impacts of fishing on non-target species , including seabirds .
" Changing entrenched attitudes and practices is a slow process , but the ATF has shown that by working with government and industry , change is possible . "
The Prince of Wales , who is a passionate conservationist , will hear about the albatross scheme first hand on Monday during a reception at Clarence House .

4 DVDs said to be bundled with 4 manga volumes starting this summer
The unofficial Neko to Negima ! to Seiyū - san site reports that Kodansha producer Yoichi Ishimoto announced a second series of Negima !
Magister Negi Magi original anime DVDs ( OADs ) in a Negima !
event in Tokyo on Wednesday .
Starting this summer , the second series will reportedly ship on four DVDs that will be bundled with limited editions of four manga volumes from Ken Akamatsu .
If sales are good , there will be plans for a theatrical film adaptation .
The new series will cover the Mahō Sekai story arc .
Akiyuki Shinbo will direct the animators at Shaft as he did for the first Mahō Sensei Negima ! : Shiroki Tsubasa Ala Alba OAD series .
Similarly , Noboru Jitsuhara will return from the first series to design the characters and oversee the animation production process .
The three volumes in the first series reportedly sold a total of 245,000 copies .

Whether video or printed , advertisements only have moments to engage the viewer / reader and convey an enormous amount of information .
Therefore they can be a great benefit to science - fiction films which have complex societal or technological backstories essential to the core plot , but which are a potential drag on pushing the narrative forward .
Apart from this practical consideration , the scope for humour and societal satire is immense when inventing ads in this particular genre .
Robocop writers Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner admit that they strip - mined the rich vein of satire – much of which is contained in commercials – in the UK Judge Dredd comic ( created by John Wagner and artist Carlos Ezquerra ) .
Dredd ‘s incisive take on advertising culture has spread through Robocop not only into that film ’s sequels but also into a number of other SF movies since , including many by Robocop director Paul Verhoeven and his Total Recall collaborator Arnold Schwarzenegger .

On February 3 , the Indian government will unveil a $ 10 educational laptop intended to bring computing to the masses , reports the Times of India .
By comparison , a computer - shaped cake pan is $ 20 plus shipping in the U.S.
Will the $ 10 PC revolutionize educational computing ?
First , the specs :
Like a lot of cheap PCs , the device will sport 2GB of RAM , Wi-Fi and expandable hardware , and operate on a modest two watts of power .
The current prototype can be produced for about $ 20 , according to India ’s Secretary for Higher Education , R.P. Agarwal .
Large - scale production runs should cut that price in half , he said , resulting in the $ 10 figure the government is touting .
That ’s about one tenth the cost of the cheapest available PCs in the U.S. that retail for about $ 100 , and operate on the old razor - and - blade business model ; they require costly subscriptions to mobile broadband subscriptions .
The Indian government has n’t broken down the cost of its components , but it probably cut the costs of research and development substantially by recruiting university students to help draw up the plans .
Students at the Vellore Institute of Technology played a significant role , working with state - funded organizations like the Indian Institute of Science , Bangalore and a partially - public entity called the Semiconductor Complex .
Despite a publicly - funded development , the notebooks themselves will be manufactured on contract by private companies .
According to the Times of India , the $ 10 laptop is a direct response to the MIT - developed nonprofit One Laptop Per Child program , that was viewed as grossly expensive in India .
The OLPC devices cost about $ 100 each , but “ hidden costs ” bring that price up to around $ 200 .
OLPC has also been a victim of its own poor strategy , evidenced by recent layoffs and a failure to secure donations and orders in 2008 .
The program has also seen itself dwarfed by Intel ’s [ INTC ]

India ’s education ministry has reportedly made deals with four publishers ( Macmillan , Tata McGraw Hill , Prentice - Hall and Vikas Publishing ) to provide digital textbooks and content on the $ 10 laptops , some of which will be accessible for free .
This cute litle Barbary lion cub is called ‘ Lily ’ .
Lily is Belfast Zoo ’s newsest arrival and she was born on June 3rd 2007 weighing a tiny 1.4kg .
In comparsion , her father ‘ Qays ’ is a whopping 300 kg in weight .
Lily was unfortunately rejected by her mother soon after she was born , and has had to be hand - reared ever since by zoo keeper ‘ Linda Frew ’ .
Lily ’s birth is very important , as Barbary lions are now extinct in the wild and therefore zoos are the only hope for their future survival .

Engineered Osmosis : Revolutionizing Saltwater Desalination
February 22nd , 2009 by Timothy B. Hurst
A Cambridge , Massachusetts - based desalination start up has closed on a $ 10 million round of funding to develop its proprietary technology to produce clean , potable water from salt water using one tenth the amount of energy used in traditional desalination plants .
As we reported last month , Yale researchers Rob McGinnis and Dr. Menachem Elimelech have developed a proprietary desalination system called Engineered Osmosis that they say could produce clean drinking water from seawater or other wastewater at half the current cost .
Now that their new company —
Oasys Water — has secured Series A funding , it can proceed with the development of its potentially revolutionary commercial desalination platform .
Company officials claim the Engineered Osmosis ( EO ) process can produce drinking water at less than half the cost of current desalination methods by eliminating the need the for high - pressures used in modern Reverse Osmosis systems , thereby cutting electricity and fuel demands by more than 90 % .
The result is a reduction in the economics of seawater desalination that will ultimately bring the cost of producing water from the ocean below the cost of conventional surface water , such as that used in California ’s aquaduct system .
“ Water shortages are no longer a ‘ far - away ’ problem , ” said Aaron Mandell , President and CEO of Oasys , in a statement .
Mendell noted that the ongoing drought in California , coupled with the fact water production is already the single largest use of California ’s electrical grid , makes such developments so timely .
Company officials also see the tremendous potential EO can have in parts of the developing world , where severe water shortages are on the rise , resulting in large - scale political and social conflict .
According to the World Health Organization , 2.4 billion of the world ’s 6.8 billion people now live in highly water - stressed areas .
“ Oasys has developed a truly disruptive technology to address the growing global water crisis , ” said Jim Matheson of Flagship Ventures , one of the projects financiers .
As with so many of the promising clean technologies , one only hopes that the excessive demand in global markets does not prevent Engineered Osmosis and other low - energy intensive desalination technologies from getting where they could have the greatest impact .

In case the revelation of Konami 's upcoming Metal Gear Solid Touch was n't enough to convince you to finally buy an iPhone , Electronic Arts just sent along word that the highly anticipated port of SimCity reached the App Store this morning .
This latest version of Will Wright 's classic city - building title is priced at $ 10 and takes full advantage of the iPhone 's touch - sensitive screen .
I 'm a bit too busy to spend a few hours testing the thing right at the moment , but , assuming the App Store description and screenshots are accurate , the iPhone port seems to retain all the widely beloved features of its PC predecessors .
Yes Virginia , that includes the player - initiated disasters .

Kingdom of God begins with change .
Christians are called to rule and reign .
Disciples of Christ they are part of a priesthood of kings called to restore and advance the Kingdom of God .
This is the “ unity of the faith ” spoken by the Apostle Paul . [ 1 ]
Not only was Jesus the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world he was also the Restoring King that would perfect his followers for the work of the ministry .
When the anointing came on Jesus he made a prophetic announcement saying , “ The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel ” ( Mark 1:15 ) .
In other words , Christ launched a revolutionary Kingdom Movement .
This movement was not about getting people to ‘ accept Jesus ’ as their savior ( a term not found in the Bible ) but joining him in restoring the rule of God on the earth through his covenant people . [ 2 ]
When you were born again you became a new creature in Christ Jesus and part of a priesthood of ruling citizens Christ could use to advance His reign .
Apostle Peter wrote , “ But ye are a chosen generation , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a peculiar people ; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light ” ( 1 Peter 2:9 ) .
He is drawing from an Old Testament decree of the LORD ruling through His people , “ And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation ” ( Exodus 19:6 ) .
The word “ kingdom ” is malkuth meaning dominion , reign , realm , kingdom , and sovereignty .
The same word is closely related to mâlak meaning to be king and ruler , to make king and ruler , or to become king and ruler .
So you can see your part as a “ dominion of priest ” destined to reign . [ 3 ]
THE KING’S DOMINION
Reigning is different than escaping .
It ’s evident in scripture that Christ never intended to save you so you could escape this world .
[ 4 ]
In fact , He saved you so you could overcome the world .
John declared , “ For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world : and this is the victory that overcometh the world , even our faith ” ( 1 John 5:4 ) .
This is not just faith that believes that Jesus is but faith that joins Christ ’s kingdom revolution .
Many believe that Jesus is the Christ but never do anything to make a difference with their lives .
You are not like that and are part of a dominion of priest advancing Christ ’s kingly reign .
The ministry of Christ is not yet finished and there is still much to do .
“ For he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet ” ( 1 Corinthians 15:25 ) .
The enemies of Christ are opposing the dominion of God.
Nevertheless , Christ has a faithful remnant serving him in their generation .
This remnant understands the words kingdom , dominion , rule , reign , and restoration .
Here is an example using the words kingdom , rule , and restoration .
“ Then said Samuel to the people , Come and let us go to Gilgal and renew ( restore ) the kingdom ( malkuth ) there .
And all the people went to Gilgal and there they made Saul king ( mâlak ) before the LORD ... “ ( 1 Samuel 11:14 - 15 ) .
Here the prophet gives instructions to God ’s kingdom of priests to restore the LORD ’S reign in Gilgal .
“ Renew , ” châdash means to repair , renew and restore .
SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY
KINGS RUSH IN
The word kingdom suggests a territory or kingdom governed by a king .
Notice in this text the scope of the LORD ’S influence seems to be confined to a people group within a specific territory .
This does n’t mean that God is not sovereign of the world but simply describes a particular group of people ( a royal priesthood of kings , a holy nation ) and a territory ( Gilgal ) “ under the influence of the LORD through His royal priesthood . ”
Samuel also uses the word renew as a specific ministry directive .
This is interesting because it implies that this territory was once under the rule of the LORD but somehow became ruled by another .
Understanding “ the earth is the Lord ’s and the fullness thereof ” brings substance to the restoration ( renewal ) of the Kingdom of God in Gilgal .
It also confirms that God created the heavens and the earth giving dominion to Adam who later committed high treason thus surrendering his kingship to the serpent .
To restore a territory under the leadership of Christ requires a people submitted to the authority of Christ that carries their king ’s values , beliefs , laws and culture into the territory .
Christ said it like this , “ Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you ” ( Matthew 6:33 ) .
This means placing yourself under the authority of Christ while following His instructions for living .
Saul was a type and shadow of the kingship of Christ ruling in a territory through a priesthood of kings .
Christ exercises
His kingly rule among men .
He is not just King of Israel but the world , even though , the world does not recognize His rule .
It does n’t matter because Christ ’s only permits a measure of mâlak ( rule ) to nation states .
He can change their status whenever he wishes .
[ 5 ]
The law of kingdoms declares that kingdoms come and kingdoms go .
There is only one kingdom that is ever expanding and unstoppable and that is the Kingdom of God.
Scripture declares , “ But the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever , even for ever and ever ” ( Daniel 7:18 ) .

People always lament the decline of those quaint mom-and - pop stores as big chains like Target and Wal - Mart dominate the holidays with impossible - to - beat price margins and robust online sites that spare you the ordeal of interpersonal communication .
But here 's something no one considers :
What if mom-and - pop are total lunatics ?
What if the mere act of stepping foot in their store endangers you ?
What if that little , locally owned store is where the Christmas Spirit goes to die ?
At least in Costco you 're safe .
There are witnesses .
Judging by these local TV ads , such small businesses ( ones that the Grinch himself may call " a bit over the top " ) do exist .
Which calls to mind a platitude that mom always reminds me of around the holidays : Better to get a lump of coal than a lead - painted tea set .

NEW YORK , Feb. 21 ( UPI ) -- U.S. financial investigators allege trader Bernard L. Madoff never invested his clients ' money in stocks listed on account statements dating back to 1993 .
The findings demolish the theory Madoff was an honest money manager driven to fraud by a volatile stock market , The New York Times reported Saturday .

The findings were delivered Friday by Iawyer Irving Picard , a court - appointed trustee whose team of investigators searched records dating to 1993 and found no evidence Madoff invested any of his clients ' money in securities , the Times reported .
The pattern of alleged fraud probably stretches back even further , Irving told an emotional public meeting packed with angry creditors .
Investigators have a " pretty good idea " of how Madoff made his scheme work but they could not discuss it because of the continuing criminal investigation , Irving said .
Madoff was charged with securities fraud in December after allegedly confessing his business was a fraud whose losses could be as high as $ 50 billion .
He remains under 24 - hour house arrest in his New York City penthouse .

For a long time we ’ve been struggling to manage the growing presence of JavaScript at 37signals .
We needed a way to share common JavaScript components and behaviors across our applications and web sites .
And we wanted the ability to organize our JavaScript source code into multiple files and folders without the overhead of including dozens of < script > tags on every page .
So we scratched the itch by creating Sprockets .
Sprockets is a Ruby library that preprocesses and concatenates JavaScript source files .
It takes any number of source files and preprocesses them line - by - line in order to build a single concatenation .
Specially formatted lines act as directives to the Sprockets preprocessor , telling it to require the contents of another file or library first or to provide a set of asset files ( such as images or stylesheets ) to the document root .
Sprockets attempts to fulfill required dependencies by searching a set of directories called the load path .
It helps you turn messy JavaScript into clean modules for development and a single .js file for deployment .
A new look for the former president ?
George W Bush has paid a jokey visit to a hardware store in Dallas , Texas , which offered him a job as a greeter .
The former US president entered the Elliott 's outlet with his security detail saying " I 'm looking for a job " , store manager Andrea Bond said .
The owner of the Texas chain made the offer earlier this month in a letter published in a Dallas newspaper .
But despite not yet having a publisher for his memoirs , Mr Bush decided on reflection to turn the job down .
Equipped with a name tag reading " W " , Mr Bush spent an hour there with his secret service security detail , chatting to customers and doing a little shopping .
Employee discount
Described as part - time , the job would have left Mr Bush time to work on his presidential library and write about his two terms at the White House .
" We 're confident that your experience working in your own family business , as well as your people skills developed throughout years of meeting with foreign dignitaries would make you an excellent candidate for the position , " read the job offer , signed by Kyle Walters , president and CEO of Elliott 's Hardware .
" Furthermore , like you , many of our greeters are retired from the corporate world , so we 're sure you 'll have no trouble making new friends . "
The employment package also offered parking for his security detail and an employee discount .
" We think you 'll find working with us much less stressful than your last job , " the offer continued .
Mr Bush and his wife Laura moved into their new home in an expensive area of Dallas on Friday .
They have kept their ranch at Crawford , Texas .
Google , the company that always seems to be hiring , has finally started firing .
And it 's starting with the people responsible for the hiring .
The search giant said today that it planned to let go about 100 recruiters .
The cuts were first reported by Valleywag and quickly confirmed on the Official Google Blog by Laszlo Bock , the company 's vice president of people operations .
Bock wrote :
As we made clear during our last quarterly earnings call in October , Google is still hiring but at a reduced rate .
Given the state of the economy , we recognized that we needed fewer people focused on hiring .
Our first step to address this was to wind down almost all our contracts with external contractors and vendors providing recruiting services for Google .
However , after much consideration , we have with great regret decided that we need to go further and reduce the overall size of our recruiting organization by approximately 100 positions .
What 's more , Google said in another post ( blogs are apparently supplanting e-mail as the preferred method of disseminating corporate news ) that it was closing engineering offices in Austin , Texas ; Trondheim , Norway ; and Lulea , Sweden .

The right to criticise religion is being slowly doused in acid .
Across the world , the small , incremental gains made by secularism – giving us the space to doubt and question and make up our own minds – are being beaten back by belligerent demands that we " respect " religion .
A historic marker has just been passed , showing how far we have been shoved .
The UN rapporteur who is supposed to be the global guardian of free speech has had his job rewritten – to put him on the side of the religious censors .
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights stated 60 years ago that " a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief is the highest aspiration of the common people " .
It was a Magna Carta for mankind – and loathed by every human rights abuser on earth .
Today , the Chinese dictatorship calls it " Western " , Robert Mugabe calls it " colonialist " , and Dick Cheney calls it " outdated " .
The countries of the world have chronically failed to meet it – but the document has been held up by the United Nations as the ultimate standard against which to check ourselves .
Until now .
Starting in 1999 , a coalition of Islamist tyrants , led by Saudi Arabia , demanded the rules be rewritten .
The demand for everyone to be able to think and speak freely failed to " respect " the " unique sensitivities " of the religious , they decided – so they issued an alternative Islamic Declaration of Human Rights .
It insisted that you can only speak within " the limits set by the shariah [ law ] .
It is not permitted to spread falsehood or disseminate that which involves encouraging abomination or forsaking the Islamic community " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In other words , you can say anything you like , as long as it precisely what the reactionary mullahs tell you to say .
The declaration makes it clear there is no equality for women , gays , non-Muslims , or apostates .
It has been backed by the Vatican and a bevy of Christian fundamentalists .
Incredibly , they are succeeding .
The UN's Rapporteur on Human Rights has always been tasked with exposing and shaming those who prevent free speech – including the religious .
But the Pakistani delegate recently demanded that his job description be changed so he can seek out and condemn " abuses of free expression " including " defamation of religions and prophets " .
The council agreed – so the job has been turned on its head .
Instead of condemning the people who wanted to murder Salman Rushdie , they will be condemning Salman Rushdie himself .
Anything which can be deemed " religious " is no longer allowed to be a subject of discussion at the UN – and almost everything is deemed religious .
Roy Brown of the International Humanist and Ethical Union has tried to raise topics like the stoning of women accused of adultery or child marriage .
The Egyptian delegate stood up to announce discussion of shariah " will not happen " and " Islam will not be crucified in this council " – and Brown was ordered to be silent .
Of course , the first victims of locking down free speech about Islam with the imprimatur of the UN are ordinary Muslims .
Here is a random smattering of events that have taken place in the past week in countries that demanded this change .
In Nigeria , divorced women are routinely thrown out of their homes and left destitute , unable to see their children , so a large group of them wanted to stage a protest – but the Shariah police declared it was " un -Islamic " and the marchers would be beaten and whipped .
In Saudi Arabia , the country 's most senior government - approved cleric said it was perfectly acceptable for old men to marry 10 - year - old girls , and those who disagree should be silenced .
In Egypt , a 27 - year - old Muslim blogger Abdel Rahman was seized , jailed and tortured for arguing for a reformed Islam that does not enforce shariah .
To the people who demand respect for Muslim culture , I ask : which Muslim culture ?
Those women's , those children's , this blogger 's – or their oppressors ' ?
As the secular campaigner Austin Darcy puts it : " The ultimate aim of this effort is not to protect the feelings of Muslims , but to protect illiberal Islamic states from charges of human rights abuse , and to silence the voices of internal dissidents calling for more secular government and freedom . "
Those of us who passionately support the UN should be the most outraged by this .
Underpinning these " reforms " is a notion seeping even into democratic societies – that atheism and doubt are akin to racism .
Today , whenever a religious belief is criticised , its adherents immediately claim they are the victims of " prejudice " – and their outrage is increasingly being backed by laws .
All people deserve respect , but not all ideas do .
I do n't respect the idea that a man was born of a virgin , walked on water and rose from the dead .
I do n't respect the idea that we should follow a " Prophet " who at the age of 53 had sex with a nine - year old girl , and ordered the murder of whole villages of Jews because they would n't follow him .
I do n't respect the idea that the West Bank was handed to Jews by God and the Palestinians should be bombed or bullied into surrendering it .
I do n't respect the idea that we may have lived before as goats , and could live again as woodlice .
This is not because of " prejudice " or " ignorance " , but because there is no evidence for these claims .
They belong to the childhood of our species , and will in time look as preposterous as believing in Zeus or Thor or Baal .
When you demand " respect " , you are demanding we lie to you .
I have too much real respect for you as a human being to engage in that charade .
But why are religious sensitivities so much more likely to provoke demands for censorship than , say , political sensitivities ?
The answer lies in the nature of faith .
If my views are challenged I can , in the end , check them against reality .
If you deregulate markets , will they collapse ?
If you increase carbon dioxide emissions , does the climate become destabilised ?
If my views are wrong , I can correct them ; if they are right , I am soothed .
But when the religious are challenged , there is no evidence for them to consult .
By definition , if you have faith , you are choosing to believe in the absence of evidence .
Nobody has " faith " that fire hurts , or Australia exists ; they know it , based on proof .
But it is psychologically painful to be confronted with the fact that your core beliefs are based on thin air , or on the empty shells of revelation or contorted parodies of reason .
It 's easier to demand the source of the pesky doubt be silenced .
But a free society cannot be structured to soothe the hardcore faithful .
It is based on a deal .
You have an absolute right to voice your beliefs – but the price is that I too have a right to respond as I wish .
Neither of us can set aside the rules and demand to be protected from offence .
Yet this idea – at the heart of the Universal Declaration – is being lost .
To the right , it thwacks into apologists for religious censorship ; to the left , it dissolves in multiculturalism .
The hijacking of the UN Special Rapporteur by religious fanatics should jolt us into rescuing the simple , battered idea disintegrating in the middle : the equal , indivisible human right to speak freely .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A brain surgeon performed what he called a " life - saving " surgery on a teenager by removing a large brain tumor using a method he read about on CNN.com just three days earlier .
Dr. Thomas Ellis is a senior neurosurgeon at Wake Forest University in North Carolina .
Dr. Thomas Ellis , a senior neurosurgeon at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina , the United States , said he had become " very demoralized " after an unsuccessful six - hour operation to remove a tumor from a 19 - year - old named Brandon .
" I had had to give the boy 's mother the bad news and that is not something I am used to .
She was crying and it was very hard .
Your story truly came at the perfect time , " Ellis said .
" I am inclined to believe that it is the work of God that I came across your article that very night , " the surgeon told CNN .
The article was about the " Omni directional dielectric mirror , " a pen-shaped fiber - optic tool that allows surgeons to carry out minimally invasive surgery on areas too difficult or delicate to access .
That night , Ellis contacted the neurosurgeon quoted in the story who put him in touch with Omni Guide , the Boston , Massachusetts - based company that manufactures the handheld device .
It was originally devised for the U.S. military , and rolled out for surgeries three months before Ellis read about it .
The tool allows surgeons to easily manipulate a CO2 laser and bend it to reach almost any tissue in the body , particularly in cases where scalpels may pose a danger .
" Seventy - two hours later I held the device in my hands , " Ellis explained .
" Omni Guide sent someone to do a demo .
I was extremely impressed and excited and very quickly I pretty much got the hang of it . "
Vital Signs Each month CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta brings viewers health stories from around the world .

Ellis added : " I think it 's an amazing story because it's yet another demonstration of how interconnected we 've become in this world .
" You have a CNN reporter in London , who writes a story about a neurosurgeon in Chicago , who 's using a device that was invented in Massachusetts .
That story is read by a different neurosurgeon in North Carolina , and all within 72 hours , we have the device in North Carolina .
" We have the patient lined up for a surgery , and in the span of just a few days we perform really a life - saving operation on this patient . "
Ellis first met Brandon on December 17 , 2008 , when his mother took him to the emergency department at Wake Forest Hospital suffering from what Ellis calls , " an extremely rapid decline in basic functions . "
" While he had been suffering from minor symptoms for about a year , he suddenly acquired terrible headaches and became very confused . "
Ellis ordered an immediate MRI scan of Brandon 's skull and found an extremely large tumor , known as a teratoma , in the middle of his brain .
Read an explainer about teratomas
He operated two days later , but despite spending six hours in the operating room and going through half a dozen scalpels , he only managed to remove 20 percent of the tumor .
" In 15 years of doing neurosurgery , it really was the most difficult tumor that I ever encountered .
It was very rubbery and hard to debulk , " he said .
" I wish I could demonstrate the firmness of the tumor that we were dealing with but it really was the case that after trying to dissect the tumor just five minutes with each scalpel , the scalpel would be dull and I would have to move on to use another scalpel .
" I went through at least a half - dozen of them , and even after many , many hours of operating on this tumor with multiple scalpels with multiple microsurgical - dissecting tools , I could n't remove very much of this tumor . "
Ellis advised the boy 's mother , Tania , who asked we only give her first name , that her son would have to go through radiation treatment .
Unlike chemotherapy , which involves the use of anticancer drugs , radiation treatment employs high - energy rays and particles to kill cancer cells .
" Radiation therapy is a difficult process , especially for such a large tumor , " Ellis said .
He explained that he was feeling despondent about the patient 's condition when he got home after the operation that night .
" Being the father of four children myself , just the thought of having to go through something like this with one of my own children is just beyond words , " he said .
" As I do every night , I read CNN online and immediately saw on the front page that there was an article in the health section entitled , From military device to life - saving surgical tool .
...
Read the original CNN.com story
" I finished the rest of the story and my first thought was : I would have given anything to have this tool available six or seven hours ago based on the description in the story .
" Lasers have long been abandoned in neurosurgery , " he said , " because they were too cumbersome to use .
But CNN spoke of a brain operation performed by a Dr. Bernard Bendok in Chicago with CO2 laser and this new easy - to - use , perfect mirror tool . "
The following day , on Christmas Eve , Ellis along with Dr. Tamir Wolf , a physician OmniGuide sent to assist , brought Brandon back to the operating room .
" After only 30 minutes , it was clear this laser device , as simple to use as a scalpel , was successfully debulking the tumor . "
Ellis operated on Brandon for four hours and managed to remove the remaining 80 percent of the tumor by vaporizing it from the inside with the laser and then excising it .
" The boy was then extubated [ removing the tube to his airway ] after about 30 minutes and that same evening he was eating normally , " Wolf said .
Brandon has recovered his basic functions and is behaving normally .
" I am very optimistic and so is his mother , although we still have to be careful and do regular check - ups to look for possible spreading of the tumor , " Ellis said .
He believes that " at the least , this device will become a valuable new tool for surgeons .
But it may actually usher in a new generation of neurosurgeons who do microsurgery very differently . "
" Either way , this type of success story is what we neurosurgeons live for . "
PHOENIX  Calling Mexican drug trafficking organizations “ a national security threat , ” Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announced Wednesday that federal authorities had mounted their biggest assault against one of Mexico ’s most powerful drug cartels .
More than 750 people nationwide have been arrested , tons of cocaine and marijuana have been seized and the distribution of drugs has been disrupted through a series of raids and arrests as part of an investigation begun under the Bush administration 21 months ago , Mr. Holder said .
The operation comes at a time of rising concern over Mexico ’s drug violence and the reach of trafficking organizations into the United States .
It has focused on the Sinaloa cartel and culminated with a wave of arrests , unsealed indictments and seizures on Tuesday and early Wednesday in California , Maryland and Minnesota .
The Sinaloa organization , based in Sinaloa State in northwest Mexico , is one of the oldest cartels and has been blamed for a large share of the spiraling violence in the country that has left more than 6,000 people dead in the past year amid turf wars and a government crackdown on their operations .
Morris F. Collen , M.D. , is a pioneer in harnessing the vast power of computers to improve healthcare .
He is hip - deep in studying the ways that prescription drugs could interact and harm the elderly .
He ’s hard at work on his sixth book .
But he just might be most proud of his brand new driver ’s license .
“ Can I show you something you ’ll never see again ? ” Collen asks , reaching for his well - used billfold .
He pulls out the rectangle of pedestrian plastic .
He points to the date of birth : 11-12 - 13 .
He points to the expiration date : 11-12 -13 .
He grins .
“ The one is in the 20th century , ” he says , tickled still .
“ The other is in the 21st century .
That represents 100 years .
When I looked at that , I said , ‘ My God , that ’s probably the only one in the country . ’ ”

Why does a 95 - year - old need a license , one that ’s just been re-upped for another five years ?
So he can drive to work , of course .
Collen is part of an elite fraternity -- above and beyond his 11 - page resume with its 193 publications and his place as one of Kaiser Permanente ’s founding physicians .
Nonagenarians make up less than one quarter of 1 % of California drivers .
Less than one third of 1 % of Americans age 95 and above work for compensation .
It is difficult to discern how many work for free , and harder still to figure out how many work and drive .
When Collen earned his bachelor ’s degree in electrical engineering in 1934 , the first computer was a dozen years in the future .
When he earned his medical degree five years later , penicillin had yet to be discovered .
He and Bobbie Diner wed in secret and lived apart for two years , because back in 1937 some hospitals fired nurses for marrying .
Mandatory retirement was legal when Collen hit 70 , so he stepped down as head of Kaiser Permanente ’s Division of Research and has consulted -- gratis -- for a generation since .

The healthcare giant is happy Collen does .
“ He ’s doing cutting - edge research on information technology and computers , ” says Robert Pearl , M.D. , chief executive of The Permanente Medical Group .
“ He ’s a systems thinker , a technologic thinker .
He ’s unique for a 45 - year - old .
He ’s really unique for a 95 - year - old . ”
For his part , Collen is happy to pile into his 10 - year - old Oldsmobile Intrigue , complete with duct tape on the right rear window , and head to the Oakland - based Division of Research every Wednesday morning .
It is an 18 - mile commute from his cramped ( he calls it “ efficient ” ) unit at Sunrise Assisted Living of Walnut Creek .
He spends a lot of the drive in the fast lane , zipping along at just over the speed limit .

“ I do not ask for pay from KP because I want to be free to do whatever I want to do , ” he said in a recent e-mail -- his favorite mode of communication .
“ I do what I do because I love it , and because it helps to keep the marbles rolling in my head ! ”

Seven men and one woman sit around a table in a windowless gray meeting room in downtown Oakland on a Wednesday morning in November .
On the wall is a giant banner celebrating the “ Morris F. Collen , M.D. Research Library and Conference Center . ”
“ Dr. Morris Collen continues to work at the Division of Research with Principal Investigator Joe Terdiman in development of the National Research Data Base , ” the banner says .
“ The project is testing and evaluating data mining methods for detecting and monitoring adverse events that occur in patient healthcare . ”

When the database is complete , it could house data on nearly 29 million Kaiser Permanente patients past and present , including some electronic records going back 40 years .
There will be federal mortality data and census information .
Terdiman , whom Collen hired in the 1960s and has worked with ever since , calls it a kind of “ one - stop shopping ” for researchers .
Collen developed Kaiser ’s very first database in the 1960s , a repository of electronic medical records that also was mined for research purposes .
It was a time when information was collected on punch cards and computers took up entire rooms .
He was the catalyst for this latest project , which Kaiser is working on with IBM , and designed several studies to be carried out beginning in 2009 with the newly compiled data .

One in particular is near and dear to his statin - assisted heart : figuring out how elderly patients are affected by the interaction of multiple drugs .
“ Every decade you add another pill , ” says Collen , who takes eight medications every day .
“ So by the ninth decade , you ’re taking about nine pills .
And I used to think , gee , if I took all those nine pills and threw them into a hot cup of coffee , what would happen ?
“ And here I throw them into my stomach , with hydrochloric acid , ” he continues .
“ Parke - Davis and each of them studies their own drugs .
They do n’t study the others . ”
The regular morning meeting of the research database project has just convened , and the task this day is to revisit a question that has nagged the group for months :
Whom to include in a study of bad drug reactions and their prevalence , when there will be millions of patients to consider , some with gaps in their Kaiser membership .
Advertisement
On the one hand , if the gap is too long , it would be impossible to know what happened to the patient during this time .
On the other , if researchers are too picky , they risk missing rare but important side effects .
With the benefit of 60 years of Kaiser history stored in his balding , freckled head , Collen comes down on the side of inclusion .
He prevails .
“ When I come here , I drop off 40 years ; I feel like a 50 - year - old , ” he says after the spirited meeting .
“ I call this my survivor therapy . ”

Collen has just arrived back at Sunrise Assisted Living , his home for the last two years and a place he regards with deep affection .
The complex has two separate buildings : his and one for residents with Alzheimer ’s disease .
“ If I live long enough , ” he adds with a wry laugh , “ I ’ll graduate . ”
Here ’s the bistro , where he gets his four or five cups of coffee a day .
And the dining room , set up like a restaurant , where he and his pal , Pete the dentist , have meals and “ watch the girls go by . ”

Collen crosses the lobby and heads for the stairs .
His fellow “ fogies ” have gathered for some live music , and the area is wall - to - wall walkers and wheelchairs .
His sole complaint : Activities tend to be “ spectator sports , ” a little tame for a guy with a car .
Collen considers the oval second floor his “ racetrack . ”
He has paced it out at about a block and tries to do 10 laps each day .
He has stopped walking outdoors -- too much rain , too much sun .
“ Here , ” he says , “ I just put my slippers on , and for me , it ’s just perfect . ”
Equally perfect is Unit 228 , all jam - packed 362 square feet of it .
There are two dressers , two desks , two filing cabinets , the bed he and Bobbie shared , a sofa , a coffee table , a bookcase , a television , boxes of files for his current book project .
Advertisement
And his computer .
For Collen , the machine is equal parts tool , entertainment system and lifeline .
He is tapping out “ The History of Medical Informatics : The Clinical Support Systems ” on it .
He uses it to watch movies , scroll through hundreds of family photos , listen to Vladimir Horowitz playing classical piano .
For the last five years he also has used it to keep in daily contact with son Barry .
Barry e-mails in the morning .
Collen responds in the evening .
If he does n’t , Barry calls .
So far , the system has worked pretty well , connecting the retired teacher in Rhode Island with his father in the tiny East Bay apartment .
Collen is sitting in his sheepskin - covered desk chair smack in the center of the studio apartment , swiveling 90 degrees at a time and pointing out the highlights .

“ I must introduce you to my family here , ” he says with a wave at the pictures above his bed , a gallery that includes four children , seven grandchildren , five great - grandchildren -- and Bobbie .
“ See , there ’s my wife .
We were married 60 years .
And you know the expression ‘ soul mate ’ ?
She was . ”
The black - and - white portrait shows a handsome woman in her 50th year , with a direct gaze and a confident smile .
There is a single plastic rose taped to the frame .
Collen recounts his daily ritual .
“ I say good night [ to Bobbie ] and I say good morning , ” he says , tearing up , halting .
“ You see that red rose ?
She loved red roses .
And when she died , I put 60 .
One for each year .
On her grave .
Buried with her . ”

Bobbie was a nurse , a poet and , as he puts it , “ a piece of cheesecake ! ”
She died at home in 1996 , after a long battle with Parkinson ’s disease and the dementia that often accompanies it .
Collen took care of her to the end and for the next decade remained alone in their 4,000 - square - foot house on three acres .
“ I ’d come home and open a can of kidney beans and throw the can away , and that was my dinner , ” he says .
Then one night , he came down with a serious stomach ailment .
He vomited and became dangerously dehydrated .
One night slipped into two as he lay there , wondering whether to call 911 .
“ Finally , it cleared , ” he recounts .
“ But that made me realize that living alone at my age was foolish . ”

Collen likes to say that he inherited his father ’s body and passed it along to son Barry -- the skinny arms and legs , the old man ’s pot belly , the creaky heart .
Barry describes that heart as “ golden ” ; Collen knows it requires careful attention .
He also knows it is proof of the leaps medical science has taken in the seven decades since he got his degree .
“ I ’ll never forget when I was a young physician , 50 , 60 years ago , ” Collen recounts .
“ And a man in his 50s came in .
He said , ‘ You know , my father died of a heart attack at 60 .
My older brother died of a heart attack at 60 . . .
Am I going to die of a heart attack at 60 ?’
Advertisement
“ Well , his lipids were way up , and I knew he would , ” Collen continues .
“ I told him , ‘ Well , be careful , keep your weight down , exercise .
And that was all , all we could do . ”
It ’s a story that hits home for Collen .
His father , a grocer in St. Paul , Minn. , died at age 67 after heart attack No. 2 .
When he himself was 70 , he had a funny feeling in his chest .
His own physician had lots more ammunition than Collen did as a young doctor .
He gave Collen an angiogram and then an angioplasty to rout out a 90 % - blocked main artery .
Collen has since had a pacemaker put in .
“ Modern technology and modern Permanente medicine has given me 25 years , ” he says .
“ I keep saying , you ’ve just got to live long enough , and you see wonderful things happen . ”

Q :
Did you pee in the fishbowl again ?
A :
That ’s an excellent question and I want to thank you for the opportunity to sit and talk with you at the Lego table .
I ’ve always felt that the hardworking taxpayers of this household deserve straight answers regarding their fishbowl urination - related concerns .
My opponent and older brother , Tyler , in an effort to distract the parents of this household from the real issues — like the still unanswered questions regarding the whereabouts of Mom ’s scissors — has brought up the issue of my misguided urination adventures .
But what he does n’t tell you is that not only did he support fishbowl - peeing programs with irresponsible double - dog daring , but , in addition , he ’s had his own history of inappropriate urination .
My opponent remains out of touch on such vital issues as the continued presence of MONSTERS IN MY CLOSET and their suspected advance to the area under my bed .
Here are the facts :
My opponent has , in the past , engaged in peeing in such locations as the bathtub , the clothes hamper , and even his own crib .
In addition , my opponent — in spite of aggressive efforts to line his pockets through “ allowance reform ” — continues his habits of reckless spending , which include undisclosed earmarks to the fat cats of the video - gaming and candy industries .
He ’s also remained out of touch on such vital issues as the continued presence of monsters in my closet and their suspected advance to the area under my bed .
I say it ’s a time for a change of leadership in this household .
It ’s time for a leader who can be counted as an advocate for transparency regarding his older brother ’s activities , a leader who will take on the pro-wedgie lobbyists in spite of painful consequences .
I want to be that leader .
But right now I want to lick some chocolate cake frosting from the mixer .
God bless you and God bless America .

S.F.'s ambiguous attitude toward brothels SEX TRAFFICKING IN SAN FRANCISCO
Health officials suspect many are brothels , and police have made some arrests , but few of the city - authorized facilities are ever shut down
Johnson Ojo ( right ) questions women as Ed Walsh records their masseuse license on Tuesday Nov. 25 , 2008 at the Moonlight Spa on Bush Street in San Francisco , Calif .

Two years after San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom called for a crackdown on brothels that front as massage parlors , city health officials say they know of more than 50 city - licensed establishments where they suspect sex is traded for money .
Yet health officials have no plans to revoke the city permits and shut them down , despite several cases where undercover officers have cited workers for soliciting sex .
One parlor continues to operate even though , during a raid , the mayor personally walked in on a man engaged in a sex act with a young woman on the lobby couch .
The sex shops exist in plain sight from the Sunset District to downtown , serving clients who walk into so - called spas , often with bathtubs , wall - to - wall mirrors and scantily clad women .
In some places , the women are willing participants ; however , San Francisco also is a sex - trafficking hub where women are forced into prostitution .
Some health department staff members say they 're frustrated .
There is only one inspector to oversee the city 's 150 sites with massage permits , and officials say they lack the legal and financial resources to aggressively pursue cases where they suspect prostitution .
And despite the mayor 's professed interest in going after the erotic massage parlors , the official line at the health department is that that the agency 's job is to look for health code violations - not stop prostitution .
" Our inspections are about following the rules for massage establishments .
We can't answer whether people are exchanging sex for money , " said Mitch Katz , director of San Francisco 's Department of Public Health .
Newsom declined to comment for this story .
A mayoral spokesman said that Katz was speaking on the mayor 's behalf .
Since even before the Gold Rush , the city has been ambivalent about the sex industry .
In 1849 , nearly two - thirds of the 300 women in San Francisco were prostitutes , according to some estimates .
And although prostitution was illegal in 1911 , the city 's health board ran a medical clinic for sex workers .
Most recently , in November , voters rejected Proposition K , which would have decriminalized prostitution .
Yet nearly 41 percent of voters - 140,185 individuals - thought sex for money should be allowed .
Health department workers who believe that part of their duty is to shut down licensed massage establishments that are actually brothels say their hands are tied .
" In a way , it feels like we have licensed brothels , but we 're stuck , " said Ed Walsh , the city 's sole massage parlor inspector .
" There are a lot of them that have permits where we suspect something is going on , and they 've had permits for years . "
In plain sight
On a recent chilly evening , Walsh and some members of an anti-sex - trafficking taskforce arrived at Double Dragon Massage at 145 Waverly Place in Chinatown .
The taskforce was convened in the summer of 2005 by Newsom and includes police officers and inspectors from the planning , building and fire departments .
Startled by the unannounced visit , several women in skimpy lingerie shifted on velvety red couches , trying to cover their bodies with towels and overcoats .
Two of them did not have massage permits .
Walsh cited them for wearing improper attire and for not having licenses .
He cited the owner for hiring unlicensed workers .
Although the Double Dragon is on the city 's " high - risk " list and , according to city law , could be closed for just one of those violations , that outcome is not likely .
Walsh works from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and is required to visit every massage establishment in the city twice a year , whether or not it is suspected of illegal activity .
He said it 's hard to prove that a particular parlor has a pattern of code violations when he has so few opportunities for repeat visits - especially in the evening hours when business picks up at the brothels .
And when he does feel like he has a strong case , there is little guarantee his own department will agree .
Under current practices , when Walsh requests a fine , suspension or permit revocation , that recommendation is reviewed by a hearing officer , who also is a city health department employee .
The officer 's guidelines are flexible , and the outcome is up to his discretion .
History indicates that it is rare for the hearing officers to close city - authorized massage parlors .
While nearly 50 parlors have closed since 2006 , only seven of them had city permits .
After federal raids , three had their permits revoked and two shut down voluntarily .
Since then two parlors were closed for planning code violations unrelated to the raids .
Yet over the same period , Walsh has issued 221 citations and collected $ 92,950 in fines against permitted operations .
So why have so few licensed shops been closed ?
Health officials said the parlor owners put up major fights , employing high - priced attorneys to help them keep their businesses .
To defend the raid - related cases , the health department used lawyers from the city attorney 's office to back up their case .
That cost about $ 500,000 to the health department budget , which is now shrinking - and so far this year has been cut by several million dollars .
Not a top priority
Katz said he believes stopping prostitution at massage establishments is the job of the Police Department .
The crime , commonly charged as a misdemeanor with minimal penalties , is understandably not a top priority for the police , either , he said .
" I think the reason there is not a more aggressive approach is that there is some reasonable ambivalence in people about prostitution and some real bureaucratic and jurisdictional issues around it , " Katz said .
Police officials say that like other vice crimes , prostitution is investigated based on public complaints .
Budget constraints also limit how many prostitution busts they can pursue , police say .
Historically , the city 's attitude toward illegal massage parlors , like its stance on prostitution , has been passive , with sporadic episodes of enforcement .
In the 1990s , new massage parlors were banned in several neighborhoods because they were seen as associated with drug sales and prostitution .
In 1998 , the Board of Supervisors banned new massage parlors in the Tenderloin , where they were - and still are - heavily concentrated .
More recently , the supervisors passed a law requiring special permits and public hearings for all new massage parlors .
San Francisco 's illegal massage business came back into the spotlight in 2005 when federal agents raided 10 parlors suspected of being central to a Bay Area sex trafficking operation involving Korean women , many of whom were duped into coming to the United States .
An estimated 100 women were removed from the locales , some of which had beds instead of massage tables , secret back doors , trap doors and hiding places .
Newsom convened the sex trafficking taskforce to conduct surprise inspections and provide information and social service referrals to women who might be held against their will .
He even went on several surprise inspections and walked in on two sex acts .
In October of this year , Newsom pleaded with voters to reject Prop. K and recounted one of the scenes .
Standing in front the Sun Spa on Geary Boulevard , one of the brothels shut down after the raids , Newsom said , " Behind me , what you see is a slavery camp .
This is a slavery brothel . "
But Sophia 's Spa - another Geary locale , where Newsom walked in on a sex act on the lobby couch - is still open for business .
Police involved
In the past two years , the Police Department has conducted about 45 investigations of massage houses .
This year , undercover officers issued 17 arrests for soliciting sex for money in the city 's licensed massage parlors .
Those businesses are also still open .
Police Lt. Mary Petrie said the police and health departments exchange information , but noted that even a solicitation arrest resulting in a conviction does not mean the business license will be revoked .
Johnson Ojo , who oversees massage businesses in the health department , said he would like to hire one more inspector and wants to beef up regulations to increase the odds that operators ' licenses will be revoked .
He said the department learned a hard lesson after the 2005 raids .
" It was very expensive and it took up a lot of everybody 's time , " Ojo said .
Ojo said he'd like there to be a rule stating that three consecutive instances of certain code violations will result in a suspension of a license or a revocation .
But Ojo's plan does n't seem likely to get much traction within the health department , which has a major budget shortfall and is not currently interested in changing its practices .
" If you want to say , ' You 'll get X punishment for Y violation , ' then you do n't need a hearing officer , " Katz said .
" They need to have discretion to hear a case and make a reasonable determination . "
Leonard E. Read , the founder of the Foundation for Economic Education in 1946 , is often heralded for his role in kick - starting the libertarian movement after World War II .
The sons of FEE went on to do great good for the world , and FEE is often called the father of all libertarian think tanks — institutions that work outside official academia to advance radical ideas .
This saved on the grueling bureaucratic struggle involved with granting permissions , and keeping up with the permissions they granted .
Asking no fees or royalties meant saving on accounting bureaucracy as well .
As he wrote : “ Freedom works its wonders simply because the generative capacity of countless millions has no external force standing against its release ! ”
Never forget that Read had a background in business .
He was head of the Chamber of Commerce in Los Angeles before founding FEE .
He must have seen countless businesses start and fail , not because they did n’t have a good product , but because people did n’t know about the product enough to go and buy it .
The critical problem that every innovator faces , after coming up with the innovation , is getting the word out .
Think of a new hamburger stand in Los Angeles .
It does n’t matter how great the burgers are ; if people do n’t know about it , it will not succeed .
Imagine if some huge fan wanted to print up t- shirts about the hamburgers .
Why in the world would the owner of the joint want to use the government to extract money from the t- shirt printer ?
That would be nuts .
And let ’s say that another burger company in town started up that used the same recipe .
What then ?
The answer is to regard the imitation as flattery , and compete in the most aggressive possible way .
It keeps you on your toes , keep you innovating , and the excitement of the competition itself can attract imitation .
And who is going to benefit the most from this struggle , the original institution or its copy ?
The answer is shown to us every day .
Originators who keep innovating benefit .
In the same way , Read saw himself in the idea business .
Why , then , would he turn to the state to restrict the flow of ideas ?
That would cut into everything he ever wanted to do .
Indeed , rather than restricting access to FEE texts , he begged the world to take them and print them and distribute them .
He wanted this more than anything else .
You will note that he was very prolific , but why ?
Because he had a lifetime burning passion to get the word out in every possible way .
He stated the freedom philosophy again and again in every way he could imagine and encouraged others to do the same .
He was an evangelist spreading the news .
He wanted to be pirated so that he could see that he was making a difference .
Thank goodness for his vision .
But please note what it means .
The modern freedom movement depended heavily on open - source materials .
It had an effect on the world because it eschewed restriction , state - means of imposing artificial scarcities , and sought above all else to get the word out .
The modern libertarian movement was born in Creative Commons and grew through that means .
Did this harm FEE ?
Quite the contrary !
It was the best thing that ever happened to the institution and to the ideas it represented .
Just as Read said , freedom worked .
The implications are profound .
This is all about practicing what you preach but there is more to it than that : it is about developing an effective tactic for spreading the truth .
It ’s a glorious thing that Read did , if only by instinct .
Would that we all had his instinct for how to rise from obscurity into prominence .

The Best of Jeffrey Tucker
Miss O'Connell became pregnant with Patrick aged 17 A 65 - year - old man has been jailed for life for killing his partner and their son before laying him out in a Viking - style ritual .
James Conan strangled Kirsty O'Connell , 21 , before stabbing her 20 times .
He then played with their four - year - old son Patrick , before smothering him .
They were found at a flat in Woolford Close , Winchester , in August 2007 .
Patrick 's body had a torch in one hand .
Conan was told he must serve a minimum of 16 years .
He pleaded guilty to murdering Miss O'Connell and to the manslaughter of Patrick , due to diminished responsibility .
The ritual nature of laying out is bizarre .
It 's as if the little boy has been sent off for a journey
Stewart Jones QC , prosecuting
The court was told Miss O'Connell had found out Conan was having an affair with another young woman and she told him to leave the flat .
On 3 August Conan , whose original surname was Walsh , killed Miss O'Connell and severed her jugular vein before lighting a cigarette and playing with Patrick , known as PJ , for half an hour .
Afterwards he took him to the main bedroom of their council flat , smothered him with a pillow and bathed him .
The youngster was then taken back to his room and " laid out ceremoniously " with items put around him , including a toy dagger and guns and a torch in his hand .
Conan was described as controlling by friends of Miss O'Connell A note from Conan was also placed near the body .
Stewart Jones QC , prosecuting , said : " The ritual nature of laying out is bizarre .
It 's as if the little boy has been sent off for a journey . "
He told the court Conan had changed his name because it had significance in Nordic legend .
Mr Jones QC , added : " This may go some way to explain the boy being laid out . "
Police officers went to the property after Miss O'Connell 's family reported them both missing for several days .
The court was told Conan answered the door and said he had killed the pair .
' Obsessive ' Conan , a widower , had met Miss O'Connell when she was a schoolgirl as they were neighbours and her mother had taken pity on him and his mentally ill wife who has since died .
Miss O'Connell 's mother would cook them meals that her daughter would take over .
Mr Jones said that soon Miss O'Connell and her friends were smoking and drinking at Conan 's house and , aged 17 , she became pregnant by Conan .
The bodies were found at a council flat in Woolford Close , Winchester She hid the pregnancy and the identity of the father from her family but when Miss O'Connell was then given a council flat , Conan moved in despite opposition from the family .
Friends of Miss O'Connell , who hoped to study law at university , said that the " obsessive " Conan was controlling and never let her out alone .
After finding out he had been having an affair , the couple argued and Conan then suffered " paroxysms of jealous and thwarted rage " which led to the attack .
The court was told three doctors agreed Conan had suffered a temporary abnormality of mind when he killed Miss O'Connell .
Justice Royce told Conan his crimes were " terrible offences " .
He added : " You are in the autumn of your days , Kirsty and Patrick had their lives stretching out before them .
Lives that were cruelly and selfishly and unforgivably cut short by you . "
In a statement shortly after her death , Miss O'Connell 's family described her as " a devoted mother and a much loved daughter " .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
We 've become used to a world where what we buy is determined by what products are stocked by a handful of chain stores , but there are signs that may be changing .
The future could be one of thriving cottage industries and skilled artisans lovingly producing custom - made wares .
An " apple jacket , " by jacquelineknits , is just one of the handmade items you can find on Etsy .
That 's the vision of Etsy , a U.S. - based Web site that describes itself as " an online crafts fair . "
But unlike your local Sunday - morning market , Etsy 's crafts fair has some 200,000 stall holders , who have this year sold just under $ 50 million - worth of their homemade goods .
The site was conceived and launched in 2005 by Rob Kalin , a carpenter , among other things , who was looking for somewhere to sell his work online .
At the time , the only real outlet was eBay , but Kalin was looking for something different , something that would provide a place for small - time artisans to sell their creations .
But according to Etsy , the site is more than simply a good business opportunity .
" One of our goals is to change the way the economy works .
It 's become normal for people to buy online and the spread of the online buying culture means it has become very democratic .
If you have a computer and camera and you like to make things , you can make and sell anything you want .
I consider it liberating for people , " an Etsy spokesman told CNN .
If the site 's popularity is anything to go buy , it 's a model that 's proved tremendously successful .
But the reason for that success is that Etsy has tapped into a growing pool of crafters and a demand for handmade goods .
In the U.S. especially , there has recently been a resurgence in the popularity of handmade goods .
The idea has even emerged of crafting as a form of political activism -- the term " Craftivism " has been coined to describe the idea of ' making your own ' as a statement against runaway consumerism and the homogeneity of mass production .
A survey carried out by Etsy earlier this year revealed the average age of its crafter / sellers to be 35 -- a far cry from the stereotypical image of grandma knitting a scarf in her rocking chair .
Tapping into that zeitgeist , Etsy has tried to create a crafting community by hosting online crafting workshops and offering advice on how to turn a hobby into a business .
The site encourages interaction between crafters , but crucially , it enables interaction between buyers and sellers .
" Anyone can go to , say , H&M and get a sweater , but then you have the same sweater as millions of people , but there 's no real meaning to it .
It 's really great to be able talk to the person who made something that you now own -- it gives it another layer of meaning and specialness that a lot of people are looking to find , " said the spokesman .
Do you prefer handmade to mass produced ?
Interestingly , Etsy also offers a service called Alchemy , where buyers request a specific product they want made , along with a deadline and price range , and sellers bid to provide that product for a certain fee .
That concept of ' merchandise on demand ' turns the idea of mass production on its head , but British Web site Kings of Neon takes the idea one stage further .
Designer Adam Duffy set up Kings of Neon when he realized there was a demand for customized sneakers .
As well as adorning plain white plimsolls with his own colorful creations , Duffy lets his customers send him their own graphics , which he turns into a design for them .
" Personally , I 've never bought anything mass produced .
I think fashion is about being individual and not wearing the same thing as everything else , otherwise it almost becomes a uniform , " Duffy told CNN .
Next month he intends to launch a new site that will allow users to create their own designs online , an extension of the shoe customizing offered by NikeiD and Vans , which let you personalize your sneakers ' color scheme online .
The design - your - own trend is growing and it's not just limited to sneakers .
Zazzle.com lets you customize your own T - shirts , mugs , plates , skateboards , postcards , ties , aprons and pretty much anything else that has a printed image on it .
It 's just a matter of importing the image you want to use , adding some text , if that 's what you want , and clicking 'ok . '
The result wo n't make Gucci lose any sleep , but it will be unique .
While it 's very different experience from that offered by Etsy , Zazzle does have tools that let you sell your designs on their Web site .
At first glance , U.S. online T - shirt firm Threadless is a similar proposition , but what sets Threadless apart is the way it determines which T - shirt designs it sells .
Threadless lets members of the public send in their own T - shirt designs , which are then displayed on its website .
The site 's 800,000 users can view the designs and vote for the ones they 'd like to see printed .
Each week , six designs , selected from around 800 submissions , make it onto T - shirts , which are then sold on the Web site .
The designers receive $ 2,000 in cash and $ 500 in gift certificates .
What 's clever about the Threadless method is that it means the T - shirts it manufactures have always been extensively market tested -- by the same target market it 's pitching its product to .
It 's an example of what has become known as ' crowdsourcing ' -- getting members of the public to collectively perform a task usually done by a professional .
Although the term has been applied to some very different projects , at its best it 's profoundly democratic -- and it's made possible by the Internet .
Kings of Neon , Zazzle and Threadless can only exist because the Internet allows interaction between buyer and seller .
Similarly , Kalin started Etsy because he could n't afford to rent a physical shop in New York to sell his work from .
By providing a virtual shop floor , and a potentially huge passing trade , the internet is a leveler that allows the artisan to compete with the chain store .
With the idea of designing - your - own gaining currency , the emergence of a growing army of crafters , and a way for them to sell their product , all that 's needed for a shopping revolution is a consuming public ready to ditch the chain stores in favor of the artisans .
EBay recently announced a new web venture called Worldofgood.com , which will provide a shop front for all manner of mostly handmade , ethically supplied goods from around the world .
The idea is similar to Etsy , but with a global , ' fair trade ' spin , and the involvement of web giant eBay is a sure sign that handmade has gone mainstream .
" In my opinion , in the U.S. and the western world there is a backlash now .
Brand names were really popular in the 80s and 90s , but now I think people are kind of tired of that -- they want something that 's more tailored to them , " Etsy 's spokesman said .
If he 's right , and we see a growth in craftspeople and artisans selling directly to the public , then the commerce of the future may bear an uncanny resemblance to that of the past .
LONDON , Nov. 14 , 2008 --
The line between actual reality and virtual reality has become more blurred with the advent of the popular online game " Second Life . "
The virtual world provides a place for individuals to create an avatar and engage in most everyday activities , including attending concerts , conducting meetings , meeting new friends , and apparently having virtual extra-marital affairs .
Amy Taylor , 28 , and David Pollard , 40 , expect to have their divorce finalized next week .
Their three - year marriage came to a crashing end after Pollard was caught by his wife e-snuggling with another Second Life female avatar lover .
" I caught him cuddling a woman on a sofa in the game .
It looked really affectionate , " Taylor told Sky News .
When Taylor confronted her husband about the matter and asked to see his chat history , he quickly turned off both the monitor and the computer to erase any evidence of his interaction .
The incident was the last straw for Taylor , since it was n't the first time Pollard had strayed digitally .
After the couple met and were smitten with each other in an Internet chat room in 2003 , they decided to get married and held an online wedding in Second Life in 2005 .
But the honeymoon did n't last long -- Pollard 's avatar was caught having sex with an online prostitute in Second Life .
" I went mad … I was so hurt , " Taylor told Sky News .
" I just could n't believe what he 'd done . "
Dr. Cynthia McVey , Head of Glasgow Caledonian University 's Psychology Department , told ABCnews.com that Taylor 's emotions reflect her feelings that she " may not be exciting enough " to her husband and even though Pollard may not have committed physical infidelity it still signaled a " step away from her . "
Second Life serves as a meeting place for friends and a virtual marketplace , and some countries have even set up embassies on the platform .
Richard Gandy , a Second Life devotee , told ABCnews.com that it was " more than just a game , " adding that it was a full - fledged " 3D virtual world . "
Gandy explained that there were " two distinct areas on the mainland – PG and Mature , where anything goes . "
Gandy explained to ABCnews.com that the official Second Life monetary unit , Linden dollars , could be converted into U.S. dollars and functions like any other currency with an exchange rate .
Gandy said that there " have been real millionaires " resulting from Second Life activity .
In fact , Gandy , who owns Felsham Village in the platform , told ABCnews.com that he rents out parcels of lands and earns rent from the tenants which he could convert into real money
But what makes one go beyond those public activities and pursue more intimate relationships in Second Life ?
McVey told ABCnews.com that people hope to " present themselves as they want others to see them and how they want to be . "
McVey explains that Second Life can be a safe haven for individuals who are " shy and lonely , " and can be a place where " appearance is no longer a concern " and where people can " connect with someone " without the worry of being judged .
Those factors may have played a roll in this situation where the couple 's avatars clearly did not match up with their real - life physical appearance .
" There is a novelty value associated with it …you can be anything you want to be , " McVey said , and says in some ways it is " an emotional representation of yourself . "
The " other woman " involved in the affair , 55 - year - old Linda Brinkley , who lives in Arkansas , was first attracted to Pollard after her online character began work as a hostess at a nightclub run by Pollard on Second Life , the Daily Mail reported .
Brinkley claims the relationship between her and Pollard was that of just friends until he split with his wife .
The timing of the affair does n't matter to Taylor .
" It 's cheating as far as I 'm concerned , " Taylor told Sky News .
A statement given to ABCnews.com from Linden Lab , the creators of Second Life , says that " we were saddened to hear of this unfortunate incident ...
Second Life provides a richly immersive environment for communication , and we have seen very positive real - life relationships form between Residents who first met in world . "
While it may be true that many have experienced meaningful relationships and made important contacts on Second Life , this Internet fairy tale did n't live up to it 's happy beginnings , as the couple 's divorce is due to be finalized next week .
And perhaps this couple should have listened to the advice of the Second Life creators : " As with any online communications medium -- from e-mail to dating Web sites -- we recommend that people choose their friendships and other relationships wisely and carefully consider these relationships before meeting in person , " Linden Lab said in a statement to ABCnews.com .
The relationship which Brinkley describes as " love at first site " became so serious that Pollard proposed to her online , and the couple is now engaged in real life , despite never meeting each other in person , the Daily Mail reported .
Brinkley , who has three children from her first marriage , aged 35 , 33 and 30 , in addition to a 15 - year - old from her second marriage , told the Daily Mail that she was " in love with Dave , " and added " I 've been married in real life before but they were n't really good relationships and I have n't had much luck with men until now . "
And apparently even Taylor has moved on from the broken marriage .
Accordingly to Sky News , Taylor has already found a new man in her life whom she met playing the fantasy role - playing game World of Warcraft .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The government reported more grim news about the economy Friday , saying employers cut 240,000 jobs in October - bringing the year 's total job losses to nearly 1.2 million .
According to the Labor Department 's monthly jobs report , the unemployment rate rose to 6.5 % from 6.1 % in September and higher than economists ' forecast of 6.3 % .
It was the highest unemployment rate since March 1994 .
" There is so much bad in this report that it is hard to find any silver lining , " said Morgan Keegan analyst Kevin Giddis .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast a loss of 200,000 jobs in the month .
October 's monthly job loss total was less than September 's revised loss of 284,000 .
Payroll cuts in August were revised up to 127,000 , which means more than half of this year 's job losses have occurred in the last three months .
September had the largest monthly job loss total since November 2001 , the last month of the previous recession and just two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
With 1,179,000 cuts , the economy has lost more than a million jobs in a year for the first time since 2001 - the last time the economy was in a recession .
With most economic indicators signaling even more difficult times ahead , job losses will likely deepen and continue through at least the first half of 2009 .
" It 's pretty clear that we 're in a recession , " said Robert Brusca , economist at FAO Economics .
" There is reason for us to believe we 'll see a drumbeat of heavy job losses for a while , and there 's room for them to get even worse . "
Brusca noted that separate readings on the manufacturing and auto industries indicated economic conditions are the worst in about 30 years .
" We may be in a severe recession , in which case these job numbers are not even big yet , " he said , suggesting monthly job loss totals could grow in excess of 300,000 an unemployment could rise to around 7 % .
Losses across the board
Job losses were spread across a wide variety of industries .
Manufacturing lost 90,000 jobs , the leisure and hospitality industries cut 16,000 jobs , and construction employment shrank further by 49,000 jobs .
Terence O'Sullivan , president of construction workers ' Laborers ' International Union of North America , noted the construction unemployment rate rose to 10.8 % - double what it was a year ago .
He called the report an " urgent alarm sounding the need to halt our nation 's spiraling job loss . "
In an ominous sign for the upcoming holiday shopping season , retailers trimmed payrolls by 38,000 workers last month .
Professional and business services , a category seen by some economists as a proxy for overall economic activity , had a 45,000 drop in employment .
" Job loss has a big impact on the economy , " Brusca said .
" When people have no income , they spend less , businesses make less money , and they cut more jobs . "
In another sign of weakness , a growing number of workers were unable to find jobs with the amount of hours they want to work .
Those working part - time jobs - because they could n't find full - time work , or their hours had been cut back due to slack conditions - jumped by 645,000 people to 6.7 million , the highest since July 1993 .
The so - called under - employment rate , which counts those part - time workers , as well as those without jobs who have become discouraged and stopped looking for work , rose to 11.8 % from from 11 % , matching the all - time high for that measure since calculations for it began in January 1994 .
Temporary employment , including workers employed by temp agencies , fell by 50,800 jobs last month .
That could mean even more full - time payroll reductions to come , as employers often cut temporary workers before they begin cutting permanent staff .
But some industries were hiring last month .
Government hiring has stayed strong throughout the downturn , adding another 23,000 jobs in October .
Education and health services also grew payrolls , which grew by 21,000 employees .
In a somewhat encouraging sign , the average hourly work week did not fall last month , holding at 33.6 hours , in line with expectations .
With a modest 4 - cent gain in the average hourly salary , the average weekly paycheck rose by $ 1.35 to $ 611.86 .
Trying to get back on track
Solutions are not simple .
Support for a second stimulus package has grown in Congress , and President - elect Barack Obama has indicated that he would support such a measure .
The prior stimulus package in the spring helped the economy grow in the second quarter , but it did little to stem the tide of job loss in the country .
Many economists have also called on the Federal Reserve to cut rates to historic lows to encourage growth .
" These are all the right solutions , but the real question is are they enough to get the economy on the right path , " said Anthony Chan , chief economist for JP Morgan private wealth management .
" They 're necessary , but we do n't yet know if they 're sufficient . "
President Bush said Friday the government 's plans to address tight credit and housing markets are the solution to rising unemployment .
" The Federal government has taken aggressive and decisive measures to address this situation , " the President said .
" It will take time for these measures to have their full impact on an economy in which many Americans are struggling . "
Chan said the programs will work , and that the government needs to continue to " slug it out , " perhaps putting even more stimulus programs in place to encourage job growth .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - South Korean prosecutors indicted a blogger on Thursday who had warned of financial doom for the country with critics saying he was targeted because his gloomy forecasts upset the government battling an economic downturn .

The blogger , writing under the pseudonym Minerva , became a household name for his predictions of sharp falls in the won and the local stock market and the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers .
Prosecutors said he hurt the local currency by posting incorrect information online .
“ The suspect in this case was indicted on charges of false information on two occasions , ” an official at the prosecutors ’ office said by telephone .
As South Korean markets tumbled late last year amid the global downturn , the main financial regulator warned it would crack down on what it considered malicious rumors and some economic analysts say they have come under pressure from authorities not to voice negative views on the economy .
“ The prosecution hurriedly went ahead with its investigation and a court readily gave prosecutors a permit to conduct a witch hunt , ” the liberal Hankyoreh daily said in a recent editorial , calling the case an infringement of freedom of speech .
Prosecutors identified the blogger as Park Dae-sung , an unemployed 30 - year - old man who faces up to five years in prison if he is found guilty of violating communications laws .
Since his detention earlier this month , legal experts have questioned whether authorities had legal grounds to prosecute individuals .
Meanwhile the conservative ruling party of President Lee Myung - bak is pushing for a tough new law on cyber slander .
“ The Minerva case shows that the tradition of rule of law has yet to set root firmly in our society , ” said Dankook University law professor Ji Seong - woo .
Since Park ’s detention , reports have flooded local mainstream media saying he was a quiet man with a humble educational background .
Experts said this may be an attempt to discredit Park in a society that places high value on an elite education and employment at prestigious firms such as brokerages .
“ Should Park be punished , it should be for his conduct and not because he is some thirty - some year old unemployed two - year technical college graduate , ” Ji said .
The South Korean currency fell 28 percent last year and the main share index slumped 40 percent .
President Lee reshuffled his top economic officials on Monday , replacing his widely criticized finance minister , to speed up measures to stop Asia ’s fourth largest economy from sliding into its deepest recession in 11 years .
Mr. Obama , in the ABC News interview , suggested that banks would be required to reveal more about their mortgage holdings .

“ Essentially what you ’ve got are a set of banks that have not been as transparent as we need to be in terms of what their books look like .
And we ’re going to have to hold out the Band - Aid a little bit and go ahead and just be clear about some of the losses that have been made because until we do that , we ’re not going to be able to attract private capital into the marketplace . ”
The day was the first big test of Mr. Geithner as Treasury secretary , who has one of the toughest sells in America : convincing lawmakers and taxpayers that they should again bail out the very banks whose mistakes contributed to the loss of more than three million jobs and caused acute financial pain .
It was clear during the hours he spent before the cameras and lawmakers that he was well - spoken and thoughtful .
But his career until now had played out behind the scenes as a civil servant and a central banker .
He occasionally lapsed into financial jargon and struggled to connect to a broader public audience .
As the day wore on , Mr. Geithner faced growing skepticism from Democratic and Republican lawmakers , many of them channeling deep voter disgust with the way the government has handled the bailout over the last nine months .
Even Democrats who are supportive of the administration said that it had failed to provide more information about how it would be spending the remaining money in the bailout program .
“ We need more details from Treasury on how exactly it plans to remove bad assets while protecting the taxpayer , ” said Senator John Kerry , the Massachusetts Democrat who is a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee .
“ We have zombie banks that are weighed down because their liabilities exceed their assets .
Without a precise mechanism for addressing toxic assets , it will be difficult to increase lending . ”
Somali sources close to the pirates said two of the attackers were wounded in an exchange of fire during an attempted rescue operation but Giessman said all crew members were safe .
" We have since observed with our satellite system that the ship had left the convoy and was heading to the Somali coast , " he said .
Sources in Somalia said the ship was being taken towards the pirate lair of Eyl , in the northern semi-autonomous state of Puntland .
The German navy 's anti-piracy unit in Potsdam said the Indian frigate INS Beas replied to a distress call overnight and wanted to send special forces on board but the captain of the German tanker refused .
The nature of the MV Longchamp 's escort was not immediately clear .
Andrew Mwangura , who runs the Kenya chapter of the Seafarers Assistance Program , said the ship was flagged in the Bahamas .
The head of the International Maritime Bureau ( IMB ) piracy reporting centre in Kuala Lumpur Noel Choong also confirmed the attack .
" Pirates armed with guns fired on the ship and managed to board and hijack her , " he said .
Choong said the last attack by Somali pirates was on January 14 and since then there had been a lull due to bad weather conditions , with high wind speeds of up to 30 knots which made it difficult for pirates to operate .
" In the last few days the weather has improved and wind speed has dropped to 15 knots and below , and it appears pirates are beginning to look out for ships to attack , " Choong said .
He said that if the weather continues to improve there could be more attacks in coming days , and urged ships passing through the treacherous region to be vigilant and maintain a 24 - hour watch .
So far in 2009 the IMB said there have been 15 pirate attacks including three successful hijackings .
Pirates are currently holding 10 vessels including the German gas tanker .
The joint strategy calls for the establishment of three information centres in Mombasa , Dar es Salaam and Sanaa an a regional training centre in the Red Sea state of Djibouti .
" We now have an efficient mechanism to fight against piracy .
The text of the code has been accepted by consensus .
IMO is ready to help the members ' state to implement this agreement , " said Koije Sekimizu of the International Maritime Organisation which organised the Djibouti meeting .
The nine signatories are Djibouti , Ethiopia , Kenya , Madagascar , the Maldives , the Seychelles , Somalia , Yemen and Tanzania .

( Newser ) – An orangutan at Washington 's National Zoo has pleased her caretakers with a unique skill — she's taken up whistling .
Researchers have previously taught apes to do so , but Bonnie is different in that she started on her own , apparently by mimicking zookeepers , NPR reports .
( She also imitates workers sweeping floors and wiping windows . )
Aside from providing a little music , scientists say Bonnie 's skill could help them study the evolution of human speech .
story continues below
In tests , researchers found that Bonnie , who 's 32 , would imitate long or short whistles .
" She was pretty good at following what I was doing , " said one .
" I think what makes it significant is that she decided to do it on her own .
Something made her want to whistle , or at least try it out .
And so to me , she was challenging herself to do something else . "

So what are the drawbacks ?
Some might say size , perhaps speed - while these little jets are fast , capable of cruising at speeds up to 375 knots , they still are n't as fast as say , a commercial airliner , and the FAA believes that a sudden influx of slower jet aircraft could potentially clog up the airways , especially if VLJ 's become as widespread as it looks like they 're going to .
The thought is that these slower aircraft would cause more delays and ultimately more unsafe skies for airlines and air taxi services , but , considering the fact that aircraft of all sizes and speeds have been sharing the same airports since humans first took flight with a minimum of problems , it is the opinion of this writer that these claims are merely a form of saber - rattling on the part of airlines afraid of losing business to smaller , cheaper , more fuel efficient jet aircraft piloted by entrepreneurs who are already planning operations for a new type of air taxi service - A VLJ air taxi service .
Beyond that , some have raised concerns about the reliance these new aircraft have on computer technology instead of simpler , tried and true equipment ; fortunately , any fears about the failure of a VLJ 's electronics in flight are all but unfounded - the backup systems ( and subsequent backup systems thereof ) installed on these aircraft make the chance of a failure roughly equal to that of winning the state lottery , or perhaps getting struck by lightning several times over .
So while the fifties may have promised us an affordable flying car in the garage of every family and jet packs for the daily commute , VLJ 's still manage to put the dream of flight , or more specifically , the smooth and sophisticated feel of flying a sleek , lithe jet aircraft , within the reach of more individuals than ever before , and all without sacrificing important things like quality or safety .
So who knows , perhaps in another few decades , the dreams of the fifties might just become a reality in one form or another - VLJ's are just a step in the process , paving the way to bring better , more efficient jets into civilian aviation in a way that has never been seen before .

We had our Christmas party on 15 December .
It was fancy dress with a sporting heroes theme .
I went as a pre-fat Maradona in full 1986 kit with a replica World Cup trophy , as well as a bag of icing sugar around my neck like cocaine .
The big boss came , but just put money behind the bar and left .
Looking back , I should have thought that was a bit weird .
The next morning , at our weekly production meeting , just as we were about to exchange our secret Santa presents , the boss came in and said we were going off air .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
There was silence in the room .
Our boss was devastated .
I had lost my job , but this had been his whole life for four years .
He seemed embarrassed and as if he did n't want to be there .
He said he was really sorry – I think he felt responsible , but it was n't his fault .
He told us we could do that night 's show or just go down to the pub .
We said , sod doing the show , let 's have a drink .
It was n't until I got home that I thought , my God , I do n't have to go to work tomorrow .
Previously , I 'd worked for the BBC for seven years and had always wanted a job there .
I worked on the Eamonn Holmes show , the Gabby Logan show for Radio 5 Live , and as a producer on Inside Sport .
I loved working at the BBC , but wanted a promotion so when SportsXchange came along I jumped at the chance to be at some - thing from the beginning .
My Dad had told me to be careful with start - ups but it seemed safe .
It was n't – it was a terrible time to start a new sports channel because suddenly nobody had money for advertising .
The rest of December was fine because I had pay for that month and it was Christmas and everyone was going out – I did n't have to accept it was real .
It was only on the Monday after New Year I realised I was the only one not going back to work – and that my money would run out at the end of January .
I 've been meeting with people about jobs and sending my CV out .
There are jobs around , but I 'll probably have to freelance for a while .
I 'm just , like , " Look , give me something to do today – I 'll be a runner tomorrow just to keep my mind active . "
I 've also been busy – I 've loved having time to go to the gym , train for the marathon , go shopping and for coffee with friends I have n't seen for ages .
I used to do the food shopping online but I 've even had time to go to the supermarket .
I spent £ 100 in Asda a couple of days ago , so at least the fridge is full .
I 'm a very proud person .
I 've always had a job and somehow it 's embarrassing to be unemployed , as if you 're not good enough .
I should be signing on – I 've paid my taxes for 13 years and am entitled to that money , but I do n't know if I can be that person .
There 's a real stigma attached to it .
If I could do it online I 'd have done it the day I got made redundant , but I have n't been able physically to walk into a Jobcentre .
Give it two weeks and I 'll probably be there .

I had worked in the Barrow - in - Furness branch of Woolworths for 45 years except for a break when I had my daughter .
Her husband , Stephen , had worked there seven years and his stepson , Matthew , did weekends and holidays .
We knew things were n't brilliant but nobody told us how bad .
The first sign something was wrong was towards the end of November , when a customer came in and spoke to Stephen .
He had seen something on the news about Woolworths being sold .
We could n't believe a company like ours , which had been going on all those years , was in such a state .
It was an awful shock .
A few days later , our manager got us all together and told us that the company had gone into administration .
He said hopefully somebody would take over , but he was also talking about getting rid of residual stock , so we should have known .
It was up and down before our hopes were finally dashed .
It was very emotional , the way things swung back and forth .

I decided nothing was going to spoil our Christmas , so we really put things on hold and said right , we 'll get through to the new year and then we 'll really have to pull the belt in .
It had been really busy in the shop – normally we take on extra staff before Christmas , but it had just been the usual crowd of all - year - rounders and they worked magnificently .
But there was anger because you think , why did they let it get so bad ?
That there must have been something they could have done .
But , I do n't know – I 'm not a business person , and at the end of the day it 's just the economic climate .
We had such a lot of sympathy from customers – people were really sorry and hoped we 'd find jobs .
It 's heartening in some ways to think people are so concerned .
It shows that for all we were n't , perhaps , the best company in the world , people actually quite liked shopping in Woolworths and were going to miss it .
We ceased trading on Saturday 3 January but we had to stay on until the Tuesday to begin clearing out the whole shop .
It was really , really upsetting .
We talked together and decided that we wanted to leave the store in as good a state as we could .
We 'd looked after it all these years and had all worked together really well .
It 's just a shell now .
The first thing I 've done is to get the house back to the usual condition – I 've been working so hard I 've neglected the home .
And then I 'll be looking for something .
I do n't want a full - time job at my age , but I want something to keep my brain working .
I 'm not one of those types to sit about .
It 's different for Stephen .
He 's got a mortgage and five kids with a baby on the way .
They do n't go without , but it 's hard .
You just want the best for them , do n't you ?
We 'll get by , we just wo n't be able to help quite as much as we'd like to .

There were no signs my job was under threat .
And then it just happened : I was taken into a meeting with the rest of the team and was told that a couple of our colleagues , who had come in for work that morning , had already been canned .
Then we were told our contracts were going to end .
It was my manager who broke the news .
He would have been more apologetic if it had been his decision but it was n't – the company just had to get rid of people and as consultants , we were first in line for the chop .
I did n't grow up in wealth but had always wanted to achieve it .
My dad worked for London Underground and brought me up on an estate .
I was lucky enough to go to a good school and got a degree in business finance , before becoming an operations consultant for investment banks .
It was very well paid .
I was out all the time , I had two properties , an Audi TT and , just last May , I went to Spain for the weekend , Copenhagen the next and Las Vegas after that .
It seemed like the party would never end .
When times are good you put yourself in a position where you always want to get to the next level .
I 'm always looking for that next rung and made certain investments to help , but none of them seemed to be paying off .
Early last year , a contract with Barclays Capital ended .
Usually I 'd find something new within a few days – I could pick my job .
But things were drying up so I had to go to Brussels to work for ING .
Budgetary constraints meant I had two months with no work .
I had to accept my last job , with Credit Suisse , with half the pay I had been earning .
It was a huge emotional insult .
Now the party has ended and my life is completely different – it 's absolute belt tightening .
I had to sell a property , the car 's gone – I 've had to dig out my travelcard .
You have all these dreams you 've built up over the years and , just as they seem to be coming true , they 're suddenly dashed .
Now I 'm not even sure I want to get back into banking .
Even if there are jobs , the rates are knocked down so far the industry has become unrecognisable .
If I get back in , what will it be for – more of the same work , for a quarter of the pay ?
It 's completely unappealing .
Things got worse recently .
I was putting spread bets on the pound reaching parity with the euro but got it wrong and lost heavily .
It 's the kind of thing you do in the hope of making it big and not having to worry about the job situation for the next year .
And it went really bad .
If you win the lottery and piss the money up the wall you can only make it back by winning again , which is unlikely .
But when you 've started from zero and reached a certain level , sure – it's demoralising to be heading back to zero , but , chances are , with a bit of grit and determination you can do it again .
I 'm optimistic that I will .

59 , lorry driver , north Lincolnshire
I loved driving lorries .
I left school at 15 and did a few girly jobs in shops , offices and factories , but never really settled .
Then I got a job driving a van and thought , wow , lorries – would n't it be good to get in one of those ?
I was 27 and passed the test first time .
Since then , I 've driven fridges , tippers , heavy haulage , abnormal loads , cement , chemical tankers , dynamite to quarries – just about every vehicle on the road .
I loved the freedom and never knowing where you would finish the day .
The week I was ready to come back to work after my hysterectomy in July – I had collapsed in the middle of the night in March and called 999 – I read in the local newspaper that the B&Q depot where I worked in Scunthorpe was going to close .
It was a big shock .
I only had a bit left to pay on my mortgage so I thought , if I worked like hell until I 'm 60 next May , I might just be able to get rid of it .
There 's only a bit left , but it was the sense of wanting to be free – free of that mortgage .
Now that 's not going to happen .
Going to the Jobcentre was horrible .
I 've only ever done it once before , when I was a teenager doing seasonal work in Blackpool .
Now it 's all changed , of course .
I thought you 'd just knock on the door and say , " Hey - ho , I have n't got a job – what can I do ? "
It 's not like that .
They send you on your way with a phone number .
You ring it and have no idea who you 're speaking to – I think it was some chap on his computer in south Wales .
He asks you questions on just about everything and taps in the answers .
It took more than an hour and I thought he was such a nosey parker .
He wanted to know all about my money , how much I 've got in the bank , my account details , savings – " Well , I have n't got any savings , " I said .
It has always been my ambition , even after leaving school without any qualifications , to pay my own way .
It 's all I wanted to do – earn money and not scrounge off anybody .
I have n't even bothered to get married because I wanted to be totally independent .
It was a blow to lose that .
Who 's going to give me a job so close to retirement ?
I 'm now living on about £ 37 a week , but it 's actually not that bad and I 'm not panicking .
My central heating packed up two years ago and I never got it repaired .
At the moment I 'm wearing a pair of thick woolly tights , jogging bottoms , two pairs of socks and a big pair of furry slippers , three T - shirts , two sweatshirts , a fleece , an outdoor jacket with a scarf and a woolly hat .
I do have a gas fire in the living room , but that 's really more for my poor little cats .
My last quarterly gas bill was for £ 15 .
I live off my own vegetables and have ditched my telly .
When you 're working , you 're earning a living .
When you 're not , you 're forced to work towards living .
I just can't wait to get my bus pass – I shall be off !
James Dale
28 , architect , London
We knew something was wrong when the jobs stopped coming in .
We usually had phone calls and emails from potential clients every day but by June or July it was down to every other week .
We were n't that worried because we had plenty of ongoing work but then clients starting putting jobs on hold or scaling down their plans .
After a while it was a case of trying to spin out what little work we had .
Rumours and gossip trying to predict who was going to be going were rife .
Then , in the middle of October , one of the partners sat me down , explained what was happening , and told me he was going to have to let me go .
We knew each other well and it took him a while to work up the courage .
It was an odd feeling for me but I was n't shocked because it was a manoeuvre I had anticipated .
And I 'm not alone ; I do n't know a single person in architecture who does n't know people who have been made redundant or had their hours reduced .
It 's the conversation everyone 's having and there 's constant anticipation about who 's going to be next .
I studied at Hull School of Architecture for four years before doing a year of work in North Yorkshire .
Then I did my two - year diploma in Edinburgh and worked on a project abroad before getting a job in a London practice .
It was a small firm of two partners and three staff and most of our work was very high - spec residential refurbishments and extensions .
We 're talking about million pound - plus budgets for basements that included swimming pools , steam rooms , saunas , games rooms and gyms .
It was silly money and the work soon became repetitive and tedious .
The challenges that came up were solved by throwing money rather than trying to find a sympathetic solution .
But at least the money was there .
Only a year ago work was abundant – you could leave one job and go straight into another one .
Suddenly , there 's this strange feeling because the work is n't there and there 's a lot of competition for jobs that do come up .
It 's intimidating as well because you 're not sure when it will change .
It got me really down before Christmas .
This is my profession – what I 'm going to do for the rest of my life .
I 've invested a lot financially – when I was working , a third of my salary went towards paying off debt – but also emotionally .
This is what I want to do and if someone takes it away , what else can I do ?
The worry has been heart - wrenching .
But , regardless of how long this goes on I will find work – it 's just a matter of when .
In the meantime , people say a lot of good things come to architecture in a recession .
People are challenged more and forced to find new ways to push forward ideas and produce more thoughtful buildings .
There 'll be fewer prestige projects and everyone will have to improve the quality of their work to compete .
I just hope I 'll be in the race .
Theo Mance
35 , antiques dealer , east London
The alarm bells started ringing last May , before the shit really hit the fan .
The showroom I worked in was on the King 's Road .
We got all the west London sorts in there .
These were high - end customers – people with money to spend and big houses to fill .
The products were high - end as well – replica 18th - century French furniture that only an expert could tell apart from an original .
We had opened three showrooms within about four kilometres of each other , including one in a well - known department store , in what appeared to be an endless market .
But if you 're in retail you see weekly figures , and in May they got bad .
We changed our warehouse structure , reducing storage overheads and cutting delivery costs , and then closed a branch in June or July .
Rumour and counter - rumours about what might happen started to circulate .
A colleague spotted our boss in conversation with other people about the lease we had in the department store and the figures kept getting worse .
The letter came in early September , but it only said we were in a consultation period and that perhaps not all the remaining shops would close .
There was no end date so we had what turned out to be a two - month redundancy period .
Normally , you get the letter and a date and that 's it .
In this case it was left open , which was irritating .
If you 're going to look for something else you need to know where you stand .
The final letter came at the end of October but the stores would not close for another month .
That 's a long time to hang around .
You 're demotivated already and then we had to reduce everything to half price , which made things intolerable because we ended up doing the equivalent of a year 's business in two months .
We 'd been put under increased pressure and were being given a greater workload at a time when they should have been considering our feelings .
The settlement was n't particularly motivating , either .
But I had been made redundant from my previous job , so it did n't seem like a disaster this time round .
When things had gone horribly wrong , my thoughts were to look for something else .
But now you have to rethink – is there going to be something else out there ?
I think the best thing one can do is not hop straight into a job you do n't really want .
If you can , I think it 's important to let out that steam and tension .
I 've been drinking a lot and meeting people I have n't seen for a long time – it's a natural reaction to what was a very stressful two months .
I went to Paris and blew some of my redundancy money on a piece of art .
I 'm planning to do the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela , which will cost me less than living in London for a month .
And I 'm thinking of going back to a job without responsibilities – behind a bar on in a shop , perhaps .
Or perhaps I 'll retrain and do and do a course in furniture making – something that 's better for the soul .
Professor Frans de Waal , who led the study at Emory University in Georgia , US , said : " I am not arguing that non -human primates are moral beings but there is enough evidence for the following of social rules to agree that some of the stepping stones towards human morality can be found in other animals . "
Web2.0 came with AJAX and AJAX came with its own requirements and standards for web application developers .
Now web applications are more like desktop applications with a lot of options , dialogs and more .
If you have developed AJAX application with different user controls you surely loaded resources such images , other javascript files on demand .
This helps you keep your application lightweight and makes its load time faster .
j Query makes creation and loading DOM elements ( in our case images ) very easy .
If you need to preload an image you can use this jQuery script here :
// Create an image element var image1 = $ ( ' < img />') .attr( ' src ' , ' imageURL.jpg ' ) ;
First jQuery creates a image DOM element and setting the src attribute of the image element would tell the user browser to load that image .
Thus preloading the image .
Next you should insert your DOM element into the DOM tree using one of the many jQuery DOM manipulation methods .
Here are some examples of how you could insert preloaded image into your website :
var image1 = $ ( ' < img />') .attr( ' src ' , ' imageURL.jpg ' ) ; //
Insert preloaded image into the DOM tree $ ( '.profile ' ) .append( image1 ) ; // OR image1.appendTo( '.profile ' ) ;
But the best way is to use a callback function , so it inserts the preloaded image into the application when it has completed loading .
To achieve this simply use .load ( ) jQuery event .
// Insert preloaded image after it finishes loading $ ( ' < img />' ) .attr( ' src ' , ' imageURL.jpg ' ) .load( function ( ) { $ ( '.profile ' ) .append ( $ ( this ) ) ; //
Your other custom code } ) ;

Perhaps , in some alternate universe where Italian cars were known for reliability and value rather than performance and beauty , this might make sense :
Chrysler LLC said today it was striking an alliance with Fiat S.p.A. that will give the Italian carmaker 35 % of Chrysler in return for sharing technology , manufacturing and management .
Advertisement
The deal must be approved by regulators , including the U.S. Treasury , which oversees a $ 4 - billion rescue loan of Chrysler .
Fiat did not commit any cash to the deal , and made no vows to do so in the future .
Chrysler said the deal would give it access to Fiat ’s engine and other vehicle technology that Chrysler would build in its plants .
Fiat will help sell Chrysler vehicles in foreign markets , where Chrysler lags its competitors today .
And Chrysler said Fiat would “ provide management services supporting Chrysler ’s submission of a viability plan ” to federal regulators .
Chrysler agreed to give up 35 % of its equity in exchange for Fiat ’s technology and no cash .
The only thing dumber than this would be if we taxpayers were on the hook for Chrysler ’s financial position .
Oh , wait …
Now that I think about it , this is bizarro universe .

Researchers have modeled the human mental lexicon as consisting of words that cannot be separated from other words , which may explain why words have many associations , a feature which helps us communicate .
Credit : Flickr.com by surrealmuse .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
When you hear the word “ planet , ” do you automatically think of the word ’s literal definition , or of other words , such as “ Earth , ” “ space , ” “ Mars , ” etc . ?
Especially when used in sentences , words tend to conjure up similar words automatically .
Further , human beings ’ ability to draw associations and inferences between words may explain why we ’re generally able to communicate complex ideas with each other quite clearly using a limited number of words .
Research has shown that words are stored in our memories not as isolated entities but as part of a network of related words .
This explains why seeing or hearing a word activates words related to it through prior experiences .
In trying to understand these connections , scientists visualize a map of links among words called the mental lexicon that shows how words in a vocabulary are interconnected through other words .
However , it ’s not clear just how this word association network works .
For instance , does word association spread like a wave through a fixed network , weakening with conceptual distance , as suggested by the “ Spreading Activation ” model ?
Or does a word activate every other associated word simultaneously , as suggested in a model called “ Spooky Activation at a Distance ” ?
Although these two explanations appear to be mutually exclusive , a recent study reveals a connection between the explanations by making one novel assumption : that words can become entangled in the human mental lexicon .
In the study , researchers from the Queensland University of Technology ( QUT ) in Australia and the University of South Florida in the US have investigated the quantum nature of word associations and presented a simplified quantum model of a mental lexicon .
Classical vs. Quantum Correlations
The researchers begin by explaining the difference between classical correlations ( in the Spreading Activation model ) and quantum correlations ( in the Spooky Activation at a Distance model ) .
Specifically , no pre-existing elements or hidden variables exist in quantum correlations as they do in classical correlations .
For example , a classical correlation would be a scenario in which someone writes the same number on two pieces of paper , and sends them to two distant ends of the Universe .
When received , both papers have the same number , but this correlation is due to a pre-existing action .
On the other hand , the quantum analogue of this scenario is much stranger .
At one end of the Universe , someone writes a number on a blank piece of paper .
At the other end of the Universe , another individual discovers that the same number is written on another piece of paper .
Called quantum entanglement , this scenario does n’t occur in everyday life , but it has been observed at the quantum scale and is referred to as “ non-locality . ”
Non-Separable Entities
In this study , the researchers ask if quantum entanglement might exist for systems beyond modern physics , such as word correlations .
“ We take the position that quantum entanglement in modern physics is a physical manifestation of something more general called ‘ non- separability , ’ ” coauthor Peter Bruza of QUT told PhysOrg.com .
“ We view quantum theory as an abstract framework for developing models of non-separability in a variety of domains including cognition .
Note that , even though we are using quantum theory to model the non-separability of words in human memory , we make no claim that this corresponds to a physical manifestation of entanglement in the brain . ”
In the researchers ’ word entanglement model , each associated word can either be recalled or not recalled .
An entangled state would occur when two associated words ( e.g. “ Earth ” and “ space ” ) are either both recalled or both not recalled in relation to a cue word ( e.g. “ planet ” ) .
Intuitively , this makes sense : when visualizing Earth , it ’s hard to not also visualize the surrounding space .
In this example , Earth and space make up a non-separable entity .
Word Recall Probability
Next , the researchers suggest that the probability of a word being activated in memory lies somewhere between Spreading Activation ( in which words are individually recalled based on individually calculated conceptual distance ) and Spooky Activation at a Distance ( in which the cue word simultaneously activates the entire associative structure ) .
Most likely , Spreading Activation underestimates the strength of activation , while Spooky Activation at a Distance overestimates the strength of activation .
“ Even though both the Spreading Activation and Spooky - Activation - at - a- Distance models are based on an underlying network , both models are still fundamentally reductive in nature and assume that words are separate , distinct entities in human memory , ” Bruza explained .
On the other hand , the quantum - based model does n’t assume that words are separate entities .
In the new model , associative word recall probability depends on how strongly connected the associated words are to each other .
For instance , “ Earth ” and “ space ” are entangled in the context of “ planet , ” but “ Earth ” and “ gas giant ” may not be entangled ( though “ Jupiter ” and “ gas giant ” may be ) .
Words that are entangled with many other words have a greater probability of being recalled , while words that are entangled with few or no other words have a smaller recall probability .
While the idea of word entanglement may sound odd , Bruza explained that it may be just one example of a strange concept .
“ We think it is odd that entanglement occurs at all , ” he said .
“ As a phenomenon , it suggests that the world is not the separable and reducible place that we have always taken it to be .
If entanglement is found in other types of ( non-physical ) systems , it will suggest that the quantum formalism is modeling non-separability per se , and this will indicate that quantum theory could provide a whole new approach to the study of complex systems , i.e. non-separable and irreducible systems . ”
The Future of Quantum Cognition
The researchers explain that their model is overly simplified , and it would be very difficult to extrapolate to a more realistic model due to the vastness of the human mental lexicon .
However , experiments involving memory tests might be able to distinguish between the predictions of the three different models .
Currently , researchers are performing an empirical analysis using the University of South Florida ’s “ Free Association Norms , ” a database of word association norms which involves data from more than 6,000 participants producing nearly three - quarters of a million responses to 5,019 stimulus words .
Eventually , all this analysis of semantic models may have applications for future technology , Bruza explained .
“ Current information processing technology is very efficient at processing symbols , but is largely clueless as to what they mean , ” he said .
“ Our position is that , in order for such technology to better align with humans , it needs to process ‘ meanings ’ like those we harbor .
As our information environment becomes more complex , we will need technology that can draw context - sensitive associations like the ones we would draw , but increasingly do n’t as we lack the cognitive resources to do so .
Therefore , such the ‘ meanings ’ processed by such technology should be motivated from a socio- cognitive perspective . ”
This kind of research is an example of an emerging field called “ quantum cognition , ” the aim of which is to use quantum theory to develop radically new models of a variety of cognitive phenomena ranging from human memory to decision making .
Although speculative , this research is gaining momentum .
For instance , later this year , the highly regarded Journal of Mathematical Psychology will publish a special issue of quantum models of cognition .
In addition , quantum cognition is a prominent theme within the Quantum Interaction Symposia , which provide a forum for a growing body of researchers applying quantum theory to non-quantum domains .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Among young college students , the frequency and type of video games played appears to parallel risky drug and alcohol use , poorer personal relationships , and low levels of self - esteem , researchers report .
“ This does not mean that every person who plays video games has low self - worth , or that playing video games will lead to drug use , ” Laura M. Padilla - Walker told Reuters Health .
Rather , these findings simply indicate video gaming may cluster with a number of negative outcomes , “ at least for some segment of the population , ” said Padilla - Walker , an associate professor at the School of Family Life at Brigham Young University in Provo , Utah .
She and colleagues examined the previous 12 - months ’ frequency and type of video game and Internet use reported by 500 female and 313 male undergraduate college students in the United States .
The students , who were 20 years old on average and mostly received course credit for their study participation , also recounted their drug and alcohol use , perceptions of self - worth and social acceptance , and the quality of their relationships with friends and family .
The findings , reported in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence , showed “ stark gender differences in video game and Internet use , ” Padilla - Walker said .
For example , compared with young women , young men reported video gaming three times as often and reported playing violent video games nearly eight times as often .
Young men were also more likely to use the Internet for entertainment , daily headline news , and pornography , while young women more often used the Internet for email and schoolwork .
However , regardless of gender , clear correlations were seen between frequent gaming and more frequent alcohol and drug use and lower quality personal relationships , as well as more frequent violent gaming and a greater number of sexual partners and low quality personal relationships .
The investigators linked similar negative outcomes with Internet use for chat rooms , shopping , entertainment , and pornography , but a contrasting “ plethora of positive outcomes ” with Internet use for schoolwork .
Padilla - Walker sees these findings as a starting point for future research .
Continued analyses of video game and Internet use should improve the overall understanding of health and development among emerging young adults , she and colleagues note .

A federal appeals court dealt a blow to the Obama administration Friday when it refused to block a judge from admitting top secret evidence in a lawsuit weighing whether a U.S. president may bypass Congress , as President George W. Bush did , and establish a program of eavesdropping on Americans without warrants .
The legal brouhaha concerns U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker 's decision in January to admit as evidence a classified document allegedly showing that two American lawyers for a now - defunct Saudi charity were electronically eavesdropped on without warrants by the Bush administration in 2004 .
The lawyers — Wendell Belew and Asim Ghafoor — sued the Bush administration after the U.S. Treasury Department accidentally released the top secret memo to them .
The courts had ordered the document , which has never been made public , returned and removed from the case after the Bush administration declared it a state secret .
The document 's admission to the case is central for the two former lawyers of the Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation charity to acquire legal standing so they may challenge the constitutionality of the warrantless - eavesdropping program Bush publicly acknowledged in 2005 .
Absent intervention from the U.S. Supreme Court , the one - line decision ( .pdf ) by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals means the lawyers ' case is the only lawsuit likely to litigate the merits of a challenge to Bush 's secret eavesdropping program adopted in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terror attacks .
" We 're trying to establish a legal precedent : A rule that the president must comply with legislation passed by Congress , " said Jon Eisenberg , the attorney for the two lawyers .
" The president is not above the law .
This case is important to establish a legal precedent . "
The lawyers ' suit looked all but dead in July when they were initially blocked from using the document to prove they were spied on .
They were forced to return it to the government after it was declared a state secret .
But last month , Walker said the document could be used in the case because there was sufficient , anecdotal evidence unrelated to the document that suggests the lawyers for the Al - Haramain charity were spied upon .
Without the document , the lawyers did n't have a case .
The Bush and the Obama administration 's said the document 's use in the trial was a threat to national security .
The document at issue is n't likely to ever become public .
Walker 's Jan. 5 order only allows lawyers in the case to view it , and they are forbidden to publicly discuss its contents .
Bush acknowledged the existence of the so - called Terror Surveillance Program in 2005 .
It authorized the NSA to intercept , without warrants , international communications to or from the United States that the government reasonably believed involved a member or agent of al - Qaeda , or affiliated terrorist organization .
Congress authorized such spying activity in July .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation claims the TSP went further , and accuses the nations ' telecommunication companies of funneling all electronic communications to the National Security Agency without warrants .
However , as part of the spy bill approved in July , the government immunized the telcos from lawsuits accusing them of being complicit with the Bush administration .
The Obama administration on Thursday urged Judge Walker , the same judge in the Al - Haramain case , to dismiss the EFF 's challenge to the immunity legislation .
Walker 's decision is pending .
The U.S. government had designated Al - Haramain a terror organization
The Justice Department declined comment .

Since his death in a Marseille hospital in 1891 , aged 37 , the French poet and erstwhile enfant terrible Arthur Rimbaud has been virtually canonised as a pioneer of modernism , revered successively by symbolists and decadents , dadaists and surrealists , existentialists and beats , and on into the 1960s when he was a major influence on Bob Dylan and was described by Jim Morrison as " the Master " .
Beyond his literary influence he has a kind of mythic status : an existential anti-hero , a " hooligan poet " , a nomadic traveller , a rebel against everything including his own literary genius .
Not the least remarkable thing about Rimbaud is that his wild , hallucinatory and often very beautiful poems were all written before he turned 21 , after which he decisively turned his back on the Bohemian world of Paris and London which had nurtured his talents on a diet of absinthe and hashish - " No more words !
I bury the dead in my belly ! "
André Breton called Rimbaud a " god of adolescence " , and it is in the teenage years that one is most prey to the fatal Rimbaldien charisma .
This was the case with Edmund White , who begins his brief biography of the poet with the recollection of how he " discovered " Rimbaud in 1956 , when he was 16 , in a boarding school near Detroit .
" As an unhappy gay adolescent , stifled by boredom and sexual frustration and paralysed by self - hatred , I longed to run away to New York and make my mark as a writer ; I identified completely with Rimbaud 's desires to be free , to be published , to be sexual , to go to Paris .
All I lacked was his courage .
And genius . "
In an interview on his website , however , White adds : " I think I used to identify with Rimbaud and want to be him .
Now I think he seems like a horrible brat . "
He finds him " less heroic as a person but maybe even more interesting as a writer " .
This is a natural and truthful evolution , though it may also suggest that nearing 70 is not the best age to embark on a biography of Rimbaud .
This is a short book , less than 200 pages of fairly large print , and the absence of any notes or index makes it more an essay than a biography .
Or perhaps , given
White 's distinguished fictional output , one might call it the biographical equivalent of a novella .
Its slenderness is further highlighted by the fact that nearly a third of the book covers just five years of Rimbaud 's life - the period of his involvement with the older poet Paul Verlaine .
This relationship was a seeding - ground for Rimbaud 's most challenging poetry - A Season in Hell and Illuminations - but was also a fiasco of drunkenness and savage psychological violence .
Rimbaud barged into Verlaine 's life in the late summer of 1870 , a 16 - year - old country boy from the Ardennes bearing the manuscript of his great poem " Le bateau ivre " .
A friend of Verlaine 's , less than impressed , described him as " a tall , gawky young man , very thin , with the look of a rather fierce street Arab " .
This is the period of the famous photograph by Etienne Carjat - the tousled hair , the piercing eyes , the skewed necktie , the " strong red mouth with a bitter fold in it " .
Verlaine was besotted , and deserting his wife and infant son , the pair went on the run to London .
They lived in dingy lodgings in Fitzrovia , in a room described by Rimbaud as " full of dirty daylight and the noise of spiders " - the giant plinth of the Post Office Tower now marks the site - and later in Camden Town in a small house on Royal College Street , recently rescued from demolition due to this illustrious connection .
Here , piquantly , they advertised in the columns of the Daily Telegraph - " deux gentlemen Parisiens " offering lessons in French and Latin - though whether any would - be pupil ventured unwittingly into this den of demons is not known .
The affair ended with a dreadful showdown in Brussels , where Verlaine shot his tormentor , wounding him in the left wrist .
Despite Rimbaud 's refusal to press charges , Verlaine was sentenced to two years ' hard labour for criminal assault .
White writes very well about this relationship , admiring the audacity and defiance of its open homosexuality - though , as he acknowledges , the evidence about Rimbaud 's sexuality is contradictory and he cannot overall be enlisted as a gay writer .
After the rupture with Verlaine and the renunciation of literature Rimbaud lived a life of obscure wanderings , glimpsed from time to time as a circus cashier in Hamburg , a quarryman in Cyprus , and a deserter from the Dutch army in Java .
He covered huge distances on foot - " I am the tramper of the highway , through the dwarfish woods .
The whispering of the sluices covers my steps " ( " Childhood " ) .
These punishing excursions were punctuated by spells back home in the Ardennes , but in 1880 he quit Europe for good to go " trafficking in the unknown " .
The last decade of his life was spent in Aden , on the south coast of Arabia , and in the walled Muslim city of Harar in Ethiopia .
He worked as a trader in coffee , skins , cloth , ivory and frankincense .
In the mid-1880s he was running guns from the Red Sea port of Tadjourah to the highlands .
He returned to France suffering from a tumorous growth on his knee .
A swift and harrowing decline followed the amputation of his right leg .
His last days of pain and delirium are recorded by his pious and devoted young sister , Isabelle .
The brevity of White 's book is no bad thing in itself - length is no guarantee of biographical merit - but there are inevitable sins of omission .
This is particularly the case with the later years ( nearly half of Rimbaud 's life ) , where he skates over some of the most mysterious and obliquely poetic incidents in Rimbaud 's career .
White writes in the crisp , laconic style which serves so well in his fiction , but which makes for a rather colourless account of this lurid , difficult and ultimately tragic young poet and adventurer .

A spoonful of sugar can help fight Malaria
One teaspoon of moistened sugar placed underneath the tongue of sick hypoglycaemic children – a simple solution to a serious problem .
Nearly 800,000 children die every year from malaria .
In Africa , malaria combined with hypoglycaemia causes many of these children to die before they get to a health care facility , where they could access life saving intravenous treatment .
A clinical trial conducted in Mali , with the support of Antenna Technologies , suggests that placing a spoonful of sugar under the child 's tongue can be effective , and moreover much simpler than glucose .
Despite recent progress in the prevention and treatment of malaria , this tropical disease still affects more than 250 million people and kills nearly one million each year .
With 85 to 90 % of deaths occurring among children , it is the most vulnerable who pay the biggest price of the disease .
The majority of these victims are under five years old and live in remote areas , mainly in Africa .
Children with hypoglycaemia , that is almost 20 % of children with severe malaria , are three to four times more likely to die from the disease .
Standard practice is to give an intravenous infusion of glucose , but this is often only accessible too late since it is administered at hard to reach health facilities .
A clinical trial was carried out in Mali , in Sikasso Hospital , by the Department of Paediatrics and with the support of the Swiss International Cooperation and the Antenna Technologies team .
This trial has identified a new method to correct hypoglycaemia and raise blood glucose .
Results from this study have been published in the Malaria Journal .
By placing a teaspoon of sugar moistened with a few drops of water under the tongue of the child , even a child already in a state of coma , blood glucose levels were raised , providing what appears to be a simple first aid treatment .
This easy treatment can be given by non professionals at home and during transportation to health centers , buying precious time , and saving many lives .
Proposed a long time ago by , among others , the French paediatrician Hubert Barennes , this simple method has not yet been applied due to a lack of trials .
Trials have now been carried out .
The bold action has been going against the idea prevalent among medics , to show that sugar does not necessarily have to be swallowed to act on glucose levels : by simple contact with the tissues in the oral cavity , particularly those under the tongue , a rapid elevation of blood sugar is observed , in fact even faster acting than if the sugar was swallowed .
In the race against time faced by children with severe malaria , evidence showing the benefits of administering sugar under the tongue can be life changing for the poorest regions where malaria hits the hardest .
Now the challenge is to make this procedure known to tropical medicine specialists worldwide , and that the WHO and other health agencies include this procedure in their guidelines .

Brisbane has been declared a natural disaster area , as soldiers and prisoners help repair damage caused by one of the biggest storms to hit the city in two decades .
About 30,000 properties across Brisbane , Redcliffe and the Gold Coast were without power on Monday afternoon after Sunday 's storm brought hail and wind gusts of up to 130 km / h , unroofed homes and toppled power lines and trees .
Emergency authorities said up to 4,000 homes were damaged , with 300 homes " significantly damaged " and 30 deemed unlivable .
While most areas received 40 mm to 60 mm of rain , Ferny Hills , in the north - western suburbs of Brisbane received 80 mm , 69 mm of which fell in the space of 30 minutes on Sunday afternoon .
A 20 - year - old man was killed when he was swept away by quickly rising water while photographing the storm in a drain with a 23 - year - old friend at Chermside , in Brisbane 's northern suburbs .

Season Wrap Up
The Astros last left us by missing the playoffs with an 86 - 75 record to finish third in the National League Central .
Although they were in the heat of the race for a while , they dropped off at the end when they were forced to play home games in Milwaukee because of the hurricanes that were whipping through their city .
While long time first baseman ’s Lance Berkman ’s performance seemed to be in an inverse relationship with the team ’s winning percentage ( as he had an amazing first half when the team was disappointing and came back to earth when the team went 14 - 1 after the All - Star break ) , the team still had some other bright spots to focus on .
The acquisitions of LaTroy Hawkins and Randy Wolf before the trade deadline made the ‘ Stros a much better team in the second half and helped them fight for the Wild Card spot .
Holes to Fill
Overall , the Astros seem to have a solid team with no gaping holes to point a finger at .
If one or two balls bounce their way during the season , they may have been in the playoffs so general manager Ed Wade may not be looking to be doing much wheeling and dealing this off season unless something ( or someone ) really peaks his interest .
With Carlos
Lee hopefully coming back from his injury next season , the Astros will , in a sense , be adding some pop to their lineup without going on the market .
Perennial Cy Young contender Roy Oswalt once again provided his usual stellar season , but he could use some help in the starting rotation .
Whether that is going to come from relief from the farm system or in free agency is hard to tell , but it would serve the ‘ Stros well to pick up at least one arm on the open market this off season to take some pressure off of Oswalt .
Houston may also be looking to add some talent that is known for their ability to get on base as well as some speed .
They have some players with considerable speed in their farm system , but would probably have to add the on base component in free agency .
Free Agents
The Astros currently have four free agents on the open market with relief pitcher Doug Brocail , catcher Brad Ausmus , infielder Mark Loretta and left hander Randy Wolf all seeking deals .
It seems Wade will not be offering any contract at all to Ausmus this off season even though he has been with the team for some time .
With the lift that Wolf provided at mid-season , he is currently the team ’s number one priority in the market .
They see him as a better than solid number two starter behind Oswalt and believe he could have made the difference in their playoff run if he had been an Astro during the entire season .
The Outlook
While they are probably going to increase their payroll ( which was ranked 14th in the majors last year at $ 88.9 million ) do n’t expect the ‘ Stros to spend like crazy on the open market .
If they are going to open their pocket books for someone , it is going to be a pitcher who they believe will be able to make the rotation more stable .
They do not seem to have many pieces to trade during the off season , but could move outfielder Michael Bourn , if they receive the right kind of interest in him .
Houston plays in a tough division where they are probably going to have to win 90 games to have any shot at all at competing for the playoffs .
To do this , manager Cecil Cooper is going to have to use all of the pieces
Wade gives him in spring training to keep opponents on their toes at all times .
With Lee coming back to the line - up , they will no doubt improve on their runs scored total of 712 from last season ( which ranked them 11th in the Bigs ) .
If the team can jump a few spots in this category and retain stable pitching without injuries throughout the season , they could see the four or five game jump needed to be in the playoff picture even later than they were in 2008 .
Off Season Moves Made so Far
The ‘ Stros have been very busy this off season with their latest move being the purchasing of the contracts of three players ( second baseman Drew Sutton , shortstop Tommy Manzella and outfielder Brian Bogusevic ) from the AA team in Corpus Christi .
Two other notable moves they have made recently were to sign pitcher Chia - Jen Lo to a minor league contract and to tie up pitcher LaTroy Hawkins for one more year .
They recently signed 41 - years - old , Brocail for 1 more year at $ 2,750,000 .
PARIS ( Reuters ) -
We ’ll keep our fine cheeses and you can keep your hormone - treated beef , was the broad sentiment in France on Friday after the outgoing Bush administration tripled import duties on roquefort to 300 percent .
The soft , blue and pungent cheese is just one of a list of European products hit by U.S. measures meant to pressure the EU to drop a ban on U.S. beef treated with growth hormones .
Roquefort , made from sheep ’s milk in southern France according to a tradition stretching back 1,000 years , epitomises France ’s gastronomic heritage .
The U.S. move , part of a long - running trade row , was received like a slap in the face .
“ Fine !
They can keep eating their rubbish , we ’ll keep the best food to ourselves , ” a blogger wrote on the website of the newspaper Liberation .
“ Some roquefort with a glass of fine wine from the late harvest ... what a treat ! ” said the correspondent , one of hundreds of French web users commenting on the development .
The cheese was expensive with the previous import duty rate of 100 percent .
The U.S. gourmet foodstore Dean & Deluca was offering on its website two pieces of roquefort of 3.5 ounces ( 100 grams ) each for $ 30 -- before the new tariff takes effect .
The row was reminiscent of previous food fights that have marked Franco - American relations in the era of President George Bush , who relinquishes office on Tuesday .
No one has forgotten the switch of language from “ French fries ” to “ freedom fries ” when then - French President Jacques Chirac opposed Bush ’s plans to invade Iraq .
“ We ’re tired of being a symbol for the American government .
Maybe the Bush administration indulged itself by taking this decision just before it leaves , ” Robert Glandieres , president of the roquefort producers ’ group , said .
In commercial terms , the impact will be very limited .
A spokeswoman for the roquefort producers ’ group said exports to the United States represented 400 tonnes per year , or just 2.5 percent of total annual sales of the cheese .
She said exports to the United States would likely grind to a halt because few U.S. consumers would be able to afford roquefort at the new prices .
Agriculture Minister Michel Barnier said France was unbowed over the ban on U.S. beef .
“ We will not import hormone - treated beef , nor will we import the technique of treating chicken with chlorine wash as is practiced in the United States , ” he said on France Info radio .
Firebrand anti-globalization campaigner Jose Bove had a solution to make up for the expected shortfall in U.S. sales .
“ French people and Europeans will just have to eat even more roquefort , ” he said .

UK minister retracts claim of US ' threat ' to cut off intel if evidence of torture released Mike Sheehan
Published : Wednesday February 4 , 2009
Print This Email This Miliband : No US pressure ; White House issues statement ; ACLU : ' Hope flickering '
A top minister in the British government said that the United States threatened to withhold shared intelligence if evidence of the torture of a UK citizen at Guantanamo Bay was released .
The allegation was made by British foreign secretary David Miliband , who told the United Kingdom 's High Court that if evidence was disclosed , the US would stop sharing intelligence with the UK , an action that would directly threaten British national security .
The UK resident , Binyam Mohamed , launched a challenge in British court to force the public release of documents detailing his treatment .
Mohamed is presently in a hunger strike at the US detainee camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and at last report was in an emaciated state .
He says confessions he made regarding his involvement with terrorism resulted from torture .
The statement by Miliband led to scathing criticism from two High Court judges who were nevertheless compelled to rule that the documents must remain secret because of the US threat .
" In the light of the long history of the common law and democracy which we share with the United States , " the judges said , " it was in our view difficult to conceive that a democratically elected and accountable government could possibly have any rational objection to placing into the public domain such a summary of what its own officials reported , as to how a detainee was treated by them and which made no disclosure of sensitive intelligence matters .
" Indeed we did not consider that a democracy governed by the rule of law would expect a court in another democracy to suppress a summary of the evidence contained in reports by its own officials , " they continued , " relevant to allegations of torture and cruel , inhumane , or degrading treatment , politically embarrassing though it might be .
" We had no reason , " said the judges , " to anticipate there would be made a threat of the gravity of the kind made by the United States government that it would reconsider its intelligence sharing relationship , when all the considerations in relation to open justice pointed to us providing a limited but important summary of the reports .
" It was and remains , " the ruling said , " the judgment of the Foreign Secretary that the United States Government might carry that threat out . "
The ruling sparked the ire of Conservative MP David Davis , who said in Parliament that UK ministers must answer to charges that Britain was complicit in torture and demanded a statement by Miliband to the House of Commons explaining " what the devil is going on . "
The US threat had been originally put in place by the Bush administration , Davis charged , adding that Miliband must explain " whether the new Obama administration supported its predecessor 's stance on the issue . "
A spokesperson for the UK's Liberal Democrats said the British government had " rolled over in the face of a scarcely credible threat from a friend . "
Miliband on Thursday vehemently denied that the US had pressured Britain to keep the Mohamed documents secret , insisting instead that the UK was unable to release the information simply because it would have violated the intel - sharing agreement with the US , an explanation that does n't appear to jibe with what the High Court judges described .
Mohamed 's lawyers accused Miliband of misleading the High Court and requested that the judges reopen the case .
For its part , the office of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said , " We have not engaged with the [ Obama ] administration on the detail of this case " and that the UK government " would ' unreservedly condemn ' the use of torture and any allegations of mistreatment would be taken ' very seriously . ' "
The White House late Wednesday commented on the situation via written statement , saying that the US " thanks the UK government for its continued commitment to protect sensitive national security information and preserve the long - standing intelligence sharing relationship that enables both countries to protect their citizens . "
Obama 's statement alarmed the American Civil Liberties Union , a civil rights watchdog , which responded in a news release , " Hope is flickering .
The Obama administration 's position is not change .
It is more of the same . "
Author , journalist and Raw Story contributor Andy Worthington , who has closely monitored US torture and ongoing detentions , says " the bitter truth ... is that Guantanamo is still being run as if the Bush administration remains in control . "
Former Bush vice president Dick Cheney seemed to reassert his influence even now , warning recently that the new administration 's anti-terror policies risked exposing the US to a catastrophic attack and saying that President Obama would regret his determination to close down Gitmo and end harsh interrogations of terror suspects .
Said journalist and columnist Joe Klein in reaction to the former VP 's withering criticism , " Cheney has done here what the Bush administration did throughout : he has politicized terror . "

NASA , when it is n't finding rogue space lights or mysterious BOOMs of the non-Steve Jobsian variety , is apparently sending rogue science teams to brief President - elect Obama on the future of the space program .
Advertisement
These teams were n't sanctioned by NASA top brass , so in a way they are effectively going rogue , not unlike an Alaskan governor in a Saks Fifth Avenue .
They were also not towing the company line about the future of the space program .
In fact , they argued that NASA should scrap the upcoming Ares rocket program in lieu of a new program called Jupiter Direct , which relies heavily on proven current - gen space shuttle program technologies and rocket parts .

On paper at least , the Jupiter Direct program appears cheaper .
Using a smaller and less cool - sounding rocket than the Ares 1 , called the Jupiter 120 , the program would require the modified external tank from the space shuttle , which would be shot into space by two RS - 68 liquid - fuel engines .
Liftoff would occur thanks to the two four - segment solid rocket boosters engineers would bring over directly from the existing shuttle program ( which is obvious once you see that image ) .

And better yet , the Jupiter Direct program has longevity built right in .
Because its engine configuration is theoretically more powerful than Ares , the 120 rocket would have the extra oompf necessary for a lunar flyby .
A larger Jupiter 232 rocket would allow man ( and woman ) to land on the moon after a hookup with NASA 's Orion lander capsule , which the program leaves unchanged .
Ultimately , the plan is about saving money and keeping space flight missions ongoing after the shuttle program is retired , not usurping NASA .
The Obama transition team provided no comment on the rogue meeting , or on the Ares program , for that matter .

War Crime du Jour : Israel Deploys White Phosphorus Shells
by C. L. Cook
W hen regarding the Christmas massacre conducted against the captive population of Palestine by the Israeli army in the name of the people of Israel 's security , one is left to wonder :
How deeply into Israel 's vast arsenal must the IDF dig before the world 's leaders act ?
Do we wait until the nuclear option is put on the table ?
" Bunker busters " are already deployed ; cluster bombs and the usual array of missiles , bombs , and bullets rained down on civilians and the civilian infrastructure .
Hospitals , universities , police stations , mosques , and apartment blocks .
Have we missed anything ?
Today , picture proof of Israel 's further degradation .
The first image is of a white phosphorus test shell ;
the second was taken in Gaza yesterday .
as seen from the Israeli side of the border with Gaza .

Of course , Israel has a history of using white phosphorus against civilians in Lebanon in 2006 ;
as their supplier , the United States of America did in Falluja , Iraq .
JUDITH VOGTLI , director of an upstate New York - based abstinence organisation called ProjecTruth , is worried that the golden age of “ abstinence - only ” education may have come to an end .
George Bush junior helped increase funding for this kind of sex education — which focuses on chastity as the way to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases , and discusses condoms only in terms of failure — to over $ 175 m a year .
The fate of that money , and of abstinence education itself , is uncertain under a new administration and Congress .
Ms Vogtli need only wait a few weeks .
Barack Obama will submit the first draft of his budget to Congress later this month .
In the meantime , her organisation , funded entirely by a government grant , is trying to go about business as usual .
That means teaching about abstaining from sex , drugs and alcohol in New York schools and holding its sixth annual abstinence Creativity Contest , to which students submitted essays , poems , artwork and music on the theme of “ Waiting is easier because … ”
Abstinence - only education programmes have been controversial ever since they were introduced under Ronald Reagan in 1981 .
Some liberals have labelled it “ ignorance - only ” education and most favour a curriculum that includes discussion of both abstinence and contraception .
Since the start of abstinence - only programs , the federal government has spent over $ 1.5 billion on them , but the United States still has one of the highest teen - pregnancy rates of any developed country .
Supporters of abstinence - only education mostly think that the media and a culture of promiscuity are to blame for this and that more government support for abstinence could help offset the rise of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease .
But opponents blame abstinence - only education .
There is some evidence to support their case .
According to Sarah Brown of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy , an advocacy organisation , there has been no randomised study showing that abstinence - only education delays sexual activity , and research from the University of Washington suggests that teens who receive comprehensive sex education have a 50 % lower risk of becoming pregnant than those enrolled in abstinence - only courses .
Abstinence - only advocates want the government to let school districts choose which type of sex education they prefer .
But in an ominous sign for them , the new Congress is already shifting its emphasis .
Louise Slaughter , a congresswoman from New York and a former scientist , has introduced a bill that would fund “ medically accurate ” comprehensive sex education in schools .
It is likely to pass .
In some cases , agents say , buyers who signed contracts before the market started to fall have managed to renegotiate the sales prices to reflect the current market more accurately .
Image FORFEITED
A buyer for this Spring Street penthouse , with stunning river views , walked away from the deal , and a $ 780,000 deposit .

Frederick W. Peters , the president of Warburg Realty , said his agency had had two multimillion - dollar deals in which buyers had forfeited six - figure deposits .
“ In both cases , ” he explained , “ the buyers felt that any renegotiation was n’t going to satisfy them and they preferred to remove themselves from the market for a while . ”
Their decisions , he added , were “ driven by the fact it ’s a new world and they were not sure what they wanted to do with their resources in the face of that . ”
When they re-enter the market , Mr. Peters said , they will very likely be able to buy similar properties at prices low enough “ that they will still have saved money , even after walking away from their deposits . ”
Other walk - away buyers , though , have not given up on the current market and are already searching for other properties to buy .
Penny Toepfer - Guttman , an agent at Brown Harris Stevens , represented someone who gave up more than $ 1 million in a deposit on an apartment in a new development in Manhattan .
She said her client had decided that the original apartment was too unusual a space and that he was now looking for something more conventional .
The first unit , she said , had a huge amount of outdoor space , and because it was priced above $ 10 million , “ he would have been paying more per square foot than anyone else in the neighborhood . ”
The developer , whom Ms. Toepfer - Guttman would not name , refused to renegotiate the price , so the buyer walked .
Ms. Toepfer - Guttman , who has been an agent for 17 years , said , “ I have never seen numbers like this being left in deposits ; this is new territory . ”
Today life without a cell phone , a laptop , or an Internet connection seems unthinkable .
Tech has infiltrated daily life in so many ways that it's hard to remember entire generations found ways to reach others , stay up - to - date , and do their jobs without the technology innovations we take for granted .
PBS Nightly Business
News took a close look at tech innovations and innovations from other fields .
To celebrate its 30th year on television , the news show partnered with Knowledge@Wharton to select the top 30 innovations in the past 30 years -- innovations that may seem standard now , but whose creation changed the way business is conducted , directly affected quality of life , broke new ground , and more .
Here are seven technology innovations from that list .
RFID and applications ( # 23 )
Long before Nike + used radio frequency device to tell you how fast you 're running , the technology was being used in World War II radar systems .
In the '80s it was put to use in automated toll payment systems , enabling speedsters everywhere the ability to fly through the tolls .
GUI ( # 21 )
The first graphical user interface was invented by Douglas Englebart in 1968 , and in the late ' 70s and early ' 80s GUI design advanced , largely thanks to Apple .
Because of these pioneers , we can take it for granted that we interact with our computer using a mouse and have easy - to - understand icons and other graphical controls instead of having to remember a bunch of computer commands .
Social networking via internet ( # 20 )
Internet - based social networks really are very new .
SixDegrees.com ( 1997 ) is the earliest social network site , according to PBS , but it was n't until MySpace , which launched in 2003 , that social networks began to appeal to the masses .
Now , of course , there 's Facebook , which gives you endless opportunities to have worlds collide , and Twitter , which empowers you to become your own paparazzi by dropping life tidbits , wisdom , and your comings and goings to your anxious followers .
Online shopping / ecommerce / auctions ( #15 )
Where would we be without Amazon , eBay and other online stores ?
Stuck in traffic on the way to the mall , that 's where .
Thanks to the Internet being opened up to commercial use , the ability for companies to capitalize on electronic transactions took off .
As did our hunger for a more peaceful shopping experience .
Mobile phones ( #3 )
Take a look at your tiny little cell phone and be thankful .
The first mobile phones , which Motorola unleashed on the market in 1983 , were confined to the car ( until a few years later when they became more mobile ) and were the size of a briefcase .
PC / laptop computers ( #2 )
1981 was a big year for computers : IBM launched the 5150 model ( which it called a " personal computer " ) and the Osborne 1 became the first portable computer .
Weighing in at 24 pounds , it challenges our current notion of laptop .
Internet / broadband / WWW ( #1 )
Coming in at # 1 is the Internet .
Our slavery to Google , our addiction to Twitter , our ability to keep up - to - date on any given news topic , our ability to send and receive far too many e-mails ... The Internet enabled so many other phenomenon that it 's startling to realize the Internet as we know it only arrived in the '90s .
But it did n't take long to change our lives forever .
This story , " 7 Technologies that Changed the World " was originally published by CIO .
On July 16 , 2002 , a survey crew from the Department of Transportation found Pam Kinamore 's nude , decomposing body in the area along the banks of the Mississippi known as Whiskey Bay , just west of Baton Rouge .
The police tested the DNA and quickly realized that they were dealing with a serial killer : the same man who had killed two other white , middle - class women in the area .
The FBI , Louisiana State Police , Baton Rouge Police Department and sheriff 's departments soon began a massive search .
Based on an FBI profile and a confident eyewitness , the Multi-Agency Homicide Task Force futilely upended South Louisiana in search of a young white man who drove a white pick - up truck .
They interrogated possible suspects , knocked on hundreds of doors , held frequent press conferences and sorted through thousands of tips .
In late December , after a fourth murder , police set up a dragnet to obtain DNA from some 1200 white men .
Authorities spent months and more than a million dollars running those samples against the killer's .
Still nothing .
In early March , 2003 , investigators turned to Tony Frudakis , a molecular biologist who said he could determine the killer 's race by analyzing his DNA .
They were unsure about the science , so , before giving him the go - ahead , the task force sent Frudakis DNA swabs taken from 20 people whose race they knew and asked him to determine their races through blind testing .
He nailed every single one .
Still , when they gathered in the Baton Rouge police department for a conference call with Frudakis in mid-March , they were not prepared to hear or accept his conclusions about the killer .
" Your guy has substantial African ancestry , " said Frudakis .
" He could be Afro-Caribbean or African American but there is no chance that this is a Caucasian .
No chance at all . "
There was a prolonged , stunned silence , followed by a flurry of questions looking for doubt but Frudakis had none .
Would he bet his life on this , they wanted to know ?
Absolutely .
In fact , he was certain that the Baton Rouge serial killer was 85 percent Sub-Saharan African and 15 percent native American .
" This means we 're going to turn our investigation in an entirely different direction , " Frudakis recalls someone saying .
" Are you comfortable with that ? "
" Yes .
I recommend you do that , " he said .
And now , rather than later since , in the time it took Frudakis to analyze the sample , the killer had claimed his fifth victim .
The task force followed Frudakis ' advice and , two months later , the killer was in custody .
Colorblind CODIS , Genetic Drift
Tony Frudakis first heard about the Baton Rouge serial killer just like everyone else outside of Louisiana – on cable news .
As months went by , the body count climbed , Frudakis followed the case , thinking " why on earth can't they catch this guy ? "
Several years earlier , Frudakis ' father was shot when he confronted a would - be car thief in the driveway of his Long Beach , California , home .
The thief escaped but dropped his driver 's license at the scene and was apprehended quickly .
The serial killer had also left behind his identification in his DNA but , unlike a driver 's license , his genetic ID revealed nothing about his physical characteristics – or at least it revealed nothing the police could use .
The DNA forensic products available at the time could only be used to match DNA specimens in the CODIS , or Combined DNA Index System , database which contains about 5 million DNA profiles .
If investigators have a crime scene sample but no suspect , they run it against those in the database to see if it matches a sample already on file .
But while CODIS is good at linking the criminals who are already catalogued from other crimes , the system is useless in identifying physical characteristics .
It says nothing about race .
It has been specifically set up to reveal no racial information whatsoever , in part so that the test would be consistently accurate irrespective of race .
But non-scientific considerations also factored into how the system was established .
When the national DNA Advisory Board selected the gene markers , or DNA sequences which have a known location on a chromosome , for CODIS , they deliberately chose not to include markers associated with ancestral geographic origins to avoid any political maelstrom .
DNAWitness , the test Frudakis applied in the Baton Rouge case , uses a set of 176 genetic markers selected precisely because they disclose the most information about physical characteristics .
Some are found primarily in people of African heritage , while others are found mainly in people of Indo - European , Native American or South Asian heritage .
No one sequence alone can predict ancestral origin .
However , by looking collectively at hundreds and analyzing the frequency of the various markers , Frudakis says he could predict genetic ancestry with 99 percent accuracy .
Based on paleoarcheological evidence and other kinds of DNA testing , scientists believe we are all derived from populations that started in Africa and migrated out some 200,000 years ago .
They first settled in the Fertile Crescent , the historic region of the Middle East flanked by the Mediterranean on the west and the Euphrates and Tigris rivers on the east .
Various offshoots went in every direction and eventually crossed the Bearing Strait to America and the populations became sexually isolated .
This process , known as genetic drift , caused markers to evolve at different frequencies in different populations and gave rise to the ethnic diversity we see today .
" There is tremendous genetic diversity among other species of animals but not among humans because our common history is so recent , " he explains .
" We 're 99.9 percent identical at the level of our DNA .
It 's the .1 percent that makes us different and about 1 percent of that .1 percent is different as a function of our differing history . "
Frudakis mines that .001 percent to find distinctive differences that determine genetic ancestry .
Using essentially the same science , DNAPrint helped Oprah Winfrey , Whoopi Goldberg , Quincy Jones and Chris Tucker trace their lineage back to Africa for the four - part PBS series , African American Lives .
It 's also how , days after the body of 26 - year - old Carrie Lynn Yoder was found at Whiskey Bay , Frudakis was able to conclude to a statistical certainty that the killer was black .
Racial DNA Profile Leads to Killer
The results from DNAPrint sent the task force scrambling back to earlier tips about non-white suspects .
Three days before Pam Kinamore 's abduction , a black man had tried to rape and murder Diane Alexander in her home .
She survived because her son returned home and interrupted the attack .
Alexander sustained cuts , fractures and stab wounds but was able to describe the man in detail .
Police never bothered to test the DNA her attacker left behind .
Her case could not possibly be linked to the other murders , they reasoned , because the suspect was black .
The police had also refused to listen to the pleadings of Collette Dwyer , who thought she might know the serial killer 's identity : Derrick Todd Lee , a 34 year - old black man with an extensive rap sheet for domestic violence , assault , stalking and peeping .
Lee had stalked Dwyer for two years after meeting her at the seafood shop where she worked .
One day , he pushed his way into her apartment , got a drink of water and told her he wanted to " take care " of her .
Lee was arrested after her two children chased him and noticed he had a gun .
He was sent to prison for two years .
Dwyer called police after Pace 's murder in May , Kinamore 's in July and again in September following the release of the FBI profile .
The police talked to Lee but did n't bother to take DNA since they were looking for a white man .
But after the conference call with Frudakis , Lee jumped to the top of the suspect list .
They got a subpoena for his DNA , collected a cheek swab and a day later , they had their answer : he was their man .
Lee skipped town just ahead of the arrest warrant but was tracked down in Atlanta and returned to Baton Rouge within days .
" CAUGHT " declared the Baton Rouge Advocate in giant print .
Relatives of the victims described their thrill and relief that a dangerous killer was finally off the streets , but also frustration that it has taken so long .
Few people knew that the most crucial piece of evidence was not unearthed by the hapless task force or forensic scientists but by a drug developer some 800 miles away .
DNAWitness Does Forensics
It takes me a while to find DNAPrint Genomics in spite of its address on one of the main thoroughfares in Sarasota .
The company is hidden in a small industrial park behind a chain - link fence across from a busy convenience store .
The office suite is marked by a sign leaning against one wall and a laminated sheet of paper with the word ' DNAPrint ' taped to the glass entry door .
The reception area is sparsely furnished , decorated only with certificates and plaques .
I am late for my appointment but Frudakis is later .
He is out to lunch and arrives 15 minutes after me .
Carrying his lunch bag and dressed in jeans , hiking shoes and a muted floral shirt , he looks more like a grad student than a chief scientific officer responsible for some groundbreaking advancement .
While the office is less than I expect , Frudakis is more – funny , self - effacing and candid about his life and work than I expect .
Frudakis earned a PhD in molecular and cell biology from UC Berkeley in 1995 .
He spent several years as a research scientist for Corixa Corporation in Seattle before starting his own company to develop genomics - based or targeted drugs .
The company 's first drug is PT - 401 , a synthetic version of the hormone produced by the kidney to promote red- blood - cell production .
It can be used to treat chemotherapy patients and anemia in people with end - stage renal disease .
PT - 401 made it through the pre-IND stage , which comes after animal testing and before Phase I trials , before the company ran out of money .
With drug approval years away and a gaggle of impatient investors , Frudakis shifted his focus to forensics in an effort to stay afloat .
The same markers used to infer clinical characteristics relevant for drug development could also be used to infer phenotype or physical characteristics that could prove invaluable in forensics .
By the time he approached the Baton Rouge task force , DNAPrint had already performed hundreds of dry runs on the test .
Its scientists studied family pedigree to make sure the ancestry traits they were measuring were indeed passed from one generation to the next .
They conducted population studies , verified the repeatability of the test , determined the minimum amount of DNA required and completed more than a 1000 blind trials for various police departments .
When the serial killer 's DNA sample arrived at the Sarasota lab , technicians isolated and amplified the 176 markers , cleaned them up to remove any primers or other agents , then used the molecular address to study the sequences at each site .
The resulting products were then deposited into a micro array and scanned by a Beckman SNPstream .
The output was then reviewed and subjected to quality - control checks .
Finally , the scores were calculated and compiled into a report for the task force .
Since 2003 , DNAWitness has been used in more than 150 criminal cases all across the country and in London .
Most remain unresolved .
In several others , however , the science played a crucial role in narrowing the suspect field and ultimately led to an arrest .
Kansas City , Missouri , police spent four years trying to identify the body of a 3 - year - old black girl .
Frudakis determined that the child had one white grandparent , a clue that ultimately led to the child 's mother , a biracial Oklahoma woman .
When two women were murdered in Napa , California , Frudakis applied a more advanced version of DNAWitness that uses 1349 genetic markers to peg the killer as 97 percent Northern European .
" The accuracy of the test was right on , " says Napa police commander , Jeff Tromley .
" They described the suspect as a blue - eyed , blond - haired , white male .
When he walked in to the police station , he was a blue - eyed , blonde - haired white man . "
DNA Profiling - Pricey and Dicey
You would think that proven success in solving these types of horrific crimes would make this technology popular with police , scientists , defense attorneys and prosecutors alike .
But it has n't .
The most obvious obstacle is price .
Cmdr . Tromley , for example , has a positive opinion of DNAWitness but adds that this does not necessarily mean his department will use it very often .
" This is a pretty niche product .
An in - depth analysis could run from $ 1500 to $ 3000 .
If you do n't need that , then you probably wo n't go that far , " he says .
Besides the expense , many people who might benefit from DNAWitness either do n't know it exists or are extremely skeptical that it works .
William C. Thompson , Chair of the Department of Criminology , Law & Society at UC Irvine is a prominent expert on the use of DNA in criminal trials but was only marginally familiar with this technology .
When I tried to describe how it works , he literally screamed at me , calling Frudakis a hack and a charlatan who obviously did not understand statistics .
But even those who believe this can be done are conflicted about whether it should be done .
History is replete with examples of injustices and inequities that were conscripted into law based on racial classification .
The Civil Rights movement of the 1960's succeeded in ending legal racial discrimination , in large measure , by downplaying the significance of race and racial differences .
By the mid-1990s prominent academics and sociologists even went so far as to say that race did not exist at all .
" Race is a social construct , not a scientific classification , " said an editorial in the May 3 , 2001 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine , adding that " In medicine , there is only one race – the human race . "
Then , along comes Frudakis with a science that seems to be saying the opposite .
New York University professor Troy Duster is a member of the advisory committee on the Ethical , Legal and Social Issues program at the National Human Genome Research Institute and president of the American Sociological Association .
Duster , who has written extensively on race and genetics , including the book Back Door to Eugenics , worries about the proverbial slippery slope .
" Once we start talking about predicting racial background from genetics , it 's not much of a leap to talking about how people perform based on their DNA – why they committed that rape or stole that car or scored higher on that IQ test , " says Duster .
" In this society where race is such a powerful idea , once you head down this path toward predicting race , will the next step be predicting racial behavior ? "
Narrowing the Suspect Field
Frudakis , not surprisingly , takes great pains to explain that those concerns are overblown .
" Our technology is based on the notion that we all share a common ancestry to Africa from a couple hundred thousand years ago , that we are all part of the same family tree , " he says .
He also counters critics who say DNAWitness is a high - tech form of racial profiling .
" This is analyzing data derived from a crime scene .
It 's a way for police to narrow down their suspect lists .
It is n't used as evidence in trials . "
Nevertheless , DNAPrint is still floundering .
He says the National Institutes for Justice denied his grant application because it believed that this is work that should be left to the government .
It 's not clear that the company will be in business a year from now , or even six months .
" Forensics stinks as a business , " Frudakis says bluntly .
" Most of the testing is done by government labs with very little opportunity for private enterprise .
If people valued what we did more , we would have the funds to expand the databases , learn about more phenotypes , develop more genetic screens , build more software systems . "
Frudakis still hopes that the company will be able to invest in more research .
RETINOME which predicts iris color with 96 percent accuracy is on the market and was used very effectively in the Napa murder case .
He has identified the gene sequences associated with height , and has compiled a database of 5000 digital photographs of people with almost every racial ancestry combination – which , one day , he says could allow him to construct a physical portrait of a DNA donor , including melanin content , skin color or eye color .
But even the people one might think should be his biggest allies are n't supporting that , including Tony Clayton , the special prosecutor who tried one of the Baton Rouge murder cases .
Clayton , who is black , admits that he initially dismissed Frudakis as some white guy trying to substantiate his racist views .
He no longer believes that and says " had it not been for Frudakis , we would still be looking for the white guy in the white pick - up truck . "
But then he adds , " We 've been taught that we 're all the same , that we bleed the same blood .
If you subscribe to the ( Frudakis ) theory , you 're saying we are inherently unequal . "
He continues : " If I could push a button and make this technology disappear , I would . "

Bernard Madoff , the Wall Street financier accused of running a massive swindle that fleeced investors of up to $ 50bn , is to remain in his lavish Manhattan apartment overlooking Central Park after a federal judge today rejected prosecution calls for him to be jailed .
The decision to allow Madoff to stay under house arrest in the $ 7 m penthouse , rather than transfer him to the Metropolitan Correctional Centre in lower Manhattan , astonished and further angered victims of the scandal .
Judge Ronald Ellis refused to revoke his $ 10 m bail , ruling that the prosecution had failed to make its case that Madoff could cause more harm if he remained at large .
But the judge did impose new restrictions that will see all Madoff 's mail searched by a security firm before it leaves his building .
An inventory will also be taken of all valuable portable objects in his apartment , which will be checked every two weeks to ensure he is not attempting to dispose of it .
The restrictions will apply to both Madoff and his wife .
Madoff was a highly respected Wall Street figure for more than 40 years , at one point holding the post of chairman of the Nasdaq stockmarket .
He gained a reputation for earning his clients a remarkably stable and high rate of return .
But last month he was arrested after it was revealed that his financial empire was founded on thin air .
He had allegedly been running what is known as a Ponzi scheme — taking in new money to pay the dividends of existing investors , losing up to $ 50bn and with it the entire life savings of thousands of his clients in the process .
Prosecution lawyers had called on the court to imprison him on the grounds that he broke a court order freezing his assets .
Shortly before Christmas , Madoff posted $ 1 m - worth of jewellery and gifts to friends and family in clear violation of his bail terms .
Court papers showed that the items included 13 vintage timepieces , including Tiffany and Cartier diamond watches , an emerald ring , four diamond brooches , two sets of cufflinks and a jade necklace .
The packages were sent by Madoff to his sons , Andrew and Mark , who worked for the family firm , his brother Peter , and his closest friends in New York .
The lead prosecutor , Marc Litt , argued that " the continued release of the defendant presents a danger to the community of additional economic harm and further obstruction of justice " .
But Madoff 's defence lawyers said the mailings were an innocent mistake : he had sent out family heirlooms and was simply unaware that was in breach of the asset freeze .
Victims and their lawyers reacted angrily to the decision to allow Madoff to remain free .
Larry Leif from Palm Beach , Florida , who lost his life savings of $ 8 m , told CNBC : " If I had commited this crime personally , I would be in jail . "
Jeffrey Zwerling , a lawyer representing individual and institutional Madoff victims around the world , said his clients would be outraged .
" They have just lost their entire life savings , are losing their homes , can no longer pay their health insurance , and here is Madoff living in a triplex overlooking Central Park . "
In further evidence of the strange moral universe inhabited by Madoff , the New York Times yesterday revealed that he has been apologising to his neighbours in the East 64th Street block of apartments for the chaos caused by the media camped outside since his arrest .
" Dear neighbours , " his letter says , " Please accept my profound apologies for the terrible inconvenience that I have caused over the past weeks .
Ruth and I appreciate the support we have received . "

I ’ve just read Brian Guthrie ’s recent article entitled Ioke mocking , Mocha as exemplar .
Brian has volunteered to work on a mocking framework for Ola Bini ’s Ioke .
I ’ve read bits and pieces on Ola ’s blog about the development of Ioke , so I was very interested to see what Brian had to say .
He makes some very valid comments ; both about mocking in general and about the internals of Mocha .
Mocking in General
I agree with him about it being so easy to stub in prototype - based languages , but ( as he says ) mocking libraries offer more than just stubbing .
One related problem is that different people mean different things when they talk about “ mocking ” .
x Unit Test Patterns by Gerard Meszaros provides a useful breakdown of the different capabilities offered by different types of what he ( more generically ) calls Test Doubles :-
Dummy Object
Test Stub
Test Spy
Mock Object
Fake Object
In my LRUG presentation : An Introduction to Mock Objects in Ruby , I translated these different types of Test Doubles into Ruby examples which people might find helpful .
Mocha Internals
I ’m glad that Brian drew some inspiration from reading the Mocha source code – I have to admit I went through a similar exercise with the jMock source code some time ago .
So thanks to Nat & Steve for that .
Mocha ( particularly the internals ) has changed a lot since the early releases but , as Brian mentions , the original split between the so - called Mocha and Stubba components has not really been bridged internally .
Reading this critique has just helped me realise that a mock object in Ruby is , after all , just an instance of a BlankSlate - like object and could therefore be approached with Stubba - like tactics ( rather than the specialised Mocha - like tactics which are currently used ) .
I think this could lead to a significant simplification of the code .
Yay !
I love open source :-)
As well as the welcome critique , Brian made some very pleasing comments :-
I ’d happily recommend [ Mocha ] to others as a good example of how to pull off some hairy Ruby functionality without writing a whole lot of hairy Ruby code in the process .
Much of Mocha is like that : moderately sized , neither opaque in its density or transparent in its verbosity .
Nice , I suppose , for my own definition of nice .
Reflections
I ’m a fan of the Pragmatic Programmers suggestion to “ learn a new programming language every year ” .
As an extension to this , I think there is some truth in what I think is a quote from Dan North : “ everyone should write a mocking framework ” .
In any case , I certainly know that one of the most important things I ’ve got out of writing Mocha is a deeper understanding of Ruby internals .
Lastly this seems like an opportune time to thank my former colleagues at Reevoo : Paul Battley , Chris Roos and especially Ben Griffiths for all their help and encouragement with Mocha .
Sharky is a floating tea - infuser that looks like a shark fin marauding through the dangerous waters of your tea mug that simultaneously releases streamers of steeped tea that look suspiciously like the detritus after a nasty shark attack .
It is in fact possibly the most brilliant tea - maker ever made :
It ’s better than the teabag auto - undangler , better than the clip - on mugside infuser , better even than the masterpiece that is the sorapot .
That ’s because it ’s a brain - twisting blend of the refined qualities associated with tea - drinking , and the menacing “ whoops , there goes my leg ” blood - thirstiness of the killer of the deep .
And that mix is a classic emblem of great design .
You ’d barely be able to take a sip of the finished cup without John Williams ’ scary theme tune running through your thoughts .
At least , Sharky is the most brilliant tea - maker ever envisaged , since it ’s a concept by designer Pablo Matteoda from Argentina .
It ’s begging for someone to productize it .
At least I , along with many habitual tea - drinking people that I know , would buy it in a heartbeat .

Smoking Bans and the Third Reich
Hitler was a fervent anti smoker and a crusader for the anti-smoking cause .
He personally funded research into the dangers of smoking and little wonder those results given the nature of his regime tended to support his assertions that smoking was an evil the Aryan race must be rid of .
Many of the studies carried out during the Third Reich are the basis for the arguments put forward today by those seeking the imposition of repressive smoking bans .
Hitler once stated that tobacco was “ the wrath of the Red Man against the White Man ” Under the Nazi ’s the Bureau Against the Dangers of Alcohol and Tobacco was established in 1939 followed in 1942 by the Institute for the Struggle against the dangers of Tobacco .
Nazi ’s were the first to coin the term “ passive smoking ” Under the Nazi regime the German people had imposed on them the most comprehensive set of tobacco regulations and restrictions seen in any modern nation to that date .
Hitler himself took particular interest in this area often personally overseeing the drafting and implementation of anti smoking policy .

The UN 's special torture rapporteur called on the US Tuesday to pursue former president George W. Bush and defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld for torture and bad treatment of Guantanamo prisoners .
" Judicially speaking , the United States has a clear obligation " to bring proceedings against Bush and Rumsfeld , the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture Manfred Nowak said , in remarks to be broadcast on Germany 's ZDF television Tuesday evening .
He noted Washington had ratified the UN convention on torture which required " all means , particularly penal law " to be used to bring proceedings against those violating it .
" We have all these documents that are now publicly available that prove that these methods of interrogation were intentionally ordered by Rumsfeld , " against detainees at the US prison facility in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , Nowak said .
" But obviously the highest authorities in the United States were aware of this , " added Nowak , who authored a UN investigation report on the Guantanamo prison .
Bush stepped down from power Tuesday , with Barack Obama becoming the 44th president of the United States .
Asked about chances to bring legal action against Bush and Rumsfeld , Nowak said : " In principle yes .
I think the evidence is on the table . "
At issue , however , is whether " American law will recognise these forms of torture . "
A bipartisan Senate report released last month found Rumsfeld and other top administration officials responsible for abuse of Guantanamo detainees in US custody .
It said Rumsfeld authorized harsh interrogation techniques on December 2 , 2002 at the Guantanamo prison , although he ruled them out a month later .
The coercive measures were based on a document signed by Bush in February , 2002 .
French , German and US rights groups have previously said they wanted to bring legal action against Rumsfeld .

David Crosby is a music legend known for his solo performances as well as his work with the Byrds , and Crosby , Stills , Nash and Young .
In this interview , he recounts how the music industry has changed over his career .
" When it all started , record companies -- and there were many of them , and this was a good thing -- were run by people who loved records , " he says .
" Now record companies are run by lawyers and accountants . …
The people who run record companies now would n't know a song if it flew up their nose and died . "
Crosby also argues that the quality of music has suffered because of corporate interference .
" It does n't matter that Britney Spears has nothing to say and is about as deep as a birdbath , " he says .
This interview was conducted on March 4 , 2004 .
I think it was , you know , it was important to us because it launched our career , but --
Describing Woodstock as the " big bang , " I think that 's a great way to describe it , because the important thing about it was n't how many people were there or that it was a lot of truly wonderful music that got played .
The important thing was it 's the moment when all of that generation of hippies looked at each other and said , " Wait a minute , we 're not a fringe element .
There 's millions of us !
We 're what 's happening here ! "
It was that self - awareness , you know , that , up to that point , it really had n't happened . …
We , in the purpose of this film , think of Woodstock as the kind of " big bang " moment .
It was where culture and politics and everything all kind of came together …
There are several flippant answers to that that I will try to avoid .
I think very early on .
My father being in the movie business , I thought being an actor would be great .
But when I started singing to people in coffeehouses , you know , singing folk music and then , later , singing songs that I started to write myself , I felt more than an affinity for it .
I felt a calling .
You know , it was like having something come into your head and tell you that you needed to do this , very strongly .
It was a calling and it was unequivocal .
That was too much joy , you know what I 'm saying ?
I loved singing .
And when did you know it was what you were going to do with your life ?
When did I decide to go into business ?
Well , it was n't a business , when I decided .
It was simply a need to sing .
I started singing in coffeehouses when I was still in high school , in Santa Barbara .
I took a job washing dishes and busing tables in the coffeehouse , so I could be there , and would beg permission to sing harmony with the guy who was singing onstage .
That was the first time I ever got on a stage in front of people .
Of course , I did n't get paid , but for me it was the big time .
There 've been tons and tons of aftermath shots of what an LCD TV looks like after it 's met a Wiimote , but this may be the first actual recorded instance of said violence .
It 's mesmerizing .

Boy , 16 , arrested in gangland killing as friends of second knife victim warn of ' race war ' between Somalis and Afghans
By Charlotte Gill and Matt Sandy

A 16 - year - old boy has been arrested in connection with the murder of a teenager who was one of two knifed to death in London , police said today .
Michael Wright was found with fatal stab wounds outside a train station in an apparent gang killing on Thursday .
The Metropolitan Police said a 16 - year - old suspect was in custody at an east London police station .
The forced added that a woman in her 30s had also been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and was in custody .
Tributes : Friends of murdered teen Michael Wright gather at the scene yesterday
The 17 - year - old was one of two teenagers who were stabbed to death within hours of each other in a night of bloodshed on London 's streets .
Michael was attacked in Leytonstone Road , opposite Maryland rail station in east London , at about 10.30 pm .
He died at the Royal London Hospital shortly after being found .
Knifed : Michael Wright
His friends , many hiding their faces with scarves or hoods , gathered at the scene yesterday to lay flowers and pay their respects as a large number of police looked on .
Bleir Xhana , 26 , who runs a bar yards from where the incident happened , said : ' A customer walked in and said they saw a black guy just lying there on the zebra crossing near the station .
' I did n't know what had happened to the boy but I was horrified and afraid .
' To be honest it is quite dangerous round here . '
The dead man 's brother also visited the scene yesterday to lay flowers .
He said : ' I have no idea why it happened or why he was stabbed - no one was after him .
' He was a very popular nice lad and we were tight .
I 'm proud of my brother and I am just gutted . '
The attack on Michael Wright came just three hours after 19 - year - old Kul Hawalied was stabbed to death in a separate incident in Wealdstone , north - west London .
The university student was knifed in the chest by a group of thugs in a suspected gang war between Somlais and Afghanis .
Mr Hawalied , from north - west London , was treated by paramedics but was pronounced dead at the scene .
Another teenager was also injured .
Student Hassan Kul Hawadleh was stabbed to death outside a petrol station
The earlier killing happened at 7.30 pm as Mr Hawadleh and an 18 - year - old friend stopped at a service station in Wealdstone , north west London .
As the pair , who are both Somali , got out of their car , four or five youths on the other side of the road saw them and came over to confront them .
They knifed Mr Hawadleh and his companion before fleeing on foot .
Mr Hawadleh died at the scene while his friend is in a stable condition in hospital .
A friend of the two men , Abdul Hassan , 22 , said that the pair were attacked in a race gang war by Afghanis .
He said : ' I 'm sure the guys who killed Hassan did n't know him , they are just targeting any Somalis .
' There was a stabbing on Wednesday , and then yesterday afternoon two of my other friends got ran up to by a gang of guys in bandanas .
' They are all Afghan or black and they are targeting Somalis .
' Hassan was not involved in anything like this , there is no reason he would be targeted .
Everyone loved the guy . '
Mr Hawadleh moved to the UK with his family when he was one year old and was studying media at the University of East London .
He was one of eight siblings .
His sister Ubed said : ' We do n't know why he got stabbed , I do n't know why anyone would want to hurt him .
Police said Mr Hawadleh was attacked by up to eight men as he refilled his car
' We have a real problem in society today - stabbing has just become the norm - it has replaced fist fighting .
People 's lives are no longer valued .
' Hassan was not the sort of person to get involved in any fighting .
He was n't the sort of boy to hang out in gangs , he was a sensible character . '
His brother , Yonis , 29 , said : ' He had a real zest for life .
He really wanted to go into the media business and travel around the world .
' He was never in trouble with the police .
He just was n't like that .
He was with his mates from uni going to play football .
' He did n't know the people who attacked him .
He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time .
We 're not sure if his friends knew them , we do n't know anything more . '
Forensics officers examine the scene near Maryland railway station , east London , after an 18 - year - old was found with stab wounds
Another friend , 23 - year - old Issaq Soul , said : ' There is a war going on between the Afghans and the Somalis .
' The tension has been building .
They want to call the shots around here .
They are completely lawless .
But Kul was n't caught up in all that .'
There have been no arrests in either case .
The two deaths bring the total of teen killings in London to three this year .
Last year , 28 teenagers were killed in the capital .
Police are appealing for witnesses to Mr Hawalied 's killing .

US intelligence chief : World capitalist crisis poses greatest threat
14 February 2009
In testimony before the Senate Committee on Intelligence Thursday , Washington 's new director of national intelligence , Dennis Blair , warned that the deepening world capitalist crisis posed the paramount threat to US national security and warned that its continuation could trigger a return to the " violent extremism " of the 1920s and 1930s .
This frank assessment , contained in the unclassified version of the " annual threat assessment " presented by Blair on behalf of 16 separate US intelligence agencies , represented a striking departure from earlier years , in which a supposedly ubiquitous threat from Al Qaeda terrorism and the two wars launched under the Bush administration topped the list of concerns .
Clearly underlying his remarks are fears within the massive US intelligence apparatus as well as among more conscious layers of the American ruling elite that a protracted economic crisis accompanied by rising unemployment and reduced social spending will trigger a global eruption of the class struggle and the threat of social revolution .
The presentation was not only the first for Blair , a former Navy admiral who took over as director of national intelligence only two weeks ago , but also marked the first detailed elaboration of the perspective of the US intelligence apparatus since the inauguration of President Barack Obama .
" The primary near - term security concern of the United States is the global economic crisis and its geopolitical implications , " Blair declared in his opening remarks .
He continued : " The crisis has been ongoing for over a year , and economists are divided over whether and when we could hit bottom .
Some even fear that the recession could further deepen and reach the level of the Great Depression .
Of course , all of us recall the dramatic political consequences wrought by the economic turmoil of the 1920s and 1930s in Europe , the instability , and high levels of violent extremism . "
Blair described the ongoing financial and economic meltdown as " the most serious one in decades , if not in centuries . "
" Time is probably our greatest threat , " he said .
" The longer it takes for the recovery to begin , the greater the likelihood of serious damage to US strategic interests . "
The intelligence chief noted that " roughly a quarter of the countries in the world have already experienced low - level instability such as government changes because of the current slowdown . "
He added that the " bulk of anti-state demonstrations " internationally have been seen in Europe and the former Soviet Union .
But Blair stressed that the threat that the crisis will produce revolutionary upheavals is global .
The financial meltdown , he said , is " likely to produce a wave of economic crises in emerging market nations over the next year . "
He added that " much of Latin America , former Soviet Union states and sub-Saharan Africa lack sufficient cash reserves , access to international aid or credit , or other coping mechanism . "
Noting that economic growth in these regions of the globe had fallen dramatically in recent months , Blair stated , " When those growth rates go down , my gut tells me that there are going to be problems coming out of that , and we 're looking for that . "
He cited " statistical modeling " showing that " economic crises increase the risk of regime - threatening instability if they persist over a one to two year period . "
In another parallel to the 1930s , the US intelligence director pointed to the implications of the crisis for world trade and relations between national capitalist economies .
" The globally synchronized nature of this slowdown means that countries will not be able to export their way out of this recession , " he said .
" Indeed , policies designed to promote domestic export industries — so - called beggar - thy - neighbor policies such as competitive currency devaluations , import tariffs , and / or export subsidies — risk unleashing a wave of destructive protectionism . "
It was precisely such policies pursued in the 1930s that set the stage for the eruption of the Second World War .
Blair also raised the damage that the crisis has done to the global credibility of American capitalism , declaring that the " widely held perception that excesses in US financial markets and inadequate regulation were responsible has increased criticism about free market policies , which may make it difficult to achieve long - time US objectives . "
The collapse of Wall Street , he added , " has increased questioning of US stewardship of the global economy and the international financial structure . "
The threat assessment also included evaluations of potential terrorist threats , the " arc of instability " stretching from the Middle East to South Asia , conditions in Latin America and Africa and strategic challenges from both China and Russia , centering in Eurasia .
It likewise dealt with the war in Afghanistan , which the Obama administration is preparing to escalate , providing a scathing assessment of the Karzai regime in Kabul and the familiar demand for an escalation of the intervention in Pakistan .
Nonetheless , the report 's undeniable focus was on the danger that economic turmoil will ignite revolutionary challenges on a world scale .
Blair 's emphasis on the global capitalist crisis as the overriding national security concern for American imperialism seemed to leave some of the Senate intelligence panel 's members taken aback .
They have been accustomed over the last seven years to having all US national security issues subsumed in the " global war on terrorism , " a propaganda catch - all used to justify US aggression abroad while papering over the immense contradictions underlying Washington 's global position .
The committee 's Republican vice chairman , Senator Christopher Bond of Missouri , expressed his concern that Blair was making the " conditions in the country " and the global economic crisis " the primary focus of the intelligence community . "
Blair responded that he was " trying to act as your intelligence officer today , telling you what I thought the Senate ought to be caring about . "
It sounded like a rebuke and a warning to the senators that it is high time to ditch the ideological baggage of the past several years and confront the real and growing threat to capitalist rule posed by the crisis and the resulting radicalization of the masses in country after country .
It may have been lost on some of those sitting at the dais in the Senate hearing room , but when Blair referred to a return to the conditions of " violent extremism " of the 1920s and 1930s , he was warning that American and world capitalism once again faces the specter of a revolutionary challenge by the working class .
There is no doubt that behind the façade of Obama , the US national security apparatus is making its counter - revolutionary preparations accordingly .
Including Blair , Obama has named three recently retired four - star military officers to serve in his cabinet .
The other two are former Marine Gen. James Jones , his national security adviser , and former Army chief of staff Gen. Erik Shinseki , his secretary of veterans affairs .
This unprecedented representation of the senior officer corps within the new Democratic administration is indicative of a growth in the political power of the US military that poses a serious threat to basic democratic rights .
A report that appeared in a magazine published by the US Army War College last November , just weeks after the election , indicates that the Pentagon and the US intelligence establishment are preparing for what they see as a historic crisis of the existing order that could require the use of armed force to quell social struggles at home .
Entitled " Known Unknowns : Unconventional ‘ Strategic Shocks ' in Defense Strategy Development , " the monograph insists that one of the key contingencies for which the US military must prepare is a " violent , strategic dislocation inside the United States , " which could be provoked by " unforeseen economic collapse " or " loss of functioning political and legal order . "
The report states : " Widespread civil violence inside the United States would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis to defend basic domestic order ...
An American government and defense establishment lulled into complacency by a long - secure domestic order would be forced to rapidly divest some or most external security commitments in order to address rapidly expanding human insecurity at home . "
In other words , a sharp intensification of the unfolding capitalist crisis accompanied by an eruption of class struggle and the threat of social revolution in the US itself could force the Pentagon to call back its expeditionary armies from Iraq and Afghanistan for use against American workers .
The document continues : " Under the most extreme circumstances , this might include use of military force against hostile groups inside the United States .
Further , DoD [ the Department of Defense ] would be , by necessity , an essential enabling hub for the continuity of political authority in a multi-state or nationwide civil conflict or disturbance . "
The phrase — " an essential enabling hub for continuity of authority " — is a euphemism for military dictatorship .
The working class must draw its own urgent conclusions from the rapid deepening of the present crisis , above all the necessity of building a mass independent political party based on a socialist and internationalist program and fighting to put an end to the capitalist profit system .
This means , above all , joining and building the Socialist Equality Party .

Singer Ben E. King sings " Stand By Me " at the conclusion of a tribute to late stand - up comedian George Carlin at the Kennedy Center 's Mark Twain Prize for American Humor Gala in Washington November 10 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Mike Theiler
LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - George Carlin would have been greatly flattered and at least slightly embarrassed had he lived to see “ George Carlin : The Mark Twain Prize . ”
Taped November 10 at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington , the event represents an honor that Carlin said meant a great deal to him .
The comedian learned of it shortly before he died June 22 of a heart attack .
The much - deserved , clip - filled tribute features testimonials from such comic greats as Jon Stewart , Bill Maher , Lily Tomlin , Denis Leary , Joan Rivers , Garry Shandling , Lewis Black , Margaret Cho and Richard Belzer .
The evening , taped for broadcast on PBS , strikes just the right balance of reverence and mirth in paying homage to one of the greatest , most ingenious and most revered ( by his peers ) comedian of the past half - century .
But any review of this Twain Prize accolade would be incomplete without calling attention to a truth at once obvious , ironic and more than a little bit ridiculous .
The comics onstage are bleeped here not simply for public TV broadcast but also in the venue itself , as is pointed out in his inimitable blustery fashion by Black .
If you did n’t know what Carlin ’s infamous “ seven dirty words ” actually were -- the ones that ultimately would be at the center of a Supreme Court test case -- you ’d never learn them here because all are censored , along with numerous other purportedly profane utterances from the stage .
Carlin no doubt would have been both disgusted by the lack of progress we ’ve made in allowing “ naughty ” words to be heard on the airwaves -- or seen in print -- and amused that a show celebrating his impact and legacy would be so ludicrously constrained .

Consider this an " interlude " of sorts in my series on writing a compiler , since the parser that will be presented in one of the future parts of that series depends significantly on an operator precedence parser to cut down on the amount of code .
Prologue
When I was 12 or 13 I was rifling through discounted books in some book store , and I found a book on Prolog .
I was deeply fascinated by different programming languages at the time , so I picked it up .
It gave a lot of interesting examples , including how to do symbolic differentiation .
I found it interesting how much manipulation you could do that way very easily in Prolog , but I did n't have a Prolog handy .
Instead I decided to try to replicate the example in Pascal ( I was using a Amiga at the time , and the C compilers were dog slow , but I had HiSoft Pascal , which was fast and with an IDE ) .
So I had to write an expression parser to get things into tree form first .
If you studied computer science , you 've probably done something similar several times - it 's commonly done in introductory algorithms courses .
It 's not hard , and there 's a large number of different ways of doing it , one of the most commonly presented ones being Dijkstra 's Shunting Yard algorithm to turn an infix expression into reverse Polish notation .
Not having any textbooks handy , however , meant I had to figure it out myself .
What I stumbled upon was a simple operator precedence parser , quite close to the Shunting Yard algorithm , as it's a quite natural approach to take if you sit down and just go walk the problem with a few examples .
Originally it was a recursive beast - the inspiration I was drawing from the Prolog book did n't help .
The code got real messy .
Eventually I sat down , drew a flowchart and figured out how to clean it up .
I was very happy about it .
Especially when I got the symbolic differentiation working ( I fully believe that writing the code to do it taught me far more about it than practicing on examples did at school ; though it also made me think it was pointless to memorize the rules ) .
As it always does when I start a hobby project , it took off in all kinds of directions , and before I knew it it had started morphing into my first compiler - a bizarre mix of inline assembler and a " Pascal with braces " where variables in expressions could be substituted directly for M68000 registers .
In some ways it was reminiscent of Randall Hyde 's High Level Assembly though it certainly never got as polished as HLA .
But that operator precedence parser was the start of my compiler interest .
For all intents and purposes this was a variation of Dijkstra 's algorithm with the only real difference being that I build a tree instead of outputting in RPN , which I finally realized when I about 5 - 6 years later started university and it showed up in my algorithm course first semester .
D`oh .
It was a learning experience worth having , though - I know that algorithm a lot better than a textbook would 've taught it to me .
Below is a walk through of building a fairly generic Shunting Yard implementation for Ruby with pluggable tokenizers and output generators .
The difference between generating RPN vs. a tree structure is minimal .
What is an operator precedence parser and why should I care ?
First of all , consider what operator precedence is :
1 + 2 * 3
Does this mean ( 1 + 2 ) * 3 or 1 + ( 2 * 3 ) ?
Most would agree it means the latter . " * " has higher precedence than " + " .
An Operator Precedence Parser ( hereafter I 'll refer to it as an OPP ) is a parser that uses operator precedence rules to parse an expression instead of lists of valid productions .
More specifically , it is most often used about a parser that is not hardwired in code for a specific set of operator precedences - it is typical to write an OPP that runs entirely of a small table with information about the operators .
The latter is what makes them interesting .
Manually writing parsers is tedious .
Especially when the patterns repeat over and over again , as they do for expressions that follows a very regular grammar .
So if you do want to use a manually written parser for whatever reason , an OPP is often a good way of making the parser compact and easy to extend or modify , as simple modifications to the grammar can be done just by amending a table of operator precedences and types .
Fairly large languages can use OPP's .
My first compiler was eventually , after starting out with a mix of a standard recursive descent parser and an OPP , driven entirely by an operator precedence parser with some unusual extensions ( support for prefix and postfix operators with multiple operands , for example ) .
Statement delimiters were operators .
Start / end of blocks ( using curly baces ) were treated as special types of parentheses that translated into a special " block " operator , and square brackets were treated the same way for array index . " . " 's in method calls were operators .
Method names were operators that took an argument list as a parameter .
The argument list was a list of expressions combined by the " , " operator .
Even if / while etc. where operators .
I would n't recommend going that far usually - unless the language is very regular and very limited in number of constructs it can get quite hard to pick the correct priorities and other flags .
That said , it did mean the printout of the parser excluding the tokenization fit on less than two sheets of paper .
It also worked because the language was designed to make it work - today I do n't like having to separate statements with ' ; ' any more , for example , and like keeping the use of parentheses and braces down after having gotten used to Ruby .
Problems with Operator Precedence Parsers
OPP 's in themselves work on context free grammars . " * " has the same properties no matter where it 's found .
In many languages that is not sufficient .
A typical example is " a * b " in C , which can be a multiplication or a pointer declaration .
This can sometimes be worked around , but not without additional information provided by the parser .
In the C example , a symbol table lookup is required on " a " ( which also means the symbol table must be build during parsing ) .
For an OPP , the specific type of the following operator must then be adjusted based on the type of the preceding operand .
That gets ugly pretty quickly .
For parsers where context is required many places , an OPP is often not an appropriate choice , as a lot of the simplicity that makes them attractive gets lost in working around context issues .
A " workaround " may be to restrict the use of the OPP to subsets of the language that are context free , but this creates issues of it's own ; specifically the issue of identifying the boundary between the part of the source text that should be parsed by the OPP and the rest .
In some languages this is easy ( an expression might always be terminated by a line - feed , a semicolon or the token ' end ' for example ) , but that 's not a general rule .
Bring on the code
It is hard to write a totally generic shunting yard implementation for the simple reason that so many rules will depend on the specifics of your grammar .
The code is however small enough that cut and past and adapting to a specific solution is perhaps more appropriate for many types of adaptation than complicating the code with a lot of knobs to tune behavior with .
Here 's a reasonably feature full version :
Oper = Struct . new ( : pri , :sym , : type ) class Shunting Yard def initialize opers , output @ostack , @opers , @out = [ ] , opers , output end def reduce op = nil pri = op ? op .
pri : 0 # We check for : postfix to handle cases where a postfix operator has # been given a lower precedence than an infix operator , yet it needs # to bind tighter to tokens preceeding it than a following infix operator # regardless , because the alternative gives a malformed expression .
while !
@ostack .
empty ? && ( @ostack [ - 1 ]. pri > pri || @ostack [ - 1 ]. type == : postfix ) o = @ostack .
pop return if o .
type == : lp @out .
oper ( o ) end end def shunt src possible_func = false # was the last token a possible function name ?
opstate = : prefix # IF we get a single arity operator right now , it is a prefix operator # " opstate " is used to handle things like pre-increment and post - increment that # share the same token .
src .
each do | token | if op = @opers [ token ] op = op [ opstate ] if op .
is_a ? ( Hash ) if op .
type == :rp then reduce else opstate = : prefix reduce op #
For handling the postfix operators @ostack << ( op .
type == : lp && possible_func ?
Oper . new ( 1 , : call , : infix ) : op ) end else @out .
value ( token ) opstate = :infix_or_postfix #
After a non-operator value , any single arity operator would be either postfix , # so when seeing the next operator we will assume it is either infix or postfix .
end possible_func = ! op && !
token .
is_a ? ( Numeric ) end reduce return @out if @ostack .
empty ?
raise " Syntax error .
#{ @ostack .
inspect } " end end
Let 's walk through it bit by bit :
The #initialize method
@ostack is our operator stack .
We 'll push any operators we come across onto it , and then remove them from it again as and when the top operator has the appropriate priority .
@opers gets assigned a Hash of operators provided by the caller .
@output gets assigned a class that handle the tokens that are ready to be output .
def initialize opers , output @ostack , @opers , @out = [ ] , opers , output end
We 'll skip the #reduce method for now .
The #shunt method
The # shunt method is called with an object we can iterate over to get tokens .
I 'll show a simple implementation that satisfies the requirements for this later .
Lets take a look at the guts of # shunt :
src.each do |token| if op = @opers [ token ] op = op [ opstate ] if op.is_a ?( Hash )
First we 've now looked up the current token , and if it's in the operator table we now have an object representing the operator in " op " .
The last line above handles the case where there 's more than one operator with the same name .
This is the case for things like prefix vs postfix increment ( " ++ " ) in many languages , for example .
" opstate " holds a symbol used to pick the right one depending on whether or not the current state means that a prefix or postfix / infix operator is allowed .
if op . type == :rp then reduce
If the operator is a closing parenthesis , we need to output the entire parenthesized sub-expression .
Any operands have already been output , and the call to #reduce will take care of the operators .
else opstate = : prefix reduce op #
For handling the postfix operators @ostack << ( op. type == :lp && possible_func ?
Oper.new ( 1 , : call , :infix ) : op ) end
Above is what happens when any normal operator is found .
After an operator , a prefix operator would be valid , but another infix / postfix one is not , so we set opstate accordingly .
Then we reduce the operator stack , passing in the current operator to take into account it 's priority .
Then lastly we push either a synthesized " : call " operator to handle a function call on the form f( arg1 , arg2 ... ) , or just plain the operator from the lookup .
else @out.value ( token ) opstate = :infix_or_postfix #
After a non-operator value , any single arity operator would be either postfix , # so when seeing the next operator we will assume it is either infix or postfix .
end possible_func = ! op && !token.is_a ?( Numeric ) end
... and if it 's an operand it 's just fed to the output object .
Last but not least , we set the flag that indicate if this is the possible start of a function call .
In this case we simply assume that any non-numeric , non -operator token is a function if it 's later followed by a left parenthesis token , which is likely to be far too aggressive for a real language .
The #reduce method
The #reduce method loops over the operator stack as long as the top of the stack contains an element with a higher priority value ( which means lower priority ) OR the top operator is a postfix operator :
If so , the operator is removed .
If it 's a left parenthesis it means we 've reduced / output the entire parenthesized sub-expression , so we just return .
If not we output the operator , and continue :
o = @ostack .pop return if o.type == :lp @out.oper ( o ) end end
Outputting RPN
The original shunting yard algorithm outputs reverse polish notation , and this is trivial with the above class .
The appropriate output class is as follows :
class RPNOutput def initialize ; @rpn = [ ] ; end def oper o ; @rpn << o.sym ; end def value v ; @rpn << v ; end def result ; @rpn ; end end
Outputting a tree structure
RPN output is not very interesting to me , so I also hacked together this example class to do tree output ( this was the reason I split out the output handling in the first place - doing it for RPN would 've been kind of overkill ) :
class TreeOutput def initialize @vstack = [ ] end def oper o rightv = @vstack .pop raise " Missing value in expression " if ! rightv if ( o.sym == : comma || o.sym == : call ) && rightv.is_a ?( Array ) && rightv [ 0 ] == : comma #
This is a way to flatten the tree by removing all the : comma operators @vstack << [ o.sym, @vstack.pop ] + right v [ 1.. - 1 ] else if o. type == : infix leftv = @vstack .pop raise " Missing value in expression " if ! leftv @vstack << [ o.sym , leftv , rightv ] else @vstack << [ o.sym , rightv ] end end end def value v ; @vstack << v ; end def result raise " Incomplete expression - #{@vstack.inspect } " if @vstack.length != 1 return @vstack [ 0 ] end end
It should be fairly self - explanatory .
It uses the " type " accessor to determine how to put the tree together .
Apart from that the only weirdness is the little bit of code to " flatten " a function call because I rely on treating " , " as an operator separating the arguments , and for multi-argument functions it 'd quickly create fairly deep , messy trees .
Pulling it all together
How to use it ?
First of all we need a simple lexer to produce tokens .
This just uses a regex to split things up and convert streams of digits into integers .
For " real world " use you 'd probably want something more advanced :
class SimpleLexer def initialize s ; @s = s ; end def each @s.scan ( /[ \r
] * ( [ 0 - 9 ] +
|[ A - Za - z ] +|\+\+ |[\(\ )+\-*\/\! , ] ) [ \r
]*/) .each do |token| token = token [ 0 ] yield ( ( ? 0 .. ? 9 ) .member ?( token [ 0 ] ) ? token.to_i : token ) end end end
Then we create a Hash of operators and get going :
def shunt a opers = { " + " => Oper.new ( 10 , : plus , :infix ) , " ++ " => {:infix_or_postfix => Oper.new ( 30 , : postincr , : postfix ) , : prefix => Oper.new ( 30 , : preincr , : prefix ) } , " - " => Oper.new ( 10 , : minus , :infix ) , " * " => Oper.new ( 20 , :mul , :infix ) , " / " => Oper.new ( 20 , : div , :infix ) , " ! " => Oper.new ( 30 , : not , : prefix ) , " , " => Oper.new ( 2 , : comma , :infix ) , " ( " => Oper.new ( 99 , nil , : lp ) , " ) " => Oper.new ( 99 , nil , :rp ) } ShuntingYard.new( opers , TreeOutput.new ).shunt(SimpleLexer.new(a ) ) . result end
Some examples :
PP. pp shunt ( " 1 + !5 " ) PP. pp shunt ( " 1 + 5 " ) PP. pp shunt ( " 1 + 2 * 3 " ) PP. pp shunt ( " 1 * 2 + 3 / 5 " ) PP. pp shunt ( " ( 1 + 2 ) * 3 " ) PP. pp shunt ( " 3 * ( 1 + 2 ) " ) PP. pp shunt ( " 3 * ( 1 + ( 2 * 4 ) ) " ) PP. pp shunt ( " f ( 1 ) " ) PP. pp shunt ( " f( 1,2 ) " ) PP. pp shunt ( " f( 1,2,3 ) " ) PP. pp shunt ( " 1 * f ++ + 5 " ) PP. pp shunt ( " ++f " )
PP. pp shunt ( " 1 + ++f " )
PP. pp shunt ( " 1 + f ++ - f " ) begin PP. pp shunt ( " f + + 5 " ) # Makes no sense .
Should give an error .
rescue puts " Failed , as it should " end
... and it 's output :
$ ruby shunting .rb [ : plus , 1 , [ : not , 5 ] ] [ : plus , 1 , 5 ] [ : plus , 1 , [ : mul , 2 , 3 ] ] [ : plus , [ : mul , 1 , 2 ] , [ : div , 3 , 5 ] ] [ : mul , [ : plus , 1 , 2 ] , 3 ] [ : mul , 3 , [ : plus , 1 , 2 ] ] [ : mul , 3 , [ : plus , 1 , [ : mul , 2 , 4 ] ] ] [ : call , " f " , 1 ] [ : call , " f " , 1 , 2 ] [ : call , " f " , 1 , 2 , 3 ] [ : plus , [ : mul , 1 , [ : postincr , " f " ] ] , 5 ] [ : preincr , " f " ] [ : plus , 1 , [ : preincr , " f " ] ] [ : plus , 1 , [ : minus , [ : postincr , " f " ] , " f " ] ] [ : plus , 1 , [ : mul , [ : not , 5 ] , 2 ] ]
Failed , as it should
( Yeah , I know , should do proper unit tests )

Norway is finally off Apple 's back now that the company has decided to ditch its FairPlay DRM on all of its music tracks .
The DRM - free tracks ( iTunes Plus ) are now compatible with any music player that can play AAC files and are therefore free of the restrictive iPod tie - in that has annoyed so many customers .
" We have no reason to pursue them anymore , " Norway 's consumer mediator Bj�rn Erik Thon told AFP .
Norway 's consumer watchdog group had been pursuing Apple over the DRM on iTunes Store music since early 2006 , when the Consumer Council of Norway filed a complaint with the Consumer Ombudsman of Norway alleging violations of the country 's Marketing Control Act .
In its complaint , the consumer group pointed to Apple 's terms and conditions that prohibit buyers from compromising the copy protection so that the tracks can be played on portable devices other than the iPod .
Since then , EU Commissioner for Consumer Protection Meglena Kuneva has spoken out against the tie - in between the iPod and the iTunes Store , and consumer groups in both France and Germany joined Norway 's push to get Apple to ditch its DRM .
When Apple first announced that it was rolling out DRM - free tracks from EMI in 2007 , the Norwegian Consumer Council was pleased , but wanted more .
As did we all , of course .
That brings us to today .
Thon had threatened to take Apple to court in late 2008 if the company did n't do something about its restrictions soon , but as most Apple fans know , Phil Schiller announced this January at the 2009 Macworld Expo that DRM would be completely banished from the music side of the iTunes Store by April of this year .
At that time , Apple expects all 10 million of its songs to be DRM - free and released at the higher - quality 256 kbps iTunes Plus bitrate .
This policy change applies across the board to all four major music labels ( Universal Music Group , Sony BMG , Warner Music Group , and EMI ) as well as thousands of independent labels .
With such a significant change , Norway and the gang apparently have no more complaints .
Thon told the AFP that he planned to inform Apple of the decision this week , but something tells us that if it's in the media , Apple already knows .

Annoted image of the possible Beagle crash site
Enlarge Image
Colin Pillinger says the images suggest the mission very nearly worked , but Beagle somehow failed to contact Earth .
He thinks the craft may have hit the ground too hard - as the atmosphere was thinner than usual because of dust storms in that region of Mars .
This may have damaged onboard instruments , preventing the call home .
The Beagle 2 lead scientist has been painstakingly studying images of the landing site in search of his spacecraft ever since it was lost on Christmas Day two years ago .
Now , he says , specially processed pictures from the camera on the US space agency 's ( Nasa ) Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft show that it came down in a crater close to the planned landing site .
Life search
The robotic laboratory was designed to search Mars for signs of past or present life .
The last contact was an image of Beagle taken by its mothership , the Mars Express orbiter , on 19 December 2003 .
Beagle 2 was designed to seek out signs of life on Mars
Professor Pillinger accepts the sceptics will say Beagle 2 is too small to be seen from space .
And when taken in isolation , each of the " objects " in the crater bowl could be explained by other phenomena .
However , he argues , it is unlikely to be mere coincidence that so many unusual features are to be found " within 20 m of each other " .
" We 've had the pessimists round saying ' we 've already seen something like that ' .
But they have n't seen them all together , " he told the BBC .
Crater bounce
Based on the features found in the crater , members of the Beagle 2 team have reconstructed what might have happened to Beagle as it touched down on the Red Planet .
" There is a lot of disturbance in this crater , particularly a big patch on the north crater wall which we think is the primary impact site , " Professor Pillinger explains .
" There are then other features around the crater consistent with the airbags bouncing around and finally falling down into the middle .
Then , when you cut the lace , the airbags fall apart giving three very symmetrical triangles . "
Four roughly circular features to the right of the " airbags " could conceivably be Beagle 's unfolded solar panels .
Professor Pillinger claims the images show Beagle 2 came very close to being the first spacecraft to mount a concerted search for life on the Martian surface .
And so , he says , it would have been common sense for British and European governments to have backed another attempt .
Nasa 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft , which will photograph
Mars in unprecedented detail once it reaches the planet next year , could confirm the tentative identification .
