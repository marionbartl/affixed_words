A new member for contextlib ?
I suggest a context manager for property defining / redefining .
There is a prototype and illustrative example :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- import sys null = object ( ) _property = property class property ( _property ) : # def __init__( self , *args , **kw ) : _property.__init__(self , *args , ** kw ) self .
__enter__ = self .
__enter self.__exit__ = self .__exit # @classmethod def __enter__( self ) : return null # @classmethod def __exit__ ( self , type , value , tb ) : if tb is None : frame = sys._getframe(1 ) self.__exitHandler(self , frame.f_locals ) # def __enter ( self ) : return null # def __exit ( self , type , value , tb ) : if tb is None : frame = sys._getframe(1 ) self.__exitHandler(self , frame.f_locals ) # @staticmethod def __exitHandler ( self , _locals ) : propName = " _ " PropName = str( id( self ) ) for key , value in _locals.items ( ) : if value is null : propName = key PropName = key.capitalize ( ) break if type ( self ) == type ( property ) : getFunc = _locals.pop ( ' get ' , None ) setFunc = _locals.pop ( ' set ' , None ) delFunc = _locals.pop ( ' delete ' , None ) doc = _locals.pop ( ' doc ' , None ) else : getFunc = _locals.pop ( ' get ' , None ) or self .
fget setFunc = _locals.pop ( ' set ' , None ) or self .
fset delFunc = _locals.pop ( ' delete ' , None ) or self.
fdel doc = _locals.pop ( ' doc ' , None ) or self .
__doc__ if getFunc : funcName = " _get " + PropName getFunc.__name__ = funcName _locals[ funcName ] = getFunc if setFunc : funcName = " _set " + PropName setFunc.__name__ = funcName _locals[ funcName ] = setFunc if delFunc : funcName = " _del " + PropName delFunc.__name__ = funcName _locals[ funcName ] = delFunc prop = property ( getFunc , setFunc , delFunc ) prop.__doc__ = doc _locals [ propName ] = prop

( This was my last week at a very lousy sales job working for a major jewelry manufacturer that deals exclusively with jewelers on a screened account basis . )
Me : “ Thank you for calling [ Manufacturer ] .
How can I help you ? ”
Customer : “ I need a price check on a diamond . ”
( We go through a drawn out process of finding the stone he wants : a large carat , high - grade diamond .
I quote him the price in the system . )
Customer : “ That ca n’t be right !
That ’s too expensive ! ”
Me : “ It ’s the price I have in the system , sir .
If you like , we can look for a different piece ? ”
Customer : “ NO !
It has to be that one !
Are you sure that ’s the right price ? ”
Me : “ Yes , sir . ”
Customer : “ Are you absolutely certain ? ”
Me : “ Absolutely , sir . ”
Customer : “ And that ’s in dollars , right ? ”
( At this point , I ’m fed up and not really concerned with whether I get fired or not at this point .
I answer in my most sincere deadpan . )
Me : “ No , sir .
That ’s in woodchucks .
We deal exclusively in fresh , live woodchucks . ”
( I hear a bark of laughter from one of the call monitoring agents on the next row , which gets even louder when the customer asks if I ’m serious . )
· Backlash from fellow Shias after three days of clashes · Al - Sadr orders days of mourning and shuts office
The Iraqi militia leader Moqtada al - Sadr , called a six - month truce yesterday after fighting with a rival Shia Muslim group in the holy city of Kerbala left more than 50 dead .
A spokesman for the Mahdi army claimed they would lay down their weapons for six months and , during this time , would attack neither other Shia groups nor the US army .
Mr Sadr , who has thousands of armed men at his command , has called truces before but these have been short - lived .
Although US forces will welcome any respite , most of the attacks they face in the centre and north of Iraq are from Sunni nationalist groups and al - Qaida in Iraq .
A US military spokesman , Lieutenant - Colonel Christopher Garver , said any organisation that worked towards a peaceful Iraq would be appreciated .
Since President George Bush announced in January he was to send an extra 30,000 US troops to Iraq , the Mahdi army has reduced the number of attacks on US forces .
Mr Sadr was reported by the US to have sought temporary sanctuary in Iran for a time , though he denied it .
Even when US forces went into Sadr city , a slum area of Baghdad that is the stronghold of Mr Sadr , the predicted bloodbath did not materialise and the Mahdi army has maintained a low profile .
Mr Sadr 's truce appears to be in response to a backlash by fellow Shias over three days of Shia in - fighting at a time when hundreds of thousands of pilgrims are in Kerbala .
The fighting forced many pilgrims to flee .
At least 52 died and 279 were wounded on Tuesday in the fighting between the Mahdi army and the Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council .
A curfew has been imposed on the city .
Hazim al - Araji , an aide to Mr Sadr , read out a statement to Reuters saying the militia would suspend its operations " to restructure it in a way that will preserve its principles " .
He said Mr Sadr had ordered all his movement 's offices shut for three days of mourning .
The restructuring is a hint he is trying to distance himself from elements in the Mahdi army being blamed for taking violence close to two holy sites , the Imam Hussein and Imam Abbas shrines .
He can claim that parts of the Mahdi army are outside his control .
Another aide suggested as much when he said the aim was to remove bad members " working for their personal interests ... to hurt the Mahdi army 's reputation " .
Both the Mahdi army and the SIIC have links with their co-religionists in Iran , though the extent of these relationships are a matter of dispute .
Mr Bush has accused the Iranian government this year of meddling in Iraq , including providing weapons to insurgents , and ordered US diplomats and military to adopt a more forceful stance towards Iranians in Iraq .
Iran protested yesterday after eight Iranians , including two with diplomatic credentials , were arrested by US forces at a checkpoint in Baghdad on Tuesday as they were heading towards the Sheraton Ishtar hotel .
They were released after the Iraqi government interceded on their behalf .
The Iranians had been accompanied by Iraqis who were providing protection .
US troops seized three weapons from the cars for which there had been no permits .
The Iranians were apparently part of an official delegation to discuss cooperation on supplying electricity to villages along the Iraqi border .
Hoshyar Zebari , the Iraqi foreign minister , told the BBC : " After we intervened with the embassy and explained the situation that they were here on legal grounds on a legal basis and they have their visas , their credentials were established , then they were released . "
He added that the detention had nothing to do with Mr Bush 's speech that day in which he ramped up the threat to Iran .
In Tehran , the Iranian foreign ministry summoned the Swiss diplomat representing American interests in Iran to protest .
The US has no diplomatic links with Iran .
On 18 January 2008 , a Mr. Larry Sinclair of Duluth , Minnesota posted to YouTube a video statement entitled “ OBAMA ’S LIMO SEX & DRUG PARTY ” in which he made sensational allegations against Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama and challenged him to a polygraph showdown .
Mr. Sinclair has to date presented no evidence to corroborate his claims .
The video is linked below and followed by a full transcript :
Hi .
My name is Larry Sinclair .
I ’m making this video and posting it on YouTube because of an incident involving myself and Senator Barack Obama between November 3rd and November 8th of 1999 in the Chicago , Illinois area .
The mainstream media and Obama himself has done greatly [ sic ] to prevent this story from becoming public .
During those time periods in 1999 , I met Obama at an upscale lounge in Chicago , Illinois .
After having a few drinks , Obama and I left in my limo , began to drink .
Mr. Obama acquired powdered cocaine for my use , crack cocaine for his use .
I performed oral sex on Senator Obama who at the time was a state representative for the state of Illinois .
Mr. Obama knows these allegations to be true .
I ’m challenging Mr. Obama to come forth , be honest , stop claiming that his drug use is limited to his teenage years .
In 1999 , you were n’t a teenager .
In 1999 , you were a state representative for the people of the state of Illinois .
In 1999 , I performed oral sex on you in the back of my limo , as well as in my hotel room in Gurnee , Illinois , two days later .
If you challenge this — the authenticity of this allegation — I challenge you to take a polygraph test , as I will submit to as well .
These allegations are true and need to be told to the public .
Let the public decide whether Mr. Obama is being forthright and honest .
Thank you .
Mr. Sinclair soon became the darling of a number of right - of - center political blogs , and he has been interviewed by conspiracy theorist Jeff Rense ( download MP3 ) and New York shortwave talk radio show “ The Right Perspective ” ( download MP3 ) .
On 11 February , Mr. Sinclair filed , pro se , a federal lawsuit against Barack Obama , his campaign manager , and the Democratic National Committee in which he repeated his allegations but again offered nothing to substantiate them .
Then on 15 February , sometime Internet pornographer Dan Parisi , who runs the website WhiteHouse.com , made his own polygraph challenge to Mr. Sinclair , offering him $ 10,000 to submit to a lie detector test and an additional $ 90,000 if he passes .
Two days later , Parisi reported that Sinclair had accepted his challenge , and on Monday , 18 February , Parisi announced that the “ test ” will be administered by a “ renowned ” but as - yet - unnamed polygraph examiner on Tuesday , 26 February 2008 .
Parisi promises , “ Since the outcome of the test will be vital interest [ sic ] to the voting public , our findings will be made available before the presidential primaries in Texas and Ohio slated for March 4 . ”
Actually , the results of Mr. Sinclair ’s polygraph examination will shed no light on the question of whether he has spoken the truth , and the voting public should attach no weight to the results .
Polygraph “ testing ” has no scientific basis : it ’s fundamentally dependent on trickery , inherently biased against the truthful , and yet easily passed by liars using simple countermeasures that polygraphers have no demonstrated ability to detect .
See AntiPolygraph.org ’s e-book The Lie Behind the Lie Detector ( 1 mb PDF ) for a thorough debunking of polygraphy and details on how anyone can fool the lie detector .
While polygraph challenges may make for titillating political theater and publicity stunts , they are a poor substitute for honest investigation .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Four out of five Americans believe things are “ on the wrong track ” in the United States , the gloomiest outlook in about 20 years , according to a New York Times / CBS News poll released on Thursday .
A foreclosure sign stands in front of a home in Perris , California May 2 , 2007 .

The poll found that 81 percent of respondents felt “ things have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track . ”
That was up from 69 percent last year and 35 percent in early 2003 .
Only 4 percent of survey respondents said the country was better off than it was five years ago , while 78 percent said it was worse , the newspaper said .
The Times said Americans were more unhappy with the country ’s direction than at any time since the survey started in the early 1990s .
The economy has emerged as the biggest issue in this year ’s U.S. presidential campaign .
The country is struggling with a mortgage crisis and many economists forecast a recession this year .
Most of those surveyed said they were keeping their heads above water financially , but Americans were concerned about the country ’s financial footing .
According to The Times , only 21 percent of respondents said the overall economy was in good condition , the lowest number since late 1992 , when the recession that began in the summer of 1990 had already been over for more than a year .
In the poll , nearly two out of three people said they believed the economy was in recession .
When questioned about the mortgage crisis , Americans blamed government officials more than banks or home buyers and other borrowers for the turmoil , the newspaper said .
Forty percent of respondents said regulators were mostly to blame , while 28 percent named lenders and 14 percent named borrowers , according to the poll .
Those surveyed said individuals , not financial institutions , should get government help .
The paper said a clear majority told pollsters they did not want the government to lend a hand to banks , even if the measures would help limit the severity of a recession .
The Federal Reserve last month engineered a rescue of investment bank Bear Stearns .
Top U.S. regulators have said the collapse of Bear Stearns could have shattered confidence in financial markets and caused lasting economic damage .
The national poll , conducted March 28 through Wednesday , surveyed 1,368 adults .
The margin of error was 3 percentage points .
A state appeals court ruled on Tuesday that the Port Authority was liable for damages caused by the 1993 World Trade Center bombing , because it knew about but chose to ignore “ an extreme and potentially catastrophic vulnerability that would have been open and obvious to any terrorist who cared to investigate and exploit it . ”
The ruling unanimously upheld a jury ’s verdict that the agency was 68 percent liable for the bombing and the terrorists 32 percent liable .
Under state rules , because the Port Authority ’s liability was more than 50 percent , it can be forced to pay all the damages to injured survivors and to relatives of those killed .
In its decision , the court noted that the Port Authority , a bistate New York and New Jersey agency that owned the trade center , did not argue that the bombing was unforeseeable , only that it was unlikely , since its own consultants and an internal study group had predicted “ with exact prescience ” how an attack could be carried out .
Andrew Carboy , a lawyer for the plaintiffs , estimated on Tuesday that the Port Authority faced more than $ 100 million in damages for the 50 personal injury and dozen business - interruption cases remaining .
Apart from its fiscal effect , the unanimous , 35 - page decision signified the first time that a body of judges , versed in the nuances of the law and legal precedent as well as the evidence , had ruled on a seminal moment in New York history .
Food regulators moved to ban artificial additives from hundreds of products yesterday , three decades after parents began complaining that their children suffered mood swings after consuming brightly coloured sweets , cakes and drinks .
The Food Standards Agency recommended ministers call for manufacturers to remove six artificial colours by the end of 2009 and lobby for a European Union - wide ban .
The FSA 's advice to parents will be strengthened to warn them about the dangers of the E- numbers tartrazine ( E102 ) , quinoline yellow ( E104 ) , sunset yellow ( E110 ) , carmoisine ( E122 ) , ponceau 4R ( E124 ) and allura red ( E129 ) .
These colours and the preservative sodium benzoate ( E211 ) were linked to hyperactivity in a £ 750,000 study by Southampton University , which found they made primary school children become distracted and fail a computer attention test .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The researchers estimated that 30 per cent of cases of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) would be prevented if companies removed the colours used in the £ 13 bn - a - year global additives industry .
The decision means the country 's biggest confectioners and supermarkets , such as Cadbury and Haribo , will have to reformulate hundreds of products including ice cream , sweets , milkshakes and fizzy drinks .
Some products for which replacements have not yet been found – mushy peas , Turkish delight , and battenberg and angel cakes – may be taken off the shelves temporarily or permanently .
The Southampton researchers had warned the seven additives were as harmful as lead in petrol , which was banned after it proved to lower children 's IQ by five points .
Their research , in The Lancet in September , was the evidence that artificial additives worsened the behaviour of normal children as well as those diagnosed with ADHD .
The European Food Standards
Agency dismissed calls for action on the additives last month but at a meeting in London yesterday , the FSA 's board decided to back the most stringent of five options recommended by officials .
Dame Deirdre Hutton , who chairs the Food Standards Agency , said : " It is the agency 's duty to put consumers first .
These additives give colour to foods but nothing else .
It would therefore be sensible , in the light of the ... study , to remove them . "
The board decided to take no action on sodium benzoate because it was " a preservative " rather than a colour .
E211 , which is linked with other potential health problems , is found in many soft drinks including Diet Coke , Irn - Bru , Lucozade and Fanta , and its removal would pose a significant technological and financial challenge to drinks companies .
The FSA stressed that its decision " does not mean there is an immediate ban " .
Campaigners welcomed the first decisive move in the UK against additives , whose effect on hyperactive children were first identified in 1975 .
Richard Watts , of the Children 's Food Campaign , said : " This decision is good news for children and parents , who have known for many years that these additives affect children 's behaviour . "
Anna Glayzer , an Action on Additives campaigner , said the FSA had put the consumer first .
" We will be keeping a close eye on the industry to see what effect the voluntary ban has . "
The Food and Drink Federation said the recommendation was " bizarre " , as manufacturers were already removing the additives .
" [ Most ] products do n't contain these colours , " a statement said .

Hillary Clinton was on Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer today , and she is starting to sound an awful lot like a team player .
Check out her response to a viewer question about why so many of her supporters say they would vote for McCain over Obama if she is n’t the nominee .
“ Right that both his supporters and my supporters might stay home or not vote for the other , and I just have to say , as strongly as I can , that that would be a terrible mistake .
Anybody who has ever voted for me or voted for Barack has much more in common , in terms of what we want to see happen in our country and in the world , with the other than they do with John McCain , ” Clinton said .
She could have stopped there , but she also pledged to “ work her heart out ” for the Democratic nominee , “ So I ’m going to work my heart out for whoever our nominee is .
Obviously , I ’m still hoping to be that nominee .
But I ’m going to do everything I can to make sure that anyone who supported me , the 17 million people who have voted for me , understand what a grave error it would be not to vote for Senator McCain — Senator Obama , and against Senator McCain . ”

Since there are still votes left to be cast , she is going to hold on to the pretext that she still has a chance , but if you look at what she said , Hillary is signaling that she is going to be a team player this fall , and that she would like her supporters to do the same .
I think all the worry and consternation from the Obama supporters that Clinton would somehow try to sink Obama ’s chances against McCain has been largely unfounded .
Since Indiana and North Carolina , Clinton has stopped attacking Obama , and has changed the tone of her campaign .
Clinton is the key to unifying the Party .
If she works hard and campaigns with her supporters for Obama , I do n’t see how he can lose .
Of course , in some ways it is too soon to talk about this because there are still hurt feelings on both sides , but Clinton seems to be slowly trying to ease her supporters into the Obama camp .
If she is successful , she will have taken a big step towards relieving the ill will that has been built up towards her among many Democrats .

E’ da un pò che ne voglio parlare ma poi , un pò per pudore , un pò per evitare che nel sito arrivino i soliti maniaci glisso e evito !
Anche se ad essere sinceri , qualche accenno tra le nostre pagine c’è stato qui , qui e qui !
Ma oggi leggo un articolo su R2 di Repubblica ( 08/04/2008 pg 36 ) e mi dico “ se ne parlano LORO ! ” .
Insomma i sex toys hanno ormai superato anche in Italia la collocazione tipica nel sexy shop , chiusi in negozi squallidi per soli uomini !
Ora li si trova in farmacia , nei centri estetici , nei grandi magazzini e in sexy shop per sole donne , nei distributori automatici delle toilette femminili .
Il mio amico “ Igno ” vendeva vibratori , ops massaggiatori , per signora che sembravano piccoli oggetti di design da quanto erano belli , nessuna forma similfallica , ma un magico mondo vibrante che niente aveva a che vedere con i cosoni puzzolenti di plastica in vendita nei negozi “ tradizionali ” .
Così tra gli oggettini da lady si trova il massaggiatore clitorideo , piccolo e vellutato , la paperella di vari colori e misure che galleggia nella vasca da bagno e vibra .
Qualche tempo fa mi capitò di sentire diverse interviste a una sessuologa spagnola che in un programma tv del suo paese parla di sesso e tutti gli annessi e connessi con disinvoltura e senza falsi pudori .
La disinibita spagnolita si trovava in Italia per l’inuagurazione di un Sexy Shop solo per donne a Roma .
A Milano si trovano reparti ad Hoc per signore e , eventualmente , i loro partner , alla Rinascente , al Coin e da tempi insospettabili in Corso Como 10 .
Ora come in Sex and the city , ci aspettiamo di vedere l’apertura di boutiques a tema come la londinese Sh !
Ma chi sono le donne che acquistano questi giocattoli ?
Secondo uno studio della Bocconi su un campione di 100 donne tra i 16 e i 45 anni 3 donne su 4 hanno dichiarato di fare uso di sex toys , il 13 % ne farebbe un uso QUOTIDIANO uhuh ?? ,
Me possino !!
Ma che vivo io nel paese dei balocchi , sono una marziana appena atterrata sulla terra ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The number of U.S. workers applying for unemployment benefits soared by 38,000 last week , posting the highest reading since September 2005 and reinforcing fears that the U.S. economy has stalled , government data on Thursday showed .
A Labor Department official said there were no special factors to explain the increase in initial claims to 407,000 in the week ended March 29 , but he said seasonal adjustments to the data owing to the early timing of the Easter public holiday this year may have influenced the reading .
“ Part of what is going on is seasonal adjustments and part of it is higher claims , ” said the Labor official .
U.S. government Treasury notes extended gains on the news , with investors betting this will encourage the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further , while the dollar edged back from earlier highs and stock futures dropped .
“ The trend is for rising unemployment .
There ’s no doubt about it , ” said Joe Saluzzi , co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham , New Jersey .
“ I ’ve been bearish for a long time and I do n’t think we have found a bottom . ”
Economists polled by Reuters had expected initial jobless claims to increase to 370,000 in the week ending March 29 , compared with 369,000 the prior week , initially estimated at 366,000 claims .
The four - week moving average of new claims , a more reliable guide to underlying labor market trends because it smoothes out weekly data swings , also increased sharply .
It rose to 374,500 , which was the highest reading since October 2005 .
Analysts fear a housing slump and credit crunch may have tipped the U.S. economy into recession and are scrutinizing the labor market for evidence of slackening jobs that could chill consumer spending .

In further evidence of soft labor conditions .
the number of workers remaining on jobless benefits climbed 97,000 to 2.94 million in the week ending March 22 , the most recent week these figures were available .
This compared with forecasts for 2.87 million so - called continued claims .
It was the highest reading for continued claims since July 2004 .
The weekly jobs data was released on the eve of the monthly payrolls report on Friday , but was collected in a week that falls after the survey period for the monthly update .
Analysts are expecting the U.S. economy shed 60,000 jobs in March after losing 63,000 the month before .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned on Wednesday that unemployment would push up as the U.S. economy slowed in the first half of the year .
The Fed has slashed interest rates 3 percentage points since mid-September to shield the economy from the housing slump and investors think it will cut again at its next scheduled policy meeting , at the end of this month .
SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Gold extended gains on Thursday , moving closer to its recent record , as speculative buying accelerated after the U.S. dollar sank against other currencies and oil hit an all - time high above $ 110 a barrel .

Gold rose to $ 984.20/985.00 an ounce from $ 981.90/982.70 late in New York , partly driven by early buying from Japanese speculators .
Gold was within sight of a record high of $ 991.90 hit on March 6 .
“ I would expect the market to keep an eye on the weak dollar and high oil prices .
That gives the real support for gold , ” said Louis Lok , a dealer at Bank of China in Hong Kong , referring to a rebound from recent lows around $ 964 an ounce .
“ I ’d expect to see the support level at $ 975 .
We will test again the high level of $ 994 or $ 995 . ”
Gold has gone up as much as 19 percent in 2008 , on top of a 32 percent rise last year , on fears of the inflationary impact of rising energy costs and expectations of further interest rates cuts in the United States , which elevate the metal ’s appeal as an alternative investment .
Dealers pegged gold ’s upside target at $ 1,000 an ounce but a lack of buying from jewellers could cap gains .
Resistance was at $ 995 an ounce .
Other precious metals firmed but held below their recent highs .
The dollar fell as far as 100.95 yen on trading platform EBS , the lowest since December 1995 .
It dropped to a record low against a trade - weighted basket of currencies , taking its losses so far this year to nearly 6 percent .
Crude oil held near a record on Thursday as the dollar ’s weakness outweighed increases in U.S. crude inventories .
Spot platinum was unchanged from late in New York at $ 2,060 /2,070 an ounce .
The benchmark platinum futures contract for February delivery on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange ended the morning session 81 yen per gram higher at 6,572 yen , aided by a surging yen .
In industry news , No. 2 gold producer Newmont Mining Corp said global gold mine output will decline over the next decade or so because of production constraints and past underinvestment in finding new resources .
Silver edged up to $ 20.19/20.24 an ounce from $ 20.04/20.09 an ounce .
Spot palladium rose to $ 499/504 an ounce from $ 496/501 an ounce .
DIGG THIS
It is impossible to keep up with all the Bush regime ’s lies .
There are simply too many .
Among the recent crop , one of the biggest is that the " surge " is working .
Launched last year , the " surge " was the extra 20,000 — 30,000 US troops sent to Iraq .
These few extra troops , Americans were told , would finally supply the necessary forces to pacify Iraq .
This claim never made any sense .
The extra troops did n’t raise the total number of US soldiers to more than one - third the number every expert has said is necessary in order to successfully occupy Iraq .
The real purpose of the " surge " was to hide another deception .
The Bush regime is paying Sunni insurgents $ 800,000 a day not to attack US forces .
That ’s right , 80,000 members of an " Awakening group , " the " Sons of Iraq , " a newly formed " US - allied security force " consisting of Sunni insurgents , are being paid $ 10 a day each not to attack US troops .
Allegedly , the Sons of Iraq are now at work fighting al Qaeda .
This is a much cheaper way to fight a war .
We can only wonder why Bush did n’t figure it out sooner .
The " surge " was also timed to take account of the near completion of neighborhood cleansing .
Most of the violence in Iraq during the past five years has resulted from Sunnis and Shi’ites driving each other out of mixed neighborhoods .
Had the two groups been capable of uniting against the US troops , the US would have been driven out of Iraq long ago .
Instead , the Iraqis slaughtered each other and fought the Americans in their spare time .
In other words , the " surge " has had nothing to do with any decline in violence .
With the Sunni insurgents now on Uncle Sam ’s payroll , with neighborhoods segregated , and with al Sadr ’s militia standing down , it is unclear who is still responsible for ongoing violence other than US troops themselves .
Somebody must still be fighting , however , because the US is still conducting air strikes and is still unable to tell friend from foe .
On February 16 , the Los Angeles Times reported that a US air strike managed to kill 9 Iraqi civilians and 3 Sons of Iraq .
The Sunnis are abandoning their posts in protest , demanding an end to " errant " US air strikes .
Obviously , the Sunnis see an opportunity to increase their daily pay for not attacking Americans .
Soon they will have consultants advising them how much they can demand in bribes before it pays the Americans to begin fighting the war under the old terms .
If Sunnis are smart , they will split the gains .
Currently , the Sunnis are getting shafted .
They are only collecting $ 800,000 of the $ 275,000,000 it costs the US to fight the war for one day .
That ’s only about three - tenths of one percent , too much of a one - sided deal for the Americans .
If the Sunnis negotiate their cut to between one - quarter and one - half of the daily cost to the US of the war , the Sunnis wo n’t need to share in the oil revenues , thus helping the three factions to get back together as a country .
Even 10 % of the daily cost of the war would be a good deal for the Sunnis .
A long - term contract in this range would be expensive for Uncle Sam , but a great deal cheaper than John McCain ’s commitment to a 100 - year Iraqi war .
If Bush ’s war turns out to be as big a boon for the Sunnis as it has for Tony Blair , we might have a modern - day version of The Mouse That Roared — a movie about an impoverished country that attacked the US in order to be defeated and receive foreign aid — only this time the money comes as a payoff for not fighting the occupiers .
As the world now knows , Blair ’s " dodgy dossier " about the threat allegedly posed by Iraq was a contrivance that allowed Blair to put British troops at the service of Bush ’s aggression in the Middle East .
Now that Blair is out of his prime minister job , he has been rewarded with millions of dollars in sinecures from financial firms such as JP Morgan and millions more in speaking engagements .
As part of the payoff , the Bush Republicans have even put Mrs. Blair on the lucrative lecture circuit .
Ask yourself , do you really think Blair knows enough high finance to be of any value as an advisor to JP Morgan , or enough about climate change to advise Zurich Financial on the subject ?
Do you really believe that after hearing all the vacuous speeches Blair has delivered in those many years in office anyone now wants to pay him huge fees to hear him give a speech ?
Even when it was free , people were sick of it .
Blair is simply collecting his payoff for selling out his country and sending British troops to die for American hegemony .
The Sunnis seem inclined to do the same thing if Bush will pay them enough .
Is the next phase of the Iraq war going to be a US - Sunni alliance against the Shi’ites ?
The Best of Paul Craig Roberts
By Leo Babauta
I ’m the first to admit that for many years , I was a bit emotionally needy .
Not in a crazy , desperate way , but in the way that many of us are .
I wanted someone else to make me happy , blamed others for my unhappiness , sought to fulfill my emotional needs through others .
This caused all kinds of problems I did n’t even realize were there : I ’d have relationship problems because if the other person was n’t meeting my needs , I ’d resent it .
I ’d be unhappy lots of the time , because I thought happiness was outside of me , and therefore it was unreliable and elusive .
I was helpless , because if other people are supposed to make me happy and fulfill my needs , then what could I do if they did n’t ?
What could I do if they hurt me instead ?
Only in the last few years have I been becoming more emotionally self - reliant .
It ’s made my relationships better , and has greatly increased my happiness .
I can’t claim to be an expert on this topic , but I can share some things I ’ve been learning .
It ’s a very , very useful process , as those who are already emotionally independent can attest to .
Test Yourself
Are you emotionally dependent ?
Ask yourself these questions :
Are you looking for a romantic partner to make you happy ?
If you have a partner , do you look to this person for love , for sex , for support , for reassurance , for validation ?
Are you upset if your partner does n’t react in a certain way , does n’t meet a need ?
When you ’re alone , do you feel the need to fill the loneliness void with distraction ?
Are you always on your phone when you ’re alone ?
Do you complain a lot about other people ?
Get mad because of things they do ?
Is your relationship the center of your universe ?
What about your relationship with friends or your kids ?
Do you get bothered if your partner does something that does n’t include you , or cuts out something that you ’ve been doing together ?
Do you get jealous ?
This list is n’t comprehensive , of course , but some of you can probably see yourselves in a couple of those questions ( or more ) , if you ’re completely honest .
And that does n’t mean you ’re a bad person .
I still have some of these issues myself , though I ’m getting better at them .
Most people have a few of these issues , though many would n’t admit it , because they worry it would make them look bad .
No one likes to look bad , or to think of themselves as bad .
But having any of these issues does n’t make you bad — it ’s just who you are right now .
However , while this is n’t an issue of being a “ bad person ” , I think the skills of emotional self - reliance are useful ones to learn .
They can transform your relationships and happiness .
How We Got This Way
Usually this way of thinking starts in childhood .
We rely on our parents for our emotional needs — love , comfort , support , validation , etc .
And we do n’t often develop emotional self - reliance skills as kids , because parents ( out of love for us ) do their best to provide for all these needs .
And then we become adults , without having learned emotional self - reliance .
And so we look for someone else to fill our emotional needs .
We look for the perfect partner , and will probably go through a few breakups , because 1 ) we ’re not emotionally independent , and so we do needy things that hurt a relationship , and 2 ) our partner is probably the same way .
If we ’re ever hurt , we blame the other person for hurting us .
If they are n’t there for us , we blame them .
If something bad happens to us , we become victims , because you ca n’t move on with your life if someone has done something bad to you , right ?
However , there is a solution .
We have to learn this : Happiness is not outside ourselves .
Becoming Emotionally Self - Reliant
We look for happiness from others , but this is an unreliable source of happiness .
Other people will come and go , or they ’ll be emotionally unavailable for their own personal reasons .
And here ’s the thing : it ’s not their job to fill our emotional needs .
They are struggling trying to meet their own needs .
So instead of looking for happiness from someone else , we have to realize it ’s not out there .
It ’s within us .
Happiness is n’t in the future , it ’s not somewhere else .
It ’s available right inside us , right now , all the time .
How can we find this happiness ?
It takes some inner searching , but consider these suggestions :
Sit by yourself , without a device or distraction , for a few minutes .
Look inside .
Notice your thoughts as they come up .
Get to know your mind .
See how fascinating it is .
This in itself is an endless source of entertainment and learning .
One of my sources of happiness is creating , coming up with ideas , producing something .
I do n’t need anyone to do those things , and they give me wonder at my own abilities .
I also love learning .
It gives me happiness , helps me grow .
Curiosity is a boundless source of happiness for me .
Learn to fix your own problems .
If you are bored , fix it .
If you are lonely or hurt , comfort yourself .
If you are jealous , do n’t hope that someone will reassure you … reassure yourself .
Take responsibility .
If you find yourself blaming others , tell yourself that the other person is never the problem .
Of course , you can believe the other person is the problem , but then you are reliant on them for the solution .
If you believe that they are n’t the problem , then you look inside yourself for the solution .
If you find yourself complaining , instead find a way to be grateful .
If you find yourself being needy , instead find a way to give .
If you find yourself wanting someone to help you , help yourself .
Create your own source of built - in happiness .
Walk around as a whole , happy person , needing nothing .
Then come from this place of wholeness , of self - reliance and independence , and love others .
Not because you want them to love you back , not because you want to be needed , but because loving them is an amazing thing to do .
In the coming hours – or days or weeks ?
– the Democratic Party ’s superdelegates will receive a flood of information about The State of The Presidential Race .
Today ’s first memorandum comes from David Plouffe , campaign manager for Senator Barack Obama .
In the overnight dispatch , Mr. Plouffe lays out the argument – rooted in math and politics – for how he believes the door is closing on Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s chance to capture the Democratic nomination .
In the six remaining contests , Mr. Obama needs 172 delegates to become the party ’s nominee – 36 percent of the total remaining delegates .
By his count , Mrs. Clinton needs 326 delegates to become the nominee – 68 percent of the remaining delegates .
“ With the Clinton path to the nomination getting even narrower , we expect new and wildly creative scenarios to emerge in the coming days , ” Mr. Plouffe writes .
“ While those scenarios may be entertaining , they are not legitimate and will not be considered legitimate by this campaign or its millions of supporters , volunteers , and donors . ”
As of now , Mr. Obama plans to spend the day in Chicago with his family , before traveling to Washington tonight .
On tap ?
Meetings with superdelegates and party leaders .
This is the argument that Mr. Obama – and his army of supporters – will lay out :
TO : Superdelegates
FROM : David Plouffe , Campaign Manager
RE : An Update on the Race for Delegates
DA : May 7 , 2008
There are only six contests remaining in the Democratic primary calendar and only 217 pledged delegates left to be awarded .
Only 7 percent of the pledged delegates remain on the table .
There are 260 remaining undeclared superdelegates , for a total of 477 delegates left to be awarded .
With North Carolina and Indiana complete , Barack Obama only needs 172 total delegates to capture the Democratic nomination .
This is only 36 percent of the total remaining delegates .
Conversely , Senator Clinton needs 326 delegates to reach the Democratic nomination , which represents a startling 68 percent of the remaining delegates .
With the Clinton path to the nomination getting even narrower , we expect new and wildly creative scenarios to emerge in the coming days .
While those scenarios may be entertaining , they are not legitimate and will not be considered legitimate by this campaign or its millions of supporters , volunteers , and donors .
We believe it is exceedingly unlikely Senator Clinton will overtake our lead in the popular vote and in fact lost ground on that measure last night .
However , the popular vote is a deeply flawed and illegitimate metric for deciding the nominee – since each campaign based their strategy on the acquisition of delegates .
More importantly , the rules of the nomination are predicated on delegates , not popular vote .
Just as the Presidential election in November will be decided by the electoral college , not popular vote , the Democratic nomination is decided by delegates .
If we believed the popular vote was somehow the key measurement , we would have campaigned much more intensively in our home state of Illinois and in all the other populous states , in the pursuit of larger raw vote totals .
But it is not the key measurement .
We played by the rules , set by you , the D.N.C. members , and campaigned as hard as we could , in as many places as we could , to acquire delegates .
Essentially , the popular vote is not much better as a metric than basing the nominee on which candidate raised more money , has more volunteers , contacted more voters , or is taller .
The Clinton campaign was very clear about their own strategy until the numbers become too ominous for them .
They were like a broken record , repeating ad nauseum that this nomination race is about delegates .
Now , the word delegate has disappeared from their vocabulary , in an attempt to change the rules and create an alternative reality .
We want to be clear – we believe that the winner of a majority of pledged delegates will and should be the nominee of our party .
And we estimate that after the Oregon and Kentucky primaries on May 20 , we will have won a majority of the overall pledged delegates According to a recent news report , by even their most optimistic estimates the Clinton Campaign expects to trail by more than 100 pledged delegates and will then ask the superdelegates to overturn the will of the voters .
But of course superdelegates are free to and have been utilizing their own criteria for deciding who our nominee should be .
Many are deciding on the basis of electability , a favorite Clinton refrain .
And if you look at the numbers , during a period where the Clinton campaign has been making an increasingly strident pitch on electability , it is clear their argument is failing miserably with superdelegates .
Since February 5 , the Obama campaign has netted 107 superdelegates , and the Clinton campaign only 21 .
Since the Pennsylvania primary , much of it during the challenging Rev. Wright period , we have netted 24 and the Clinton campaign 17 .
At some point – we would argue that time is now – this ceases to be a theoretical exercise about how superdelegates view electability .
The reality of the preferences in the last several weeks offer a clear guide of how strongly superdelegates feel Senator Obama will perform in November , both in building a winning campaign for the presidency as well as providing the best electoral climate across the country for all Democratic candidates .
It is important to note that Senator Obama leads Senator Clinton in superdelegate endorsements among Governors , United States Senators and members of the House of Representatives .
These elected officials all have a keen sense for who our strongest nominee will be in November .
It is only among D.N.C. members where Senator Clinton holds a lead , which has been rapidly dwindling .
As we head into the final days of the campaign , we just wanted to be clear with you as a party leader , who will be instrumental in making the final decision of who our nominee will be , how we view the race at this point .
Senator Obama , our campaign and our supporters believe pledged delegates is the most legitimate metric for determining how this race has unfolded .
It is simply the ratification of the D.N.C. rules – your rules – which we built this campaign and our strategy around .
Shinya Yamanaka , leader of one of two research groups responsible for turning skin cells into embryonic stem cell equivalents , has duplicated his breakthrough without using a gene that made the new cells cancerous .
The results , published today in Nature Biotechnology , could answer some of the fine - print questions that dogged the original research , hailed last week as a potential peacemaker in the intractable ethical battle over embryonic stem cell research .
Embryonic stem cells , or ESCs , can grow into any other type of cell .
Someday they may be used to regrow organs and treat now - incurable diseases .
However , producing individually - matched ESCs involves a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer , in which a cell 's nucleus is placed inside an empty human egg .
After the egg grows for a week , embryonic stem cells form .
Harvesting these destroys the embryo – and that outrages people who consider embryos to be fully human .
As a result , ESC research sits in the middle of a bitter , seemingly unresolvable culture war fight .
Less controversial than the embryo - destroying ethical problems , but perhaps just as significant , risky hormone treatments are used to acquire the eggs used in cloning .
A limited egg supply also means that only a few people would have access to anticipated ESC therapies .
By inserting four growth - stimulating genes , researchers led by Kyoto
University 's Yamanaka and a University of Wisconsin team led by Junying
Yu coaxed skin cells into an essentially embryonic stage .
When injected into mice , the cells formed brain , muscle , bone and heart tissue .
Robert Lanza , chief science officer of biotech company Advanced Cell
Technologies , described this as the " Holy Grail " of stem cell research , a feat akin to " turning lead into gold " – useful , personalized , ethically trouble - free stem cells .
But there was a catch : the procedure was n't yet ready for medical applications .
After turning into assorted human tissues , the new cells had a nasty tendency to go cancerous .
In today 's Nature Biotechnology paper , Yamanaka reports that by scrapping one of the four genes – * c - Myc *– he was still able to produce de-differentiated stem cells , but without causing cancer .
Of 36
mice injected with cells created through the four - gene process , six died from tumors after 100 days ; of 36 mice injected with cells created through the minus - c - Myc process , not a single one died .
These findings come with multiple caveats .
Whether the new cells will be similarly cancer - free in people is n't known , 100 days is a relatively short period of time , and making the cells safe will almost certainly require more than a single tweak .
Junying
Yu's team did n't use c -Myc to begin with , but did use the other three genes used by Yamanaka – and her cells still became cancerous .
When I called Yu to ask about the C- myc findings , she reiterated what she said last week : she wants to find some way of inducing the cellular activity prompted by the genes , but without adding any genes at all .
Caveats aside , though , Yamanaka 's findings are still exciting : they could very well prove to be an important step on the path to safe de-differentiated stem cells .
They could guide other research , perhaps even Yu's .
And for such a significant observation to emerge so soon after the original de-differentiation studies hints at how rapidly this potentially world - altering research is advancing .

In JavaScript , there are basically two kinds of object iteration :
All objects support property enumeration : for ( var propName in someObject ) { var value = someObject [ propName ] ; }
Some objects support the " Array protocol " : for ( var i=0 ; i< someObject.length ; i++) { var value = someObject [ i ] ; }
These both suck .
Property enumeration is only really useful for debugging , since chances are the objects will have a lot of properties that you do not want them to have , and there is no standard way to have properties that are hidden from enumeration .
Array protocol enumeration sucks because :
Writing for loops is so " C "
Not every object that supports the " array protocol " is actually an array , so the " higher order " methods to manipulate the array such as Array .
prototype.slice are n't going to be available everywhere .
DOM NodeList objects and the special arguments array are particularly common examples of these array - like objects .
Fortunately , this does n't stop you from writing your own iteration protocol .
Here is an example of a JavaScript iterator in the style of Python 's PEP 234 - Iterators :
StopIteration = function ( ) {} ; StopIteration.prototype = new Error ( ) ; StopIteration.name = ' StopIteration ' ; StopIteration .
message = ' StopIteration ' ; arrayLikeIterator = function ( arrayLike ) { var i = 0 ; return { ' next ' : function ( ) { if ( i >= arrayLike.length ) { throw StopIteration ; } return array Like [ i++ ] ; } } ; } ; var countToFive = arrayIterator ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] ) ; try { while ( true ) { var item = countToFive.next ( ) ; // do something with item here } } catch ( e ) { if ( e != StopIteration ) { throw e ; } // pass }
As you can see , it 's not pleasant to work directly in this style .
We 've actually made things worse , but we 've gained two important things in the process :
The concept of an iterator separate from the object being iterated This separation is very important .
When you have iterators that are separate from the object being iterated , you can do crazy things like iterate in reverse without creating a new array , define an iteration over objects that are n't normally iterable ( particularly important since JavaScript does n't have operator overloading ) , or define an alternative kind of iteration over something ( such as walking a tree in pre-order , or iterating over every even item in an array , etc. ) .
Iterators that do n't need to know about length or index
This basically means that iterators are lazy .
You can define infinite iterators , filter chains , etc .
This can be extremely important when doing some kinds of programming in a functional style .
Unfortunately , as - is , we 've made things too hard to use liberally .
That 's when you bring in the sledgehammers , er , functions that make this less painful .
Basically , these fall into three groups :
Functions that create iterators from an iterable object ( not necessarily an iterator ) Functions that transform an iterator into some kind of primitive object Functions that transform one iterator into another iterator
The most important function in the first group ( following the Pythonisms ) is iter( iterable [ , sentinel ] ) .
iter 's job is to determine if iterable is already an iterator , or match it up with the appropriate iterator factory to make one out of it .
The optional sentinel argument is just an additional convenience ( which I carried over into MochiKit 's iterators ) .
Determining whether an iterable is already an iterator is trivial , simply check typeof ( iterable .next ) == ' function ' .
However , if it 's not , then it has to do some grunt work .
In Python style , our implementation of iter allows an object to implement an iter ( ) method ( like Python 's __iter__ ) which returns an iterable .
However , since we do n't do any built - in object prototype hacking , we 've also allowed for adapters ( using the same methodology that 's in Comparison and Adaptation in JavaScript ) to be defined .
Just like registering comparators , registering an iterable is a matter of writing a function that detects the kind of object you want to iterate ( check ) , and another function ( wrap ) that is the iterator factory for that kind of object .
Note that we recommend adapting on how objects act , not their type .
Since JavaScript 's type system is sufficiently weak , adapting based on type is a non-starter .
For example , many of the objects you may run across in JavaScript will behave similarly to an Array , but are n't quite .
The DOM's NodeList is a particularly ugly example .
It has a length property , and it supports the [ ``same syntax ] `` as Arrays do , but they are n't Arrays .
The arguments special object is similarly Array - like , but is n't a real Array .
In order to work around this , Duck Typing is usually the right answer .
Instead of checking the constructor , instanceof , etc. , you simply introspect the object to see if it looks like a duck , and quacks like one .
For example , the registration for turning array - like objects into iterables looks like this :
isArrayLike = function ( obj ) { // working around blog - bug with " and " due to ampersands return !( typeof ( obj ) != ' object ' || typeof ( obj.length ) != ' number ' ) ; } arrayLikeIterator = function ( arrayLike ) { var i = 0 ; return { ' next ' : function ( ) { if ( i >= arrayLike.length ) { throw StopIteration ; } return array Like [i++ ] ; } } ; } ; registerIteratorFactory ( // name of the adapter " arrayLike " , // check function isArrayLike , // wrap function arrayLikeIterator ) ;
With this , given a suitable definition of iter , we can write iter ( someIterable ) without having to worry so much about what someIterable is .
The second group of functions let you do the inverse : take something iterable , and make it primitive again .
There are two basic examples of this , reduce and list .
The implementations are as follows ( the documentation is better in MochiKit , I shortened it for brevity ) :
list = function ( iterable ) { /*** Create an array from an iterable .
***/ // fast - path if they passed in an Array already if ( typeof ( iterable.slice ) == ' function ' ) { return iterable.slice ( ) ; } // it 's good to do this for convenience , // it 's cheap if it 's already iterable iterable = iter( iterable ) ; var rval = [ ] ; try { while ( true ) { rval.push( iterable.next ( ) ) ; } } catch ( e ) { if ( e != StopIteration ) { throw e ; } } return rval ; } reduce = function ( func , iterable , /* optional */ initial ) { /***
Create a value from an iterable by applying a function of two arguments cumulatively to all of its elements .
***/ iterable = iter( iterable ) ; if ( arguments. length < 3 ) { try { initial = iterable .
next ( ) ; } catch ( e ) { if ( e == StopIteration ) { e = new TypeError ( " reduce ( ) of empty sequence with no initial value " ) ; } throw e ; } } try { while ( true ) { initial = func( initial , iterable.next ( ) ) ; } } catch ( e ) { if ( e != StopIteration ) { throw e ; } } return initial ; }
The last group of functions completes the toolkit by allowing you to transform an iterator into another iterator .
These functions are imap , ifilter , ifilterfalse , etc .
Effectively what these let you do is compose something a bit more declarative .
For example :
// reduce ( operator.add , sequence , 0 ) is also sum( sequence ) in MochiKit sumOfAllObjectsGreaterThanTen = reduce ( operator.add , // all objects that are greater than 10 ( 10 is less than them ) ifilter ( partial ( operator.lt , 10 ) , // skip all objects that are undefined or null ifilterfalse ( isUndefinedOrNull , allObjects ) ) , // use 0 as the initial value , i.e. ( ( ( 0 + p0 ) + p1 ) + p2 ... ) 0 ) ;
The equivalent in idiomatic JavaScript looks more like this :
var sumOfAllObjectsGreaterThanTen = 0 ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < allObjects.length ; i++) { var o = all Objects [ i ] ; // working around blog - bug with " and " due to ampersands if (!( isUndefinedOrNull ( o ) || o <= 10 ) ) { sumOfAllObjectsGreaterThanTen += o ; } }
Granted , this particular example does n't give you much .
However , if you 're familiar with the functional style of programming you can easily see where this goes .
Unfortunately , I 'm not really in the mindset to teach at the moment , so if you do n't get it yet , you 're not going to get it from me ( today ) .
Various news sources have been pouncing on AMD 's acknowledgment of potential problems when a high - end Phenom X4 processor is paired with certain 780G motherboards , but some of these articles have been focusing on the wrong part of the equation .
The reported overheating and stability issues are n't being caused by Phenom , but by motherboard manufacturers ' failure to design / certify their solutions for a Phenom processor with a 125W TDP .
This type of issue actually is n't all that rare ; a $ 49 motherboard is $ 49 for a reason .
Even if the motherboard 's chipset is technically capable of running a high - end processor , the motherboard may not be designed to handle the CPU 's power draw and thermal output .
That 's essentially what has happened here , but a combination of other factors has made the situation more important than it might otherwise be .
The errant motherboards , in this case , are n't no -name knock - offs from mainland China or seventh - tier OEMs .
These are boards from ASUS , Gigabyte , and ECS , with prices , in some cases , in the $ 90 - $ 100 range .
The 780G chipset that these boards are based on , meanwhile , is easily the strongest product in AMD 's current platform portfolio .
The HD 3000 series from ATI might be price / performance competitive with NVIDIA cards , and Phenom might be a reasonable Intel alternative , but the 780G chipset positively shines against its integrated Intel competition .
AMD technically classifies the 780G as a mainstream chipset , but for many people its low power consumption , newer southbridge , and excellent integrated graphics performance make it a more appealing than the " enthusiast " 790FX .
Motherboard manufacturers are , of course , free to design their products to support any CPU grades that they please , but ECS , Gigabyte , Asus , and Biostar have apparently made almost no effort to communicate the limitations of their respective 780G products to consumers .
I searched written ( motherboard manual ) and online ( web site ) material on a total of seven 780G motherboards made by ECS , ASUS , Biostar , Sapphire , and Gigabyte , to see what CPU specifications the board manufacturers had set .
Written Documentation : None of the seven boards I investigated listed specific processor support .
The three ASUS boards ( M3A - H , M3A78 - EMH , and M3A78 - EH ) and the Gigabyte GA - MA78 GM - S2H all claim to support both Phenom and Phenom FX processors .
The latter is interesting , considering that AMD has never released such a product , but it seems to be indicative of how motherboard manufacturers approach the issue .
Biostar , Sapphire , and ECS do n't claim to support Phenom FX , but make no mention of incompatible Phenom processors .

Online CPU support list :
Here , the available data was much better .
Of the manufacturers we checked , only Sapphire failed to provide any sort of CPU support page .
Information from the other manufacturers corroborated the 125W issue .
The ECS A780GM - A and Gigabyte GA - MA78GM - S2H both can handle up to a Phenom 9750 , while the Asus M3A78 - EMH , M3A78 - EH , and Biostar TA780G only support up to the Phenom 9600 ( and presumably 9650 ) .
Of these seven boards , only one of them — the ATX form - factor Asus M3A - H — officially supports Phenom 9850 at this time .
CPU specification information , however , is only listed on the CPU Support page .
Neither the listed board specifications at NewEgg nor the board specifications listed at the manufacturer 's page make any mention of limited CPU support or signal a problem with 125 TDP processors .
Either better documentation or better implementation would 've solved this problem before it occurred .
According to AMD , affected motherboard manufacturers may release BIOS updates to improve processor support , but some of the boards in question are literally incapable of handling a 125W processor .
For now , if you intend to build on 780G and want a Phenom X4 9850 , the ASUS M3A - H is a confirmed safe bet .
Buy anything else , and you invoke the ancient rule of caveat emptor .
Ask any blogger about Stumbleupon 's ability to generate traffic , and many people will tell you some almost unreal stories .
Ladies and Gentleman , I 'd like to give StumbleUpon the middle finger .
Sure , many of you will say , " well Troy , you 're posts just do n't appeal to stumblers , so it does n't generate stumbles . "
Well that 's all fine and well if I did n't get consistently over 20 thumbs up per page .
Do n't get me wrong , I love stumbleupon for browsing the web , I have almost 5000 thumbs under my belt , and who knows how many pages I 've browsed without giving a thumbs up .
But it just doesnt seem to work well for me as a blogger .
My most recent post , " Phoenix : We 're over the top " , at last count , had 25 people who gave it a thumbs up on stumbleupon .
You would think this would generate some traffic , well everyone , I give you my Analytics stats for that page for today :
stumbleupon.com 14 13 00:00:04
That 's right everyone , that page received 14 page views from stumblers today .
I 'm going to have this page submitted to SU , and I know it 's against Stumbleupon success rule # 1 to bash stumbleupon on stumbleupon , but I 'm willing to bet Digg will generate more traffic than Stumbleupon .
So if you honestly believe that SU can generate the kind of traffic people say it does , go ahead and give some of my pages thumbs up .
Maybe it 's because my stumblers are weak , it 's possible .
Next person to tell me they love stumbleupon because it generated over 1000 uniques to their blog in 1 day gets punched in the fleshy part of the throat .
Do n't tempt me , I 'll do it .
So let 's see , I will track the success of my blog with SU vs Digg vs Entrecard and we 'll see who comes out on top .
I 'm going to start experimenting with reddit , so who knows , reddit might own all ...
Then came the biggest twist of all .
“ A Nation at Risk ” resonated with Americans , who seemingly agreed that there was indeed something “ seriously remiss ” in their schools .
White House pollsters picked this up .
The president began visiting schools all over the country , usually in the company of Secretary Bell , who until then , as head of a department scheduled for elimination , had never seen the inside of Air Force One .

The most important legacy of “ A Nation at Risk ” was to put the quality of education on the national political agenda  where it has remained ever since .
The last 25 years have seen a succession of projects and movements aimed at increasing the quality of American primary and secondary schools : standards - based reform , the 1989 “ education summit ” that set six “ national goals ” for education , the push for school choice and , most recently , the No Child Left Behind legislation .
Proponents of each have taken pains to portray themselves as the heirs of “ A Nation at Risk . ”
The apocalyptic rhetoric of the opening section of “ A Nation at Risk ” is n’t the only element of the report that has had a lasting impact .
One of the main ideas enshrined in the document  that quality of schooling is directly linked to economic competitiveness  has also shaped the way Americans think about education .
This particular theory , however , has n’t been borne out by history .
In 1983 , the causal connection between education and the economy seemed obvious .
Americans were living in awe of the Japanese “ economic miracle ” and assumed that it was made possible by a school system whose students consistently routed ours on all those comparative international achievement tests .
But then the Japanese economy soured  even though it still had the same education system  and we began asking ourselves another question :
If American schools are so bad , why is our economy doing so well ?
With the wisdom of hindsight , it is clear that the link between educational excellence and economic security is not as simple as “ A Nation at Risk ” made it seem .
By the mid-1980s , policymakers in Japan , South Korea and Singapore were already beginning to complain that their educational systems focused too much on rote learning and memorization .
They continue to envy American schools because they teach creativity and the problem - solving skills critical to prospering in the global economy .
Indeed , a consensus seems to be emerging among educational experts around the world that American schools operate within the context of an enabling environment  an open economy , strong legal and banking systems , an entrepreneurial culture  conducive to economic progress .
To put it bluntly , American students may not know as much as their counterparts around the Pacific Rim , but our society allows them to make better use of what they do know .
The question now is whether this historic advantage will suffice at a time when knowledge of math , science and technology is becoming increasingly critical .
Maybe we need both the enabling environment and more rigor in these areas .
A New Way to Control Weight ?
Scientists say just standing up may be more important than exercise .
Nov. 28 , 2007  --
Scientists have found intriguing evidence that one major reason so many people are overweight these days may be as close as the seat of their pants .
Literally .
According to the researchers , most of us sit too much .
In most cases , exercise alone , according to a team of scientists at the University of Missouri , is n't enough to take off those added pounds .
The problem , they say , is that all the stuff we 've heard the last few years about weight control left one key factor out of the equation .
When we sit , the researchers found , the enzymes that are responsible for burning fat just shut down .
This goes way beyond the common sense assumption that people who sit too much are less active and thus less able to keep their weight under control .
It turns out that sitting for hours at a time , as so many of us do in these days of ubiquitous computers and electronic games and 24 - hour television , attacks the body in ways that have not been well understood .
The Need to Putter
" It was hard to believe at first , " said Marc Hamilton , associate professor of biomedical sciences at the University of Missouri - Columbia and leader of the research team .
He said the team did n't expect to find a strong signal when they began researching what happens to fat when we remain seated .
But the effect , both in laboratory animals and humans , turned out to be huge .
The solution , Hamilton said , is to stand up and " putter . "
The research was published this month in the peer - reviewed journal Diabetes , and it will be presented by Hamilton 's post - doctoral researcher , Theodore Zderic , at the upcoming Second International Congress on Physical Activity and Public Health in Amsterdam .
Hamilton is not suggesting that anyone quit exercising .
But he says his work shows that exercise alone wo n't get the job done .
We have to pay more attention to what 's happening when we are n't in the gym , because the body 's ability to dispose of fat virtually shuts down , he says , at least if we 're sitting down .
Hamilton recruited a few laboratory rats and pigs , as well as about a dozen human volunteers , including himself , to learn more about the physiological effect of sitting .
The lab animals laid the foundation for the research in two different experiments .
The animals were injected with a small amount of fat that contained a radioactive tracer so the researchers could determine what happened to the fat .
" What 's the fate of that fat ? " Hamilton asked during a telephone interview .
" Is it burned up by the muscle ? "
The radioactive tracer revealed that when the animals were sitting down , the fat did not remain in the blood vessels that pass through the muscles , where it could be burned .
Instead , it was captured by the adipose tissue , a type of connective tissue where globules of fat are stored .
That tissue is found around organs such as the kidneys , so it 's not really where you want to see the fat end up .
The researchers also took a close look at a fat - splitting enzyme , called lipase , that is critical to the body 's ability to break down fat .
After the animals remained seated for several hours , " the enzyme was suppressed down to 10 percent of normal , " Hamilton said .
" It 's just virtually shut off . "
The results from the animal studies were very convincing , he said , and human experiments were just as compelling .
The researchers injected a small needle into the muscles of the human volunteers and extracted a small sample for biopsy .
Once again , the enzyme was suppressed while the humans remained seated .
That resulted in retention of fat , and it also resulted in lower HDL , the " good cholesterol , " and an overall reduction in the metabolic rate .
You Need to Move Those Legs
The implications , Hamilton said , are clear .
While much thought has been given to the good effects of regular exercise , scientists have not paid enough attention to what happens during the rest of the time when we may be fairly active but are probably sitting too much .
That could help explain the rising tide of obesity , because people tend to sit more these days than they did a half century ago .
Not to mention eating too much and getting precious little exercise .
Some might argue that playing video games , or even working at the computer , involves movement of the upper body , especially the hands and arms , so that 's not really inactive .
But Hamilton counters that arms do n't weigh very much , and the big muscles in the human body which are so critical to burning fat are located in our legs and back .
" When we think about the postural muscles that are mostly in the legs and back , these are big , powerful muscles , " he said .
" We 're talking probably 20 pounds of muscle in each leg .
That 's a lot of muscle that can be engaged in routine activities , " including burning fat .
But they can't do that without the enzyme that is suppressed while seated .
Much is still not known , including such fundamental issues as how long the effect lasts from getting up and moving around for a while , but Hamilton expects the answers to come fairly soon .
" There is going to be a flood of research on this in the next couple of years , and not just by us , " he said .
" This has raised the attention of a lot of great scientists around the world who have begun doing their own studies . "
In the meantime , he suggests , we do the obvious .
Take the time to get up and " putter " for a while .
If his research turns out to be on the mark , it could save your life .

Watching the TV this week I wept as pictures were broadcast from an isolated part of Texas .
I saw 416 children - from infants to teenagers - and 133 women being taken into protective police custody .
They were driven away from a place they called " home " - a 1,700 - acre desert compound run by the polygamist sect once controlled by their " prophet " , Warren Jeffs .

Carolyn Jessop was hunted down like ' prey ' after she escaped with her eight children
The reason I was crying was simple - those images of women wearing ankle - length dresses and holding the hands of bright - eyed children brought back terrible memories .
For I was once one of them .
Many of those teenage girls were pregnant and some already had babies .
Few of the 416 youngsters brought out of the sect in the Texas desert knew their full names , birthday or even their own mothers .
Some had been beaten so badly they had suffered broken bones .
Girls , some as young as 12 and 13 , had been expected to have sex with much older men .
But as the freed youngsters played with donated toys , social workers claimed the shadow of fear was finally lifting for the children .

Rescued : Female members of sect are escorted onto a school bus in Eldorado , Texas
Relieved : A group of women church members tearfully embrace after being reunited at Fort Concho , Texas
No one knows better than I do what the horrifying reality of life was like at the Yearning for Zion ranch near Eldorado , south of Dallas - I was born into the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) .
Only I was lucky enough to escape .
I came from six generations of polygamists who formed the 10,000 - strong FLDS , as we called it .
The organisation was part of the Mormon church , but broke away to defend the rights of its male members to have more than one wife - a practice the Mormons stopped at the turn of the last century .
When I was young , I remember being looked at with scorn when we went into the town in our long pastel dresses .
The residents called us " polygs " and sometimes threw rocks at us , but I did n't mind .
It proved to my young and naive mind that all the people in the outside world were evil .
At the age of 18 , in 1986 , I was made to marry a 50 - year - old stranger - a fellow member of the cult - because that was expected of every young woman in our community .
Spiritual leader : Warren Jeffs is currently in jail in Arizona
It was deemed perfectly natural : the leader , our prophet , decided whom you should marry and you were supposed to do it without hesitation .
Except I did hesitate .
When I was forced to marry , it was a turning point for me - a moment which made me question everything I had been taught .
But so strong had my indoctrination been , I still lived by the tenets of our faith , ignoring the questioning voice in my mind .
So , during the next 15 years , I bore my husband , Merril , who had six other wives , no fewer than eight children - five boys and three girls .
I had no alternative than to obey his demands - including treating him like a god .
If I refused , or failed in my tasks , I was punished .
My every move was watched , and I was never allowed my own money .
I knew I was being controlled and it frightened me .
My sister ( also a member of the FLDS ) and I used to have a grim joke : " Do n't drink the punch " - a reference to the mass suicide of 900 members of the cult The People 's Temple by drinking a poison punch under the orders of the Rev Jim Jones in Guyana in 1978 .
We were terrified it might happen to us .
Indeed , ever since Jeffs inherited the leadership of our cult from his father in 2002 , he'd been preaching that he was Jesus Christ incarnate .
He spoke about moving his followers to what he called the " Centre Place " .

Compound :
The sect built giant , elaborate temples on the West Texas ranch
My husband was close to Jeffs , who was rumoured to have 180 wives , and there was every chance that he , too - together with me and his other six wives and 54 children - would be among the first to be taken to the Centre Place , wherever it was .
Once I complained to Jeffs about my husband 's treatment .
Jeffs told me I was foolish .
I never complained again , even though I was n't allowed to kiss or cuddle my children because the cult forbade it .
I also was n't able to protect them from Jeffs , who 'd started marrying off younger girls to sect members .
My 12 - year - old daughter , Betty , was once kept a virtual prisoner in his house for three days .
I was never sure what happened to her there .
And so , in April 2003 , at the age of 35 and with just £ 10 to my name , I ran away with my eight children .
Three years later , my testimony formed a crucial part of the case that led to Jeffs being jailed for being an accomplice in the rape of a 14 - year - old girl who was forced to marry her adult cousin .
He is still awaiting trial on other child sex charges .
I was there the day Jeffs was convicted of the rape charge : September 25 , 2007 .
It was an unforgettable feeling .
I was finally free of his malign influence .
FLDS has also created many other Warren Jeffs - men intoxicated with power , determined to dominate their many wives and children .
But to explain why , and tell you what life was like under the spell of the FLDS , I really need to go back to the beginning .
You see , mine was no ordinary childhood .
My father did n't want me to attend an ordinary school and so I lived on an FLDS compound .
My father would be travelling for his business - men were allowed to move freely , while women could do so only with permission , and even then were virtual prisoners thanks to their constant pregnancies .
My mother grew depressed by her isolation - complaining that she had nothing to live for and how she 'd rather be dead .
So brainwashed was I that when I was six I told her : " Mama , I think Dad better hurry up and get a new wife . "
That 's the way I was trained to think .
Not long afterwards , Dad did find a new wife .
But even back then I began to notice strange things - such as the fact many women wore dark glasses .
It was n't long before I realised it was because they had black eyes from being beaten by their husbands .
Beating was commonplace in our house , too .
My mother beat my two sisters and I every day - everything from small swats on the behind to a lengthy belt whipping .
I never told my father about the beatings , because it was accepted in our culture .
What my mother was doing was n't considered abuse ; it was considered good parenting .
Anyway , there was no one to object to , or see what was going on .
Our community was so isolated it was rare we saw anyone from outside .
Back then , I felt the luckiest girl in the world to be one of God 's elite .
I was FLDS royalty because I had a long bloodline of polygamy .
My grandmother told me stories about how her great - grandfather was one of the first men to introduce the principle of " celestial marriage " .
She also taught me that my sole purpose on earth was to have as many children as possible and that God would reveal the name of the man he wanted me to marry by sending a revelation to our prophet .
We also grew up knowing an awful lot about the end of the world .
It had been drilled into us that we were God 's chosen people , and when the apocalypse came - as it inevitably would - we would be saved , while the wicked would be killed and the world destroyed .
There was just one caveat .
Before God slaughtered the wicked , he would allow them to try to kill us .
So the government , which was wicked , would try to kill everyone in our community , but - providing we were faithful - God would hear our prayers and protect us .
That was why we kept ourselves to ourselves so ferociously .
As a young woman growing up , I did n't question any of this - any more than I questioned why we were never taught about sex .
When we had health education at school inside the compound , all the chapters about human reproduction were cut out .
Sex was something a husband was to teach his wife .
There were some women in FLDS who married and still believed that babies came from kissing .
When I was 17 , I worked for a year as a teacher 's assistant in the compound 's school , and by the time I was 18 I had a secret dream of becoming a paediatrician .
I did n't know any other woman in the FLDS who was so ambitious , but I was determined to try , so I told my father of my desire to go to college .
He said he'd ask our prophet - who was then a man known as Uncle Roy , who controlled the church before Jeffs ' father .
Just a few days later , my father woke me up .
" I had a chance to talk to Uncle Roy , " he announced .
" He told me you could go to school to be a teacher .
But he said that before you go you should marry Merril Jessop . "
I was stunned .
My future had just vanished .
Now , even if I continued with my education , I 'd have to do so while being constantly pregnant - as was expected of married women .
My husband would also be able to overrule any decision about what I did .
I looked at my father in horror .
I hardly knew Merril .
He was 50 , and I 'd gone to school with his daughters .
Now I was going to be one of their mothers .
" How does Merril feel about this marriage ? " I asked him .
" How does he feel about marrying a child ? "
My father simply said : " Oh , he 's done it before .
I talked to him and arranged for you to marry him this Saturday . "
That was just two days away .
My father went on to tell me that this came down from the prophet of God and I should see it as a blessing .
" You should not question it , or allow the devil to interfere in your feelings . "
My parents did n't intend to let me out of their sight until the wedding .
When Merril arrived at my house that morning , he did n't even acknowledge me - but when he left , he clearly expected me to follow , and I did .
As we pulled away from our house , I felt as though I was in a horror movie that was playing out in front of me .
Except the horror was real and there was no escape .
I had no experience with men .
I had never dated a boy .
Relationships outside of marriage were taboo in our culture .
But I certainly knew I did n't want Merril to touch me .
On my wedding night I was paralysed .
I did n't want to consummate the marriage , but had no choice .
Merril took off my nightgown and shifted his body on top of me , but he could n't perform and thankfully gave up .
The next day he took me to his house and introduced me to his three other wives - he was to get two more quite soon - as well as their ten teenage daughters and four other daughters aged between nine and 12 .
But even though I had n't wanted to marry Merril , did n't love him , let alone like him , I still believed in the FLDS doctrines .
I thought my husband was the revelation the prophet had received for me .
I believed I was destined to bear his children and serve him until he died .
I also realised the only way to protect myself in my marriage was by remaining of sexual value to him .
Sex was the only currency I had to spend in my marriage - every polygamist wife knows that .
A woman who possesses a high sex status with her husband has more power over his other wives .
If she becomes unattractive to him , she is on dangerous ground - usually winding up as a slave to the dominant wife .
So although I hated Merril touching me , I knew I had to make myself attractive to him , even though there was no chemistry between us and our sex life was always perfunctory .
In fact , throughout our 17 years of marriage , he saw me naked only a few times , and the bedroom was always completely dark .
Nevertheless , I did bear him eight children - all of whom were regularly beaten by their father .
The only way I could stop Merril beating my children was to have sex with him .
But when my seventh child , Harrison , developed cancer as a baby and was whisked away to hospital , I finally realised that no one in our community cared about him .
Poor Harrison was so ill , but no one from the community came with us , no one expressed their concern .
Despite the intimate living arrangements I had with Merril 's other wives , even they stayed silent .
This was a mark of the essentially competitive relationship we all had - the internal rivalries between six wives were hugely complex .
But this whole experience was a wake - up call for me .
For 32 years I 'd been brainwashed into thinking that every person outside the FLDS was evil - but suddenly I saw the only people willing to fight for Harrison 's life , and stay at his bedside , were outsiders , the wonderful doctors and nurses who saved his life .
I secretly started to make plans to flee - from my husband , from the Fundamentalist Church of Latter Day Saints and from its leader Warren Jeffs .
To avoid suspicions , I had to keep up the pretence of marital relations , which produced my eighth child , another boy called Bryson .
Thankfully , I managed to avoid the attentions of my husband and Jeffs .
And just before 4.30 am on Monday , April 21 , 2003 , I ran away .
I packed my eight children into our van and drove away from the compound , even though my 12 - year - old Betty was screaming : " Mother , you 're stealing us .
Uncle Warren will come and get us .
We do n't belong to you , we belong to the prophet . "
After five hours on the road , we arrived in Salt Lake City and went into hiding .
Within hours , Merril was hunting me down like prey , but I did n't care .
I would rather be dead than live that way another minute .
Over the next three years I fought a long legal battle for my freedom , and the custody of my children - and I eventually won .
I still struggle with my past .
I know I was brainwashed , but I struggle to free myself from the doctrines I was taught .
If I 'd lost the custody battle , I , too , would have been one of those women ushered on to the yellow school buses in Texas this week - and that 's a fate I would never wish on anyone .
I know what they went through .
I can only hope they survive like I have .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Venezuela 's associations with terror states , Iran 's meddling in Iraq and the resurgence of al Qaeda in Afghanistan top the concerns in a new State Department report on terrorism threats in countries around the world .
A U.S. report on terrorism notes Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez 's " sympathy " for Colombian rebels .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is not cooperating with U.S. anti-terror efforts and has " deepened Venezuelan relationships with state sponsors of terrorism Iran and Cuba , " the annual report says .
The report notes Chavez 's " ideological sympathy " for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the Colombian - based National Liberation Army , which " regularly crossed into Venezuelan territory to rest and regroup . "
While the report says it " remained unclear to what extent the Venezuelan government provided support to Colombian terrorist organizations , " it notes that Venezuelan weapons stocks have turned up in the hands of Colombian terrorist organizations .
It also notes that Iran and Venezuela began weekly flights between their capitals , and the passengers were not subject to proper checks .
Among the passengers was a suspect in the plot to bomb New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport .
" Venezuelan citizenship , identity , and travel documents remained easy to obtain , making Venezuela a potentially attractive way station for terrorists , " the report says .
Bernardo Alvarez Herrera , Venezuela 's ambassador to the United States , told CNN that the criticism of Venezuela in the report is " a political decision motivated by politics . "
" The accusations are mostly motivated by political disagreements , " he said .
" The US decided for political reasons they are going to name a country , and then try and collect information to support their thesis .
It is almost ridiculous . "
Alvarez Herrera said that Venezuela has relationships with many countries in the world , and its cooperation with Iran is not different .
The recent flight from Tehran to Venezuela is a once - a - week joint venture between the Venezuelan airline and Iran Air .
He said that everyone has to follow " normal procedures at the airport , including complying with immigration law . "
" This is ridiculous that we would have a commercial plane coming from another country in a joint venture and not comply with international law , " he said .
He added that concerning the allegation of passport fraud , Venezuela has had problems in the past but has moved to biometric passports and is " moving very aggressively " to correct the problem .
Concerning Iran , the report says that once again , the nation " remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism . "
" Elements of its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were directly involved in the planning and support of terrorist acts throughout the region and continued to support a variety of groups in their use of terrorism to advance their common regional goals , " it says , citing the group 's support for Hezbollah , Hamas , Iraq - based militants , and Taliban fighters in Afghanistan .
The report says that despite promises to stabilize Iraq , Iran " continued to provide lethal support , including weapons , training , funding , and guidance , to some Iraqi militant groups that target coalition and Iraqi security forces and Iraqi civilians . "
" In this way , Iranian government forces have been responsible for attacks on coalition forces .
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - Quds Force continued to provide Iraqi militants with Iranian - produced advanced rockets , sniper rifles , automatic weapons [ and ] mortars that have killed thousands of coalition and Iraqi Forces , " it says .
The report says that Iraq " remained at the center of the war on terror , " with al Qaeda in Iraq and other insurgent groups battling coalition and Iraqi forces .
It also criticizes Syria , another U.S. - designated state sponsor of terrorism , for allowing foreign fighters into Iraq , citing U.S. government reports that found " nearly 90 percent of all foreign terrorists known to be in Iraq had used Syria as an entry point . "
" The Syrian government could do more to stop known terror networks and foreign fighter facilitators from operating within its border , " it adds .
Although it notes that no Syrian official has been implicated in bombing attacks in Lebanon , the report says that Damascus " continued to undermine Lebanon 's sovereignty and security through its proxies , " including Hezbollah .
Syria is also criticized for its weak treatment of terrorist financing and its continued support of Palestinian terror groups such as Hamas , including providing safe haven to its leader , Khalid Mishal .
It notes that " Palestinian groups with leaders in Syria have claimed responsibility for anti-Israeli terrorist attacks . "
The report notes that the Sudan , North Korea and Cuba , all designated as state sponsors of terror , had not actively supported terrorist groups inside their countries over the past year .
The report once again found al Qaeda and its affiliated networks " remained the greatest terrorist threat to the United States and its partners " last year , reconstituting some of its pre-9/11 operational capabilities in Pakistan 's tribal areas .
It also found a resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan and voiced concern about a rash of bombings by militants , including the one that killed former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto last year .
" Despite the efforts of both Afghan and Pakistani security forces , instability , coupled with the Islamabad brokered cease - fire agreement in effect for the first half of 2007 along the Pakistan - Afghanistan frontier , appeared to have provided AQ leadership greater mobility and ability to conduct training and operational planning , particularly that targeting Western Europe and the United States , " the report says .
The report again notes that al Qaeda continued to exploit local grievances for larger terrorist purposes and " seeks weapons of mass destruction in order to inflict the maximum possible damage on anyone who stands in its way , including other Muslims and / or elders , women , and children . "
Al Qaeda operatives in East Africa and al - Shabaab militants in Somalia once again posed " the most serious threat to American and allied interests in the region , " the report says .
Somalia 's weak central government and lawlessness " make Somalia a permissive operating environment and a potential safe haven for both Somali and foreign terrorists already in the region , " it found .
" Somalia remains a concern , as its unsecured borders and continued political instability provide opportunities for terrorist transit and / or organization .
AQ is likely to keep making common cause with cells of Somali extremists in an attempt to disrupt international peacemaking efforts in Somalia , " it adds .
The report also voices concern about insurgent terror tactics in Algeria over the last year and calls Yemen 's counterterrorism efforts last year " mixed " with " significant setbacks , " including releasing all returned Guantanamo detainees and instituting a surrender program for terrorists with " lenient requirements . "
It also criticizes Yemen 's weak counterterrorism laws and an " ineffective " justice system .
The report notes that human rights organizations have accused China of using counterterrorism in the run-up to the Olympics as a pretext to suppress ethnic Uighurs in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region .
Although the Chinese have claimed they are terrorists , the report found no concrete evidence of that .
It also notes a spread of radical Islam in Europe , where several " significant terrorist plots " were foiled .

All About Venezuela • Iran • Syria
Three U.S. Air Force officers have invaded the pages of the usually staid , straightforward Defense AT&L magazine ( that 's acquisition , technology and logistics ) and bestowed upon the world a story , of a kind , meant to illustrate . . . something , we 're sure .
How the Pentagon must avoid spending money and time developing expensive weapons designed to defeat yesterday 's threats , maybe .
The story ( .pdf , naturally ) stars " Krog " – that 's him in middle – as a kind of futuristic , alien program manager who can't quite figure out what his " Peregrine starship " is supposed to do .
The parallels to today 's Pentagon can not be missed .
“ Never mind , ” continued Krog .
“ The operational shortfalls are n’t the main point .
I ’m still trying to understand what threat this thing is supposed to address .
Obviously we ’re not fighting the Torrapians anymore .
Are we ? ” Krog paused ominously .
“ Well , the Minotaur - Squids of the Indigo Zone … ” the Ensign began nervously .
*“ Are a technologically backwards group of jelly - fish - based terrorists with very limited spacefaring capabilities , ” interrupted Krog .
“ They lack both the means and the inclination to conduct combat operations in space .
Their most effective planetary defense weapon flings a cloud of debris in the general direction of a spacecraft and hopes to punch a hole or two in the hull .
Please do n’t tell me we ’re building a sophisticated , agile starfighter to counter that !
If they are the target , we should be working on armor , * intel , or psyops .
“ Trust me , ” he continued with a fierce grin , showing all four rows of his razor sharp teeth , “ I believe in using overwhelming strength as much as anyone , but even I do n’t use a plasma nuke to kill a tiny , furry kucatani , no matter how sharp its claws might be .
I just bite its fuzzy little head off .
The truth is , the Peregrine is entirely unsuited for combat against the Minotaur - Squids , or anyone else in the Indigo Zone . ”
He sat back and took a deep breath , wishing he could bite something .
Or someone .
“ Well , sir , ” added an engineering officer from the jungles of Gontapen 5 , “ although there are no immediate threats that require Peregrine - class starships , we ca n’t rule them out for the future . ”
Krog raised his eyebrows .
“ I ’m sure you are not insinuating that the Technocracy and the Torrapians will resume hostilities , ” he growled , not unreasonably .
* An uncomfortable silence descended on the room . * “ Can anyone tell me why we ’re building this thing ?
It ’s designed for a threat that does n’t exist , and it is n’t very good at what it ’s supposed to do — finding and killing things in space without being found or killed itself .
On top of that , we ’re not planning to buy nearly enough of them . ”
The silence deepened .
At least two of the three authors , by the way , are bloggers .
Unsurprisingly .
The following blog post was prepared by a CMS graduate student who , appropriately enough , wishes to remain anonymous .
S/ He has been watching with some interest the emergence of the Anonymous movement , a grassroots effort to protest against the Church of Scientology organization , which has adopted a range of references and models from popular culture to further its goals .
It offers a rich reference point for those of us in better understanding the ways that participatory culture can offer a spring board for civic engagement .
It seems like an appropriate followup to the interview I ran earlier this week with Witness 's Sam Gregory in that it represents another example of how video sharing might contribute to civic discourse .
The author closes the post with a call for academic discussion of the implications of this phenomenon .
S/he and I offer this post as a resource for further study .
On March 15 , 2008 , over 9000 * people worldwide took to the streets to protest practices of the Church of Scientology organization .
Without any clear leadership , masked individuals descended upon local organizations with signs and flyers .
They stood outside , chanting phrases like " tax the cult " and " why is Lisa Dead ? "
They gave speeches , recruited new members , and granted press interviews .
Then , they sang and danced to Rick Astley 's epic 1987 hit , " Never Gonna Give You Up . "
Hi , We 're from the Internet
The protesters call themselves " Anonymous " and their movement originated on several loosely affiliated web sites .
The long - standing site Something Awful had built a community through its forums and a popular image manipulation competition called Photoshop Phriday .
Other sites spun off of or grew up in parallel with Something Awful , including the always - offensive image posting site 4 chan.org .
The most popular " board " on 4 chan was " / b/ " , which featured doctored photos , inside jokes , and porn .
Through 2007 , the community was pulling online pranks like taking down web sites and defacing Myspace pages .
Their culture grew out of the pursuit of these sophomoric " lulz " and spawned several internet memes .
Perhaps most well known is the LOLCats .
Their language became filled with sarcastically self - referential bastardizations of English .
The community began coordinating " raids " against various sites , online games , and people that they deemed idiotic ( or , in their words , had broken " teh Rules of teh Internetz " ) .
They successfully shut down a white supremacist 's page , lashed out at a site that copied one of their images , and flooded virtual games that they considered inane .
They coordinated these efforts through several sites , but most prominently through a collaboratively maintained wiki .
Plans would form as a result of many proposals , one of which would gain a critical mass of support .
There were no leaders .
At some point , the group decided to start calling itself " Anonymous , " inspired by the largely anonymous web - posting tools they used .
On July 26 , 2007 , KTTV Fox of Los Angeles did a news report on the group , calling them " hackers on steroids " and " domestic terrorists . "
The Fox report was quickly spread , parodied , and made fun of .
It also formed the foundation for the group 's ironic self - identity , and cemented the " Anonymous " moniker for months to come .
Throughout , Anonymous maintained a rough edge .
Their " raids " often seemed more like cyberstalking or bullying .
Their image boards continued to feature mostly porn , gore , and insults .
Their conversations were peppered with what sounded like hate speech -- constant references to " fags " or " niggers " .
To be sure , it was a community made up largely of young white males acting somewhat immaturely .
On the other hand , there have emerged more subtle undercurrents in their behavior .
To some extent this language is used ironically and critically .
Anons are equal opportunity offenders , and they seem to value free speech far more than they feel true hatred .
They also use this harsh language when referring to each other just as much as when discussing the targets of their attacks .
In a way , the phrases have been removed from their contextualized meanings in standard English discourse and reappropriated as part of the memetic language of the group .
On January 15 , 2008 , the online gossip site Gawker posted an internal Church of Scientology video featuring Tom Cruise riffing on the wonders of Scientology .
The church had already successfully used legal tactics to remove the video from other sites , but Gawker claimed , " it 's newsworthy ; and we will not be removing it . "
Lawyers for the church claimed copyright infringement , and Gawker claimed fair use .
At some point , some members of Anonymous became incensed at what they saw as an attempt to silence free speech and violation of internet principles .
Debate ensued , and one member stated :
" Gentlemen , this is what I have been waiting for .
Habbo , Fox , The G4 Newfag Flood crisis .
Those were all training scenarios .
This is what we have been waiting for .
This is a battle for justice .
Every time /b/ has gone to war , it has been for our own causes .
Now , gentlemen , we are going to fight for something that is right .
I say damn those of us who advise against this fight .
I say damn those of us who say this is foolish .
/b/ROTHERS , THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO RISE AS NOT ONLY HEROES OF THE INTERNETS , BUT AS ITS GUARDIANS . "
Scientology had thrown down the gauntlet , and Anonymous awoke .
In a YouTube video addressed to the church , Anonymous explained that , " for the good of your followers , for the good of mankind , and for our own enjoyment , we shall expel you from the Internet and systematically dismantle the Church of Scientology in its present form . "
Anonymous promptly took down Scientology 's web sites , endlessly faxed them black sheets of paper , and called their public phone numbers with loops of ... you guessed it ... " Never Gonna Give You Up . "
A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the LULZ
The initial objective of the campaign was a success .
By all accounts , Anonymous was frustrating the Church of Scientology and generating amusement for Anonymous .
The church replied publicly , counter - attacked Anonymous sites through legal ( and , allegedly , technical ) means , and was forced to move its servers to a more robust and costly provider .
Soon , long - time Scientology critics began to take notice .
Some of these critics had worked to expose the organization 's practices for decades , and the massive influx of energy was both exhilarating and frightening .
One critic , Mark Bunker , replied via YouTube :
" I think it 's incredibly exciting to have an army of young , passionate people wanting to do something about Scientology 's fraud and abuse .
However , I think you 're making some major mistakes that are going to hurt in the long run .
They 're going to make you look bad , they 're going to get you in trouble ... they 're going to get us in trouble , those of us who have been long - time critics of Scientology .
Scientology is good at tar - and - feathering us with other people 's actions .
It may seems like fun and games , but Scientology is serious , you have to be prepared ...
I 'm mainly concerned because you should n't be doing things that are illegal .
You just should n't .
It 's not morally right , it 's not right when Scientology does it , and it's not right when we do it ... a better way to get at them would be to try to get rid of their tax - exempt status ... now I know that does n't sound anywhere near as interesting as attacking their websites .
It sounds dull , but that 's going to hurt them .
Going out and protesting , that 's wonderful .
I do n't know if this makes any sense to you , but please please please reform your movement the way we want Scientology to reform their movement . "
Bunker later commented that " I thought they 'd lash out at me . "
Instead , they celebrated him and named him " Wise Beard Man . "
In his video , he sounds like an earnest and concerned parent .
It 's hard to imagine such an uncouth and authority - hating group taking him seriously .
But , they did .
They began to educate themselves about Scientology 's various alleged abuses , including the 1995 death of Lisa McPherson who was under the care of the church at the time she died .
When someone posted a YouTube video claiming to speak for families that had been torn apart by Scientology , one Anonymous replied :
" Fucking rise up , sons and daughters of the Internet .
Rise the fuck up and stay up .
Let 'em know we 'll take the fight to them , and that we 'll help every single person that wants to leave the cult .
We have lawyers and social workers and therapists in our ranks , and we can , and will , give aid to those who want out .
We are Anonymous .
For the lulz , but moar than that now .
For teh most epic win .
Revoke Scientology 's tax - exempt status .
Great Justice for Lisa McPherson . "
Nearly overnight , Anonymous shifted focus .
The Anons began planning for a worldwide protest , they compiled research , started a lobbying campaign , and cranked out flyers and informational pamphlets .
On February 10 , they staged their first major protest with several thousand participating .
Many Anonymous donned " guy fawkes " masks , made famous in the film " V for Vendetta " , as a symbol of their resistence to oppression and their commitment to anonymity .
There is a long history of Scientology protesters allegedly being harrassed and otherwise attacked by the church .
When anonymous translated its digital anonymity into real - world anonymity , Scientology faced something it had never before experienced .
Nevertheless , just before the second wave of protests on March 15 , the CoS began agressively pursuing members of Anonymous that it had managed to identify .
In some jurisdictions , local anti-mask laws had actually made it difficult for Anons to protest anonymously - - a sharp contrast to their accustomed protections online .
The church posted videos " outing " members and accusing them of hate crimes and terrorism ( Anonymous responded by cloning the site and replacing the videos with Rick Astley ) .
The CoS claimed to have filed criminal complaints at federal agencies , with these allegations .
It tried to get an injunction against protestors in Clearwater , and failed .
The worldwide protests grew , and Anonymous declared March 15 a success .
The protests had been timed to coincide with the birthday of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard .
Anonymous donned birthday hats , ate cake , and danced to a cheesy song with the lyrics , " When it 's time to party we will party hard . "
After the March protests , CoS sent nastygrams to some de-masked Anons via at least two law firms , which in themselves constituted no legal action .
In a couple of limited cases , CoS actually took demonstrable legal action .
It accused LA - based Sean Carasov of making death threats , and the LAPD dismissed the charges .
It also filed a complaint of Trespass and Criminal Harrassment against Boston - based " Gregg " who knocked on the door of the local CoS and attempted to give them fliers .
Gregg has yet to be heard in court , but Anonymous feels confident that the legal merit is weak and that the actions were filed solely as an attempt to intimidate .
By all measures , the intimidation is n't working .
The next protests occur on April 12th , and are focused on bringing attention to the families that have been " disconnected " by the CoS.
Anonymous plans monthly protests for the forseeable future .
An Academic Opportunity
Anonymous presents an array of opportunities for interesting scholorship .
It is a cultural community , a political movement , a legal battleground , and more .
It straddles between internet and " real world " existence .
We need to study Anonymous ... and to study hard .
Academics from cultural studies , media theory , and anthropology might seek to better understand what holds this unique community together .
How have they appropriated anime and internet culture into the core of their identity and used it to unify their movement ?
How do neighbor communities like cosplay and video gaming cross pollinate with Anonymous ?
How does Anonymous connect with the earlier Internet vs. Scientology effort ?
What do we make of their obscure and offensive language ?
Legal academics also have a great deal to consider when it comes to Anonymous .
How do our laws regarding online vs. real - world anonymity differ ?
For example , should a Kentucky bill banning anonymous online posting pass or should a New York statute banning anonymous protesting in real life be overturned ?
Is the CoS using official - looking lawyer letters to intimidate and chill free speech ?
What can be done to defend Anons who claim that they are the target of fair - gaming through the legal system ?
What about the larger questions of Scientology 's tax - exempt status and their controversial 1993 settlement with the IRS ?
Political scientists studying movements and agenda - setting might want to consider how this group organizes and affects political change .
What has made Anonymous able to grow and adapt so dynamically ?
How can such a decentralized , leaderless collective maintain potency in the long term ?
What are the means that the group is using to lobby and advocate anonymously ?
How is the movement gaining newcomers while staying on message and not becoming fragmented ?
Some academics have already begun to take notice , but their work is preliminary .
PBS 's digital news project " Idea Lab " recently posted a thought - provoking article on the Anonymous transition from the Internet to the " real world . "
Anonymous demonstrates the principles of digital learning as they translate their online skills into collective action .
They leverage viral - like promotion strategies through efforts like youfoundthecard.com .
They use language and tactics from the video game world .
They have developed a decentralized news making and gathering service in support of their cause .
What can academics learn from this ?
Rise up , sons and daughters of the academy .

News from SPACE.com Science and space news on USATODAY.com The International Space Station 's ( ISS ) first female commander and two crewmates are safely back on Earth , but landed well short of their intended landing site as they capped a marathon mission to the orbiting laboratory .
The Russian Soyuz TMA - 11 spacecraft ferrying Expedition 16 commander Peggy Whitson , of NASA , and her crew to Earth touched down about 295 miles short of its target zone on the central Asian steppes of Kazakhstan .
" The crew is alive and well .
The landing was nominal , but by a backup design , " said Anatoly Perminov , chief of Russia 's Federal Space Agency , after the 4:30 a.m. ET landing on Saturday .
" It was a ballistic descent and all the cosmonauts are feeling fine . "
A ballistic re-entry is one in which a Soyuz re-enters at a steeper than normal angle that subjects astronaut crews to higher forces of gravity , NASA officials said .
Cosmonauts returning from the space station last fall also experienced a ballistic re-entry , as did the crew of Expedition 6 in 2003 .
Whitson returned home alongside Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko , an Expedition 16 flight engineer , after a six - month mission that added new science and living space to the $ 100 billion station .
South Korea 's first astronaut , 29 - year - old bioengineer So- yeon Yi , also accompanied the Expedition 16 crew to conclude her own 10 - day spaceflight to the ISS .
Malenchenko , as Soyuz commander , used a satellite phone to contact recovery forces to relay that the crew was in good health .
" We went through the same thing on Expedition 6 , " said Steve Lindsey , NASA 's chief astronaut who planned to greet Whitson at the original landing site .
" Of course we did n't hear from them for awhile , so we were concerned .
But eventually we got word that they were located so that 's real good news . "
Recovery teams located the Soyuz crew about 45 minutes after its scheduled landing with a complement of flight surgeons to begin traditional post - landing health checks , Lindsey added .
Back on Earth Russian space officials promised an in - depth investigation to hunt down the source of the ballistic landing .
Meanwhile , Expedition 16 crewmembers were eager to readapt to life on Earth .
" We 've really had a very exciting mission , " Whitson said this week .
" And to have done so much , it was more than we could have asked for . "
While she was not looking forward to returning to Earth 's gravity after months of weightlessness , Whitson said she was eager for a wider variety of food at mealtimes and getting back to her roots , literally , at her home in Houston , Texas .
" I really like working in my garden and planting flowers , " Whitson said .
" It 's about the right time in Houston to be doing that . "
Whitson set a new spaceflight record on Expedition 16 for the most cumulative time spent in space by an American .
Today 's landing ended a 192 - day flight to the station , giving Whitson a career total of 377 days in space during Expedition 16 and her Expedition 5 flight in 2002 .
She is now 20th in the ranks of the world 's most experienced spaceflyers , though Malenchenko — with 515 days across four spaceflights — now ranks ninth on the list .
" It was a wonderful time , " he said of the mission .
Space station expansion Whitson and her crew began Expedition 16 at a sprint , hosting the first of three visiting NASA shuttle crews about two weeks after their October launch .
By late November , shuttle and ISS astronauts had moved a massive solar power tower , performed seven spacewalks and some tricky robotic crane work to attach a new module to space station .
Two more shuttle flights , in February and March of this year , delivered Europe 's $ 2 billion Columbus laboratory and a storage room for Japan 's massive Kibo lab , which is slated to launch May 31 aboard the shuttle Discovery .
Whitson and her crew also squeezed in extra spacewalks to inspect one solar wing joint and repair another .
" It 's so large that I can actually lose crewmembers at times now , " Whitson said of the space station before turning it over to its new skipper , Expedition 17 commander Sergei Volkov .
" It 's so neat , and I think we 're ready for a six - person crew now . "
Volkov — a second - generation cosmonaut — and Expedition 17 flight engineer Oleg Kononenko are beginning their own six - month mission alongside NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman .
They launched with Yi on April 8 .
" I feel confident going into Expedition 17 with Sergei and Oleg , " said Reisman , who joined the station 's Expedition 16 crew last month and is due to return home in June .
" It 's going to be an all rookie station .
I think that 's a first . "
Yi , meanwhile , flew to the space station under a reported $ 25 million commercial agreement between her country and Russia 's Federal Space Agency and performed a series of education and science experiments .
She was selected from among 36,000 applicants to serve as backup to South Korea 's first astronaut , artificial intelligence expert San Ko , but moved to the prime crew last month after Russian space officials pulled Ko from the flight due to reading rule violations .
" As a woman of Korea , and just a person of Korea , I 'm so honored to be the one who flew in space , " Yi told reporters this week , adding that she took special care with experiments designed to spark interest in science among Korean youth .
" I want to make them dream about space . "
A challenging half - year Despite its ambitious construction work , the Expedition 16 crew was not without challenges .
Whitson , Malenchenko and their crewmates tackled a torn solar wing , damaged solar array gears and shuttle launch delays that ultimately kept one Expedition 16 astronaut — NASA spaceflyer Dan Tani — in orbit while he grieved over the unexpected death of his mother in December .
Tani returned to Earth two months later , in mid-February , during NASA 's first shuttle mission of this year .
" I actually think some of my proudest moments of this mission have been how we handled the problems that have come up , " Whitson said .
In just the last few weeks , Expedition 16 astronauts bid farewell to last month 's visiting shuttle Endeavour crew , watched over the arrival of Europe 's first - ever unmanned cargo ship Jules Verne , and welcomed their relief crew before preparing for the trip home .
" I was likening it the other day to Grand Central Station , " said Reisman , adding that he initially expected some bouts of down time and isolation aboard the outpost .
" There has n't been any tedium up here , it 's all been action packed .
It 's like the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie of space missions . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Attorney General Michael Mukasey warned Wednesday that organized criminal networks have penetrated portions of the international energy market and tried to control energy resources .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey speaks Wednesday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
In a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , he said similar efforts have targeted the international financial system by injecting billions of illicit funds to try to corrupt financial service providers .
Mukasey then vowed to beef up U.S. efforts to fight international organized crime , which he called a growing threat to U.S. security and stability .
The attorney general and top law enforcement officials from the FBI , Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Justice Department Criminal Division said a classified threat assessment prompted the creation of a strategy to combat the threat .
It calls for several U.S. agencies and their overseas counterparts to better prioritize their targets , to improve information sharing and to boost cooperation in law enforcement investigations and operations .
" The activities of transnational and national organized criminal enterprises are increasing in scope and magnitude as these groups continue to strengthen their networking with each other to expand their operations , " said FBI Deputy Director John Pistole .
Officials declined to discuss specific cases because the information remains classified , and disclosure could jeopardize ongoing investigations .
Do n't Miss Britain warns terror threat is worsening
However , the International Organized Crime Threat Assessment identified eight general strategic threats from international organized criminals :
• The penetration of the energy market and other strategic sectors of the U.S. and world economy .
As U.S. energy needs continue to grow , so , too , could the power of those who control energy resources .
• Providing logistical and other support to terrorists , foreign intelligence services and foreign governments , all with interests harmful to those of U.S. national security .
• The trafficking in people and contraband goods , bringing people and products through U.S. borders to the detriment of border security , the U.S. economy , and the health and lives of those exploited .
• The exploitation of the U.S. and international financial system to move illegal profits and funds , including sending billions in illicit funds through the U.S. financial system each year .
To continue this practice , they seek to corrupt financial service providers globally .
• The use of cyberspace to target U.S. victims and infrastructure , jeopardizing the security of personal information , the stability of business and government infrastructures and the security and solvency of financial investment markets .
• The manipulation of securities exchanges and engaging in sophisticated fraud schemes that rob U.S. investors , consumers and government agencies of billions of dollars .
• The successful corruption of public officials around the world , including countries of vital strategic importance to the United States , and continuing efforts to find ways to influence -- legally or illegally -- U.S. officials .
• The use of violence and the threat of violence as a basis of power .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Maybe , just maybe , the financial world is not about to implode .

Such is the level of disaster mongering surrounding the latest phase of the eight - month - old credit crisis that you could be forgiven for thinking we will all soon be hoarding food and reverting to a barter economy .
At the very least , some market pricing and financial commentary has invoked a systemic collapse akin to 1929 ’s stock market crash and the Great Depression that followed .
Let ’s put that in context .
U.S. historians estimate that in the first 10 months of 1930 some 744 U.S. banks failed -- rising to a total of 9,000 by the end of the 1930s .
Savers lost the equivalent in today ’s money of $ 140 billion in deposits by 1933 .
U.S. unemployment rose to 25 percent from 4 percent in 1929 and prices and incomes fell by 20 to 50 percent over the same period .
The debate , as German government spokesman Thomas Steg noted this week , has become “ hysterical . ”
This crisis is serious , for sure .
But there is a pretty good chance it is not 1929 -- even if the U.S. Federal Reserve has adopted depression - era tactics to address it .
“ To justify a repeat of last week , you really have to start believing this is going to be 1929 again , ” said Jim O’Neill , chief global economist at Goldman Sachs .
“ With the Fed moving so quickly , I think that is unlikely . ”
But with investors already positioning for a “ worst case ” scenario , there is a chance of a large pendulum swing .
Last week , a survey by Merrill Lynch showed a majority of 193 fund managers were overweight cash in March , signaling extreme caution .
No coincidence then that three - month U.S. Treasury bill yields are their lowest since the 1950s , at less than 1 percent .
Or that safe - haven gold had topped $ 1,000 an ounce before a violent reversal late last week that may itself signal a turn .
“ People are one - way ; they ’ve got the cash ; they believe equities are cheap , ” said Merrill consultant David Bowers .
“ They just need a catalyst to know when it is safe to go back into the markets . ”
Whatever the catalyst for a turn , it will first need to offer evidence the problem is not getting any worse .
The credit crisis , rooted in the U.S. real estate bust , is now essentially one of bank liquidity and solvency .
The problem is lack of confidence .
Visibility is near zero as markets fail to provide adequate pricing for mortgage assets and securities .
The only burst of clarity tends to happen at the end of each quarter when accounting rules force banks to report asset values on their books .
And as they write down assets where market prices are impossible to find , the banks struggle to raise cash to meet capital adequacy rules .
This is despite the fact that many of these assets are in suspended animation rather than worthless -- many will still pay out over the life of the loans .
The coincident hoarding and searching for cash in the final weeks of each quarter leaves the weakest exposed and it ’s no surprise stricken UK lender Northern Rock and U.S. investment house Bear Stearns were forced to go cap in hand to their central banks in mid-September and mid-March .
CIRCUIT BREAKER
With only volatile derivative prices or bespoke pricing models to go by , conservative accounting has led to huge writedowns , dents to bank capital ratios and a rationing of lending that we now know as the credit crunch .
So what could be the circuit breaker ?
First , bankers and investors need to be able to see some timescale for the crisis .
Otherwise they will continue to hunker down in safe havens of cash and gold and perpetuate the cycle .
One important development this month -- drowned out by panic surrounding the Bear Stearns rescue -- was that credit rating firm Standard & Poors said the end was in sight for writedowns of the subprime mortgage assets that sparked the crisis .
Putting total writedowns at some $ 285 billion , it said the banking sector had already written off the majority of its distressed assets and more than $ 150 billion was already declared .
First quarter writedowns at three Wall St firms that reported last week -- Goldman Sachs , Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley -- were indeed much less than analysts had feared .
S&P also emphasized that some subprime mortgage writedowns are larger than any reasonable estimate of actual losses .
This raises the prospect that when the mortgage market normalizes , banks may be able to add “ writebacks ” onto quarterly results .
In the meantime , central banks need to stand ready to prevent seizures of the banking system and governments need to do all they can to stabilize the housing and mortgage market .
The Fed has gone some distance by slashing lending rates by three percentage points in six months and recently pumping $ 400 billion of liquidity into the banks .
The U.S. government ’s release last week of an additional $ 200 billion of cash from housing finance agencies to plough into the distressed mortgage market is another major boon .
No magic bullets .
But when a turn comes , it may happen fast .
“ We have all learnt , many times , that every moment of crisis is always also one of opportunity , ” said Max King at Investec Asset Management .
About the author
( NewsTarget ) Leading U.S. scientists have called on Congress to prevent the next elected president from doing what they say the George W. Bush Administration has done .
That would be censoring , suppressing and falsifying key environmental and health research .
Serious consequences result when drug safety decisions are not based on the finest and most accurate scientific advice available from experts .
More than 15,000 government scientists have signed the statement asking Congress to protect scientific integrity .
Interference from the White House is just part of the problem , however .
The other factor is industry lobbyists .
This group is very influential over government agencies , trying to influence the research that will have impact on their corporations .
Unfortunately , these special interest groups are being given access and influence at a high level .
Government scientists are having their findings subjected to censorship and misrepresentation .
The public as well as Congress has often been deprived of accurate scientific information .
The pursuit of science in an open society has had a long and successful run in America .
Unfortunately , this tradition has been violated in recent years and the government itself is responsible .
The Union of Concerned Scientists has begun tracking the Bush Administration 's activities within the scientific community .
Amazingly , at least 1,191 scientists who are employed at nine federal agencies have reported that they fear retaliation from superiors if the results of their research are perceived as threatening to corporate or other interests .
When certain programs produce research results that are considered inconvenient or negative , they are being penalized by having their funding cut .
One such program is an annual compilation of pollutants released by private companies , called the Toxic Release Inventory .
This listing has reportedly been undermined .
The NASA satellite research program Mission to Planet Earth , whose purpose is to document environmental degradation , has also been the target of extensive budget cuts .
This interference has been largely directed at climate change research , new birth control pharmaceuticals , species protection , consumer safety studies , and agricultural research .
The suppression of specific health data by the federal Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) may cost many people who were at Ground Zero in New York City their health .
Following September 11 , the then - EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman repeatedly assured the public and safety personnel that the dust hovering over Ground Zero and settling over New York was not harmful to them .
Many rescue workers and local residents have now become very sick because of the toxicity of the air they were breathing .
Another hot topic has been the commission 's refusal to warn the public about significant issues with products like all - terrain vehicles .
This , even when research showed clearly how dangerous they were .
It has been disclosed that a political appointee prevented research on all - terrain - vehicle safety from reaching the public -- even when deaths and injuries were occurring with their use .
In another example , a microbiologist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture was prevented 11 times from publicizing his research about the dangers of airborne bacteria near large pig farms in Iowa and Missouri .
His research determined that the bacterium found is resistant to antibiotics .
Unfortunately , his supervisor restricted him from discussing his results .
He was told : " politically sensitive and controversial issues require discretion . "
Incidentally , these pig farms are major U.S. pork producers .
It 's very important that scientific and mathematical research on consumer products be free of influence from politics .
This influence will incorporate a bias in favor of the industry .
When science is falsified , fabricated , or censored people 's health and safety will suffer .

JavaOne
The most impressive Java gadget we 've seen makes its debut more than 5000 miles away from this week 's JavaOne Conference in San Francisco .
It 's the engineering equivalent of a haiku : Robin Southgate 's Java toaster , a device he assembled as part of his final year design project at Brunel University in England .
The toaster dials a freephone number to get the weather forecast and burns the appropriate symbol on a piece of toast .
And ... that 's it .
We first told you about this on March 31 , leading some of you to assume it was an April 's Fool Day prank .
It is n't , and here 's proof .
Unlike the multi-megabyte JVM behemoths , this uses a $ 20 embedded microcontroller called TINI .
Robin had originally intended to use a PC as a concept demonstration , but after hearing from wise Register counsel John Wilson , he turned to an all - in - one solution .

Germany likes to call itself the " Land of Ideas " - and over the centuries it has certainly had plenty of them .
It was Germans who invented the aspirin , the airship , the printing press and the diesel engine .
But Germany has surely never produced anything quite as weird as the automated restaurant .
I say " restaurant " - but it actually looks more like a rollercoaster , with long metal tracks criss - crossing the dining area .
The tracks run all the way from the kitchen , high up in the roof , down to the tables , twisting and turning as they go .
And down the tracks - in little pots with wheels fixed to the bottom - speeds food .
Supersonic sausages , high - pace pancakes and wine bottles whizzing down to the customers ' tables with the help of good old gravity .
One pot is spiralling down so fast , it looks like an Olympic bobsleigh ( but it 's only Bratwurst ) .
I wanted to come up with a complete new restaurant system
Michael Mack , restaurant owner
What 's more , at the 's Baggers restaurant in Nuremberg , you do n't need waiters to order food .
Customers use touch - screen TVs to browse the menu and choose their meal .
You can even use the computers to send e-mails and text messages while you wait for the food to be cooked .
But all this may not appeal to those who like traditional waiter service .
Meals on wheels
Up in the kitchen , it is man , not machine , that makes the food .
They have n't found a way of automating the chef , just yet .
Everything is prepared from fresh .
When it is ready , the meal is put in a pot and given a sticker and a colour to match the customer 's seat .
Then it is put on the rails and despatched downhill to the correct table .
Manna from heaven , German - style .
The restaurant is the brainchild of local businessman Michael Mack .
" I wanted to come up with a complete new restaurant system , " Michael tells me , " one that would be more efficient and more comfortable " .
Replacing waiters with helter - skelters and computers is fun for the customers .
It also makes financial sense for the restaurant .
A plate of food whizzes down from the kitchen " You can save labour costs , " explains restaurant spokesperson Kyra Mueller - Siecheneder .
" You do n't need the waiters to run to the customers , take the orders , run to the kitchen and back to the guests . "
The restaurant has not completely done away with the human touch .
There are still some staff on hand to explain to rather bemused customers how to use the technology .
But what do the punters here think ?
Do Germans really have the appetite for automated mealtimes ?
" It 's another art for eating .
I like it ! " one man raves .
" It 's more for young people than old people , " a woman tells me .
" My mother was here yesterday and she needs my son 's help to order . "
Watching all this food raining down on the restaurant makes me ravenous .
I decide that it is my turn to test the system .
I order steak and salad on the computer and wait for it to appear .
A few minutes later , a pot glides down to my table with my " fast food " - and it is delicious .
As I finish the meal and prepare to leave , one final thought crosses my mind .
An automated meal does n't only save the restaurant money , but the customer , too .
After all , in a restaurant without waiters , there is no need to leave a tip ....

Is business school in your future ?
Why are we asking this now ?
The septuagenarian deal - doer is adding another of the best - selling newspapers in the US to his global empire , dramatically increasing his power in the highly influential media market of New York , and riding roughshod over rules designed to stop such a concentration of media ownership .
Plus ça change , you might say .
What is he buying this time ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Now it is Newsday , a tabloid paper covering the commuter territory of Long Island outside the city , for which Mr Murdoch is planning to slap down $ 560 m - $ 580 m ( £ 290 m ) .
The paper is currently owned by Sam Zell , a former property magnate , but he has found himself with a little too much debt on his hands , so Mr Murdoch has swooped in to take advantage .
They have not signed on the dotted line yet , and there is still talk of a rival bid or some sort of tax issue that could derail the deal , but the two men have shaken hands – and Mr Murdoch has proved time and again that he has the financial power to get what he wants .
Is this a big deal ?
Compared with Mr Murdoch 's $ 5.2 bn purchase four months ago of The Wall Street Journal , the mightiest organ in financial news and the second - biggest selling paper in the US , Newsday is certainly smaller .
But this latest deal would mean that , in the space of a year , he has gone from controlling one of the top 10 US papers – his beloved trash tabloid , the New York Post – to owning three .
That 's a lot for any man , let alone for someone who also owns the most - watched television news channel in the country , the unabashedly unfair and unbalanced Fox News .
And lest we forget , he also owns one of the major television networks , Fox , home to powerhouse programming including American Idol and The Simpsons , and the movie studio 20th Century Fox .
How big is the Murdoch empire ?
Bigger than ever .
As well as all the US assets , there is MySpace , the most popular social networking website in the world .
He is the UK 's biggest newspaper proprietor , thanks to The Sun and The Times and their Sunday sisters .
He controls BSkyB in the UK , other satellite operations in Europe , and the biggest daily paper in his native Australia , plus the book publisher HarperCollins .
In Asia , he is beefing up Star TV , the satellite broadcaster .
News Corp has revenues of more than $ 30bn a year , and Murdoch 's personal fortune of $ 8.3 bn puts him just outside the 100 richest people in the world .
Why do people fear this concentrationof power ?
One need only look at Mr Murdoch 's papers in the UK to see the influence they have on the political process , and how the news that readers are fed can be skewed to his own political and business desires .
Thanks to a freedom of information request by The Independent , we learnt last year how Mr Murdoch had a hotline to Tony Blair at crucial moments during his premiership , and that the pair spoke three times in nine days in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq .
On two occasions , the day after a call with Blair , The Sun launched vitriolic attacks on the anti-war French President , Jacques Chirac .
In the US , his right - wing New York Post called the anti-war leaders " The Axis of Weasel " .
In fact , the Post has been Mr Murdoch 's unapologetic bloodhound in the US for decades , waging feuds with politicians such as Teddy Kennedy ( " Fat Boy " , the Post calls him ) who have opposed liberalised media laws , and with Mr Murdoch 's business rivals .
New York 's elite fears nothing more than a savaging in the paper 's delightfully vicious gossip column Page Six , and the Democrats are fearful of what it would do to Barack Obama if Mr Murdoch decides the Senator is too inexperienced and too liberal to be president .
Merging Newsday with the Post immediately turns it profitable , giving it immense new firepower .
How does Murdoch defend himself ?
Generally , he denies using his papers for political or business ends , saying that he is driven by commercial considerations .
Fox News , for example , was simply exploiting a gap in the market opened up by what he says was the liberal bias of CNN .
Murdoch complained during the battle to wrest control of The Wall Street Journal that opponents had reacted as if he were " a genocidal tyrant " , and that he would have walked away if he was n't so sure it was a perfect business fit for News Corp .
But he is behaving himself at the Journal ?

To persuade the Bancroft family to part with the paper , he did have to introduce an independent board to safeguard the paper 's editorial integrity .
Staff at the paper remain nervous that the mogul will somehow skew its coverage to further his business interests , and they became even more unsettled this week when Marcus Brauchli , the paper 's main editor , tendered his resignation , after just four months of working with the new proprietor .
Mr Brauchli told staff : " I have come to believe the new owners should have a managing editor of their choosing . "
Are n't there rules to limit Murdoch 's power ?
Pretty much every democracy in the world recognises the dangers of concentrating media ownership in too few hands , and have rules that ensure a diversity of voices in the marketplace .
Trouble is , Murdoch and News Corp are masters at exploiting loopholes in the law .
Technically , there is a ban on owning more than one newspaper and more than one TV station in major US cities , but the purchase of the Journal took News Corp up to two of each in the New York area .
His ownership of the New York Post is allowed on a waiver of normal rules which he got because he rescued it from bankruptcy .
He is confident of getting a second waiver for the Journal .
Adding Newsday might make a mockery of the rule .
Are there moves to tighten the rules ?
In fact , the rules have been progressively weakened .
Until December of last year , when the one - paper - one - channel rule was introduced , they were even tighter .
The Federal Communications Commission argued at the time that it would be worse for democracy if the declining profitability of newspapers pushed companies out of the business altogether .
And the rise of the internet means that traditional media rules are increasingly out of touch with how many people receive their news .
In the US at least there are campaigns to strip Mr Murdoch of his local TV stations when the licences come up for review , and the acquisition of Newsday will only intensify those calls .
Is Murdoch unstoppable ?
NO ...
* Outrage forced him to concede independent overseeing of the Wall Street Journal 's integrity
* By flouting media rules , Mr Murdoch runs the risk of making himself a target , which he would want to avoid
* Political pressures are rising now that Democrats are in the ascendancy
YES ...
* News Corp has the financial firepower to buy whatever Mr Murdoch likes
* By intimidating politicians and lobbying hard , it has got round media rules in the past
* Expansion in Asia offers Mr Murdoch a big new powerbase to add to his huge interests in the US , the UK , Australia and elsewhere

Hillary is cruelly misunderstood , and she deserves more credit for her benevolence .
Not only does she have a lot in common with Rocky , as she said Tuesday in Philadelphia , but she has a lot in common with another famous character  the Marschallin in Strauss ’s bittersweet comic opera “ Der Rosenkavalier . ”
The Marschallin is a princess married to a Viennese field marshal who has a liaison dangereuse with a younger man , Count Octavian .
Though she ’s worried about her fleeting youth and the fickleness of men , she instructs the young man on the ways of love and then gracefully sets him free , allowing him to find happiness with young Sophie as a soaring waltz plays .
Whether or not she wins , Hillary has already given noble service as a sophisticated political tutor for Obama , providing her younger colleague with much - needed seasoning .

INTRODUCTION
I created this website in order to help demistify the science of knowledge representation ( KR for short ) for all who are interested in this still largely underappreciated scientific field .
Representing knowledge , in itself , is not a very difficult thing to understand :
It is no mystery that computers are a great way to store and retrieve information .
But have you ever wondered where things currently stand with the science behind computer information ?
Is the way we currently use information on computers about as good as it can be ?
... Or , can we expect that there are major advancements still ahead of us ?
Anyone who looks closely at the way we currently store and use information with computers will find that our methods are , at best , still rather crude .
But I think , additionally , that these limitations are fixable and that major changes are awaiting us in the way we represent and use knowledge electronically - although I will try to show that we have already had a couple of revolutions of knowledge representation in the past , an entirely new revolution ( and probably the largest ) is looming just over the horizon !
I hope that after you read this essay you might agree that some inevitable changes lie ahead of us , but I also hope this essay will provide you with a lot of practical , nitty gritty details at how modern knowledge representation systems work that can be hard to pick up from other sources -
This will help you anticipate any new developments in this field if the do indeed happen in our future .
The 10,000 Foot View
Because the science of KR touches on so many fields of thought , we can easily become confused if we can't appreciate the big picture of where we 've been with KR and where we will most likely be heading .
To do this , let 's take a look at the major players that have been the driving forces in modern information systems .
By players , I mean that there are some distinct communities of computer users that have unique philosophies and can be represented by an iconic idea , or archetype .
For the sake of this primer , we can classify all computer users as belonging to one of three main archetypes :
The Guy In The Garage
The Writer
The Scientist
If we look at the history of computers , it appears that these three archetypes have been ( and potentially will be ) triggers of revolutions in how we use electronic information .
The term revolution , for sake of this essay , refers to a major shift in the way computers can be used to use information that has a tangible , everyday effect on mainstream society , with major financial and philosophical effects on how people produce and consume computerized information .
Let 's take a look at some of these three archetypes a little more closely :
The Guy In The Garage
In the early days , computers were expensive and had little computing power .
Hence , many accommodations had to be made by computer operators in order to get these early machines to do anything useful at all .
At many universities , a new breed of computer engineer appeared , able to overcome the limitations of these machines by their willingness to compromise their methods and approaches for the sake of pragmatism -
People like him , the proverbial computer hacker , began to develop things such as FORTRAN compilers , file systems , etc - the nuts and bolts of modern computer software .
People like him also started the early companies like Apple Computers - leading to the myth of the Guys in the Garage .
But in terms of knowledge representation , the most important idea contributed by The Guy In The Garage was his invention of the relational database managment system ( RDBMS for short ) .
The RDBMS sparked the first major revolution in electronic knowledge representation :
In the late seventies , average people began to directly encounter the work of computer systems : machines began to print airline tickets , give account information at bank tellers , and tracked customers , orders and inventories at many companies .
Although some of the theory behind the performance of RDBMSes was based on advanced scientific theories ( such as tuple calculus and others ) , when used as a tool to represent knowledge , RDBMSes require little advanced scientific understanding :
They are incredibly effective storage tools , but are also crude and limiting in terms of their expressiveness .
As the guy in the garage might say : " It ai n't pretty but it works ! "
The Writer
Although The Guy In The Garage was able to accomplish major feats with early computer systems , his designs had one very serious limitation :
Most information that was entered into a computer system had to be entered in a way that the computer could " understand " : in other words , a computer user had to enter in the airline tickets , bank orders , or factory widgets in a simplistic , computer - friendly manner .
Early systems worked this way because computers back then were uncommon and networks were small , so most data entered into computers was entered " for " the computer , not for other people .
This meant that a lot of people who knew a great deal about many things ( but had little to do with computers ) had not yet benefited from the world of computer science ... until , of course , the advent of the second computer revolution : The Internet Era .
All of a sudden , it did n't matter if a computer could n't " understand " knowledge about art , medicine , literature , or other fields :
By letting humans directly interact through the medium of the internet , experts in different fields could communicate in raw text or pictures directly with each other .
In this new era , people who had expertise in specific fields could write their knowledge into crude computerized web pages that other people could easily access .
By transforming the computer from an end in itself into a medium of communication , a far larger community of non-technical " domain experts " could now benefit from computers that were previously useful to only the smaller community of the technical elite .
All of a sudden , the amount of actual knowledge stored on computers exploded , although in a rather chaotic and unorganized fashion .
But There 's More !
There is an important twist to the second KR revolution that , in a way , makes it far more important than the first .
This is because the two different personalities that became part of the computer era could now interact in many different ways and bounce ideas off of each other in ways that were previously not possible .
We can illustrate this in a somewhat fanciful way by creating a gradient between The Guy In The Garage and The Writer :
This diagram illustrates the existence of two different communities of people enabled many new ideas that were previously obscure or impractical to be developed ; people were able to develop hybrid ideas that borrowed both from the world of The Guy In The Garage ( and his simple but highly structured , computer friendly data ) and The Writer ( and his rich , complex , but highly unstructured data ) .
These hybrid ideas were essentially new forms of data that contain elements that are structured as well as unstructured .
In a way , this new revolution in knowledge amplified its effects through a bridge it formed between these two archetypes , producing new concepts like search engines , markup languages , and others .
In short , there was ( to use the old ninties cliche ) synergism .
OK ...
So where 's The Scientist in all This ?
Missing in this whole discussion is The Scientist .
Although she played a critical role in developing the technology that made computers possible in the first place , so far she has played only a very minor role in the world of computer software or knowledge representation :
When you write a term paper in a word processor , read your email , or play solitaire , very little of what we call " advanced science " comes into play :
To write such software , a programmer needs little or no knowledge of things like integral calculus , theorem proving , general relativity , linguistics , or other sciences .
No one really expected that things would end up this way :
It would have made much more sense that the world of computer science should be " ruled " by advanced scientists , but this is just not what happened .
Although scientists have of course made many important advances to the world of computers , when it comes to software and KR their impact has been miniscule compared to that of the hackers and domain experts we discussed earlier .
Although scientists have put much effort into computer KR in the last few decades , many people have found the results rather disappointing ( one dramatic example was the AI winter ) .
So where does The Scientist fall in the scheme of things , then ?
In short , it turns out that the job of The Scientist when it comes to information and computers has simply been more difficult than was originally expected - partially , it may be due to the complexity of software in itself , but mainly , I think , it is due to the fact that a revolution of any sort requires the participation of many people and that , in this case , the limitations of human psychology have prevented the true science of knowledge in software to really take hold as was originally expected .
But , still , I think the future of The Scientist is secure : The Third Computer Revolution will be The Revolution Of The Scientist !
The main goal of this primer on knowledge representation will be to look at this Revolution of The Scientist and how it will come about .
In my opinion , most of the seeds that will trigger this revolution are already in place .
Additionally , these ideas can again be mixed with ideas from the other archetypes ...
For instance , some of these ideas can be blended with ideas out of the garage :
Whereas other ideas are more compatible with the knowledge of writers and domain experts :
These diagrams are of course simplistic , but they allow us to express something basic about how such disparate ideas on knowledge relate to each other ...
Furthermore , we can place all of them into a triangle ...
Behold !
Conrad's
Somewhat Accurate Triangle of
Knowledge Representation&trade
Using this triangle , we can display all the major ideas in knowledge representation as a function of their pragmatism , scientific rigor , and accessibility to domain experts -
The oldest ideas lie at the corners , while more recent ideas appear along the sides .
Only in more recent times is software slowly beginning to fill in the areas in the center of this triangle .
For the rest of this primer , let us dissect this triangle into parts and analyze every corner of the world of KR :

America 's fourth - largest bank , Wachovia , is raising $ 7bn ( £ 3.52 bn ) through emergency fundraising as the subprime mortgage crisis in the US continues to reverberate through the banking sector .
Wachovia is raising the funds through public offerings of common and convertible preference stock after incurring a surprise $ 350 m loss in the first quarter of 2008 compared with $ 2.3 bn in profit a year earlier .
The news came today as two of the biggest names in Wall Street - Citigroup and Merrill Lynch - were poised to report huge write - downs because of the continuing credit crisis .
Analysts are bracing themselves for total write - downs of $ 17bn when the two banks report their quarterly results later this week .
At North Carolina - based Wachovia , the loss was caused by a rise in provisions against loans which had turned sour , particularly mortgages hit in the housing downturn .
These option adjustable rate mortgages begin with a low interest rate , which is then replaced by a heftier charge .
Wachovia 's chief executive , Ken Thompson , blamed the " precipitous decline in housing market conditions and unprecedented changes in consumer behaviour " for the figures .
The group bought Golden West Financial Corp , a specialist in these adjustable rate mortgages , just before the home loan market plunged .
It has set aside $ 2.8 bn for credit related losses compared with $ 177 m in the same quarter last year before the home loan crisis began .
To conserve $ 2bn of funds , Wachovia is cutting its quarterly dividend by 41 % to 37.5 cents per share .
Other US banks have taken action to raise new funds and have tended to approach investors with deep pockets such as sovereign wealth funds .
Wachovia 's decision to raise capital and cut its dividend comes at a time when speculation is mounting that banks in the UK will have to take action to bolster their balance sheets .
Mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley has denied reports that it is planning to tap its shareholders for new funds through a rights issue while analysts believe Alliance & Leicester and Royal Bank of Scotland may also be candidates for fundraising exercises .
Shares in B &B fell by 7 % in early trading to 155.5 p , although they recovered to close down 1.75 p , or 1 % , at 165.50 p .
It is such an indictment on the pathetic notions of journalism from a journalist -- especially when it comes to dealing with media darling John McCain -- that CNN reporter Jim Acosta can't even recognize a legitimate question being asked of a presidential candidate and characterized it as being under fire from a heckler .

At an appearance at an Episcopal high school in Alexandria , Virginia during his Biography tour , a student calmly and rationally pointed out the rather obvious political overtones to the assembly ( despite it not being portrayed as such to the student body , evidently ) and asked what McCain 's intent was being at her school .
Oooh !
That 's so harsh !
The nerve of that student !
Rush her to Gitmo now !
Seriously , to Jim Acosta , that 's heckling .
ACOSTA : But it was earlier this week in Alexandria , Virginia , where he [ McCain ] visited a high school — a uh , high school … Episcopal high school in Alexandria , Virginia -- where apparently a student there started heckling the Senator and John McCain then had to respond .
So here is John McCain responding to what appears to be a student heckler earlier this week in Alexandria , Virginia : STUDENT :
We can see that this is n't completely absent , uh , political motivation is n't completely absent , yet we were told this is n't a political event .
So , what exactly is your purpose in being here , not that I do n't appreciate the opportunity , but I 'd just like some clarification .
MCCAIN : I knew I should have cut this thing off .
[ laughter ]
This meeting is over .
[ laughter ]
Um , this is an opportunity and part of a series of visits that I 'm playing ... paying ... we started in Mississippi , uh , where my family 's roots are back to the middle of the 19th century , to here .
We 're going from here to Pensacola , Florida , to Jacksonville , Florida , and a couple of other places where ... we 're going to Annapolis , where I obviously attended the Naval Academy .
And it 's sort of a tour where we try to not only emphasize the values and principles that guided me and I think a lot of this country in the past , but also portray a vision of how I think we need to address the challenges of the future , and a lot of that is in retrospect , but a lot of it is also advocacy and addressing certain challenges that face the nation .
I hope that attendance here was not compulsory .
ACOSTA : So there you have it , John McCain , who is no stranger to incoming fire , able to handle that heckler there ...
Dude , did you just liken that question to being in a combat zone ?
Hang it up , Acosta .
You 're just an embarrassment now .

Everyone has heard of superconductors but a superinsulator is a newly - discovered fundamental state of matter created by scientists at Argonne National Laboratory in collaboration with several European institutions that opens new directions of inquiry in condensed matter physics and breaks ground for a new generation of microelectronics .
Led by Argonne senior scientist Valerii Vinokur and Russian scientist Tatyana Baturina , the international team fashioned a thin film of titanium nitride with they then chilled to near absolute zero .
When they tried to pass a current through the material , the researchers noticed that its resistance suddenly increased by a factor of 100,000 once the temperature dropped below a certain threshold .
The same sudden change also occurred when the researchers decreased the external magnetic field .
" Titanium nitride films as well as films prepared from some other materials can be either superconductors or insulators depending on the thickness of the film .
If you take the film which is just on the insulating side of the transition and decrease the temperature or magnetic field , then the film all of a sudden becomes a superinsulator , " Vinokur said .
Like superconductors , which have applications in many different areas of physics , from accelerators to magnetic levitation ( maglev ) trains to MRI machines , superinsulators could eventually find their way into a number of products , including circuits , sensors and battery shields .
If , for example , a battery is left exposed to the air , the charge will eventually drain from it in a matter of days or weeks because the air is not a perfect insulator , according to Vinokur .
" If you pass a current through a superconductor , then it will carry the current forever ; conversely , if you have a superinsulator , then it will hold a charge forever , " he said .
Additionally , scientists could eventually form superinsulators that would encapsulate superconducting wires , creating an optimally efficient electrical pathway with almost no energy lost as heat .
A miniature version of these superinsulated superconducting wires could find their way into more efficient electrical circuits .
Titanium nitride 's sudden transition to a superinsulator occurs because the electrons in the material join together in twosomes called Cooper pairs .
When these Cooper pairs of electrons join together in long chains , they enable the unrestricted motion of electrons and the easy flow of current , creating a superconductor .
In superinsulators , however , the Cooper pairs stay separate from each other , forming self - locking roadblocks .
" In superinsulators , Cooper pairs avoid each other , creating enormous electric forces that oppose penetration of the current into the material , ” Vinokur said .
" It 's exactly the opposite of the superconductor , " he added .
The theory behind the experiment stemmed from Argonne 's Materials Theory Institute , which Vinokur organized six years ago in the laboratory 's Materials Science Division .
The MTI hosts a handful of visiting scholars from around the world who then perform cutting - edge research on the most pressing questions in condensed matter physics .
Upon completion of their tenure at Argonne , these scientists return to their home institutions but continue to collaborate on the joint projects .
The MTI attracts the world 's best condensed matter scientists , including Russian " experimental star " Tatyana Baturina , who , according to Vinokur , " became a driving force in our work on superinsulators . "
Scientists from the Institute of Semiconductor Physics in Novosibirsk , Russia , Regensburg and Bochum Universities in Germany and IMEC in Leuven , Belgium also participated in the research .
The once - webcomic - now - gaming - empire Penny Arcade continues to make waves in the industry , and with news of its new independent games portal Greenhouse , even more industry eyes are on both Penny Arcade and Hothead Games , developers of the upcoming Penny Arcade game On the Rain - Slick Precipice of Darkness .
The game wo n't just be available on the PC ( including a nifty piece of licensing that allows a single purchase to cover Windows , Mac OS X , and Linux ) , but also on the Xbox Live Arcade .
Ars caught up with Mike " Gabe " Krahulik of Penny Arcade as well as the CEO of Hothead Games to find out how tough it was to work with Microsoft and bring On the Rain - Slick Precipice of Darkness to Xbox Live .
We asked Vlad Ceraldi , CEO of Hothead Games about the process .
" There has only been one other ' M ' rated game on Live Arcade , so the first hurdle was actually getting everyone that needed to be involved in a large organization to understand what the game was actually all about , " he explained to Ars .
" The second hurdle was the release schedule — we originally decided to launch the PC versions in late 2007 and the Live version in early 2008 . "
( Hothead has yet to announce a firm release date . )
Surprisingly , that did n't end up being a problem .
" When we decided to launch all the versions simultaneously , Microsoft worked with us to remove as many roadblocks as possible with their processes to ensure the game could be released as close to our original intended date as possible , " Ceraldi continued .
" Microsoft is a large organization , so although there are some issues that come up that make you wonder how anything gets done , they suddenly surprise you with their agility and adeptness at dealing with change . "
Mike Krahulik , the artist behind Penny Arcade , also described the process in positive terms .
" It was n't really difficult because we never felt like we ' had ' to get it on the Xbox .
We went into it saying ' This is our game , and if they do n't want it or they want us to change it , then we 'll just forget about the Xbox ' , " he explained to Ars .
" The truth is that Microsoft did want it , and they did n't want to change it at all , so there was really no problem .
Working with them has actually been pretty painless other than the fact that when you work with any big company it takes a long time to do anything .
There 's really no getting around that , though . "
Dealing with Microsoft to bring the Penny Arcade game to the Live Arcade is only part of the story , as the title will also be sold via the Greenhouse site .
The indie - games portal run by Penny Arcade and Hothead Games will be a home for more titles , but Krahulik does n't feel the need to rush that aspect of their plans .
" Right now our main focus is working any kinks out of the store and launching the [ Penny Arcade ] game .
Once that 's done we can turn our attention to other games , " he told us .
" The response from independent developers has been pretty crazy already but we 're not at point where I can give you any titles . "
Considering he and Jerry Holkins such long - standing critics of both games and gaming culture , Krahulik does n't sound that intimidated by releasing their own game — even though all the news organizations and game publishers they 've mocked in the past will have the opportunity to rub their faces in it if the game disappoints .
" I 'm really excited to see what people think of it , " he told Ars .
" I 'd be lying if I said I was n't nervous but we 've been making stuff and putting it online for ten years now .
If there is one thing we 've learned it 's that you can never please everyone .
" Just like with the comic , not everyone is gonna like it .
The only thing we can do is keep making stuff that we like and hope it 's appreciated .
So far that strategy has worked for us and I think it will be the same with the game . "

1895 : Otto Steiger receives a patent for his Millionaire calculating machine .
It may not have been fruitful , but it multiplied .
The history of calculators stretches back to the invention of the abacus around 2500 B.C. through early attempts by mathematicians like Blaise Pascal and various 19th - century machines , including Charles Babbage 's famous difference engine .
By the late 19th century , some of these mechanical wonders could add and subtract , but could only simulate multiplication through repeated addition .
Steiger , a German who lived in Munich , invented his machine in 1893 .
It advanced the ideas of Ramón Verea 's 1878 U.S. patent and León Bollée 's 1889 French patent .
Neither had put his invention into commercial production .
Verea just wanted to " show that a Spaniard can invent as well as an American , " and Bollée – who lived in Le Mans – turned his efforts to building race cars .
The Millionaire used a complicated internal clockwork of carriage , cranks , cams , cogs , gears , levers , pins , shafts and sliders to perform addition , subtraction , multiplication and division .
For multiplication , each turn of the handle read a metallic multiplication table in Braille - like fashion to create a partial product .
The device could carry 10s , so you turned the handle a second time for two - digit multipliers , three times for three digits , and so on .
Hans W. Egli of Zurich , Switzerland , manufactured 4,655 of the calculators ( with the German name of Millionär ) over a remarkable 40 - year span for customers in Europe and America .
Although it was developed for business calculations , scientists also found it very useful , and government agencies became the prime customers .
The price depended on whether you wanted a hand - operated or electric lever , or an upgraded model with a keyboard , which could likewise be either hand - operated or electric .
U.S. prices in 1924 ranged from $ 475 all the way up to $ 1,100 ( $ 5,900 to $ 13,750 in today 's money ) .
The inside of the wooden case had extensive printed instructions and a special cleaning brush to keep the works free of dust and grit .
At 100 to 120 pounds each , the Millionaire was a far cry from the first Texas Instruments pocket calculators of 1972 or the keychain calculators given away as promotional swag today .

Address by Edwin Vieira Jr .
Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee Inc. conference
GATA Goes to Washington -- Anybody Seen Our Gold ?
Hyatt Regency Crystal City Hotel , Arlington , Virginia
Friday , April 18 , 2008 Silver and gold are not merely valuable commodities , investments , and media of exchange .
More importantly , they are key " checks and balances " in America 's legal and political institutions .
The fight against the use of silver and gold as money that has been waged by bankers and rogue politicians since the 1870s as to silver and the 1930s as to gold -- and will intensify as fiat currencies collapse throughout the world -- is ultimately directed against America 's national independence , her constitutional government , and every common American 's individual liberty and prosperity .
The Constitution of the United States adopted a monetary system consisting of silver and gold coin , in which the standard is the " dollar , " containing 371 1/4 grains ( troy ) of fine silver , with the values of gold coins to be measured in " dollars " according to the free market 's rate of exchange between silver and gold .
Neither the general government nor any state is authorized to emit paper currency .
These restrictions prevent rogue public officials from turning public debts into currency , as a means for redistributing wealth from society to political elitists and their clients in special - interest groups .
Furthermore , although the Constitution does not mention banks , either public or private , its only correct construction requires separation of bank and state -- extirpation of all inherently fraudulent fractional - reserve banking schemes -- and rigorous regulation of all other fractional - reserve arrangements that might operate fraudulently .
( See Edwin Vieira Jr. , " Pieces of Eight : The Monetary Powers and Disabilities of the United States Constitution , " second revised edition , 2002 . )
But since the early 1800s rogue politicians and bankers have steadily subverted the Constitution by forging an increasingly tight relationship between bank and state .
Through the grant of one abusive special privilege after another , politicians have immunized fractional - reserve banking against the just economic and legal consequences of its own inevitable failures , so that public officials and bankers could turn both public and private debts into currency -- thus separating the supply and the purchasing power of currency from the economic discipline of the free market , and rendering those matters largely political in nature .
Under the Federal Reserve System , Americans no longer enjoy " money " in the economic sense but are subjected to what must be denoted as " political currency , " with emphasis on the adjective .
Political currency is emitted on the basis of political debts -- that is , either 1 ) public debts or 2 ) private debts for the payment of which the creditors expect public bailouts if their debtors default .
Unfortunately , the Federal Reserve System is inherently unstable , and must lurch from one self - generated crisis to another , each increasing in severity , until its house of financial cards self - destructs .
Having separated society 's medium of exchange from the production of real goods and services in the free market -- and instead linked the currency to creating , packaging , marketing , servicing , and eventually salvaging political debts -- the Federal Reserve system encourages , facilitates , and rewards irresponsibility on the part of both lenders and borrowers , in the private as well as the public sector .
For those who benefit from the system to continue to loot society , the supply of political currency must expand .
For that supply to expand , political debts must increase .
True enough , political debts can increase , even geometrically , because political currency can be created ( as the saying goes ) " out of nothing " to float them .
But real wealth cannot be generated simply by the emission of paper promises .
Neither can new paper promises pay off old ones .
So , avarice being unlimited , insatiable , and imprudent , the whole operation must cumulate and culminate in an unsustainable bubble of debts that either implodes in a depression or explodes in hyperinflation .
Although the Federal Reserve System is fatally flawed , the wealth and power of elitists in high finance , big business , and the political class depend on maintaining it -- or replacing it in a timely fashion with something of equal serviceability for their ends .
As it cannot long be maintained , it must and will soon be replaced .
With what remains a matter for speculation .
Not open to the slightest doubt , however , is that , as crises have rocked the system , the establishment has always moved farther away from the Constitution -- deeper into the sump of lawlessness -- to shore up the banking cartel , and always at the expense of common Americans .
In the 1930s , in response to the collapse of the fractional - reserve racket , rather than reforming the operations of the banks , the Roosevelt administration and a pliant Congress seized the American people 's gold and outlawed almost all public and private contracts promising to pay in gold .
In the 1950s and through the 1960s , until the Nixon administration terminated redemption of Federal Reserve notes in gold in 1971 , the inflationary policies of the Federal Reserve System drained off more than half of America 's national stock of gold to foreign banks and the profiteers operating through them .
And during the last few decades , surreptitious manipulation of the precious - metals markets has kept the price of gold ( measured in Federal Reserve notes ) suspiciously low , even as this country 's financial structures have become increasingly shaky .
The price of gold has been manipulated for two reasons , one being the suppression of evidence , the other the throttling of monetary evolution .
First , an ever - increasing price of gold reflects the breakdown of the Federal Reserve System -- just as an ever - increasing temperature reveals that the human body is sick , and when it reaches a critical point that death is imminent .
Second , those who fatten off of political currency need to prevent ordinary people from realizing that only a return to silver and gold as common media of exchange can stabilize America 's economy , and especially from actually employing silver and gold in preference to Federal Reserve notes in their day - to - day transactions .
However , as the Federal Reserve System experiences ever - more - frequent , ever - more - serious , and ever - less - tractable problems , downward manipulations of the prices of gold and silver will become impossible .
And that the system is beyond repair will become apparent to all .
At that point , the question will arise -- and behind the scenes doubtlessly already has arisen among bankers and politicians -- as to how and with what to replace the banking cartel .
When a political currency has failed , the traditional trick of the bankers and politicians has been to introduce a new , supposedly more stable currency -- often within a new , supposedly more stable banking apparatus .
This was the sleight of hand that moved America from the independent state banks in operation prior to the Civil War , through the partially cartelized national banks created in the 1860s , to the fully cartelized Federal Reserve System established in 1913 .
Throughout this devolution , the progression of illegality became increasingly stark .
The state banks violated Article I , Section 10 , Clause 1 , of the Constitution .
But at least they operated only regionally .
The national banks violated Article I , Section 8 , Clause 2 , and operated throughout the country .
But at least their emission of paper currency was limited by the amount of public debt a generally thrifty Congress was willing to incur .
The Federal Reserve System , though , is a corporative - state ( or fascist ) structure that purports to delegate Congress ' supposed monetary powers to private interests ; and the system 's bubble of both public and private debts will expand to the limit of the avarice of the cartel 's operators , their clients , and their political henchmen .
Nonetheless , as unconstitutional and economically unsound as they were and are , all these schemes operated and even now operate under color of the national sovereignty and laws of the United States , subject in principle to overarching control by the American people .
Indeed , Section 30 of the Federal Reserve
Act still explicitly reserves to Congress the right to repeal , alter , or amend the system at will .
But with the Federal Reserve System the bankers and politicians have gone about as far as they can go within the economic and political institutions of the United States .
And they have separated paper currency from the discipline of free markets about as far as possible , while still pretending to maintain some semblance of a connection to free markets .
So as the Federal Reserve System shakes itself to pieces , the likelihood is that first , a new currency will arise outside of the United States in some regional supra-national entity such as the proposed North American Union ; and , second , the value of this new currency will not be controlled by free financial markets but , instead , propping up the currency 's value will be the excuse for extensive governmental intervention in and manipulation of the markets .
This plan is so alien to the experiences and desires of most Americans that its implementation will probably require a controlled meltdown of the Federal Reserve System to bludgeon them into accepting the North American Union as the only way to obtain a new , supposedly stable currency and to return to something approaching economic normalcy .
Yet even a controlled meltdown , along with the accompanying absorption of the United States into a new Northern Hemispheric political order , will unavoidably generate extensive economic , social , and political unrest that will threaten the financial establishment 's power .
Even dumbed - down Americans will not long suffer conditions of depression akin to those of the 1930s , let alone South American levels of inflation as well .
Desperate people will ask questions and assign blame .
Perhaps not just a few will abandon debt currency altogether and substitute silver and gold as their media of exchange .
They and others will conclude that the Federal Reserve System is unconstitutional -- and therefore that its operations are arguably a complex of criminal offenses .
( See 18 U.S.C. §§ 241 and 242 . )
Many will realize that the establishment 's scheme for replacing Federal Reserve Notes with a supra-national currency is a political crime on a more stupendous scale yet , because it depends upon destroying both the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence .
Then an aroused people will take political action against the institutions and individuals responsible for foisting the funny - money scheme on their country .
On the other side , the establishment will not be idle .
It will do anything and everything possible to maintain its position .
Obviously the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence will be expendable , because the establishment has been trying to whittle away the former on a piece - by - piece basis over the years , and intends to do away with the latter at one fell swoop in the near future .
So this country , as an independent nation , will be expendable too .
And if this country , why not the freedom and prosperity of common Americans as well ?
Will ordinary Americans -- at least 80 to 90 million of whom are armed -- meekly put up with a program aimed at their own country 's assisted suicide ?
Why should they , when they have nothing to lose economically or politically ?
If they refuse to knuckle under , the establishment 's only recourse will be to attempt to lock down the whole country under a para - militarized police state , perhaps with the assistance of " peacekeepers " from Canada and Mexico ( for the employment of whom negotiations are apparently already in progress ) .
That is why careful observers conclude that the paranoia being generated by politicians and the big media over " homeland security " -- and the frenetic para-militarization of law - enforcement agencies at the national , state , and even local levels in the name of " homeland security " -- are not caused by or aimed at foreign " terrorists " at all , but instead target ordinary Americans in their own home towns .
The establishment is preparing to force justifiably angry Americans into line when its financial house of cards comes tumbling down , either in a controlled demolition or otherwise .
Americans will not be the only victims of such repression .
The establishment must prevent other peoples , in other parts of the world , from jumping off the financial treadmill of political currency .
That will require the use not only of economic and political pressure , but also -- indeed , especially -- of military coercion .
For the provision of which the establishment will attempt to force common Americans to pay , and to send their sons and even their daughters off to fight , die , and be maimed and sickened in foreign lands .
Little good , then , will it do for an ounce of gold to soar to $ 2,000 , $ 3,000 , or higher -- and for silver to increase in value proportionately too -- if the ultimate consequences are a police state in America , then a supra-national regime replacing the United States , accompanied by endless military conflicts throughout the world .
In the grand scheme of things , gold and silver are far less important as economic investments or hedges against hyperinflation or depression than as guarantors of individual freedom -- and then to the fullest extent only when they are actually used as media of exchange throughout society .
Silver and gold as currencies supply the foundation necessary for economic democracy and limited government ; whereas fiat currencies inevitably function as the tools of fascism , socialism , and every other form of financial imperialism .
Thus , the fight over gold and silver as media of exchange is about more than mere money , let alone making money .
For it is a fight with only two possible outcomes : either control of their own lives by the people themselves , or control of the people and their lives by political and economic elitists .
To achieve the first and avoid the second no price will prove too great to pay .

A Thai rubber tapper who got rather tired of his neighbours ' karaoke version of John Denver 's Country Roads resolved the noise pollution problem by shooting eight of them dead , the Telegraph reports .
Weenus Chumkamnerd , 52 , blew away a respected female doctor and seven of her guests at a rowdy singalong in the town of Hat Yai , close to the Malaysian border .
He later recounted : " I warned these people about their noisy karaoke parties .
I said if they carried on I would go down and shoot them .
I had told them if I could n’t talk sense into them I would come back and finish them off . "
A neighbour confirmed that while the karaoke group " normally sang Thai pop and southern Thai ballads " , they had a particular penchant for Country Roads .
As well as Dr Suthathip Thammachart , 36 , the massacre also accounted for the life of Chumkamnerd 's own brother - in - law , Boontip Desaro .
Chumkamnerd rather touchingly got his son to whisk Desaro to hospital following the carnage , but he was already dead .
Chumkamnerd was later cuffed after going on the run . ®

Zimbabwe ’s Electoral Commission is now in the process of recounting ballots from last month ’s presidential election in which the long - time strongman Robert Mugabe appears to have lost out to opposition parties , including the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , led by Mugabe ’s primary political nemesis , Morgan Tsvangirai .
As the recount continues , there are reports that Mugabe ’s party , ZANU - PF , could be preparing for a crackdown .
Human Rights
Watch last week accused the regime of establishing “ detention centers ” in remote areas , allegedly to be “ used as torture camps to punish rural voters for supporting the MDC . ”
Reports today suggest that Zimbabwe ’s hospitals are quickly filling with victims of political violence .
Meanwhile , there ’s another ominous sign of trouble ahead — a cargo ship loaded with weapons and ammunition from China , bound for Zimbabwe .
According to reports in the South African press , the vessel , called the An Yue Jiang , carries three million AK - 47 rounds , rocket - propelled grenades , and mortar shells .
It was due to arrive in the South African port of Durban last week , but when word of the ship ’s cargo reached shore , dockworkers refused to unload it .
The dispute was referred to a judge , who upheld the dockworkers claim that the weapons , once transported to Zimbabwe , could contribute to “ internal repression or suppression of human rights and fundamental freedoms . ”
The vessel reportedly departed Durban Sunday night , possibly bound for ports in Angola or Mozambique for another attempt at offloading its cargo .
If another attempt is made , there ’s no guarantee either country will grant the request , at least if the International Transport Workers Federation ( ITF ) has anything to do with it .
The London - based organization is calling on dockworkers in both African nations to reject the shipment .
“ We ’re trying very hard to track down where that ship ’s going , ” ITF general secretary David Cockroft told Voice of America , adding that his organization is also in talks with Chinese trade unions ( still government - influenced , but “ showing signs of independence ” ) in hopes of gaining their support .
The ITF finds the timing of arms shipment is highly suspect .
According to Cockroft :
There is no reason why Zimbabwe needs three million rounds of AK - 47 ammunition right now .
There ’s no prospect of there being a sudden external invasion of Zimbabwe .
And so it is very difficult for anyone to conclude that this ammunition is likely to be used for anything other than to take action against opposition groups in the very controversial , very sensitive position which is still surrounding the aftermath of the Zimbabwe general elections .
What of the accusation that the dockworkers ’ actions violate nations ’ right to engage in free trade ?
If this is free trade I ’d love to see what unfree trade is like .
This is a government - to - government activity … which is designed to bolster the regime in Zimbabwe , which is clearly a regime which is coming to its end .
And there is no reason why there needs to be a supply of arms of this level at this stage in Zimbabwe history .

At the beginning of Nick Turse ’s The Complex , we meet “ Rick , ” an educated , antiwar , Daily Show - watching resident of the New York City suburbs .
Rick wakes up to a Sony alarm clock , brushes his teeth with Crest toothpaste , and showers with Herbal Essences shampoo before catching a segment about Iraq on NBC ’s Today Show .
If you asked him , Rick would tell you that his life has no connection to the military .
But so far , everything Rick has touched has been produced by a company that does business with the Pentagon .
The rest of his day will be no different .
Whether we like it or not , we live in an America whose connections to the military are so numerous as to be virtually invisible .
Like the fictional Matrix , what Turse calls the “ military - corporate complex ” is ubiquitous , hidden , and influences our lives in ways that we never notice .
From pharmaceutical companies to furniture makers , book publishers to office supply stores , tens of thousands of corporations work with the Department of Defense .
Their influence is so complete that it is close to impossible to opt out — even zealous anti-corporate types read books , and publishers Houghton Mifflin , Random House , and Warner Books are all DoD contractors .
It ’s not just mega - corporations , either : Turse lists a number of small - town operations that also supply the Pentagon .
Turse ’s new book , structured as a series of short but dense snapshots of everything from the “ Military - Petroleum Complex ” to the “ Military - Doughnut Complex ” ( really ) , is a tour of the DoD ’s forays into commerce , entertainment , academia , and social networking , as well as an education in what the word “ support ” really means .
Almost every American , he writes , “ is , at least passively , supporting the Complex every time he or she shops for groceries , sends a package , drives a car , or watches TV — let alone eats barbeque in Memphis or buys Christian books in Hattiesburg .
And what choice do you have ?
What other brand of computer would you buy ?
Or cereal ?
Or boots ? ”
Turse spoke with Mother Jones about why the best - funded wing of the U.S. government can’t pass an audit , how going to the movies encourages the Iraq war , and whether or not we can ever escape the matrix .
Mother Jones :
Most people are aware that the Pentagon has a big budget .
What inspired you to look deeper ?
Nick Turse :
It started with my investigation of the ways the military and the video game industry have become intertwined .
When I began to look , I was just amazed .
It was tough to figure out where one ended and the other began .
After that , I began to look at the less obvious ways in which the Pentagon had invaded the civilian sphere .
MJ : What are some of the most striking things you learned while you were writing ?
NT : The thing that really struck me was how many firms that we think of as strictly civilian had ties to the Pentagon .
Companies like Apple , Starbucks , Oakley , the sunglasses manufacturer .
Even Google , and a lot of big corporations like PepsiCo , Colgate - Palmolive , and Nestlé , that you do n’t normally think of as defense contractors .
MJ : You start the book by describing a fictional yuppie progressive who gets up in the morning and pats himself on the back for not participating in the Complex .
And while I was reading , I was thinking , “ there ’s no way that I ’m part of any of this . ”
But , obviously , that ’s totally wrong .
NT : Yeah , as I mention in the book , unless you ’re a very committed anarcho - primitivist , it ’s almost impossible for an American to really unplug from the complex .
It ’s just so invasive .
It pops up in so many places — Christian bookstores in Mississippi , or BBQ joints in Louisiana — and these companies do n’t advertise it .
Unless you ’re combing the Pentagon ’s list of contractors , it ’s almost impossible to tell how deep the rabbit hole goes .
MJ : Let ’s say the DoD budget disappeared tomorrow .
How would that affect the business of these companies ?
NT : I imagine that a company like Lockheed Martin would be in bad financial shape .
85 percent of their business comes from the U.S. government , most of that from the Pentagon .
But most firms are not dependent to that degree .
MJ : How does the state of the economy affect the Pentagon ’s ability to do business ?
Currently we ’re seeing trends towards less consumer spending , which has an impact on civilian businesses and causes them to lose money .
That said , even consumers who spend less money are paying their taxes .
NT : Absolutely .
Some people have referred to that as a form of military socialism :
Tax dollars are shuttled into the Pentagon , and they dole them out to these corporations .
So while I do n’t think a lot of these firms are so dependent on the Pentagon that they ’d go under without it , I would imagine that in a challenging economic market it ’s helpful for them to have a steady supply of tax financing .
MJ : Some Pentagon expenditures that you detail seem so outrageous that they ’re not actually possible — nearly a million dollars for two 19 - cent washers , for example .
In your research , did you figure out how that even happens ?
NT : The Pentagon has such an arcane bookkeeping system — or , I should say , systems , because there ’s a number of them .
Because it ’s so vast , a lot of these things get lost in the shuffle .
The DoD has never undergone an audit .
In 2004 it actually pledged to undergo a full audit by 2007 , but that deadline came and went , and then they moved it to 2016 .
No one , not even the DoD , thinks they ’ll actually be able to pass it in 2016 .
So it will be nearly a decade until the Pentagon fails an audit , and passing one — no one has any idea when that will happen .
So there ’s a major lack of accountability .
The GAO makes a noble effort to look at some of the most egregious things .
In their reports you can find that the Pentagon shelled out over $ 400 for a genie lamp , $ 51,000 on cappuccino makers , or $ 1,000 on a “ nacho cheese warmer . ”
MJ : You describe in the book how huge amounts of money also go to the Pentagon ’s research laboratories , for projects like engineering soldiers to fight without food or water .
Do these projects have any real - world potential , or will they go the way of the gay bomb ?
NT : A lot of these projects are funded through DARPA — the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency .
Most DARPA projects actually do fail to meet all their goals , but there are a lot of projects that still make it out there .
One I talk about briefly in the book is their cyborg insect project .
They call it MEMS , microelectric mechanical systems .
They implant computer chips into moths while they ’re still developing in the cocoon , and when they hatch , the moths can be remotely controlled .
The idea is that eventually you ’ll have remote control moths with video and audio surveillance .
Who would think that would really ever happen ?
But I just read a report that the scientists have overcome some of the major sticking points – the moths now live into adulthood , and they ’re able to control them at least while they ’re tethered .
So it is n’t out of the question that something like that , that sounds like science fiction , could be fact in a few short years .
MJ : Another area you discuss is research universities that receive Pentagon funding .
Did you come across any examples of the Pentagon dictating research topics at civilian institutions , or shutting down research they did n’t like ?
NT : It ’s not so much that they can shut down research as the fact that they account for such a large percentage of federal funding for a number of critical fields .
For example , The Pentagon provides over 60 percent of available funding for electrical engineering research .
Over 50 percent for computer science .
40 percent for metallurgy and metal engineering .
Over 30 percent for oceanography .
In fields like that , where they control that much of the research budget , researchers naturally have to tailor what they study around the dollars that are available .
Conversely , maybe there ’s something you want to look into , but there ’s no federal money for it .
MJ : If all the money , all the research , all the technology , and all the amenities are concentrated and available only within the Pentagon , and everyone else is fighting over what resources remain , could that actually divide society along military and non-military lines ?
NT : I think there would be a social division , of who gets access to these types of technologies and who does n’t .
DARPA spends $ 3 billion a year on 200 projects ranging from human performance enhancement to unmanned aerial vehicles .
The Environmental Protection Agency ’s DARPA - like arm gets only a fraction of that .
They spent only about $ 2 million in state innovation grants last year .
So civilians with problems resulting from environmental hazards get very little in the way of government - funded aid , whereas troops involved in war reap the benefits of the government ’s research .
MJ : You reference Eisenhower a lot in the book .
How did things move so far from his vision of the military - industrial complex ?
NT : In Eisenhower ’s day , the military - industrial complex did n’t extend much beyond the Lockheed factory floor .
Today , Lockheed , Boeing , GM and the big oil companies still form the core of the complex , but they ’re dwarfed by the tens of thousands of smaller contractors that you would n’t necessarily guess were wrapped up with the military .
MJ : According to the book , you ca n’t even go to the movies without supporting the complex .
NT : The military has a very long relationship with Hollywood , that dates back to the silent film era .
In recent years they ’ve developed a more sophisticated relationship .
It used to be done on an ad hoc basis , and now the military ’s set up a one - stop shop in Hollywood .
This office has liaisons for the Army , Navy , Air Force , and Marines .
So if you have a script , you bring it into them if you ’re seeking military hardware like planes and helicopters , or want to film on a base .
The military is also a good source for large numbers of movie extras .
They ’ll review your script , and if they like it , they ’ll let you use their machinery , and their bases , and their people .
If they find parts objectionable , they ’ll note them and give it back to you , and if you make the changes they recommend , they ’ll give you the equipment you ’re requesting .
MJ : Did you come across any instances where the military was involved in a non-war film ?
NT : Generally the films that go to them are the ones that want something from them .
Last year , the film Transformers was a big summer blockbuster , really popular with kids .
It received a tremendous amount of military support .
In fact , the film ’s producers said it would have been a totally different film had they not received military support .
But it would seem that it would n’t be necessary to have the military involved in that project .
It ’s a film about giant robots .
It ’s not a war film .
MJ : How big a presence does the military have on the Web ?
NT : I could n’t give you a number , but the military operates a tremendous number of websites .
They have their own sites , but they ’re also operating sites that look like civilian sites .
They have recruiting sites that look like they ’re designed to give career advice to teenagers , and they mention asking a guidance counselor to take a certain type of test .
What they do n’t tell you is that it ’s the armed forces entrance exam .
They operate some websites for overseas audiences that look like news portals , but are actually DoD propaganda sites .
You have to search the fine print in one portion of the site to find that it ’s created by the Pentagon .
MJ : Do you see this trajectory continuing ?
NT : I do n’t see it stopping without a huge public outcry .
MJ : Do you think there will be one ?
NT : I do n’t , unfortunately .
MJ : Why not ?
NT : For one , there is n’t widespread recognition of how invasive the military has become , how far it stretches into the civilian sphere in America .
I think that while there might be a lively antiwar movement in this country , it ’s not huge or particularly militant .
If the war does n’t drum up that type of support , I do n’t imagine that this would .
MJ : What would you suggest people do , since opting out is so difficult ?
NT : I ’ve been asked before if people could comfortably live without supporting the complex , and while everyone has different comfort levels , I do n’t think it ’s likely that everyone would be able to unplug totally .
But they could curtail their support for the most egregious offenders .
Or , conversely , target the smallest companies , or those who take a relatively small percentage of their profits from the military .
They ’d be most susceptible to boycotts , letter writing campaigns , or whatever other type of protest people want to mount .
MJ : Did you cover everything you wanted to in The Complex , or is there more to find ?
NT : I think the book could have gone on forever .
I talk about things in there that are sort of tongue in cheek , like the Military - Doughnut complex .
But you can find these discrete corporate complexes .
You could cover one a day for the next several years and not run out of topics .
By Jason Leopold
President George W. Bush ’s comment to ABC News — that he approved discussions that his top aides held about harsh interrogation techniques — adds credence to claims from senior FBI agents in Iraq in 2004 that Bush had signed an Executive Order approving the use of military dogs , sleep deprivation and other tactics to intimidate Iraqi detainees .
When the American Civil Liberties Union released the FBI e-mail in December 2004 — after obtaining it through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit — the White House emphatically denied that any such presidential Executive Order existed , calling the unnamed FBI official who wrote the e-mail “ mistaken . ”
President Bush and his representatives also have denied repeatedly that the administration condones “ torture , ” although senior administration officials have acknowledged subjecting “ high - value ” terror suspects to aggressive interrogation techniques , including the “ waterboarding ” — or simulated drowning — of three al - Qaeda detainees .
But the emerging public evidence suggests that Bush ’s denials about “ torture ” amount to a semantic argument , with the administration applying a narrow definition that contradicts widely accepted standards contained in international law , including Geneva and other human rights conventions .
The FBI e-mail — dated May 22 , 2004 http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/FBI.121504.4940_4941.pdf— followed disclosures about abuse of Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison and sought guidance on whether FBI agents in Iraq were obligated to report the U.S. military ’s harsh interrogation of inmates when that treatment violated FBI standards but fit within the guidelines of a presidential Executive Order .
According to the e-mail , Bush ’s Executive Order authorized interrogators to use military dogs , “ stress positions , ” sleep “ management , ” loud music and “ sensory deprivation through the use of hoods , etc. ” to extract information from detainees in Iraq .
The FBI e-mail was put into a new light by news reports last week that senior White House officials — including Vice President Dick Cheney and then - National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice — did meet secretly to discuss specific interrogation methods that could be used against detainees .
“ The most senior Bush administration officials repeatedly discussed and approved specific details of exactly how high - value al - Qaeda suspects would be interrogated by the CIA , ” ABC News reported http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/LawPolitics/Story?id=4635175&page=1, citing unnamed sources .
“ The high - level discussions about these ‘ enhanced interrogation techniques ’ were so detailed , these sources said , some of the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed — down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic .
“ These top advisers signed off on how the CIA would interrogate top al - Qaeda suspects — whether they would be slapped , pushed , deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning , called waterboarding , sources told ABC News . ”
On Friday , President Bush confirmed the report , stating matter - of - factly : “ I ’m aware our national security team met on this issue .
And I approved ”
FBI E- Mail
The May 2004 FBI e-mail stated that the FBI interrogation team in Iraq understood that despite revisions in the Executive Order that occurred after the furor over the Abu Ghraib abuses , the presidential sanctioning of harsh interrogation tactics had not been rescinded .
“ I have been told that all interrogation techniques previously authorized by the Executive Order are still on the table but that certain techniques can only be used if very high - level authority is granted , ” the author of the FBI e-mail said .
“ We have also instructed our personnel not to participate in interrogations by military personnel which might include techniques authorized by Executive Order but beyond the bounds of FBI practices . ”
One month after the e-mail was sent to FBI counterterrorism officials in Washington , then - White House counsel Alberto Gonzales held a news conference in an attempt to contain the fallout from the Abu Ghraib scandal .
Gonzales told reporters that the abuses , which included sexual humiliation of Iraqi men , were isolated to some rogue U.S. soldiers who acted on their own and not as result of orders being handed down from high - level officials inside the Bush administration .
“ The President has not directed the use of specific interrogation techniques , ” Gonzales said on June 22 , 2004 .
“ There has been no presidential determination necessity or self - defense that would allow conduct that constitutes torture .
“ There has been no presidential determination that circumstances warrant the use of torture to protect the mass security of the United States . ”
Prior to the news conference , the White House selectively declassified and released documents to reporters , including one dated Feb. 7 , 2002 , and signed by President Bush , that cited the Geneva Convention ’s rules about humane treatment of prisoners during conflicts .
Describing the contents of the Feb. 7 , 2002 , memo , Gonzales said , “ This is the only formal , written directive from the President regarding treatment of detainees .
The President determined that Geneva does not apply with respect to our conflict with al - Qaeda .
Geneva applies with respect to our conflict with the Taliban .
Neither the Taliban or al Qaeda are entitled to POW protections . ”
Gonzales added : “ But the President also determined — and this is quoting from the actual document , paragraph 3 ; this is very important — he said , ‘ Of course , our values as a nation , values that we share with many nations in the world , call for us to treat detainees humanely , including those who are not legally entitled to such treatment .
Our nation has been , and will continue to be , a strong supporter of Geneva and its principles .
As a matter of policy , the Armed Forces are to treat detainees humanely , and to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity , in a manner consistent with the principles of Geneva ’ . ”
But the FBI e-mail ’s reference to an Executive Order describing specific harsh interrogation techniques , allegedly approved by President Bush , appeared to contradict Gonzales ’s assertions .
Yoo ’s Memo
The issue surrounding U.S. interrogation methods and whether they amount to torture resurfaced two weeks ago when the Defense Department released an 81 - page document in response to the ACLU ’s ongoing FOIA lawsuit .
John Yoo , then a deputy in the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , drafted the document , dated March 14 , 2003 .
It essentially provided military interrogators with legal cover if they resorted to brutal and violent methods to extract information from prisoners .
“ If a government defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a manner that might arguably violate a criminal prohibition , he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the al - Qaeda terrorist network , ” Yoo wrote .
“ In that case , we believe that he could argue that the Executive Branch ’s constitutional authority to protect the nation from attack justified his actions . ”
The legal opinion for military interrogators was virtually identical to an earlier memo that Yoo had written in August 2002 for CIA interrogators .
Widely called the “ Torture Memo , ” it provided CIA interrogators with the legal authority to use long - outlawed tactics , such as waterboarding , when interrogating so - called high - level terrorist suspects .
In declaring that the United States does not engage in torture , Bush administration officials appear to be relying on a narrower U.S. definition of torture than that is accepted under international law , such as the 1984 Convention Against Torture that was signed by the Reagan administration in 1988 and ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1994 .
“ The threshold for torture is lower under international law : acts that do not amount to torture under U.S. law may do so under international law , ” wrote Philippe Sands , law professor at University College London , in a column published in the Dec. 9 , 2005 , edition of The Financial Times .
“ Waterboarding — strapping a detainee to a board and dunking him under water so he believes that he might drown — plainly constitutes torture under international law , even if it may not do so under U.S. law . …
“ When the U.S. joined the 1984 convention it entered an ‘ understanding ’ on the definition of torture , to the effect that the international definition was to be read as being consistent with the U.S. definition
The administration relies on the ‘ understanding . ’
“ So , when Ms. Rice says the U.S. does not do torture or render people to countries that practice torture , she does not rely on the international definition .
That is wrong : the convention does not allow each country to adopt its own definition , otherwise the convention ’s obligations would become meaningless .
That is why other governments believe the U.S. ‘ understanding ’ cannot affect U.S. obligations under the convention . ”
At the June 22 , 2004 , news conference , Gonzales said the White House defined torture as a “ a specific intent to inflict severe physical or mental harm or suffering .
That ’s the definition that Congress has given us and that ’s the definition that we use . ”
However , on March 8 , 2008 , President Bush vetoed congressional legislation that called for a specific ban on waterboarding and other abusive interrogation techniques , including stripping prisoners naked , subjecting them to extreme cold and staging mock executions .
“ This is no time for Congress to abandon practices that have a proven track record of keeping America safe , ” the president said in a radio address http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/08/bush.torture.ap/
explaining his veto .
“ We created alternative procedures to question the most dangerous al - Qaeda operatives , particularly those who might have knowledge of attacks planned on our homeland . ”
Bush said .
“ If we were to shut down this program and restrict the CIA to methods in the [ Army ] field manual , we could lose vital information from senior al - Qaeda terrorists , and that could cost American lives . ”

These people are organized crime .
This is so overwhelming , yet the MSM ignores it .
This is so much bigger than Watergate ( which was horrible ) .
The whole Bush administration is like a mud wrestling match --- enough dirt to go around on all topics .
Add in the whole torture memo , and assault on the constitution , and it is beyond even a dedicated conspiracy theorist 's imagination .

Hey guys I wrote to the guy who wrote the fliping software read what I wrote below .
Any way
He needs our help and cash because he is running for Fl Senate seat His name is Clint Curtis any way read on ...
Here is the source code .
It is a reproduction of the prototype but it will still show functionally what the code did .
Once finished into a full program it would then be installed on the voting machine ( or if an outside hack - would replace the existing software ) .
You will need VB5 to play with it and Access 97 to open the database .
You do not need access in order to have the program run .
Once it is fully installed VB5 would not be needed either .

You would think some news organization could at least call Siegelman a conspiracy theorist to save their own butt while getting the story out there .
Time is running out for the 2008 election .
Siegelman is just one more American hero who will be invisible until organizations like MoveOn , PFAW , ACLU , and all the other usual suspects STOP ignoring the most important story of our times .
The danger of wholesale , undetectable election theft .
I 'm thinking the DLC will be the first to help us out here .
Bill Richardson could help too .
He wrote an eloquent letter about democracy and ballots not too long ago that I delivered to my governors office .

If the media wants to ignore the hacking of elections , I would think a score of zero across the board for all candidates in the electronic vote tabulation results would get their attention .
And my understanding is you can't really do a recount on electronically submitted and tabulated votes , right ?
I 'm curious : has any county or precinct implemented separate paper receipts / trails ? - Tom

They 've been stealing elections for 8 + years thru electronic voting machines .
These things need to be BANNED immediately .
This is the real reason why politicians do n't care at all about the overwhelming anger of the electorate .
In other words , even the illusion of " democracy " is shattered .
Not to mention the media is completely bought off .

TomR , we vote on paper ballots here in San Diego , but recounts are unaffordable .
Even if we could afford a recount , if the election officials do n't want to allow one , we have to sue them and that can take years .
But even if we got a recount and were able to prove with the paper ballots that the election was electronically stolen , only Congress itself can unseat a Member once they 're sworn in , and they are n't very likely to do that .
They also do n't want to " go there " and they usually dismiss evidence of election fraud without looking at it .
But your first suggestion makes sense .
If there was an election boycott they might try to pad the poll books with phony signatures to make it look as if as many people had voted as the machines produced " votes " for ( that has been done ) , but it is much easier to prove the signatures are phony .
Again , since the courts , the media , and Congress do n't care , the proof is useless .
They have the final say and we do n't .
Think about it .
Article 5 , Section 1 of the Constitution says that Congress itself is the sole judge of the elections , returns , and qualification of its Members .
Theoretically they could swear somebody in without an election even having been held , and then " judge " that the person had been elected .
And only Congress can unseat a Member once they 're sworn in .
We cannot impeach or recall Members of Congress , we just have to wait for the next rigged election and try to vote them out .
( Ha ! )
With Presidential races it is even worse .
Our Constitution does not allow us to vote directly for President or Vice - President .
Supposedly we can vote for electors , but THEIR names are not on the ballot and many of them are appointed rather than elected .
In Bush v. Gore 2000 the Supreme Court said that we have no federal Constitutional right to vote for electors , so it is up to the States .
But even so , Congress can refuse to accept electoral college votes if it wants and the Supreme Court can still intervene , nullify an election , and install whomever they wish , as they did in 2000 .
If elections could change anything , they 'd be illegal .
Do n't vote --- it only encourages 'em .

Well like I have been saying for at least 5 years now , there is only ONE way this crap is ever going to stop and that is with a full blown VIOLENT citizen uprising of at least 75 - 100 Million damn angry and not going to take anymore patriots .
All the peaceful protest , millions of Emails , confrontations , petitions , etc mean absolutely nothing to these people .
They now see that the vast majority of the American citizenry are hopeless , ignorant , easily fooled wimps with all the fight & chutzpah of a bowl of jello .
They know we are going to do nothing so they are going to continue to do whatever they damn well please .
Future elections will continue to be stolen , future laws and bills will continue to be fascist manifesto's and the fascist corporate media will continue to be complicit and cover it up .
The so called democrats are equally as guilty so stop pretending that some democrat in shining armor is going to save us all from ourselves .
So either WTFU American or just accept the fact that we are now a fascist nation run by treasonous war criminals that only work for the top 2 % .
That for some reason I am not sure of is hell bent on total destruction of this country .
Meanwhile as we all sit here contemplating on whom to " email " a shame on you letter or where the next totally non violent " protest " of a few 1000 people will be , they are laughing all the way to WWIII and getting ready to attack Iran where of course China & Russia and probably several others will back them .
If it were n't for my mother which is 91 and refuses to leave then my wife & I would have already left this country years ago .
I am truly embarrassed to be called American anymore .
We all deserve exactly what 's coming .

How many mainstream conservatives have dared to point out what is obvious to anyone having a brain bigger than a chimp's ?
Who'll arrest the perpetrators in this adminisitration and military complex ?
Public opinion would at least remove them from office , absent their tampering with electronic voting machines and / or declaring martial law .
More deeply thinking people know that Bush " won " his re-election through electronic voting machines , as there was no way in hell that those INSIDE perpetrators of September 11th would have risked NOT RETAINING CONTROL after such a bold , risk - taking move .
Electronic voting machines invite voter fraud by both Left and Right -- we ’ve taken the idea “ fairness ” to a new low in the West , which new low I express by amending an old saying : ‘ All is fair in love and war and politics . ’
What the computer scientists have missed is this : voting tabulations are altered remotely , using a hidden transceiver within each critically located machine ( critical states ) .

I lived in Alabama during the Seigelman Administration .

In Birmingham ( Scrushy 's hometown ) the controversy over Scrushy and his own high - handed antics were the talk of the town .
Seigelman was vilified by the holier - than - thou for supporting " gambling " , but it was pretty clear the level of politics in Alabama was about anything other than what the State really needed .
It was all about character assassination .

Ummm we are IN a Police State already , the ONLY thing that will ever change this is 10s of Millions of damn angry patriots taking back this country from the nut jobs that have absconded with it .
If you think for 1 second that ' peaceful " protest will make ANY difference whatsoever with these criminals then you are in a dream world .
they could absolutely not care less .
Whack em up side the head with a bat and I bet you will get their undivided attention .
Burn down Faux Noise and make sure they cant even make a cell phone call anymore and I bet the MSM will straighten right up over night .
It is WAY past time for peaceful anything as these criminals have absolute control of every avenue of regress of grievances .
We are ruled by a ONE party system of treasonous war criminals that have the Supreme Court , All of Congress and the MSM all working for them .
They literally laugh at peaceful protest .
America was not founded by peaceful protest , as a matter of fact NOTHING was ever really accomplished solely through peaceful protest even MLK & Gandhi both accomplished nothing but getting the word out and attaining loyal followers .
It was only when BOTH were assassinated and VIOLENT riots ensued is when things got changed .
Sad as it is , violence is the ONLY answer at this point .
Sooner we get past this " non-violence " BS the better off we will be .
What do you think these nut bags are going to do if 100 Million damn mad & armed patriots stand up and take this country back ?
send in 150,000 Blackwater freaks ?
LOL they would be mowed over in 24 hours .

I had a son disappear in 1998 in Georgia and then he was said to have died in Baldwin County , Alabama .
It took several years to even get police reports from there .
I was told I 'd have to " hire an attorney and get a subpoena . "
It was ridiculous , because those were public records .
Someone else was representing himself as sheriff , named John Garner .
I later found out the sheriff was named Johnson .
When I finally got the autopsy report several years later , the body had descriptions that did not match my son's body .
They did n't tell the truth then , the A.B.I. passed the buck around and I have all of the names and notes recorded .
While my son was being " suicided " in Alabama , I was living in the future Republican Governor Sonny Perdue 's county of Houston , Georgia being intimidated , harassed , and arrested by Georgia police .
It 's as though they did n't want me to attend my child 's funeral or burial services , and made sure I was unable to attend by using the " justice system , " and " law enforcement . "
For a period of 39 days I survived news of a dead child , three jails , committal , and his death , funeral , burial spanning three states , I 've wondered how I survived Georgia and got out of their traps , although I still have nightmares .
All of the false charges against me were thrown out of court , which proves the arrests were used to trash and intimidate , and keep me from attending services for my son .
http://a-loon.blogspot.c...s-in-baldwin-county.html
And yes , I was put in shackles and handcuffs .
It must be a Republican trend in their torture tactics .
Before living in Georgia I had one speeding ticket in my life , going 10 miles over the speed limit .
All of it's connected to Baldwin County , Alabama .
They do n't tell the truth there .
And they have n't told the truth in Georgia , either .
The Republicans took over those states about the same time .
And Baldwin County is Republican .
The only thing I have been able to figure is that the court system , and police are either very ignorant marionettes , or they 're involved in criminal activities with high level politicians and organized criminals intermixed .
It 's a horrible thing to lose a child , but much of it began with the death of another girl in North Carolina when I was a political cartoonist .
Strangely my son disappeared and died with very similar circumstances .
Maybe there 's really a " Dixie Mafia , " tied in with the Boss Hoggs of the South , afterall .
Maybe the politicians needed some new blood and recruited Canary down South for his Republican " businessman " skills .

This is interesting .
If you go to the Dan Abrams site on MSNBC and look at the " Bush League Justice " section which has covered the story of Don Siegelman you 'll notice his name is spelled wrong on all of the video links .
They spell it Siegalman .
This may be a minor mistake , but it does n't make research any easier , does it ?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let 's face it .
Something went down with the unofficial wrh forum and this fricken thread was right in the thick of it .
The fundamental question is do paid spook trolls exist or not ?
Are we to believe that all the trolls are the stereotype of an asocial person in the basement with cheetos dribbling on their shirts ?
At BradBlog today someone named Nunyabiz advocated violence as a means to social change .
He also said , to paraphrase , that civil disobedience means squat .
I did n't know what to say .
Agent99 gives me a deja vu feeling with Tinoire .
I just left one word cointelpro .
It feels like walking on eggshells there .
--------------------------------------------
Now why can he not disagree with a poster without calling them paid shrills or cointelpro ?
What is SUCRATES agenda ?
Does he work for Israel ?
How does one spend 24 hours on the internet and place so many posters from so many forums / blogs into certain groups with not a shred of evidance ?
Why cant a poster say what they want to around this wacko ?
I want to talk about throwing out all the machines but if I do I am called something I am not !
I think SUCKRATES is cointelpro and a paid shrill to stiffel free speach !!!!

I am sorry Agent 99 .
But it is hard to have a discussion when if one poster disagrees then they are called names and it is posted all over the internet .
Even though I hate violence I will defend someones right to having to express thier frustration by comdoning violence .
It is hard to sit back and watch a country die .
So sometimes people feel so frustrated that they think that violence is the only way left to change things .
I do not agree with Nunyabiz but I understand where that poster is coming from after every petition / protest etc I can see why someone would feel that way .
I would like to trow out all the machines and put people to work counting the votes again .
But that will not happen and that is why they are not scared of the people anymore so yes it is frustrating .
Being called cointelpro or paid shrill is also frustrating because it takes away the right to free speach .
Sorry again I will try to mind my manners .

Thanks Redender .
Best to just ignore " Socrates " I think .
I am not " for " Violence per se` however I am also not an idiot and I know when to take the blinders off and smell the bacon .
I have signed every petition out there that is for Impeachment of these criminals , I have protested in several large organized protest the last one of which was in Washington DC Sept 25th 05 ' where there were at least 350,000 MINIMUM of us there .
Briefly CSPAN covered it and said it appeared to be 500,000 + , CNN mentioned us ONCE and said 600,000 after that the only mention was a couple of print media articles that said the police said there were " maybe 100,000 or less " and then proceeded to downplay everything and completely forgotten within 24 hours .
BTW I along with several others were sprayed with " Tularemia bacterium " for our " patriotism " there , I was sick as hell for about 6 - 7 weeks .
8 other people in just the bus I went there in were also sick .
Take a wild guess where that Tularemia came from .
I was interviewed by Mark Benjamin from Salon.com and he said he had spoken to quite a few others that had symptoms .
I personally called the CDC myself and was given nothing but a BS run around .
Even though Salon.com paid for the test to be done I found it almost impossible to be tested for it where I live and as you can see from this article which is what the MSM spewed about it is a complete LIE because there were really lots of us infected , could have been 1000s for all I know because it would have seemed to most like a VERY bad flu .
http://www.washingtonpos.../01/AR2005100101209.html
Same goes for every other large protest I have seen such as Feb 15th I believe it was and I think that was 2003 in NYC with well over 500,000 there and something like 2 MILLION protesting in London and an estimated 15 Million world wide making it a world record massive protest with Bush literally the most HATED individual in human history .
What was covered in our MSM here ?
To my knowledge ABSOLUTELY NOTHING !
I protested around the local Federal courthouse here where I live just 2 weeks ago , nothing in the local paper or news .
There are several city councils across the country that have passed Impeachment resolutions , even some state legislatures .
At least 60 % of the country wants Bush / Cheney impeached and that mind you is even with a total Media blackout of any & all information concerning Election fraud , War Crimes , Crimes against humanity and do n't even get me started about the FACT that 9/11 was clearly orchestrated by some Neofascist faction of this government .
There have been 3 Citizens World Tribunals one consisting of 11 nations which have found Bush / Cheney and others GUILTY of War crimes & crimes against humanity .
What do you hear about in the MSM , unless you are online and know where to look ( like Bradblog ) or lets face it as ignorant Americans even give a crap to bother looking then you would have no idea , because you hear nothing of it .
The Media is flat out LYING to all of us and they are going to continue to do so because there are no consequences , same with Congress .
All these people know that Bush / Cheney the various Neofascist and top 2 % are lying treasonous war criminals .
They literally laugh at peaceful protest and could not care less , we are used as experiments to see how aerosolized bacterium can be dispersed to infect the populace , we are used as chattel , we are drained of every penny to be used for their fascist empire building & their Christian Dominionist insanity of world domination .
Anyone that believes these lunatics can be taken out of power through peaceful means or pretend democracy ( rigged voting ) is seriously delusional .
We have the same chance of doing that as the German people would have protesting Hitler back in the 30s .
Do I " WANT " violence ?
Hell NO !
If I did I would be like them , it is the LAST thing I or any sane human being would want .
But I defy anybody here to come up with a better alternative and say it with a straight face .
There comes a time when you just have to face facts and personally I just do n't see any other viable alternative .
I would like nothing better than to see 10s of Millions of Americans in the streets peacefully protesting , refusing to buy anything except food , turning off the TV completely and stop listening to the lying ass media and take away their broadcasting license on PUBLIC AIRWAVES !
Sadly I have a greater chance of winning the Power ball lottery twice in a row than that ever happening .
I am just being realistic and facing facts , sooner or later all of us will hopefully it wont be too late when you do .

And , Time Magazine published an article entitled " Rove Linked to Prosecution of Ex- Alabama Governor " by Adam Zagorin which touched on a controversial computer glitch : " Though Republican Riley…initially found himself behind by several thousand votes , he had pulled ahead at the last minute when disputed ballots were tallied in his favor .

Unfortunately many people believe that this kind of corruption of justice is simply business as usual in Alabama .
After a century and more of justice for whites and injustice for blacks you can see how the system can morph into supplying injustice for both .
The mechanism is the same just the victims are different .

What happened in Alabama is part of a bigger scheme .
Consider the following which , in essence , was forwarded to the Judiciary Committee on 04/14/2008 : Governor Siegleman is definitely on to something .
I have been tracking developments in the Justice department since September 2001 and have accumulated an abundance of information corroborating the theory that under the Bush Administration , the Justice Department has assumed the purely partisan role of furthering the agenda of the GOP , which is hidden between the lines of the GOP Contract with America .
Moreover , election tampering has become a trend among Republican 's whose theme appears to be " rule by any means necessary . "
Because of the research that I have done , written about and spoken about , while sharing same with members of this administration , I too - a mere citizen with overzealous curiosity , a D.C. law degree and hometown law license - have been targeted by this administration along with numerous other ( 1 ) democrats being prosecuted for corruption , ( 2 ) liberals being set up for internet pornography stings , ( 3 ) Blacks being framed for gun crimes and ( 4 ) all groups listed above being persecuted for " voter fraud , " while the GOP be overlooked with respect to same .
Fortunately , I was saved " by the bell " - AOL telling me that an attempt had been made to frame me with a Trojan Horse virus during the course of a Federal Sting Operation .
The GOP Hacker obviously knew that there was a sting operation going on ; but didnt ' know that this " mark " was out of town and had no access to her internet account accept to check email messages .
At any rate , I fully empathize with the Governor and who knows how many others who unlike me got caught in the wide reaching net .
There is no doubt in my mind that there is a broad and long term strategy to institute a system of Justice in keeping with the concept of the " new world order " wherein , the only people entitled to civil rights , will be ( Just ) Us - one reactionary right wing party .
I write about this because I am afraid and concerned for me , mine and everyone I know who is being censored by any means necessary , during this modern day Inquisition .
I am but one blade in the grass and yet , I am quite vocal about the results of my research since September 2001 and thus , I have become enough of a threat to the " powers that obviously be " that someone privy to Justice Department plans for a sting operation , would literally attempt to frame me for a crime .
Now , that 's scary !
I especially fear for my son who is growing up in a world where the police , prosecutors , and right wing judges have already pre-determined his fate .
Meanwhile right wing 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) interests groups , continue to lobby for lawmakers and legislation , who and which will pass the litmus test of eroding the constitution and criminalizing anyone other than " Just US " - meaning those who seek to stack the legislature , the courts , the prosecutors office and the police departments to administer Injustice for many but not all .
It comes as no surprise that the GOP would resort to any means necessary to defame a Democratic Governor .
After all " they wanted the Governor 's seat . "

Nunyabiz , I do understand what you are saying especially after what you went through just for protesting .
That is horrible being sprayed with that stuff .
Now do the rest of the posters here understand why Nunyabiz said what he / she did ?
I recieved another email petition today regarding the senate voting about paper ballots on the 15th of this month , well a while back I found out that any petition has to be signed in person other wise it is considered trash mail !
So really what can we do ?
We are watching our country die and we are watching people here being starved to death just like the Palastianians are .
It seems they like a slow death at this point but I think that will change . \
Someone here said that Obama will change things but I hear him say he pledges to the same ones that all the rest are pledging to .
So I dont think any of them will change one thing .
So yes the question is just what does have to happen to save not just us but the world ?

They all are working for someone else not us the people !
So really just listen to them all they all say they will attack Iran .
They all say the same tripe .
If we are going to change things it will not be through any of them .
THEY ARE NOT WORRKING FOR US THE PEOPLE !
Obama , Clinton or McCain will not save this country they are all part and parcel of its destruction .

I would hope that fact is pretty clear to anyone these days .
I could not care less what democrats " say " as much as what they " do " and what the majority of them do is full blown Reich wing crap .
They can not possibly believe that their constituents want ANY of the things they are doing .
What they are doing is solely for themselves & the top 2 % along with the Neofascist .
The main difference between Obama / Clinton Vs McCain is that the democrats have to LIE more in order to fool the idiots voting for them whereas McCain can be as utterly insane as he wants because his base is stark raving mad .

A study released in February by ACEEE evaluated a suite of energy efficiency policies for Maryland and found that more than enough energy efficiency resources exist in the state to meet Governor O'Malley 's ambitious 15 by ' 15 goal , and confirmed that reducing electricity consumption is the quickest , cheapest , and cleanest way for policymakers to bring consumer bills down and keep the lights on in the state .
Two of the bills are key to meeting the Governor 's goals .
The first codifies the goal of reducing per capita electricity consumption 15 percent by 2015 .
This target , known as an energy efficiency resource standard , will require the state 's electric utilities to achieve 10 % savings by 2015 and the Maryland Energy Administration ( MEA ) to oversee programs to meet the remaining 5 % .
The second bill establishes a Strategic Energy Investment Fund supported by the proceeds of upcoming auctions of the state 's carbon dioxide emission allowances and administered by MEA .
About half of this new fund , which is expected to reach $ 100 million or more per year , is to be expended on programs to reduce energy consumption , including low - and moderate - income electric customers .
In addition , the General Assembly passed a bill that requires energy - efficient and environmentally friendly design and materials for new state buildings and public schools , and a separate bill that boosts the state 's renewable portfolio standard ( a target for the portion of the state 's energy derived from wind , solar , and other renewable sources ) to 20 percent by 2022 .
Among all the possible energy resources available to the state , energy efficiency is the least - cost and the quickest to deploy , " said Maggie Eldridge , ACEEE 's State Team Leader .
" By committing to investing in energy efficiency , Maryland can meet its future electricity needs while containing energy costs for the state 's consumers .
This legislation is an extremely smart investment for all Marylanders .
ACEEE 's analysis shows that the benefits of energy efficiency include lower consumer electric bills , improved system reliability , significant job and economic development in the state , and reduced pollution .
Our analysis of policy options available to Maryland identified potential net consumer electric bill savings of about $ 900 million and over 8,000 new in - state jobs in 2015 , " said Eldridge .
" The provisions included in this year 's energy legislation and last year 's appliance efficiency standards address about 90 % of the efficiency savings that we identified .
Helping consumers save energy means helping families reduce their electric bills , said Ed Osann , Senior Associate with ACEEE .
We commend the General Assembly for answering the Governor 's call to help Marylanders make their energy use more efficient .
The foundation for a more energy - efficient Maryland is now in place , said Neal Elliott , ACEEE 's Associate Director for Research .
" ACEEE looks forward to working with the Maryland Energy Administration , the Public Service Commission , utilities , and consumers as new programs are developed that will achieve these ambitious goals .
Based on our work with leading energy efficiency programs across the country , we are confident that Maryland can succeed . "

The Bush Team's Geneva Hypocrisy Newly released U.S. government documents , detailing how Bush administration officials punched legalistic holes in the Geneva Convention ’s protections of war captives , stand in stark contrast to the outrage some of the same officials expressed in the first week of the Iraq War when Iraqi TV interviewed several captured American soldiers .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly Then , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , President George W. Bush and other administration officials orchestrated a chorus of outrage , citing those TV scenes as proof of the Iraq ’s government contempt for international law in general and the Geneva Convention in particular .
“ It is a blatant violation of the Geneva Convention to humiliate and abuse prisoners of war or to harm them in any way .
As President Bush said yesterday , those who harm POWs will be found and punished as war criminals , ” Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said on March 24 , 2003 .
That same day , Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told the BBC that “ the Geneva Convention is very clear on the rules for treating prisoners .
They 're not supposed to be tortured or abused , they 're not supposed to be intimidated , they 're not supposed to be made public displays of humiliation or insult , and we 're going to be in a position to hold those Iraqi officials who are mistreating our prisoners accountable , and they 've got to stop . ”
At a March 25 , 2003 , press briefing about progress in the U.S. - led invasion , Secretary Rumfeld said , “ This war is an act of self defense , to be sure , but it is also an act of humanity .
…
In recent days , the world has witnessed further evidence of their [ Iraqi ] brutality and their disregard for the laws of war .
Their treatment of coalition POWs is a violation of the Geneva Conventions . ”
The U.S. news media also assisted in this one - sided indictment by uncritically reporting the administration ’s complaints while staying silent on the fact that just days earlier , American TV had run scenes of captured Iraqi soldiers , some forced to kneel down at gunpoint to be patted down by U.S. soldiers .
This behavior of the U.S. news media during the early phase of the Iraq
War fit with its lack of skepticism in the months leading up to the March 19 , 2003 , invasion as Bush administration officials spoon - fed the press false intelligence alleging secret Iraqi WMD stockpiles and covert links to al - Qaeda terrorists responsible for the 9/11 attacks .
So , perhaps it should have come as no surprise when the U.S. news media treated the TV footage of American POWs as further evidence that Iraq was run by a lawless regime with no respect for the rules of war .
[ For a contemporaneous account of the POW issue , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ International Law a la Carte . ” ]
Stunning Hypocrisy
In retrospect – now with much more of the documentary record available – the disparity between the administration ’s outrage toward the Iraqis for showing the video and the abuse inflicted by the U.S. government on captives from the Iraq and Afghan wars is stunning .
Declassified documents reveal that the Bush administration concocted legal theories to justify sidestepping the Geneva Convention when it came to prisoners incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay , at secret CIA prisons and at various locations in Iraq , including Abu Ghraib where shocking photos were leaked of sexual and physical abuse in 2004 .
Indeed , while U.S. government officials were preaching to Iraqis about the rules of war , the Bush administration was seven months into a secret interrogation program that authorized CIA interrogators to question Afghan and al - Qaeda detainees using brutal methods .
The techniques included painful “ stress positions , ” forced nudity in cold conditions and the simulated drowning of waterboarding , practices that human rights organizations say violated Geneva and anti-torture laws .
The Bush administration also ordered the CIA to engage in “ extraordinary renditions , ” which involved kidnapping terror suspects and shipping them to countries that are known to practice torture .
If held to the same standards that the Bush administration demanded of the Iraqi military , U.S. officials implicated in these policies would be guilty of violating the Geneva Convention , said Claire Tixeire , a " human rights fellow " with the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York and an attorney .
“ They clearly knew that the laws of war were supposed to apply to prisoners apprehended by the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq , but they found every legal loophole to find ways it did n't apply to the U.S. side , ” Tixeire said in an interview .
Tixeire , whose organization is defending some of the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay , said that while U.S. officials may have had a point in accusing the Iraqi military of violating the Geneva Convention over the TV interviews , the way the U.S. treated Iraqi captives was much worse .
“ It ’s clear to me these actions came down from the very top , ” Tixeire said .
“ Denying prisoners of war humane treatment is a grave breach of the Geneva Convention .
It 's a war crime .
They put U.S. troops at risk for being treated inhumanely if they were captured . ”
When asked recently about the past statements about Iraqi violations of the Geneva Convention , representatives for Clarke , Wolfowitz and Rumsfeld said the now - former officials would not comment for this story .
Anti-Torture Laws
The actions of the Bush administration also flouted the 1984 " Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , " which was approved by 145 nations , including the United States .
It declares that : " No exceptional circumstances whatsoever , whether a state of war or a threat of war , internal political instability or any other public emergency , may be invoked as a justification of torture . "
Moreover , the convention says individuals who resort to torture cannot defend their actions by saying they were acting on orders from superiors and it mandates that torturers be prosecuted wherever they are found .
The United States signed the Convention Against Torture in 1988 under President Ronald Reagan , who hailed it as “ a significant step ” in preventing torture , which he called “ an abhorrent practice unfortunately still prevalent in the world today . ”
In a May 20 , 1988 , message to the U.S. Senate , Reagan noted that “ the core provisions of the Convention establish a regime for international cooperation in the criminal prosecution of torturers relying on so - called ‘ universal jurisdiction . ’ ”
According to that provision , “ each state party is required either to prosecute torturers who are found in its territory or to extradite them to other countries for prosecution . ”
It was this Convention , ratified by the Senate in 1994 , that Bush administration officials sought to bypass with legal memos , many drafted by John Yoo of the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel .
The administration memos argued that the Geneva Convention did not apply to detainees in the “ war on terror ” and that President Bush ’s commander - in - chief powers allowed him to ignore laws in the interest of protecting the nation .
The record now shows that during the same week in March 2003 – when Rumsfeld was publicly berating Iraq for violating the Geneva Convention by broadcasting footage of American POW ’s – he was engaged in drafting a top - secret plan that would give military interrogators at Guantanamo wide latitude to use harsher techniques to obtain information from prisoners .
Rumsfeld signed off on the plan on April 2 , 2003 , according to documents declassified and turned over to the American Civil Liberties Union last month in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit .
Though some of the more extreme techniques were dropped as the list was winnowed down to 24 from 35 , the final set of interrogation methods Rumsfeld approved still included tactics for isolating and demeaning a detainee , known as " pride and ego down . "
Such degrading tactics would appear to contravene the Geneva Convention , which bars abusive or demeaning treatment of captives .
Reports of Abuse Weeks after the Iraq invasion , human rights groups started receiving information about the abuse of dozens of Iraqi prisoners at Camp Cropper , Camp Bucca and Abu Ghraib , and the deaths of two prisoners , one of whom died of a crushed larynx , and the other with a hard blow to the head .
Amnesty International sent a letter to the head of the U.S. occupation , Paul Bremer , on June 26 , 2003 , raising concerns about abuses during house searches , treatment during arrest and detention , people being forced to lie face down on the ground ; use of hoods or blind folds , exposure to sun and heat for hours , limited amount of water supplied , and lack of proper washing and toilet facilities .
One month later , Amnesty International released a report , " Iraq : memorandum on concerns relating to law and order , " warning of allegations of torture and abuse in U.S. prisons , including Abu Ghraib .
" Regrettably , testimonies from recently released detainees held at Camp Cropper and Abu Ghraib Prison do not suggest that conditions of detention have improved , " the report said .
There are " a number of reports of cases of detainees who have died in custody , mostly as a result of shooting by members of the Coalition forces . "
A Saudi national " alleged that he was subjected to beatings and electric shocks . "
Photographs backing up these allegations would surface a year later in two investigative news reports , one by Seymour Hersh of The New Yorker and the other by " 60 Minutes II , " which detailed the systematic abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib .
Months before the worldwide condemnation of the treatment of the Abu Ghraib prisoners , Rumsfeld sent Maj. Gen. Geoffrey D. Miller was sent to Baghdad from Guantanamo Bay to “ hit back at the [ Iraqi ] insurgents ... through unorthodox means , ” according to a May 10 , 2004 , front - page story in the Washington Post .
" He came up there and told me he was going to ' Gitmoize ' the detention operation , " turning it into a hub of interrogation , said Brig .
Gen. Janis L. Karpinski , then commander of the military prison system in Iraq , according to the Post .
Hersh wrote in The New Yorker ’s May 24 , 2004 , issue that “ the roots of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal lie not in the criminal inclinations of a few Army reservists but in a decision , approved last year [ 2003 ] by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , to expand a highly secret operation , which had been focused on the hunt for Al Qaeda , to the interrogation of prisoners in Iraq . …
“ The solution , endorsed by Rumsfeld and carried out by Stephen Cambone , was to get tough with those Iraqis in the Army prison system who were suspected of being insurgents .
… Rumsfeld and Cambone went a step further , [ bringing ] unconventional methods to Abu Ghraib . …
The male prisoners could be treated roughly , and exposed to sexual humiliation . ”
Tarnished Image
Amrit Singh , a staff attorney at the ACLU ’s Immigrant Rights Project and the co-author of Administration of Torture , added that Rumsfeld and other top Bush administration officials by “ holding up the Geneva Convention and saying it did not apply to some prisoners have tarnished the image of the U.S. throughout the world . ”
Even after the programs governing interrogations were exposed , Rumsfeld made sure that a loophole in a new Defense Department policy issued in November 2005 , which barred torture and called for the " humane " treatment of detainees , gave him and his deputy the authority to override it .
" Intelligence interrogations will be conducted in accordance with applicable law , this directive and implementing plans , policies , orders , directives , and doctrine developed by DoD components and approved by USD ( I ) , unless otherwise authorized , in writing , by the secretary of defense or deputy secretary of defense , " the policy says .
" USD ( I ) " refers to the undersecretary of defense for intelligence .
Rumsfeld resigned in November 2006 .

Back to Home Page
It was back in 1993 when Stanford endocrinologist David Feldman accidentally backed into his startling discovery : potentially dangerous molecules known as bisphenol A , or BPA , were leaching from the plastic flasks he and his colleagues were using for experiments .
“ We were growing yeast in the flask to see if we could find estrogenic molecules , ” said Feldman , who was doing experiments on steroid hormones like estrogen .
They found them , but not where they expected .
After sterilizing the empty flask with very high heat and pressure , Feldman said he “ discovered the molecules must be leeching from the plastic , because they were n’t coming from the yeast . ”
No one paid much attention .
But 15 years – and billions of plastic bottles – later , Feldman ’s discovery seems downright ominous .
Wal - Mart recently announced it will stop selling baby bottles containing BPA early next year , and Nalgene announced it will phase out production of its hard - plastic sports bottles that contain BPA .
Governments are also taking notice – Canada placed exposure limits on the chemical , calling it “ toxic ” to human health .
And federal toxicology investigators in the United States recently concluded there is “ some concern ” that fetuses , infants and children may be harmed by BPA , commonly found in juice bottles , campers ’ water containers and even that icon of the modern cubicle world – the office water cooler .
The FDA , meanwhile , says it has found no links between BPA and health problems .
The problem , Feldman said , is polycarbonate , the clear , sturdy plastic found in thousands of items on grocery - store shelves , including food cans lined with polycarbonate - laced epoxy resin .
And it all first surfaced when Feldman heated that plastic flask in his lab .
“ That set off an alarm in my head , ” he said .
“ Because when BPA was first synthesized , it was known to be structurally connected to DES , or diethylstilbestrol .
And 20 years after mothers had been treated with DES to prevent miscarriages , some of their grown children were developing vaginal cancers from that therapy . ”
The repercussions of what Feldman and research associates Aruna Krishnan and Lazlo Tokes had stumbled upon by accident were alarming .
Since BPA leaches from the plastic when it ’s sterilized and perhaps when washed with certain detergents , the potential for health risks could be immense , even though industry groups say there are no serious health risks associated with plastic bottles containing BPA .
“ I ’m not an alarmist , and I ’m not saying that drinking from plastic bottles will cause breast cancer , ” said Feldman , who advises his own children not to put plastic containers in the microwave or dishwasher and to limit the amount of canned foods they consume .
“ But I am worried about the effects of BPA on babies , expectant mothers and fetuses .
To me , it ’s better to be safe than sorry , and we should at least know when people are exposed to this . ”
So why did it take 15 years for the world to notice ?
“ Our discovery was a big deal at first , even in Japan , ” said Feldman , who at a 1994 symposium in Washington , D.C. , presented a paper titled “ Estrogens in Unexpected Places : Possible Implications for Researchers and Consumers . ”
Feldman said that while many other scientists built upon his research and continue to this day to explore the effects of BPA , initial attempts to push the industry to do more studies and implement safeguards came slowly .
“ Why did n’t it move faster ?
Politics , I think .
There ’s a lot of money involved .
Billions of pounds of this stuff is being made , ” he said .
“ So there ’s not much incentive by industry to do anything .
And scientists can only say so much . ”
Feldman , who at 69 is still at Stanford but no longer researching BPA , said he ’s encouraged by the growing precautions taken by industry and government , even if a clear link between health risks and BPA in polycarbonate and perhaps other kinds of plastic has not been conclusively established .
“ Maybe the BPA does n’t hurt us or kill us , ” he said .
“ But there have been studies where mice and rats are exposed to it , and they ’re finding changes in their prostate and breast tissue .
The question is , how does that translate into human use ?
And we do n’t yet know the answer . ”
His comments caused a selloff in the stock marketand arally in the bond market .
" Among the largest banks , the capital ratios remain good and I do n't anticipate any serious problems of that sort among the large , internationally active banks that make up a very
substantial part of our banking system , '' he said in response to a question during semi-annual congressional testimony .
Big U.S. banks have already raised billions of dollars of
fresh capital to make good on losses on subprime mortgages ,
often by tapping foreign investors .
Bernanke said that he hoped this trend would continue in order to bolster lending .
" They have already sought something of the order of $ 75 billion of capital in the last quarter .
I would like to see them get more , " Bernanke said .
" They have enough now certainly to remain solvent and remain ... well above their minimum capital levels .
But I am concerned that banks will be pulling back and not making new
loans and providing the credit which is the lifeblood of the economy .
In order to be able to do that ... in some cases at least , they need to get more capital , " Bernanke added .
Bernanke also said the nation is " not anywhere near " the dangerous stagflation situation that prevailed in the 1970s .
With the economy slowing and inflation rising , fears have grown that the country could be headed for the dreaded twin evils of stagnant growth and rising prices known as " stagflation . "
" I do n't anticipate stagflation , " Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee .
Still , high energy prices and rising inflation does complicate the Fed 's job of trying to keep the economy growing and inflation contained , Bernanke acknowledged .
High energy prices are creating " inflationary stress , " Bernanke said .
And , that is " complicating " the Fed 's work in terms of shoring up the economy , the Fed chief said .
President Bush , at a news conference Thursday , noted the slow economic growth but said the nation is n't headed into a recession .
He rejected calls for additional stimulus efforts , instead advising patience .
" Why do n't we let stimulus package one , which seemed like a good idea at the time , have a chance to kick in ? "
Bush said at the White House .
Bernanke 's testimony in the Senate caps back - to - back appearances on Capitol Hill that started in the House on Wednesday .
The Fed chief 's overarching economic message was the same on both days :
The Fed stands ready to lower a key interest rate yet again to bolster the struggling economy .
Many fear the country is hurtling toward a recession or is in one already .
The central bank started lowering a key interest rate in September .
Over just eight days in January , the Fed shaved 1.25 percentage points , the biggest one - month reduction in a quarter century .
Economists and Wall Street investors predict the Fed will cut rates again at its next meeting , March 18 .
Just before Bernanke testified , the government reported that the economy nearly stalled in the final quarter of last year .
It grew at a pace of just 0.6 percent , a big loss of momentum compared with the prior quarter 's brisk 4.9 percent growth rate .
Bernanke indicated he is prepared to lower rates even as high oil prices heighten inflation risks .
Dale and Leilani Neumann did not get medical help for their daughter 's diabetes .
April 28 , 2008  --
Parents who prayed as their 11 - year - old daughter died of untreated diabetes will be charged with second - degree reckless homicide , the Marathon County district attorney said Monday .
" The failure to seek medical intervention created an unreasonable and substantial risk of death or great bodily harm , " District Attorney Jill Falstad said .
She announced the charges Monday during a news conference at the Everest Metro Police Department with Police Chief Dan Vergin .
Vergin has said Dale and Leilani Neumann told investigators their daughter Madeline last saw a doctor when she was 3 to get some shots .
The couple face up to 25 years in prison if convicted .
Madeline - called Kara by her parents - died Easter Sunday at the family 's rural Weston home .
An autopsy determined she died from undiagnosed diabetic ketoacidosis , an ailment that left her with too little insulin in her body .
The couple 's lawyer did not immediately return a message left by The Associated Press .
Leilani Neumann , 40 , told AP previously she never expected her daughter to die .
The family believes in the Bible , which says healing comes from God , but they are not crazy , religious people and have nothing against doctors , she said .
Dale Neumann , a former police officer , has said he has friends who are doctors .
He started CPR " as soon as the breath of life left " his daughter 's body , he said .
Madeline , a straight - A student who was being home - schooled , was in good health until she started getting tired about two weeks before she died , her mother has said .
When the situation got worse over Easter weekend , " we stayed fast in prayer then , " Leilani Neumann said .
" We believed that she would recover . "
According to a search warrant request , the girl 's grandmother told investigators she had been ill for several days , was " very tired , " and wanted to be held by her mother .
By March 22 , Madeline could n't walk or talk , her grandmother said .
The grandmother said she told Leilani Neumann to take the girl to the doctor but the mother said her daughter " would be fine and God would heal her , " the court record said .
The grandmother eventually contacted a daughter - in - law in California , who called police on a non-emergency line to report the girl was in a coma and needed medical help .
An ambulance was dispatched to the home shortly before some friends in the home called 911 to report the girl had stopped breathing , authorities said .
The Neumanns said they moved to Weston , a suburb of Wausau in central Wisconsin , from California about two years ago to open a coffee shop and be closer to other relatives .
The couple has three other children , ages 13 to 16 .
The family does not belong to an organized religion or faith , Leilani Neumann has said .
In March , an Oregon couple who belong to a church that preaches against medical care and believes in treating illness with prayer were charged with manslaughter and criminal mistreatment in the death of their 15 - month - old daughter .
The toddler died March 2 of bronchial pneumonia and a blood infection that could have been treated with antibiotics , the state medical examiner 's office said .
In Oregon , laws passed in the 1990s struck down legal shields for faith - healing parents after the deaths of several children whose parents were members of a fundamentalist church .
Last week I wrote about why I do n’t ( illegally ) download music .
One great reason that did n’t even make my list , is that there is already a lot of free stuff .
There are enough legal ways to get free stuff , that pirating the latest software or CD is n’t necessary .
Here are just a few of the free alternatives to some of the things you might already be paying for :
1 ) Use the Library Instead of Bookstores
I recently made the switch from buying most of my books to reading them for free .
Two years ago I lived in a small town , where the public library did n’t have a wide selection .
As a result I got used to buying my books instead of renting .
Books might not be a big expense , but if you end up reading 50 - 70 books each year , the cost can quickly add up .
2) Free & Legal Music Instead of CD ’s and iTunes
As I wrote earlier , I ’m not a fan of downloading music for free without the artist ’s consent .
I ’ve tried to do my best with this , but it was only in the last several months I became proactive in doing this .
In the past I had occasionally come across free samples over the net from questionable sources , but never took a firm stance to keep it off my hard drive .
One of the things that helped me stay committed to keeping my library legitimate , was the discovery of all the different sources of free & legal music on the net .
Here are a few ways you can explore a large amount of music for free without becoming a pirate :
Pandora –
This internet radio has a near infinite music variety that can be tuned to your individual preferences .
This was my method of choice until they stopped offering access to Canadians .
( ouch ! ) Download.com – Both streams and downloads of free music .
Internet Radio –
There are many free internet radio stations .
And if you ’re away from your PC , good ol ’ AM and FM work as well .
Tracked Music –
An entire genre of free music .
You can get a free player here and download music here .
I have nearly 500 tracks on my playlist .
3 ) Blogs Instead of Magazines / Newspapers
I ’m sure I do n’t need to tell you this one .
Blogs can offer you access to tips , ideas and news on a daily basis without costing you a penny .
Many offline publications are now starting to head into cyberspace , so I do n’t think it will be long until almost all publications are free .
4 ) Open Source Instead of Microsoft
I use mostly open source and freeware software for my computing needs .
Open source benefits by being cheaper and often more flexible than traditional software .
Here are a few alternatives you might want to try :
OpenOffice instead of Microsoft Office – Powerpoint , Excel , Word and Access all have OpenOffice equivalents .
A great program that does n’t cost you a cent .
Firefox instead of Internet Explorer Thunderbird instead of Outlook Linux instead of Windows GIMP instead of Photoshop WordPress instead of Typepad
5 ) OpenCourseWare Instead of Paying Tuition
OpenCourseWare is an initiative where major universities are starting to release their classes online for free .
MIT has one of the biggest catalogs of courses at the moment .
I ’ve already gone through a few of the courses online .
The perfect resource for the person who wants an education without student debt .
6 ) TED Talks Instead of Seminars .
TED has hundreds of 10 - 20 minute speeches posted online for free .
Great speakers include Bill Clinton , Will Wright , Richard Dawkins , Daniel Gilbert and Ray Kurzweil .
The topics range from the issues of global warming to discovering what makes us happy .
7 ) Home Exercise Instead of Gym Memberships
Running is free .
So are push ups , sit ups and stretches .
You do n’t need to go broke on fancy sports club memberships and exercise equipment to stay healthy .
Keeping your exercise plan simple can actually make it easier to stick with .
8 ) Tap Water Instead of Bottles
When you buy bottled water , you ’re paying for the picture of a rainforest on the bottle .
There is virtually no difference between water from your faucet and one in a 2 $ bottle .
If you think there is a difference in taste , I suggest putting it to the test :
Buy your favorite bottled water and get some tap water .
Pour three cups of each and get a friend to mark the cups , so they will know which is bottled , but you wo n’t .
Drink from each of them and write down the ones you like best .
I ’m skeptical that most people could even tell the difference .
Save creating more garbage and save yourself some money and drink from the tap .
9 ) Skype Instead of Telephones
With Skype you can get free ( or nearly free ) telephone capabilities with your computer .
Save on those long - distance bills by going digital .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Record - high U.S. corn prices are on a bullish path that could heighten tensions over global food inflation woes and give further ammunition to critics of using grain to make the renewable fuel ethanol .

High food prices have sparked riots in several African countries , as well as Indonesia and the Philippines .
The food situation toppled the government in Haiti last week when senators fired the prime minister after a week of riots .
The pace of seeding the corn crop in the United States is off to a slow start due to rains and soggy fields , and farmers have scaled back the number of acres to be planted with corn this spring as they switch more land to high - priced soybeans .
There is also the weak dollar , which has bolstered U.S. exports , and a three - week Argentina farm strike which has tarnished that country ’s reputation as a reliable supplier .
Chicago Board of Trade corn futures for the spot month , May , were around $ 6.03 per bushel on Wednesday morning , up more than 50 percent from a year ago .
“ It will be much easier to get out to the $ 7.00 to $ 8.00 ( a bushel ) level than back down to the $ 4.00 or $ 5.00 level , ” said Bill Nelson , grain analyst for Wachovia Securities .
“ By miracle if we started reversing , and the dollar started rallying , then maybe it would be a little easier to talk about the lower levels .
In our trading plans we ’re bullish on corn . ”
Further gains in corn prices could hurt the bottom line of poultry and livestock producers , and raise meat prices .
Chicken producer Pilgrim ’s Pride Corp on Monday said it was cutting production for the second time in a month due to high feed costs .
Its share prices rose as investors were pleased that reduced supply would drive up meat prices .
U.S. farmers are projected to plant roughly 7 million fewer acres of corn this year than in 2007 when soaring prices prompted the largest corn area in more than 60 years , at 93 million acres .
A key reason for the surge in corn acres last year was demand from the ethanol sector , which will consume about 25 percent of this year ’s estimated 13.1 billion - bushel corn crop .
USDA DEFENDS BIOFUEL POLICY
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer on Tuesday addressed criticism that the use of corn for biofuel was fueling global food inflation , telling CNBC that “ energy is the big issue as we look at those food prices . ”
He later told Reuters during a visit to the CBOT that he expected no shift in the current biofuels policy .
“ I think the capacity right now is such to where changes in the target gallons ( of ethanol ) is n’t going to make any difference in the marketplace , ” Schafer said .
Grain analysts said there will be no margin for error when it comes to crop weather this year , with a continued wet spring or hot and dry summer during the key crop development stage likely to lift prices .
“ With bad weather you could have $ 8.00 per bushel new - crop December corn ... it ’s pretty much weather right now , ” said Paul Haugens , vice - president for Newedge Trading .
A veteran of the cash grains and futures markets , Haugens saw little reason for the corn markets to weaken as global demand for feed , food and fuel remains on the boil .
CBOT corn futures soared to a record high $ 6.43 per bushel this week and the bellwether new - crop December contract leaped to a contract high of $ 6.29 per bushel .
Farmers in the United States plant the corn crop in the spring and begin harvesting the grain roughly in late October and November .
A big portion of the crop is sold or hedged on the CBOT December corn futures contract .
A wet spring has led to concerns about reduced plantings and / or lower corn yields per acre , and more rain is expected .
This season , high soy prices are stealing acres from corn .
“ The ratio of new - crop beans to corn had dropped below 2 , so I think the corn market was kind of frantic to buy back a couple million acres ; I really think we need more acres than that , ” Nelson said .
Usage of corn in the United States remains strong as livestock and poultry feeders compete with the energy sector for supply , which is now large at more than a billion bushels .
But domestic demand , coupled with exports , could quickly drain supplies to critically low levels by summer of 2009 summer .
“ If you benchmark on the 86 million acres , it basically runs you out of corn by the summer of 2009 .
Of course it wo n’t go to zero , but basically you have to ration demand to correspond with the limited supply , ” Nelson said .
“ The food - versus - fuel battle is going to get bigger and it ’s a political year in the United States so I do n’t see anyone making any changes ( to ethanol policy ) , ” Haugens said .

Welcome to " The Room "
The subscribers - only home page of Casey Research Written : April 11 , 2008 Dear Readers ,
No question about it , we humans like to keep things simple .
And no wonder ; if the world is anything , it is chaotic .
And so we look for our philosophy in un-taxing nuggets , the sort , perhaps , that might grace the back of a cereal box , be squeezed onto a bumper sticker or unfold fully contained in a 5 - second sound byte on the evening news .
� Ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your country � pops to mind .
As does , � You are either with us , or against us . �
But few hold a candle to , � From each according to his abilities , to each according to his needs . �
Thus wrote Karl Marx , by reliable accounts a penniless , unpopular , slovenly loser throughout the entirety of his miserable existence .
Yet , avoiding any deep contemplation , the masses gravitated to his slogan , resulting in hundreds of millions of deaths and untold misery that carries forward even to this day .
This willingness , nay , rush , to unthinkingly embrace the simplistic is very possibly coded into our DNA .
And for good reason .
After all , if our club - bearing ancestors had paused to inquire more closely into the root reason that the rest of their hunting group was running screaming from the large growling sound emanating from a nearby bush , then we wouldn�t be having this chat today .
Instead , they took the cue and dedicated themselves to outrunning their companions ( a race that our very presence here today attests they won ) .
Millennia of similar experience , and the need to efficiently sort through the daily onslaught of input our poor minds receive , has resulted in a tendency by humans to think in one of two ways , depending on our individual temperaments and the need at hand .
The first form of thinking is cue - based , or heuristic .
The second is termed �systematic .�
To understand the difference , consider the process you might go through when looking for a new computer .
You could do all the hard research yourself ; that would be thinking systematically � or you could simply pick up the current edition of some suitable buyer�s guide and flip straight to the � Best of 2008 � award and you are done .
While we all think in both modes , most tend to shift between the two , some more frequently than others .
And because it is more difficult , most of us look to reduce the amount of systematic thinking we are required to do by delegating that responsibility to those who are good at that sort of thing .
For example , we might pay an accountant to do our taxes .
Likewise , if you are collared for some real or imaginary offense , you could immerse yourself in all the various case laws that apply to your situation , or you could pick up the phone to call a lawyer .
In my view , it is essential in this modern age to keep this aspect of our human nature in clear perspective as you listen to all the electioneering , posturing and pontificating that now competes for your daily attention .
Or , put another way , when confronted with convenient explanations or fine - sounding platitudes , make a concentrated effort to shift into systematic thinking mode .
While I could point to literally hundreds of jingoistic but empty ideas floating through the ether just now , our globe - trotting chairman Doug Casey has just written in from Argentina with a good example , one that has specific relevance to us as investors .
Namely that today�s inflation is being caused by rising commodity prices .
Rising Commodity Prices and Inflation By Doug Casey
Many people blame inflation on higher prices of gasoline , wheat , copper , or what have you .
This is an old , idiotic , and tragic economic fallacy .
It �s idiotic because it confuses the consequences of currency inflation with its cause .
And tragic because it blames inflation on those who produce real wealth , as opposed to the government , which is the actual cause .
In today�s world , governments , through the central banks , control the amount of money in existence .
If they double the money supply , the general price level would double .
Of course not everything rises at the same rate .
Since inflation initially makes people feel richer , perhaps the prices of Ferraris would go up a lot � but the prices of old Chevys would drop � who wants old cars when loans are out there for a new one ?
If the money supply is stable , and one commodity goes up a lot , the price of others must drop � the general price level , in terms of dollars , stays the same .
Inflation causes people to save less .
That means there�s less capital to invest for new production , even while it encourages more consumption now ( to beat anticipated higher prices ) .
This is the main reason inflation causes the standard of living to drop � in addition to causing the business cycle .
Bad Speculators David again , though continuing on the same theme .
This morning I heard an interview between a National Public Radio host and Robert Zoellick , head of the World Bank , about that august body�s recently released report on rising food prices and the social unrest now beginning to break out as a result .
I have to say , while I tend to be very skeptical of supra- organizations such as the World Bank , Zoellick impressed me as a reasonable man when he failed to rise to the bait of the interviewer who must have asked the same question 5 times , along the lines of � How much are speculators having to do with the food price run up ?�
It was only after much more of the same that the conversation turned to the actual biggest culprit identified in the World Bank survey ; the shift toward redirecting food crops , and the land used to grow same , to the production of biofuels .
A misallocation that would not have been made without government mandates and massive subsidies .
I recently read a pretty good book on the history of the U.S. dust bowl that has become iconic , along with soup lines , of the Great Depression of the 1930s .
The book , titled The Worst Hard Time , was quite revealing � for example , of the stubborn optimism of certain people who -- despite year after year of failed crops and dusters that would cover the floors of their shacks in a foot of fine dust , kill the cattle and even close family members -- refused to move away , figuring it couldn�t last forever .
If , in fact , they had done a systematic evaluation of the climate of the dissected areas where they had been encouraged with free land by the government to set up their farms in order to meet global food demands triggered by World War I , they would have found that drought in the Texas panhandle is the norm , not the exception .
In the latter years of the disaster , the Roosevelt administration commissioned an extensive study to reveal what had gone wrong .
According to the author , Roosevelt and his merry men expected to find it was caused by climate change coupled with excessive speculation .
What the study�s leader eventually reported , however , was far less pleasing : it was the government�s own well - intentioned but poorly considered machinations that were behind the dust bowl .
That �s because without the subsidies , the mass migration to an area that was climatologically ill suited to agriculture would never have happened .
Not one to suffer second guessing , Roosevelt pretty much disregarded the study .
In fact , he went further and , disregarding the whole �climatologically ill suited to agriculture� part , attempted to solve the problem by ordering the planting of millions of trees � virtually all of which quickly died .
But back to the present .
As food prices rise , along with virtually everything else , the sloganeering and rhetoric are going to reach a shrill pitch .
The government will begin to point the finger at anyone and anything other than the real causes , starting no doubt with �speculators , � who will be portrayed in the same light as war profiteers .
The practical implications of this -- other than stirring up the class warfare so fondly anticipated by Marx as he sat in his grubby chair scrawling a screed against the capitalists -- will be to unleash any number of government �solutions � that will sound high minded , but lead to low results .
Price controls � interference in the free flow of foreign capital� trade sanctions � changes in margin requirements for commodities accounts � higher capital gains taxes .
It �s all coming .
At our recent Scottsdale Summit , one of the more memorable thoughts was shared by Dan Mitchell of the Cato Institute when he pointed out that the government was increasingly using higher taxes on tobacco to raise the costs and therefore curb the habitual use of the noxious weed .
� And , you know what , the government got it right .
Higher taxes do reduce consumption , � Mitchell commented , adding , � So why is it the politicians don�t understand that the same principles also apply to commerce and investment markets ? �
A good question , but one that most people won�t ask themselves as they applaud President Obama�s proposed near - doubling of the capital gains tax from 15 % to 28 % .
Take cover .
Guess Who Will Soon Own 1,000,000 Homes ?
You Will !
A couple of weeks ago , I mentioned the view of real estate pro Andy Miller that , absent government intervention , the real estate meltdown would be incredibly painful , but relatively short lived .
But if the government rolled up its sleeves and set about �fixing � things , the pain could stretch out 10 or even 20 years .
At this point , the odds greatly favor the latter .
In fact , we seem to be in a race to the bottom for the candidates , egged on by the professional posturers that hold forth in Washington .
Case in point , House Finance Committee Chairperson Barney Franks , maybe the least financially savvy human being I have ever heard discourse on the topic of finance , has teamed up with Senator Christopher Dodd to propose the nation set up a special $ 400 billion taxpayer - funded pool for the sole and specific purpose of buying non-performing loans from troubled lenders .
When confronted by such largess in the past , I have been known to make indelicate remarks .
A plan of this degree of sheer disregard for anything remotely resembling the free enterprise system leaves me nearly speechless .
$ 400,000,000,000 is a lot of money , no matter what anyone tells you .
And the democrats are not alone .
Even John McCain , bending to the anticipated wishes of the voters this next November , has just done a brisk about - face and announced his own bailout plan .
A plan that but for some modest window dressing , is almost identical to that which has been proposed by Mssrs. Barney and Dodd .
To quote Bloomberg , The ( McCain ) plan would retire old loans that homeowners no longer can pay and replace them with less expensive , 30 - year , fixed - rate mortgages that are federally guaranteed .
McCain said families would gain " the opportunity to trade a burdensome mortgage for a manageable loan that reflects the market value of their home . "
Karl Marx would be proud .
But am I being too harsh in condemning government action ?
After all , when we are talking about collapsing housing prices , we are talking about real hardship being felt by real people� with lots more to come .
It �s a good question , even though I asked it myself .
But the answer is relatively straightforward , albeit in the form of another question .
" Which economic system has history proven to provide the maximum reward to the maximum number of people over a sustained period of time ? �
I think the answer is clear .
So , faced with an economic distortion encouraged by decades of government meddling , do we step further away from free - market capitalism and toward yet more meddling ?
Or , do we accept that there is a price to be paid and the longer the bill remains unpaid , the steeper it inevitably will be ?
Humankind is remarkably adaptable and , when pushed to it , resilient .
If the government could resist doing anything at this point , lenders would fail , house prices would return to a market clearing level , people in the housing trades would find other employment � but the world would not come to an end .
That said , I can�t see any way that the government is going to be able to resist organizing a big bailout � so all I can do is the next best thing : position my portfolio to profit by betting on the inflation that such a bailout makes inevitable .
The Ascent of Humanity My friend and favorite partner of all times , Doug Casey , is well known to be a pessimist in the short term , but is , I can assure you , equally so a raving optimist in the longer term .
Viewing the world through his longer lens , he sent me an interesting , albeit brief , essay from John Robb this week .
It is an update of sort on humankind�s progress in trying to create artificial intelligence .
Robb�s thesis has it that we are very , very close � a few years at most � from being able to reliably duplicate the intelligence of an insect .
Within a decade , he expects we will have reproduced the intelligence of a mammal .
Say , a rat .
And by the end of the next decade , we will have succeeded in duplicating the intellect of a human being .
Each of these milestones , according to Robb , will change the face of the world as we know it .
You can read his full essay by following this link here :

In making his case , Robb links to a video of the Big Dog robot , which is quite amazing .

And this is just one of many areas where humans are making rapid progress toward a more promising future .
For instance , if you credit the reports out of the Swiss firm , CERN , they have figured out how to make the Internet 10,000 times faster .
Given that I am already able to use the current version of the Internet to view a wide selection of movies from Netflix , near instantly , it�s hard for me to fathom the possibilities inherent in an exponentially faster Internet .
The new system will be available to universities this summer and , I have to believe , will roll out pronto thereafter .
Is there an investment angle in this stunning new development ?
While a topic for greater exposition than time allows now , there are two companies ( in addition to CERN ) that are standing squarely in the path of this breakthrough , and both are related to fiber optics , which is a prerequisite for delivering information at this speed .
The first is JDS Uniphase ( JDSU ) , the leader , by a wide margin , in the manufacturing of fiber optics switching equipment .
The second , my friend Porter Stansberry told me last week on Jekyll Island , is Verizon ( VZ ) , which has been spending the majority of its revenues in recent years building out the most extensive fiber optics system in the United States .
The build - out will soon be done , allowing the company to redirect the billions they have been spending on infrastructure back to the bottom line .
And , more importantly , to sally forward as a primary beneficiary of the new and vastly improved Internet .
Watch Out Below
As predicted by our own Bud Conrad , bond insurer MBIA , Inc. was downgraded this week by Fitch Ratings to AA from AAA .
The knock - on effect of this has yet to be felt , but the way these things work is that any of the AAA bonds insured by MBIA will now have to be similarly downgraded , because no bond can have a higher rating than the company that insures it .
Holders of these bonds now have to revalue them in their portfolios , especially if , as expected , the other rating agencies follow suit .
For a quick snapshot of the sort of turmoil this could unleash , here is an excerpt from the January 2008 edition of the International Speculator .
Credit Insurance .
The smaller corporate and municipal borrowers ( which together represent a large segment of the bond market ) depend on credit insurance .
Now the credit insurers are in trouble .
S&P cut the credit rating of ACA Capital Holdings by 12 levels , to CCC ( junk ) , after the company posted a $ 1.04 billion third - quarter loss in November .
ACA has $ 1.1 billion to cover potential losses on $ 7.1 billion of bonds it insured .
It turned itself over to the regulators for protection in late December .
The credit rating companies are now reviewing MBIA Inc. , Ambac Financial Group Inc. and other bond insurers because of concern they do n't have enough money to cover losses on accelerating downgrades of the debt they guarantee .
Weakness in these companies would endanger the value of $ 2.4 trillion of securities they�ve insured .
It goes on and on .
Certain money market funds have been hurt by the commercial paper meltdown .
More may follow .
Because of their bond investments , some insurance companies are in the crosshairs as well .
Stay tuned � China �s Olympic Torchture
In the March 14 , 2008 edition of this weekly feature , I touched on the decision by the Chinese to hoist the Olympic torch to the top of Tibet ( Mount Everest , to be more specific ) as possibly being one of those accidents of history with serious repercussions .
But I didn�t foresee how fast and how far things could have gone off the tracks .
In the lead - up to previous Olympics , being selected to run with the torch was a high honor .
The sort to be photographed for your personal posterity and dropped in passing into every cocktail conversation you might be drawn into .
This time around , however , carrying the torch is akin to being selected by Native Americans of antiquity for the dubious honor of running the gauntlet .
You might survive , but it�s no sure thing .
And it is certainly nothing you�ll be bragging about to anyone in particular , lest you be accused of being a keen supporter of oppression .
Even if the Chinese , who have assigned a cadre of toughs to protect the flame , go one step further and borrow the Popemobile to finish delivering the torch to Beijing , the public relations damage they are suffering is akin to the death of a thousand cuts , with each step along the route bringing another cut .
( For those of you with strong stomachs and curious about the origins of that term , I provide this link �
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_slicing)
While we can�t yet know how the Chinese will react to their global humiliation , if you look at the language used by China �s foreign ministry in objecting to a U.S. resolution calling for China to stop beating up the Tibetans , you can get a sense of the emotions involved �
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu labeled the resolution passed Wednesday by the House of Representatives anti-Chinese , saying it " twisted Tibet 's history and modern reality ... seriously hurting the feelings of the Chinese people . "
( I suspect that whoever it was that conceived the idea of taking the torch to Tibet has already received some indication of the leadership�s displeasure .
I can imagine a short conversation along the lines of , � Mr. Han , please come in .
We would like to talk to you about that idea you had about taking the Olympic torch to the top of Mt. Everest .
No need to sit down ; in fact , if you�d be so kind to just stand up against that wall over there � yes , that should be fine . �)
Given the clout that the Chinese currently have in the global economy , and given the fact that they are actively competing for all manner of natural resources with many of those nations whose spokespersons are now lining up to condemn them over their human rights record , this is definitely a geopolitical situation to keep an eye on .
On that latter point , this week the news came out that China is looking to buy 9 % of BHP Billiton , the world�s largest mining company � a move that follows their purchase of 9.3 % of Rio Tinto in February for $ 14 billion .
And last week it was revealed that they had dropped $ 2.8 billion to buy a stake in Total , the French oil producer .
This week the market was moved by news that the Chinese are on the hunt to acquire Canadian uranium companies .
Referring to its quest for uranium companies , according to Bloomberg� State - owned China National Nuclear is considering options including takeovers and supply agreements that range in value from �several hundred million dollars to more than a billion , � Cui Jianchun , general manager of subsidiary CNNC Finance Co. , said in an interview yesterday in Toronto .
Call it what you will , but I think you can safely call it a War for the World�s Resources , with U.S. dollars being used as ammunition .
It is too early to discern what will be the ultimate consequences of China �s Olympic - sized embarrassment � which will continue through the event�s closing ceremonies on August 24 � but they could be serious .
[ Ed . Note :
In my reading this week , I came across a pretty good essay on this topic on the BBC web site .
You can read it here �
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7339764.stm ]
And There�s
This �
While we are on the topic of China , I thought I would share an email from one of our many fine subscribers .
He penned the following in response to my previous skeptical musings on what I see as the myth of Chinese invincibility � .
Dear David ,
I have been a Casey subscriber for a number of years now and find that one of the highlights of my week is ' The Room . '
Your easy style is always a pleasure and it never detracts from the clarity of the underlying message ; however , when discussing China - its massive ( and growing ) economic influence and the ability , or otherwise , of its ruling elite to �manage � the immense changes taking place - I find it odd that no mention is ever made of the demographic time bomb inherent in the One Child diktat .
My wife and I traveled through China in the mid-1990's and wherever one went , you would see groups of parents and grandparents fawning over a single child .
Fast forward to today and consider the consequences .
Those children have no uncles , aunts or cousins .
A typical family would now comprise - in it 's entirety - one grandchild , two parents and four grandparents !
Also consider the fact that traditionally , boy children are preferred to girls .
The result is a significant gender imbalance eventuating in a preponderance of males .
In a society where security in old age has always depended on the support of an extended family , an intolerable burden is now placed on a single grandchild and that grandchild , if it is a male , is also going to have a tough job finding a wife !
As this imbalance works its way through the Chinese population , we can expect severe , and unpleasant , consequences .
Yours sincerely ,
R.H .
Not a new story , but one that has yet to really play out .
Food for thought , to be sure .

Out of Silver ?
There has been a lot of discussion in the blogosphere about the lack of silver coins at dealers .
We did some research on the topic and the situation appears to be nothing more than a miscalculation by the mints leading to a temporary shortage in the circular blanks required to make coins .
Proof of that point comes from one close acquaintance of ours who placed an order for $ 1 M in silver the week before last and had the bars promptly delivered .
A Solution for Global Warming !
I had a good chuckle this week when reading a story by Bloomberg on a study issued by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences about the possible consequences to the environment by a nuclear war involving � 100 Hiroshima - size bombs . �
The story relates how , should such a conflagration occur , it would cause damage to the ozone layer , resulting in an increase in skin cancer , eye damage and similar illnesses caused by more extreme exposure to sunlight .
But nowhere in the story was there a single mention of the straight - up death and destruction caused to people by � 100 Hiroshima - size bombs � going off , or the ill effects of the clouds of radiation that would soon blot out the sun .
They did mention , however , that one possible outcome was that global land temperatures would drop .
So , there�s that to look forward to .
* Errata .
Last week , while writing in the fog of early morning , I misplaced a decimal point when discussing the percentage of GDP represented by Mexican oil exports ... which , based on the Export Land Model , should cease in , or before , 2014 .
While the error was fixed on Monday morning -- to more accurately reflect the total at about 6.5 % of GDP versus the errant 65 % -- if you viewed this missive over the weekend , you might have seen the erroneous number and so have sallied forth with poor information , for which I apologize .
While not nearly so significant , the lower number is still very significant .
That�s
It for This Week As I prepare to sign off for this week , it came across the screen that consumer confidence in the U.S. has now fallen to a 26 - year low .
One of the drivers of this pessimism , according to the report , was the price of gas� a commodity that indeed hits consumers straight in the pocket .
Earlier this week , I read a report by the International Energy Agency that they expect oil to remain above $ 100 per bbl for the rest of the year .
This is one of those stubborn economic inputs that the U.S. government , despite all its real power , is helpless to affect .
That �s because the U.S. imports over 65 % of its oil .
We can�t , therefore , force producers to sell it cheaper to us� because the Chinese , among others , will simply step in and pay the market price .
Confronted with consumer backlash , the only real action I can see that is left to the U.S. government , should it wish to be seen as �doing something , � is to subsidize prices .
In other words , reach into the public coffers to pick up some of the tab .
But that , of course , simply adds fuel of a different sort to the inflationary fires .
There is no positive way to view this situation , especially for those who have a long commute , or for businesses � airlines for example � that are so solidly impacted by persistently high fuel prices .
On that last point , you might want to check your portfolio for exposure to any companies where fuel looms large in their P&Ls .
A final check of the numbers as I prepare to put the tools to rest has it that gold is hovering around the $ 926 level , while the DJIA is taking a hard shellacking , down 223 points .
For entertainment purposes only , I �m going to bet that gold is going to go over $ 950 in the coming week .
In fact , I�ll go one step further , and say it will peak at $ 953 for the high this week ( as of noon next Friday , April 18 ) .
If you want to get in on the game , send in a specific guess of gold�s high for the week ( also by noon next Friday ) .
If you are right , we�ll comp you for a year of BIG GOLD � with a tie going to whoever sends in their prediction first .

If Lyle could be summed up in one word , it'd be " competitive . "
If he could be summed up in three words , it'd be " ultra - competitive jackass . "
If you had $ 21.00 on you , Lyle would make it a point to have $ 21.50 .
If you estimated that a task would take you twelve hours , it 'd take Lyle eleven hours and 45 minutes .
If a distant relative died , somehow two of Lyle 's distant relatives died .
He was the kind of guy that would play basketball against a nine year old to win , then he'd make fun of the kid for losing , then he'd make fun of the kid for crying .
If a stranger asked Lyle what time it was , he treated it as a challenge .
Lyle was two levels above James W. in the company hierarchy ( or , as Lyle would probably call it , " winning " ) .
James reported to Rob , who reported to Lyle .
Another team of the same size reported to Lyle as well .
James and one of his colleagues knew about Lyle 's obsession with winning and exploited it at every opportunity , usually teasing him to the point that he'd leave them alone .
As is the case with most bullies being called out on their bullpucky , Lyle got defensive and eventually stopped visiting James during the day .
Clearly , there were problems with the team ( and not with Lyle ) , so he had to take action .
I 'm better at team building than anyone else , Lyle reasoned .
Time for a team - building exercise !
And he knew just the place , too : Lazer Zone X - Treme 2000 !!
It was the ideal environment for IT office team building — screaming children , sticky arcade cabinets , blaring nu-metal — paradise within just a few miles of the office .
He sent emails to his two teams inviting them to play laser tag .
Everyone carpooled to LZXT2K ( Lyle got there first ) , and stood in line waiting to sign in ( Lyle signed in first ) .
The teams in the laser tag game were the same as the teams in the office , with Lyle joining the team opposite James .
They entered their names , put on their vests , and began the first of two games .
While James was skeptical of laser tag for team building , he had to admit that it was a good time and that everyone enjoyed the friendly competition .
Everyone except Lyle , that is .
Whenever he was hit , he'd throw up his arms and complain that he shot first and his gun was n't working .
Whenever he landed a hit , he 'd laugh and praise himself loudly in third person .
" How are you so awesome , Lyle ?
I do n't know , Lyle , I just can't help it ! "
The first match was neck - and - neck throughout , until James 's team barely pulled ahead at the end .
While everyone else was laughing and comparing score sheets after the game , Lyle sat in the corner scowling at his sheet .
" OK , tough guys , " Lyle said , rising from his seat and crushing his score sheet in a clenched fist , " how about for the next game the losing team has to sing the ' I'm a Little Teapot ' song here in the lobby ! "
James rolled his eyes , realizing that it must 've taken Lyle tremendous strength of will to not be howling profanities at his team .
Everyone agreed to the wager before the second game began .
Five minutes into the game , James was getting the sense that something was amiss .
Lyle 's team had more than three times the score of James 's team , and James could hardly land a shot on anyone !
At one point , James had snuck up behind someone on the opposite team , and from three feet away could n't get their vest to register a shot .
It was a laser tag massacre — James 's team had lost by over 1,000 points by the end .
And Lyle could n't have been happier .
" OK , let 's hear it , " he insisted with a toothy smile .
" Just one second , " James said loudly enough for all to hear .
He went over to the kid running the system to do some detective work .
" So ... ' Skippy , ' " James began , reading the kid 's nametag .
" I 'm curious — is there a way to turn off all the vests on one team ? "
Skippy immediately broke eye contact , looking down at his desk .
After a pause , he sheepishly replied " yeah ... "
" And did that guy over there ask you to turn off the vests for his team ? "
" Y... yeah ...
He asked me to turn all of them off except one . "
" Thanks . "
James excused himself and returned to the group .
Lyle still had a huge smile on his face .
" Ah , so the losers came back !
Have you got something you 'd like to say , or perhaps , sing for us ? "
James shot a disgusted look at Lyle , and after a brief , awkward silence , the teams returned to their cars .
Lyle got back to the office first .
A few days later , Lyle sat James down to take him to task for figuring out his subterfuge .
James was surprised that he was the one being admonished .
" It 's just that I did n't want my team feeling bad about losing twice , " Lyle explained .
" No one would have felt bad , " James explained .
" Everyone was having a good time !
Nobody was talking trash or trying to make one team feel bad . "
Well , except you , James thought .
Hopefully the next team - building exercise , a small company picnic , wo n't be sabotaged by Lyle .
Democratic Senator Ron Wyden has put ISPs on notice that he 's going to do everything he can to preserve Net Neutrality , telling ISPs to " think twice " before they start to corrupt the connections they provide to their customers .
Wyden delivered his ultimatum at a Computer & Communications Industry Association conference in DC , where he cast the entire network neutrality debate in terms of a legislative compromise .
Years ago , Congress began protecting ISPs from the twin threats of regulation and taxation ; in return , ISPs were expected to deliver an unimpeded connection to the Internet .
A move away from a neutral ' Net would undermine the " very philosophical underpinnings of what we fought for for the last 15 years , " according to Wyden .
If that happens , he sees no reason for Congress to continue sheltering ISPs .

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has expressed concerns that Adobe 's efforts to develop a DRM system for Flash video content will be bad news for users looking to remix and repurpose digital media content .
Adobe 's DRM will principally be used in its new streaming desktop media player application , but will also be supported in the Flash browser plug -in .
The primary function of DRM is , theoretically , to block copyright infringement .
But DRM also restricts many noninfringing activities that have traditionally been protected under the banner of fair use .
The draconian Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) broadly prohibits circumvention of copy - protection mechanisms , and thus criminalizes the exercise of fair use rights on DRM - encumbered content .
The failure of the DMCA to provide adequate exceptions and safeguards for fair use , critics say , undermines the underlying principle of the copyright system , which is to promote creativity by establishing a fair balance between the rights of content producers and content consumers .
All too often , lawmakers focus on protecting the content industry and forget that the permissive elements of copyright law — like fair use and the public domain — are just as essential to fulfilling the purpose of the system .
The EFF notes that an increasing number of Internet users are downloading and modifying short video clips to create expressive " remixes " that have independent value .
These remixes often fall well within the bounds of fair use , because they do not contain substantive portions or decrease the profitability of the original works from which they are derived .
The EFF contends that broad adoption of DRM on Flash video would criminalize production of such remixes despite the fact that they are not in themselves infringing .
In addition to stifling creativity and freedom of expression , the EFF argues that DRM in this context also deprives society of a valuable learning tool .
" [ T ] he prospect of widespread adoption of DRM restrictions on Flash threatens to squash a growing tradition of expressive fair use of online video — a practice effectively in its infancy that , left unfettered , would be a dynamic solution to our failing effort to teach media literacy , " the EFF 's Seth Schoen wrote in a statement .
" Before we understand how to read media messages , we must first learn how to speak their language — and we learn that language by playing with and remixing the efforts of others .
DRM , by restricting the remixing of Flash videos , stands to bankrupt a rich store of educational value by foreclosing the ability of students and teachers to ' echo others ' by remixing videos posted online . "
Prairie dog says : " Do n't tase me bro ! "
Schoen cites the Dramatic Prairie Dog as an example of an instance in which the ability to freely manipulate video content led to the emergence of an influential Internet cultural meme that exploded into the mainstream .
The EFF links to a number of Dramatic Prarie Dog video remixes posted on YouTube , one of which has been viewed literally millions of times .
These remixes often parody other elements of popular culture by incorporating elements of movies .
Creating these short remixes is fully permissible now , but might not be for very long if DRM continues to become more pervasive — a calamity that would certainly justify Dramatic Prairie Dog 's poignant expression of existential horror .
DRM technologies generally have a poor track record when it comes to protecting multimedia content .
Virtually every new and advanced copy - protection system that has ever been touted as unbreakable has been circumvented ( even Blu- ray 's BD + ) , which has led many to wonder why these technologies are so widely used .
The reason is simple : DRM can be used to lock out competitors and force law - abiding customers to fork over cash for every conceivable usage of encumbered content , including activities that were once protected as fair use .
The EFF also notes that DRM will likely lock out alternate implementations of the Flash player , such as the the one created by the open - source Gnash project .
Alternate implementations are important because they diminish the risks of vendor lock - in and bring access to relevant technologies to unsupported platforms .
For instance , the Gnash player can make Flash content accessible to users of alternative operating systems for which Adobe does not supply a version of its own proprietary Flash player .
Although the EFF specifically targets Adobe with its criticism , it is important to remember that there are other companies already developing their own DRM technologies for Flash and Microsoft 's competing Silverlight framework has DRM support as well .
Adobe likely sees adoption of DRM as a competitive necessity and potential source of additional revenue ( the EFF notes that the ability to add DRM to content will only be available in Adobe 's high - end Flash video streaming products ) .
It seems like media software makers are intent on serving the content industry 's desire to prevent the next Dramatic Prairie Dog from popping out of its hole .

Sap beetles ( Librodor japonicus ) .
Regardless of their size , they can all succeed in love , with each size employing a different strategy to snag a mate .
In the beetle world , it 's the big guys who often win in the mating game , chomping their larger jaws down on the competition to fend them off .
But biggest is not always best .
All sizes of male sap beetles — large , medium and small — can get lucky .
Each size adopts a different tactic in finding a mate , evolutionary ecologist Takahisa Miyatake at Okayama University in Japan and his colleagues found .
These beetles are found all throughout Japan .
They live off the sap exuding from oak trees .
The largest male beetles wait for females at feeding areas — in the case of experiments , thin banana slices — and then fight for the right to mate .
In those cases , the males with the biggest jaws stand the best chance of winning .
The medium - sized beetles — too small to beat the bigger males — have developed wings relatively larger than those of their larger counterparts .
So the middleweights use their wings to search for feeding sites that are unoccupied by large males and woo with females there .
The smallest males adopt yet another completely different tactic — they rely on their relatively larger testicles .
They stay at feeding sites with big males and then sneakily attempt to have sex with females behind the backs of the other males .
They can then produce sperm that is more competitive than that of the bigger males .
While scientists had known that small and large male sap beetles ( Librodor japonicus ) employed different strategies , they had not known of the unique tactic of the medium - sized males .
Miyatake said researchers should reexamine other beetles for such strategies as well .
The findings are detailed in the April issue of the journal Ecological Entomology .

When a strong Germanic signal was discovered in the Y - chromosome of British men , geneticists at University College London suggested that enslavement and apartheid imposed by Saxon invaders was responsible .
It was an idea that , given 20th - century European history , had a particular resonance .
The argument is , that from AD 430 to 730 , the Germanic conquerors of Britain formed an elite , with a servant underclass of native Britons .
Inter - marriage was restricted , and the invaders and their genes flourished .

“ But it is just not necessary to assume an apartheid - like system , ” argues John Pattison of the University of South Australia in Adelaide .
“ The evidence is compatible with the idea of a much more integrated society . ”
Lengthy influx
Pattison reviewed existing archaeological and genetic evidence , and conducted a new analysis of British DNA .
Then , starting in 2001 and working backwards to pre-Roman times , Pattison calculated for each generation the net population growth and the origins of immigrants .
He concludes that people with Germanic origins came to Britain well before and after the early Anglo - Saxon period , and this long period of immigration can explain a relatively strong Germanic genetic signal today .
He adds that about 60 % of the current British population still has some native Briton DNA , arguing against the idea , put forward by Mark Thomas at University College London and colleagues that Saxon invaders ethnically purged the country .
The textual and archaeological evidence collected by Thomas ’s team is also controversial , says Pattison .
Brutal times
While the Anglo - Saxon King Ine of Wessex did formulate a code that imposed heavier taxes on native Britons than Saxons , for example , this might have been intended to encourage reluctant Britons to fully adopt the new Germanic culture and language , and to label themselves “ Germanic ” , rather than to penalise an underclass , Pattison argues .
Overall , he says , the evidence suggests the picture of life in early Anglo - Saxon Britain was not as dismal as that portrayed by Thomas and his team .
“ It was still the Dark Ages .
People were pretty brutal and there was a lot of fighting going on – but it was n’t necessarily as grim for the Britons as has been suggested , ” he says .
Chris Tyler - Smith , an evolutionary geneticist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute , UK , does not think we have seen the end of the “ apartheid ” debate .
“ It emphasises for me how much room there is for interpretation , ” he says .

So you now know which comic adapted movies I believe to be the best .
Now let ’s go to the list of movies that I consider the worst and which occupied the time between Superman and Spiderman .
Batman Returns / Batman Forever . ( 1992 , 1995 ) .
These two Batman movies had two different actors to portray Bruce Wayne – Michael Keaton for the former and Val Kilmer for the latter .
Both actors are good but the manner in which these two movies were made was extremely bad .
There can be no doubt that Tim Burton ( 1992 ) and Joel Schumacher ( 1995 ) used the best special effects for the films – the effects were impeccable .
But the storyline pretty much just jammed all these celebrities portraying all these famous villains into one movie .
The acting of all characters villain or hero was detestable as well .
Definitely , these two movies did not give justice to the well - loved story of Batman no matter how star - studded it may be .
Supergirl . ( 1984 ) Supergirl was portrayed by Helen Slater during the time that Superman was dominating the screen .
It was made to ride the Superman wave but it failed miserably .
The movie was star - studded with Faye Dunaway , Mia Farrow and Peter O’Toole being part of the cast .
But despite the accumulation of talent , the storyline was flat and simple .
Helen Slater ’s performance matched the storyline with her dull expressions and blah portrayal of Supergirl .
She was pretty however and did look nice in that outfit .
Catwoman ( 2004 ) .
This movie was nothing more than to exhibit Halle Berry ’s beautiful body .
The story was very predictable and the acting , by both Berry and Sharon Stone , lacked enough depth that the comic book looked more 3 dimensional .
The CGI effects of Catwoman ’s movements were too much that it made Halle Berry looks oddly gross .
The Hulk ( 2003 ) .
Ang Lee is a very good director but he killed the Hulk .
The Hulk is one of the more interesting 3 dimensional characters in the Marvel World as the Hulk represented the beastly irrational side of a very scientific and logical Bruce Banner .
Eric Bana was not able to portray Banner as well as he should .
All he did was serve as eye candy for the female audience of the movie .
But Bruce Banner is one of those heroes that do not own a good - looking secret persona .
Bruce Banner is a scientist not a body - building Hector looking guy .
Moreover , so much time was invested on the origin of the Hulk that the story just dragged on .
For an action flick there was more talking than there was any action .
X - Men III : The Last Stand ( 2006 ) .
What were they thinking ?
X -men and X2 are two movies that would be part of my top ten list ( although I only made a top 5 list ) but The Final Stand was horrendous .
It was so obvious that there was some politics going on behind the screens .
First , Storm , Halle Berry ’s character all of a sudden , with no prior build up comes to the fore of the story .
Granted Storm is the leader of the X - men team and is a very significant character in the comic books , but the first two movies did n’t develop that .
Moreover , they kill off Cyclops and Professor X .
It turned out to be a let ’s just feature Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry movie .
Forget the story .
Forget all the other characters .
Let ’s just kill them off .
Despite its successful beginnings , X - men the Final Stand is one of the worst comic - adapted movie .
Rumor has it they will recast X - men although spin - offs starring the original cast are being made .

An informal survey of several bartenders on whether they use gloves or tongs when garnishing beer bottles was met with incredulity , ridicule and disdain .
But when asked to perform this alien ritual , they did their best with the tongs , gripping the little wedges and guiding them into the bottles .
Some fumbled , while others took to it like surgeons performing a transplant .
None of them seemed happy with the thought of doing it every day .
The first stop was Smith & Wollensky , the revered brass - rail bar and steakhouse in Midtown where the staff wears sharp white coats .
Patrick Ford , a bartender for 35 of his 53 years , was standing behind the polished bar amid gleaming bottles on a busy Tuesday night as he considered how to legally garnish a beer .
“ I wo n’t wear gloves , ” he said , his tall frame so thin it seemed his white coat was still on a hanger .
“ It ’s not a doctor ’s office .
It ’s a saloon . ”
He fished out a Corona and looked around .
“ We do n’t have tongs , ” he said .
“ I ’ll use a fork . ”
He speared a little wedge of lime and walked past several amused regular customers , toward a waiting Corona .
In his coat , holding the fruit before him , he looked like a mad scientist with a laboratory specimen .
The lime addressed the lip of the beer bottle with uncertainty , but when Mr. Ford removed the fork , it stuck there .
Men cheered .
“ Hey , Patty , ” one man bellowed .
“ Give me a Corona over here !
Be sure to use a fork ! ”
The more experienced the bartender , the more ludicrous the rule sounded , as bizarre as using tongs to shake someone ’s hand .
Good bartenders flow behind the bar , with rhythm and economy of movement , and regulatory disruptions trip them up .
Tongs are to a bartender what work boots would be on a ballerina .
Take Dale DeGroff , 59 , a bartender since 1974 and the self - proclaimed “ king of cocktails , ” as well as the author of “ The Craft of the Cocktail . ”
A former bartender at the Rainbow Room , among other New York establishments , he said he had never heard of tongs or gloves for limes in beer bottles until he was called for this article .
“ It ’s been accepted practice for 200 years in New York that a bartender will twist a lime in your gin and tonic , ” he said .
“ Can you imagine bartenders wearing rubber gloves and how ridiculous that would be ? ”

Machine is the first of a new generation to hit the market .
No need to amplify : you do n't need multiple copies of bits of DNA with new sequencers .
Getty
A Massachusetts company has published data from a DNA sequencer that can read individual letters from single molecules of DNA .
The machine , produced by Helicos BioSciences , is the first of a new generation of devices , called single - molecule DNA sequencers , to enter the market .
Single - molecule approaches are widely regarded as the future of sequencing , because they do not require the DNA to be ' amplified ' ( copied into multiple , identical strands ) before it is sequenced .
The amplification step can introduce errors into the sequence and does not work well for some DNA fragments , making it difficult to sequence a genome ’s full complement of DNA .
By avoiding these complications , single - molecule approaches may reduce the time and the cost of sequencing an individual ’s genome .
“ They 're cool , ” says Edward Rubin , director of the US Department of Energy ’s Joint Genome Institute , a genome - sequencing facility in Walnut Creek , California .
“ Eventually , single - molecule sequencing will be what we use . ”
Close race
The competition in the sequencing field has been heating up this year as companies jostle to be the first , the fastest and the cheapest to sequence large amounts of DNA .
Helicos will be competing with established companies such as California - based Illumina of San Diego and Applied Biosystems of Foster City .
In February , Illumina claimed to have kept the costs for an entire human genome down to just US $ 100,000 ( see Company claims to have sequenced man 's genome cheaply ) .
and a month later , Applied Biosystems stated that it had sequenced a human genome using less than $ 60,000 worth of reagents .
Helicos has not yet sequenced a human genome — it looked instead at the genome of a virus called M13 that infects bacteria .
But it has published its initial data in a peer - reviewed journal1 .
The virus 's genome is tiny — nearly a millionth the size of the human genome — but the firm estimates that their machine could sequence a human genome for about $ 72,000 in eight weeks .
The machine itself will cost customers US $ 1.35 million , according to the company website .
Helicos ’ method begins by chopping the genome into small fragments .
An enzyme then attaches a short DNA tag onto the end of each fragment .
The tag binds to a complementary DNA molecule attached to a platform , anchoring the DNA fragment in place .
A DNA replicating enzyme is then added along with a stock of DNA ' letters ' or bases carrying fluorescent labels .
As the fluorescent DNA forms into strands that complement the genome fragments , a camera takes a picture of each newly added base .
This method , called ‘ sequencing by synthesis ’ , is similar in principle to that used by other sequencers .
But Helicos has adapted its method so that it can detect the light from individual letters of DNA .
The other procedures require many thousands of identical genome fragments to be sequenced simultaneously to get a signal bright enough to interpret .
Bit by bit
But there is a catch : Helicos can sequence only small fragments .
In today 's report , the fragments carried about 30 DNA letters .
That puts the machine on par with some currently used sequencers , but nevertheless limits its usefulness for sequencing large genomes .
Sequenced fragments need to be pieced together by looking at overlapping regions : the smaller the fragments , the more difficult it is to assemble them .
This means that Helicos ’ machine would struggle to sequence a large genome that has never been sequenced before .
It could stitch together at least 85 % of a person 's genome , says Timothy Harris of Helicos and lead author on the paper , using the already - published human genome as a reference — more than enough of a sequencing effort to be useful for personal genomics .
Pacific Biosciences of Menlo Park , California , has said that its single - molecule sequencing machines can sequence DNA fragments of over 1,000 bases long .
That data has yet to be published , however , and the company has estimated that their first machine will not hit the market until 2010 .
The competition is driving the field rapidly toward the lofty goal of a $ 1,000 human genome sequence , which Harris thinks will be reached in less than five years .
“ Maybe that will be Helicos and maybe not , ” he says .
“ There are a lot of people pushing in that direction . ”
Recently , reports have circulated that actor Jason Beghe , a former Scientologist , has denounced his religion .
Beghe is reported as saying that “ Scientology is destructive and a rip off . ”
He goes on to say “ [ Scientology is ] very , very dangerous for your spiritual , psychological , mental , emotional health and evolution .
I think it stunts your evolution .
If Scientology is real , then something ’s f— —ed up . ”
The video in which Beghe criticizes Scientology has been removed from YouTube , along with two other prominent anti-Scientology accounts owned by Tory Christman and Mark Bunker .
YouTube issued the following statement to Times Online regarding the account suspensions :
YouTube takes these issues very seriously but we do n’t comment on individual videos .
Our general approach is simple : we have clear content policies about what videos are allowed on the site .
For example we prohibit clips that infringe copyright or show extreme violence .
Videos that breach these rules are removed and we disable all accounts belonging to repeat offenders .
I scarcely have to point out that this is a non-answer .
It says a lot about why accounts in general are suspended , but nothing about why the individual accounts were suspended .
Neither Christman nor Bunker received any information from YouTube as to why their accounts were suspended , though Christman ’s account is back up .
No word yet on when or if Bunker ’s will be reactivated .
At the risk of sounding paranoid , I think that the church of Scientology has everything to do with this .
It is the policy of their church to target critics , whom they call Suppressives ( or SPs ) .
The critics are considered “ fair game ” to do whatever it takes to destroy their character and stop them from criticizing Scientology .
This policy of dead agenting is one component of Scientology ’s long standing policy of hate to its critics .
In a world that hates the truth , in a world that love its sin , I can see the need for a firm defense of the truth .
But truth does n’t require bullying , fear - mongering , and hatred .
Morally , we can all see these things for evil .
If Scientology is true , then it has nothing to fear from critics .
However , if it is n’t true , and its upper ranks know that it is n’t true , then the need for “ fair game ” and “ dead agenting ” becomes very clear .
[ digg - reddit - me ] I wanted to call this post , “ The End of Hillary 2008 ” but there were no “ knockout blows ” in this debate .
Only the gradual erosion of Ms. Clinton ’s candidacy and the demonstration of Barack Obama ’s resilience .
On October 30 , 2007 , the Democratic candidates for president debated in Philadelphia .
At the time , I noted that this debate might mark ” The Beginning of the End of Hillary 2008 “ .
I based this prediction on the fact that the fundamentals of this election year favor Senator Barack Obama , and that Ms. Clinton had just made a significant mistake that played into her perceived weaknesses .
Many people scoffed – and the conventional wisdom of the time was that although Ms. Clinton made a large blunder , she had n’t offered a large enough opening for Mr. Obama to take advantage of .
It is hard to recall now how obvious it seemed then that Ms. Clinton would be the Democratic nominee .
Now tonight , 170 days later , and 10 days before the umpteenth “ final showdown ” between the candidates , they debated again .
In the October debate , Ms. Clinton complained that Tim Russert and Brian Williams were “ ganging up ” on her because they pressed her to answer questions that she was trying to evade , most specifically regarding driver ’s licenses for illegal immigrants .
Tonight though Charles Gibson and George Stephanopoulos did gang up on Mr. Obama .
They used a surrogate to ask if he was loved the country and the flag ; they brought up the fact that he had once served on a charitable board with a former member of the Weather Underground ; they of course mentioned Bittergate ; they brought up again the comments of Reverend Wright .
Ms. Clinton piled on – especially by trying to raise the issue of William Ayers , the former member of the Weather Underground who Mr. Obama knew from the charitable board and the University of Chicago and by saying , again , that Mr. Obama ’s comments about “ clinging ” to religion , guns and nativism were elitist and out - of - touch .
Watching her closely as she flung this mud – which had often been thrown at her in the past two decades – I thought I could see her squirm , as she refused to focus her eyes on anyone or anything in particular , looking up , then down , then left , and right , all awkward yet determined .
I thought I could see Ms. Clinton ’s conscience squirming as she tried to teach Mr. Obama the lesson that she had been taught : the only way to win is to ignore the issues and the truth as you know it , and try to bring down your opponent .
The National Review ‘s Jonah Golberg halfway through the debate wrote on The Corner :
I ’m no leftwing blogger , but I can only imagine how furious they must be with the debate so far .
Nothing on any issues .
Just a lot of box - checking on how the candidates will respond to various Republican talking points come the fall .
Now I think a lot of those Republican talking points are valid and legitimate .
But if I were a “ fighting Dem ” who thinks all of these topics are despicable distractions from the “ real issues , ” I would find this debate to be nothing but Republican water - carrying .
I think if he were more honest , Mr. Golberg might say he did find the debate to be “ nothing but Republican water - carrying ” and that the issues the moderators and Ms. Clinton kept pressing were “ valid and legitimate ” points only if “ valid and legitimate ” points were defined to mean those issues which would help Republicans beat Mr. Obama .
It ’s worth noting how far Hillary Clinton has come – as demonstrated in the following video which many redditors will be familiar with :
( h/t The Nation ‘s Ari Melber . )
In the debate tonight , Ms. Clinton attacked Mr. Obama as an elitist , attacked him by invoking 9/11 ( some 4 times by my informal count ) , and attacked him for associating with a former terrorist ( a charge which Obama parried very well , pointing out that President Bill Clinton had pardoned several members of the same group that Ms. Clinton was attacking Obama for having served on a charitable committee with . )
Ms. Clinton has gone from the foremost victim of the Drudge - style smears and gaffes to the foremost practitioner of the varied and dark arts of dirty politics ( now that Karl Rove has retired ) .
Tonight ’s debate on ABC provided her with an ideal platform with sympathetic questioners who aided her .
And yet here is the key : Obama scored no knockouts , but he kept going , and he kept talking about the policy issues that matter to most Americans without looking like he was dodging the questions .
He answered , then pivoted .
Again .
And again .
And again .
And it worked .
What his candidacy comes down to is this : he is betting on the American people .
That ’s why , when confronted with the incendiary statements of Reverend Wright , he did n’t do the typical political move and disown him ; he condemned the comments and sought to explain why he still admired the man who said them , speaking to Americans as if they were adults .
Mr. Obama ’s candidacy is not magical , as it did feel for a time in the days after Iowa .
What his candidacy is is grounded and methodical and competent and substantiative and groundbreaking .
Maybe there ’s a bit of magic mixed up in there too – but it ’s not in the candidate himself .
It ’s in the hopes of the people who are coming into the political process to support him ; it ’s in the sense that America is righting itself after many , many rocky years ; it ’s in the movement that is swelling around his candidacy ; it ’s in the connection between Barack Obama ’s story and the nation ’s ; and it ’s in the fact that the candidate who is winning is the one who was willing to bet on the good sense of the American people .

OTTAWA–Today 's federal budget is expected to announce a surplus at least $ 1 billion higher than expected , ratcheting up the pressure on Finance Minister Jim Flaherty to meet the demands of Ontario 's jobless and cash - strapped cities .
The surplus , originally pegged at $ 11.6 billion for the fiscal year ending in March , will now ring in at $ 13 billion or more .
Of that , $ 10 billion will go to debt reduction .
But the windfall gives some room to dole out " surprises " in what was otherwise expected to be a bare - bones financial blueprint .
Last night , a senior Ontario government official said that if Ottawa has extra money it should be used to soften the blow of the heavy job losses in the province 's manufacturing sector .
" They should be using that money to help grow jobs in Ontario " by joining with the province 's Next Generation Jobs Fund , the official said .
But that seems unlikely .
Earlier in the day , Flaherty dismissed the call from Queen 's Park for increased Employment Insurance benefits for the province 's unemployed .
Flaherty charged that there are jobless Ontarians already collecting EI who should n't be .
" There is a concern about the way Ontario calculates it ( EI ) because they include people who are not entitled to unemployment insurance , " Flaherty said during a pre-budget photo op .
An official in Flaherty 's office was unable to explain what exactly Flaherty was referring to , but it was clearly a continuation of his war of words with Canada 's most populous province .
" The biggest threat to the Canadian economy is a finance minister who does n't understand our economic engine , " the Ontario official said .
Flaherty , who hands down his third federal budget today , criticized Premier Dalton McGuinty for failing to cut business taxes and brushed aside the complaint Ontario does n't get a fair shake when it comes to EI .
The Ontario government has argued for the need to reform EI given that only 30 per cent of Ontario workers who lose their jobs qualify for EI benefits – versus about 80 per cent across the country – and those who do receive only about $ 5,110 , compared with $ 9,070 in the rest of Canada .
" We want fairness for our workers , who if they lose their job , receive $ 4,000 less in employment insurance benefits than workers in other provinces .
That 's not fair and we 're looking for redress , " McGuinty said yesterday in Toronto .
Flaherty told reporters that one day McGuinty is going to wake up and understand he 's part of Ontario 's economic woes .
" The biggest problem in Ontario is that they have the highest taxes on new business investment in Canada and the premier seems unable to understand that , " he said .
" Some day that is going to dawn on him that there is a relationship between bad fiscal policy in the province of Ontario and business not growing in the province of Ontario . "
Inside the House of Commons and out , politicians attacked the Conservatives for criticizing Ontario , where thousands of jobs have been lost in the past few years , fuelled by a high Canadian dollar and a weakened U.S. economy .
" Why does the federal finance minister continue petty attacks against the Ontario premier and thumb his nose at the hardships faced by hard - working Ontario families ? " said Liberal MP Sue Barnes ( London West ) .
Liberal MP John McCallum ( Markham - Unionville ) said he found it puzzling that the federal government subsidizes the aerospace industry , based mainly in Quebec , when it refuses to assist Ontario 's ailing auto industry .

" It would be consistency and fairness to the people of Ontario .
Why does the minister insist on policies that are flagrantly unfair to the people of Ontario ? "

President George W. Bush has transformed an open federal government in Washington into one of “ pervasive secrecy , ” a distinguished authority on communications and First Amendment rights says .
Since his inauguration , Bush has overseen changes that suggest “ a dramatic growth of government secrecy , far beyond the secrecy occurring during the Clinton Administration , ” writes Susan Dente Ross , ( no relation ) an Associate Professor in the Edward R. Murrow School of Communication at Washington State University at Pullman .
“ Through executive agency opinions , executive orders , statutory changes , and aggressive litigation , the Bush Administration has effectively limited the power of FOIA ( Freedom of Information Act ) and reversed the presumption that government records should be available to the public absent demonstrable proof showing that secrecy is needed , ” Ross writes in The Long Term View , a journal of opinion published by the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover .
“ The administration ’s sweeping expansion of the power of federal government to classify records , and so hide them from public view , increases the range of information that may be classified and extends the lifetime of such secrecy , ” Ross says .
She noted that :
# Bush has increased the number of federal agencies authorized to designate information as secret and exempt them from public disclosure .
# The Department of Homeland Security removed the agency ’s entire classification of information process from public scrutiny .
The secretaries ’ of Health and Human Services and Agriculture and the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency , have been granted the right to classify information “ for purposes of national security and national defense . ”
# The Defense Department has adopted a new policy that imposes strict limits on discussion of all its “ critical research ” from the “ idea phase ” onward .
# Bush has placed his own papers , and those of his father , the former president , “ outside the public eye and empowered himself to keep Congress in the dark about intelligence matters .
# Bush has increased the authority of the Central Intelligence Agency to empower its director to block declassification of CIA information unless disclosure is authorized by the president .
# Bush has extended time that information can be kept classified from 10 to 25 years and this period may be extended even longer .
“ Blanket closures of INS ( Immigration and Naturalization Service ) proceedings and absolute gags on disclosure of related information eviscerate the time - honored constitutional protection of open public trials , ” Ross writes .
She noted the federal government “ arrested and refused to identify hundreds of aliens who either may be connected to terrorism as material witnesses or who may have visa or other INS infractions . ”
An INS directive issued promptly after September 11 , 2001 , mandated absolute closure of all deportation hearings in cases the agency determined to be of “ special interest ” to the war on terrorism , Ross said .
The INS judges could gag aliens from disclosing anything learned in closed proceedings and an INS regulation requires states and localities housing federal detainees to withhold all information about them .
Ross noted , though , a U.S. Court of Appeals judge struck down the INS closures and a U.S. District Court Judge in Washington ordered the Justice Department to disclose the names of more than 1,100 non-U.S. citizens detained at some point in connection with terrorism .
Ross asserts , “ Legislation championed as essential to protect the nation against terrorist threats allows the federal government to spy on its citizens , to detain them in secret without charges , to prosecute them based on secret evidence , and to prohibit parties to the trial from discussing related information . ”
Ross writes the merest perusal of some Bush initiatives shows it has reversed the presumption of open government : “ Although the now prevailing presumption of closed government is masked in subtle nuances of language and interpretive guidelines , we may liken the shift to the sea change that would occur in our criminal justice system if we moved from a presumption of innocent until proven guilty to an assumption of guilty until proven innocent . ”
Granting the Bush administration has imposed its sweeping secrecy policies in the name of national security , Ross contends this exchange is “ unacceptable . ”
“ The trade - off , secrecy for security , is a sham , ” she writes .
“ The citizenry gives up its vital check on abuse of government power and gains little in return .
” “ A shadow government that operates in secrecy , ” Ross continues , “ does not advance the security of its citizens .
Ignorance is not security .
Safety is not increased when citizens are blinded by government deception and distortion .
Government does not better serve its electorate when it operates with impunity . ”

Cusack slams corporate media , talks up new movie ' War , Inc. ' in wide - ranging interview Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Wednesday May 7 , 2008

Print This Email This Want to attend a screening of War , Inc. for free with two Raw Story writers ?
Want John Cusack to see your talent as a limerick writer ?
See details at the end of the interview .
Actor , writer , director John Cusack has a lot to say about the Iraq war and the current state of US politics .
Although he frequently uses such forums as the Huffington Post to express his criticism of the Bush administration , in his new film , War Inc. , he really pulls out all the stops to shine a damningly aggressive light on the privatization of war .
Cusack sat down with Raw Story 's Larisa Alexandrovna to discuss the film , his political views and his take on the state of mainstream media , which he feels has failed in its role as the public watchdog .
" I think in a way you can almost respect the criminals more than the enablers in some sick way -- I mean , I think what the Bush administration has done is criminal , should be treated as a crime , but the idea that people who call themselves journalists let these lies go on unchecked and endorsed them time and time again is [ unpardonable ] , " Cusack said .
" Do n't get me wrong , I think great journalism is heroic , I am in awe of great journalists . "
The journalists Cusack goes on to praise are a small contingent -- including the legendary Bill Moyers , Naomi Klein , Sy Hersh and Keith Olbermann .
Cusack also credits alternative press outlets like Raw Story and blogs like Crooks and Liars with keeping the public informed .
War , Inc. is not subtle as far as satire goes , but it is precisely the sledgehammer hit -- the " shock " of the totally outlandish and suffocating all - over - the - place bombing of the viewer 's senses -- that makes the film a truly onomatopoeic visual to the audacious crimes it is ridiculing on screen .
The plot revolves around a corporate hit -man , Brand Hauser ( Cusack ) , who is hired by a corrupt US defense contractor called Tamerlane to assassinate the oil minister of the fictional Middle Eastern country of Turaqistan , which has been invaded by the United States .
Tamerlane 's CEO is a former United States Vice President , played brilliantly by Dan Aykroyd and obviously based on the current real life Vice President and former Halliburton CEO , Dick Cheney .
Asked what Cusack would say to Vice President Dick Cheney if he had the opportunity , Cusack wisecracks , " You have the right to remain silent . "
Cusack is far more serious on the topic of torture and violations of the Geneva Conventions by Bush administration officials .
" You know , Nuremberg [ the post World War II Nuremberg trials of the leaders and enablers of Nazi Germany ] said that an illegal invasion of a sovereign country in a war of aggression is a supreme war crime . "
Cusack wonders why no one in the press has made this a bigger issue and why Democrats in Congress have not made it a priority .
A clip from the movie appears below , followed by RAW STORY 's exclusive interview .
Raw Storys Larisa Alexandrovna :
So what made you want to make a film ?
I mean what possessed you to wake up one day and say to yourself " I want to make a dark comedy about the Iraq war and corporate greed " ?
John Cusack :
Well , I think there is like a great tradition of satire or absurdist comedy that mocks and tries to take down power elites and orthodoxies whether its the church or the aristocracy or the state .
It is not really a new idea for example the carnival , or the Marx Brothers , Preston Sturges , Terry Southern , [ Bertolt ]
Brecht are all obviously great influences RS : Is Terry Gilliam an influence here ?
Because stylistically War Inc. , resembles that sort of gritty visual that combines a WWII - era setting , that is actually taking place in some detached and random future where technology has advanced significantly , but society is still set in the past , like in his classic Brazil JC :
Oh yes , absolutely and even [ Franz ] Kafka .
There is so much I would even say the incendiary political cartoons of George Grosz or the writings of Hunter S. Thompson there are so many influences and traditions of this type of thought , satire with teeth or comedy as serious business to escape and laugh at things that are not supposed to be funny .
It is supposed to make you think but not overtly .
You are not sure if you should be laughing or what it means to laugh .
RS : Yes , of course .
The rebellion - in - a - safe - setting - type thing .
But what prompted you 
John Cusack  to say I am going to make a black comedy about the Iraq war ?
JC : Yes , a very long winded answer RS :
No , I really like it because it provides insight and because I particularly like this genre ...
JC : Well I am going to meander because I have been talking non-stop for a week RS :
That is fine , I tend to meander as a matter of course , so go right ahead .
JC : ( laughs )
Okay .
I think in the kind of postmodern way , the aristocracy today  where it used to be the Bishop , the popes , the royals , etc.  is now the corporate aristocracy RS :
The gilded age JC : Right and so what made me do it [ make the film ] was what I thought was behind the Iraqi invasion , a kind of corporatist ideology that has been trying to take over and engulf the great things about America and the American dream you know ?
RS : Yes .
The first fully privatized war with non-privatized casualties .
Reality Plus  the Film JC : I think so .
In fact , it is really taking trends to their logical conclusions and there has been a movement in the last 35 years I think , a corporate revolution to replace the state .
If you read The Shock Doctrine [ by Naomi Klein ] plus other books about this stuff , and there is a lot out there , you can see this trend .
Although Naomi is on the vanguard as a journalist , reporter , and thinker and she puts it together in a ground - breaking way .
RS : Is this based on The Shock Doctrine ?
I mean you putting the screenplay together around the time she was writing it ?
JC : No actually , we were working on the film and her piece " Baghdad Year Zero " came out in Harpers , and it inspired us to dig deeper .
And as we were making the film , we sent her the script 
I was lucky enough to become friends with her  and so we sent her the script and we asked her what she thought and she was totally on - board , as a friend .
She was not an official collaborator or anything , but she was very supportive .
RS : The book is amazing .
I have read it twice already .
As you say the ideas are not new , but the distillation of those ideas and those histories into a single , measurable cause - effect narrative is indeed groundbreaking .
By the way , I really enjoyed your interview with her as well .
JC : Oh , thanks .
Yeah , she has been really supportive of the film .
She calls it  Reality Plus RS : I was actually thinking of it having the sub - title " Entitlement Capitalism " I mean , is that right essentially ?
The idea that is ?
For example your characters name , Brand Hauser seems to be a play on words .
Because I was thinking that Hauser could be based on the foundling Kasper Hauser and then the Brand together could easily translate into Entitlement Capitalism is the character based on Kasper Hauser ?
I am reading way too much into it arent I ? JC : I think you are half right .
I think Hauser sounds like Howitzer .
But yeah , when you think of something funny to say and it is in the back of your mind , like this little secret and I was aware of Kasper Hauser , so it may have translated and I was aware of the language of films and having genres and trying to subvert genres through language .
Just like the right - wing uses the aesthetics of authoritarianism , its kind of American patriotism is the cover for what they do .
They use a sort of frontier model where George Bush plays cowboy and so the idea of branding of images is all connected in this way with the character .
RS : Right and there is also the whole double entendre of branding  as in cattle , the ownership society .
But your character , does he represent something more than what we see ?
That is to say , outside of the obvious branding concept and him being a hit - man , does he represent something more internal ?
For example  does he represent a struggle between the persons choice to do a thing and their feelings ultimately about that choice ?
Again , I may be reading far too much into it , so just humor me JC : I think there is this element , you know , when you are playing around with archetypes and we do try to keep the emotions of characters vital as they shift from the surreal to seriousness to dark comedy to melodrama so within that you are working with a lot of archetypes and I think Hauser is kind of like a full - spectrum Samurai , you know ?
Samurai are these warriors with a code and they are sort of left really wandering around as guns for hire .
So they are mercenaries and they have been corrupted and then they leave a corrupt situation and try to on their own make an allegiance in a corrupt world .
Wandering around a fallen world , that type of archetype .
We thought of that , and plus the assassin metaphor is a particularly good one of our foreign policy , because Hauser does not necessarily equate who he is with what he does .
RS : And the mask or the will to go on to do what he does is located in this drink you have him constantly imbibing in the film ,  Donny Loo 's Fever Juice .
Is that the point of the drink , as a transformative device ?
JC :
We thought it would be really funny that he has this thing that he takes that blocks out but also gives him a kick start .
It s a public show , a test too .
Remember [ Watergate burglar ] G. Gordon
Liddy used to put a flame to his arm , to burn his flesh to prove that he still had the discipline kind of thing RS :
At parties no less JC : Really ?
RS : : Yeah , he would stand around at parties and put his hand over a candle , holding it there without flinching .
Or at least that is what Deep Throat tells us in All the Presidents Men [ Pulitzer Prize winning book about Watergate by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein ] .
Yes , it is one hell of a party trick for a sociopath .
JC : [ laughs ]
So this is our G. Gordon Liddy party trick .
I mean it was for him , Hauser , that he does it and it is this mixture of jet propulsion and self flagellation RS :
Ah , so there is an element of guilt , no ?
JC : Yeah , I think so .
Or there is an element of trying to drown out his past .
RS : Did you actually make some sort of concoction to drink as a prop ?
What was in there anyway ?
JC : I mixed up some tomato juice .
RS : That s it ?
JC : Well tomato juice and tobacco .
RS : And speaking of hit - men , this is your second one , no ?
JC : Um yeah , it is actually .
RS : [ Laughs ]
So how do you actually get ready for roles like this .
Do you go out and sniff out hit - men from somewhere , or do you locate some random retired CIA guy to talk to , or do you just wing it ?
JC : I know a lot about that sort of thing .
You know ultimately I was more worried trying to get the film together .
RS : So are we going to see another hit -man ?
JC : [ Laughs ]
I dont know RS : Now how did you and Josh Seftel agree on who would do what ?
Did you sit down together and decide who would do what and who would be cast in what role ?
JC : We worked together real close .
It was very collaborative .
But you know , we did not have a lot of time or money so we had to come in and shoot fast RS :
So wait , were you guys having a hard time getting a distributor for the film ?
Political Censorship is on the March JC :
Oh yeah , it was really hard to get a break for it RS : Why ?
JC : Because its crazy RS :
Well crazy or not , look at the line - up for Christs sake JC : : Yeah , but that s not how they think .
You have to understand the time it was made .
I mean the statue [ of Saddam Hussein ] had just fallen .
Bush was strutting around like a conquering hero and they were standing up on podiums saying  these people better watch what they say ,  queuing all these McCarthyism threats so there wasnt anybody rushing to take on the neo -con agenda and how it is destroying this country and the whole corporatist war , this cancer devouring our society .
I dont think the financiers wanted to take the risk .
They did not understand it .
RS : But you finally did get it made and it is finally coming out .
Are you now finding it easier to get it into theaters ?
JC : I think everyone has been really surprised .
People thought that because it is so controversial and structurally totally a little experimental  you know telling someone you want to do a film that is essentially an incendiary political cartoon , part Telemundo soap opera , part George Grosz  and yeah , they will say okay ! ( laughs ) let s release it RS : : Yeah , where do I sign up for this extravaganza type - thing JC : Yeah , but as people have seen it , there has been a rush to use it as a springboard in the media to talk about these ideas [ behind the film ] , and ultimately they [ the studios and distributors ] are seeing now that people are getting it , more than they thought would get it .
RS : You mean people in the political The Grassroots and Blogs Drive Exposure for the Film JC : People like you .
People who are interested in it and they / you want to do stories about it , write about it .
So we have gotten way more media interest in it that anyone ever thought we would .
RS : And probably broader interest because , for example , I dont usually do movie reviews  despite being a cinema buff .
So if you have me coming out to write about the film as opposed to just quietly enjoying it , then it is indicative of the broader interest of the public in the underlying issues behind the film .
JC : : Yeah , so we have all these reporters , journalists , people who do who dont regularly write about movies wanting to write about it RS :
Right I see this doing extremely well and across all levels of interest .
Even if people dont get the issues driving this film , the style will get them into theaters .
For me anyway , this whole genre from Terry Gilliam to the much darker side of it with David Cronenberg is breathtaking anyway .
So I think it will do very well .
And once people who initially go to the film for stylistic reasons actually get into the theater , they are invited in , the rest translates for them .
JC : I hope so .
First Look , the studio , has a very limited budget .
But we have so much national press coming in from so many quarters that if they can sell out to the limited theaters we have now , they will expand it nationally .
And the thing is , it is a total grass - roots vibe .
Like it has not come top down we have not gotten any big corporate support .
It s all coming from political writers and journalists who do not even write about movies , like Raw Story , and from the progressive blogs like Crooks and Liars .
All those types of people have been kind of swarming around it .
So now , some of the bigger corporate media are like oh , whats that movie ?  or what s everybody talking about ?...
RS :
The movie they had initially passed on , which First Look had the balls to take on JC : Oh , absolutely .
A lot of them would not even touch it even five months ago .
When we put out word [ asking people in the press to cover it ] they were like oh I dont know if I see the world that way ,  and now it has totally shifted .
 Corporate press propaganda RS : See , I dont even know if the whole public - shift thing has happened or , rather , I never believed in this whole pendulum of shifting public opinions .
I just think what has happened now is that more and more of the public understands that what they are being sold they never wanted to buy .
They just dont want to participate anymore and are turning to alternative resources for information , news , etc .
Once you understand how we got into the Iraq war to begin with actually , this brings me to my next question sort of organically .
Do you think the corporate press is as much responsible for how we are in Iraq as is the Bush administration ?
JC : I think in a way you can almost respect the criminals more than the enablers in some sick way I mean , I think what the Bush administration has done is criminal , should be treated as a crime , but the idea that people who call themselves journalists let these lies go on unchecked and endorsed them time and time again is [ unpardonable ]
Dont get me wrong , I think great journalism is heroic , I am in awe of great journalists .
But the criminals
Like the other day it was on TV that Bush had admitted to approving meetings in the White House about enhanced interrogation techniques RS :
You mean torture JC :
Well yes , that is where I was going RS : [ Laughs ]
Sure , sure .
JC : Those are the semiotics RS : State sanctioned even JC : Right .
And so here you have the President of the United States admitting on television that he not only authorized torture but has made it a for - profit industry .
So at least he , these people , have the courage to be the criminals that they are .
The media , the journalists nothing , no follow - up questions .
You can see them going ,  Oh let s just go back to talking about Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and considering how to knee - cap them both , or talking about how Obama is or is not an elitist .
Dont get me wrong , I am not making a blanket condemnation of all journalists RS : Yes , well thank you .
JC : : No , no I am in awe of great journalism .
But these people , the corporate press I mean how many times does Dick Cheney go on Meet the Press and just get softballs from Tim Russert ?
That is what I mean and yeah , I think the corporate press is absolutely culpable [ for the Iraq war ] .
RS : Or  lets play spot the propaganda  how about The New York Times and Judith Millers pre-Iraq war articles , five articles .
JC : How about when they did the Iraq round - up with all these people [ reporters ] and nobody talked about how invading a sovereign country in a war of aggression is a war crime .
You know , Nuremburg said [ the post WWII Nuremburg trials of Nazi- German leaders and enablers ] that an illegal invasion of a sovereign country in a war of aggression is a supreme war crime .
RS : Yes , absolutely true .
In fact , a former chief prosecutor in the Nuremburg trials , Benjamin Ferencz ( he successfully convicted 22 Nazi officers ) has recently said that prima facie case can be made that the United States is guilty of the supreme crime against humanity , that being an illegal war of aggression against a sovereign nation . "
JC : Right .
You can go back to the Hague and what happened there RS : I wish we could go back to the Hague But I wanted to say regarding your point about the courage of criminals .
You are right , we expect criminals to be criminals , so there is no surprise there  perhaps not so overtly audacious  but we expect a criminal to be just what they are .
For me , obviously just my own opinion is that I think the corporate press should be held more responsible [ for the Iraq war ] because the public has put their trust
In them to protect them from the government machinations , distortions , lies , especially in matters of life and death .
JC : That is exactly my point .
We are in violent agreement RS : I prefer violent agreement over violent disagreement .
JC : That is something my father always says , that we are in violent agreement . 
But I also think the same thing could be said of the Democrats , who I have some sympathy for but not much .
RS : : You mean the current Congressional Democrats ?
JC : : Yeah .
I mean [ House Speaker Nancy ]
Pelosi said impeachment is off the table .
What does that mean ?
I mean does that mean that someone can commit a crime and it just goes unaccountable until maybe a Democrat can win the White House ?
RS : I think it means that Congress has abdicated its duty .
JC : Dont get me wrong .
I dont mean to make a blanket statement .
I am a great fan of [ Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , Democrat ] John Conyers , of [ Democratic Senator ] Russ Feingold , of [ Democratic Congresswoman ] Jan Schakowsky .
So I dont want to make blanket statements , but there are those Democrats in Congress who are compromised , just like many of the mainstream journalists .
You know , I dont think Keith Olbermann has rolled over or Naomi Klein , so I dont want to make blanket generalizations .
RS : I would throw in  in terms of courageous journalists  Jonathan Landay and Warren Strobel , or what we call them in - house as the McClatchy boys .
JC : Yeah , the McClatchy papers are fantastic RS : Sy Hersh JC : Yeah and Bill Moyers , who is a life - long hero of mine RS : Yep , mine too .
But what you are basically pointing to are the investigative journalists , and although not mentioned , I would add the non-corporate or alternative press .
JC : Yes and the alternative press for sure .
RS : One more question , if you could say anything to Dick Cheney , what would you say ?
JC : You have the right to remain silent .
RS : [ Laughs ]
So we end our talk with a citizens arrest .
Good work .
Thanks for taking the time to sit down with me .
JC : Thank you , my pleasure .

The popular BitTorrent site Mininova just released a set of new features , including music torrent streaming .
The new music streaming feature uses a Java applet developed by BitLet , which is easy to use and compatible with all Java - enabled browsers .
With the new music streaming feature users can listen to individual music tracks , streamed from . torrent files .
It is integrated in the featured torrents section , which lists all the distributors that take part in Mininova ’s content distribution platform .
An example of a streamable torrent is this track .
If you want to stream music torrents that are not listed in the featured section , you ’ll need to use the Bitlet website .
The service currently supports mp3 and ogg / vorbis files .
BitTorrent streaming is not restricted to music files , and indeed , Erik , one of the founders of Mininova told TorrentFreak that they are currently looking into the possibility of video streaming via BitTorrent as well .
He said that Mininova will start a private BETA test of the BitTorrent video streaming integration in a few weeks .
Together with the music streaming capability , Mininova published some other new features including comment tracking , which gives users an overview of all the comments they recently made .
Another new feature that might come in handy is the manual refresh of the seeder and leecher statistics that logged in users now have .
Finally , every self respecting BitTorrent sites now has its own toolbar .
Isohunt and The Pirate Bay launched one a few weeks ago , so Mininova could n’t stay behind .
Personally I ’m not a huge fan of these toobars , but some people seem to like it .
The good news is , the toolbars are malware free , and generate some extra revenue via the integrated search box .
It ’s good to see that Mininova and other BitTorrent sites continue to add new features , and improve the service to their users .
Are you interested in getting orders - of - magnitude performance increases over standard multi-core processors , while programming with a high - level language such as C ?
And would you like that capability to scale across many devices as well ?
Many people ( myself included ) have achieved this level of performance and scalability on non-trivial problems by using CUDA ( short for " Compute Unified Device Architecture " ) from NVIDIA to program inexpensive multi- threaded GPUs .
I purposefully stress " programming " because CUDA is an architecture designed to let you do your work , rather than forcing your work to fit within a limited set of performance libraries .
With CUDA , you get to exploit your abilities to design software to achieve best performance on your multi- threaded hardware -- and have fun as well because figuring out the right mapping is captivating , plus the software development environment is both reasonable and straightforward .
This is the first of a series of articles to introduce you to the power of CUDA -- through working code -- and to the thought process to help you map applications onto multi- threaded hardware ( such as GPUs ) to get big performance increases .
Of course , not all problems can be mapped efficiently onto multi- threaded hardware , so part of my thought process will be to distinguish what will and what wo n't work , plus provide a common - sense idea of what might work " well - enough " .
" CUDA programming " and " GPGPU programming " are not the same ( although CUDA runs on GPUs ) .
Previously , writing software for a GPU meant programming in the language of the GPU .
An acquaintance of mine once described this as a process similar to pulling data out of your elbow to get it to where you could look at it with your eyes .
CUDA permits working with familiar programming concepts while developing software that can run on a GPU .
It also avoids the performance overhead of graphics layer APIs by compiling your software directly to the hardware ( GPU assembly language , for instance ) , thereby providing great performance .
The choice of CUDA device is up to you .
Figures 1 and 2 show the CUDA N - body simulation program running on both a laptop and a discrete GPU based desktop PC .
Can CUDA really increase application performance by one to two orders of magnitude -- or is all this hype rather than reality ?
CUDA is a fairly new technology but there are already many examples in the literature and on the Internet highlighting significant performance boosts using current commodity GPU hardware .
Tables 1 and 2 show summaries posted on the NVIDIA and Beckman Institute websites .
At the heart of CUDA is the ability for programmers to keep thousands of threads busy .
The current generation of NVIDIA GPUs can efficiently support a very large number of threads , and as a result they can deliver one to two orders of magnitude performance increase in application performance .
These graphics processors are widely available to anyone at almost any price point .
Newer boards will expand CUDA 's capabilities by providing greater memory bandwidth , asynchronous data transfer , atomic operations , and double - precision floating point arithmetic among many hardware improvements .
Look for the CUDA software environment to expand as the technology evolves and we eventually lose the distinction between GPUs and " many - core " processors .
As developers , we have to anticipate that applications with many thousands of active threads will become common - place and look for CUDA to run on many platforms , including general - purpose processors .

The Mars rover " Spirit " is indicated by a circle on " Home Plate " in this new image of Gusev Crater on Mars .
This detail is part of a much larger image the HiRISE camera took on Sept. 27 , 2007 .
The rover has since driven north .

The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment , or HiRISE , camera onboard NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has taken a new color image of the feature dubbed " Home Plate " in Gusev Crater on Mars .
The Mars Exploration Rover " Spirit " shows up inside the perimeter of Home Plate , where it was when HiRISE took the image on Sept. 27 , 2007 , at 2:19 p.m. local Mars time , HiRISE team member Ken Herkenhoff of the U.S. Geological Survey , Flagstaff , said .
Spirit is driving toward the safe , north - facing slopes on the north side of Home Plate , which is toward the top of the image .
There it will be positioned to tilt its solar panels toward the sun for the long Martian winter .
Home Plate is a flat , raised feature that is probably a remnant of a deposit emplaced by an ancient eruption , Herkenhoff added .
The new color image of Home Plate was created using the camera 's blue - green and red channels , Herkenhoff said .
At the time , the camera was flying about 270 kilometers , or about 168 miles , over the surface .
At that distance , the camera could resolve objects about 81 centimeters , or about 32 inches , across .
The sun was about 56 degrees above the horizon in the winter afternoon sky .
The HiRISE image of Home Plate and others are on the HiRISE Website , hirise.lpl.arizona.edu .
HiRISE operations are based at The University of Arizona in Tucson .
Professor Alfred S. McEwen of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory is principal investigator for the experiment .
The HiRISE camera is the most powerful camera ever to orbit another planet .
It has taken thousands of black - and - white images , and hundreds of color images , since it began science operations in 2006 .
A single HiRISE image will often be a multigigabyte image that measures 20,000 pixels by 50,000 pixels , which includes a 4,000 - by - 50,000 pixel region in three colors .
It can take a computer up to three hours to process such an image .

The Israeli newspaper Ma’ariv on Wednesday reported that Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu told an audience at Bar Ilan university that the September 11 , 2001 terror attacks had been beneficial for Israel .
“ We are benefiting from one thing , and that is the attack on the Twin Towers and Pentagon , and the American struggle in Iraq , ” Ma’ariv quoted the former prime minister as saying .
He reportedly added that these events “ swung American public opinion in our favor . ”
Netanyahu reportedly made the comments during a conference at Bar - Ilan University on the division of Jerusalem as part of a peace deal with the Palestinians .
Meanwhile , Iran ’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad cast doubt over the veracity of the September 11 attacks Thursday , calling it a pretext to invade Afghanistan and Iraq .
“ Four or five years ago , a suspicious event occurred in New York .
A building collapsed and they said that 3,000 people had been killed but never published their names , ” Ahmadinejad told Iranians in the holy city of Qom .

Ingmar Bergman ’s famous 1957 movie
The Seventh Seal takes place during the 14th century , when Europe is in the midst of a major epidemic of the bubonic plague — the Black Death — which ultimately killed about half the population .
A Swedish knight , Antonius Block , returns from the Crusades and finds Death waiting for him .
He challenges Death , later seen disguised as a priest , to a chess match , hoping to stave off his own death by devising what he hopes is a winning next move .
For the past three decades , researchers and health workers have engaged in a similar battle against one of the most cunning viruses to afflict humanity and much of the animal world : the dread influenza virus .
This pathogen is even smarter than Death ; it continuously changes the appearance of its chess pawns — the proteins on its coat — so that im­ - mune systems do not recognize the new disguise .
Every year the World Health Organization and other institutions try to predict the next change in the virus ’s coat .
Once the WHO decides on the likeliest alterations , drug manufacturers then have only a few months to develop vaccines .
“ The whole infrastructure required for the preparation of seasonal vaccines has enormous disadvantages , ” remarks Walter Fiers , a molecular biologist at Ghent University in Belgium .
“ It is slow — sometimes we miss the strain that becomes predominant — and if a pandemic should arrive , we will not be prepared . ”
Fiers ’s goal : a universal vaccine that , like some childhood immunizations , would confer lifelong immunity .
Scientists have dreamed for decades of a one - shot approach to stop the flu— particularly influenza A , the most serious type .
But the task is daunting .
The appearance - changing coat of the influenza virus is studded with mainly two proteins : hemagglutinin , which allows the virus to attach to and enter a cell ; and neuraminidase , which boosts the virus ’s ability to pass to other cells .
( These proteins serve as the basis for influenza nomenclature ; for instance , the H5N1 virus refers to specific classes of hemagglutinin and neura­minidase , which in this example correspond to an avian flu subtype . )
The genes responsible for these proteins undergo frequent point mutations , resulting in genetic “ drift ” ; moreover , the genes from different animal and human strains may also interchange , resulting in genetic “ shift . ”
Both drift and shift make these proteins unrecognizable to the antibodies present in people that were previously inoculated against the flu virus , which now circulates as more than 90 strains .
Unlike the hapless knight Block , the 77 - year - old Fiers believes that he has found his adversary ’s Achilles ’ heel : although the virus is good at disguising its pawns , there is one on its coat that it cannot change .
That pawn , the external part of a protein called M2 , should be the target for vaccination , he says .
Fiers has come to this conclusion after five decades of work in molecular biology — in particular , decoding genomes .
In 1972 he and his team were the first to publish the nucleotide sequence of a complete gene .
This gene codes for the coat protein of a bacteria - infecting virus , or bacteriophage .
Four years later they published the bacteriophage ’s complete genome — all four genes of it .
“ This was the first complete genome that was sequenced , ” Fiers recalls .
Because of its medical importance , he decided around that time to focus on the influenza virus .
In 1980 Fiers first sequenced the gene for hemagglutinin derived from the human influenza strain H3N2 that circulated in 1965 .
He then compared the hema­g­glut­inin gene of this strain with a similar hem­ag­glut­inin gene derived from the strain that had started the 1968 Hong Kong pandemic .
His analysis proved that point mutations account for genetic drift .
Equally important , his studies led him to see how the virus can jump species through genetic shifts .
At that time scientists knew that antibodies from people infected by the 1968 pandemic virus also reacted with an influenza strain isolated in 1963 from flu - ridden ducks .
Fiers investigated the nucleotide sequence of the hemagglutinin gene of this duck virus and found that it was indeed very closely related to the strain that started the 1968 Hong Kong outbreak .
Today infectious disease experts recognize that an avian flu virus could genetically change enough to trigger a human pandemic .
If such a jump occurred , the virus “ would not be hindered by any preexisting immunity in the human population , ” Fiers explains .
“ It would spread fast over the world because when it arrived here it would look like an entirely different virus .
Therefore , you need a vaccine that is not invalidated by drift or shift . ”
More specifically , he needed a vaccine based on a part of the influenza virus that does not change .
Fiers found it in the viral coat protein M2 , which creates a pore in the coat .
Specifically , he noticed that a section of that protein , called M2e , remains stable even as the other viral surface proteins mutate .
The M2 protein , however , occurs only in small numbers on the virus , which is too low to set off a good immune response .
The obvious solution was to amplify the number of M2e segments .
But how ?
Fiers turned to the liver - attacking hepatitis B virus .
This pathogen has an inner protein core called HBc , and something intriguing happens when the gene for HBc is inserted into the bacterium Escherichia coli .
The bacterium starts producing HBc proteins and assembles them to produce viruslike particles .
Fiers found that by linking M2e genes to HBc genes , the bacteria would produce viruslike particles studded with M2e .
In tests with mice and , later , ferrets , the M2e - HBc particles caused the formation of antibodies directed against M2e , thereby protecting the animals from a lethal dose of influenza .
The vaccine works differently from conventional vaccines in that it does not prevent infection directly .
“ The target is not the virus , but the target is the virus - infected cell , ” Fiers says .
“ If at an early stage , you can kill off these cells , then you will counteract the infection . ”
In 1997 Fiers received a patent for the technology , and in 1999 he published a paper in Nature Medicine expounding his approach .
The British - American company Acambis , based in Cambridge , Mass. , and Cambridge , England , has obtained the license to start production of the vaccine .
In a phase I trial completed last year , Acam­bis found that among the 79 volunteers who received the vaccine , 90 percent developed antibodies to the M2e segment .
Whether the antibodies protect against influenza now needs to be determined — no guarantee if the past is any guide .
A decade ago a drug based on an internal protein of the flu virus , called NP ( for nucleoprotein ) , set the immune system ’s killer T cells into action , but it only partially protected mice from the flu .
Because intentionally infecting a volunteer to see if a vaccine works is unethical , the compound will have to face large field trials .
“ We have to find an area where there is a higher probability that an influenza epidemic will take place , ” Fiers says .
The likeliest places are where dense human populations live near farm animals .
Thousands of people will have to be vaccinated to obtain statistically acceptable results .
( The current version of the M2 vaccine would protect only against influenza A , the type that has launched pandemics . )
The pharmaceutical industry is showing strong interest , and Arnold Monto , an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor , thinks that this universal vaccine is promising .
Still , “ whether it will be sufficient without having other proteins in there , I ’m not sure , ” Monto says , referring to a possible need to use seasonal flu vaccines as supplements .
The chess battle against influenza will have to continue for a while longer , but for now hopes are high that playing the M2 vaccine might be the right strategy to checkmate the virus .
I 'm an avid reader , but suffice it to say none of these epic works are on my priority list at the moment ( Bonfire of the Vanities is next in my lineup , in case you were curious ) .
10 of the Longest Novels Ever Published
1. The Blah Story by Nigel Tomm .
3,277,227 words , which ends up being 7312 pages .
And I thought The Stand was long ( it 's only 1168 pages ) .
2. Marienbad My Love by Mark Leach .
It is supposedly the world 's longest published novel in English at 2.5 million words .
If you have some extra time , you can read it at marienbadmylove.com .
3. ArtamÃ¨ne by Madeleine de ScudÃ©ry .
It was published in ten volumes but considered a single work and contains 2.1 million words .
If you 're fluent in French , you can read it at artemene.org .
4 . A la recherche du temps perdu by Marcel Proust .
No doubt Frank , the number one Proust scholar in America from Little Miss Sunshine would have read this even though it 's 1.5 million words long .
The English translation is Remembrance of Things Past or In Search of Lost Time .
5. Mission Earth by L. Ron Hubbard .
I 'm sure Tom Cruise has this one memorized since it 's only 1.2 million words .
6. Gordana by Marija Juric Zagorka .
Maria Juric , AKA Zagorka , was one of the first popular female writers in Croatia .
No word count , but based on its 5200 page count , Gordana makes the list at number six .
7. Sironia , Texas by Madison Cooper .
It 's roughly 1.1 million words ; 1731 pages .
A " little " story about small - town Texas .
8. Clarissa by Samuel Richardson .
Clarissa explains it all in about 969,000 words .
I 'm sorry ; I know that was a terrible joke .
I just could n't help myself .
9 . A Dance to the Music of Time by Anthony Powell
This one is a little iffy , because it 's sometimes regarded as a novel sequence and not one novel .
Like Clarissa , it 's just shy of one million words .
10 . Poor Fellow My Country by Xavier Herbert
This is the longest Australian novel ever written at 850,000 words .
" What about War and Peace ? " you are probably wondering .
" What about Les Miserables ?
Gone With the Wind ? " Nah .
Those are practically novellas at 560,000 words , 513,000 words and 419,218 words respectively .
We 've seen an A4 - sized sheet of e-paper or two in our day , but Epson 's new prototype display features an absurdly high resolution for its size : 3104 x 4128 , clocking it in at something like 385 p pi .
According to Fareastgizmos , E Ink 's supplying the , um , electronic ink , while Seiko Epson built out the low - temperature polycrystal Si-TFT glass substrate medium .
Yeah , we 've got a long ways to go before we 'll all be reading the e-paper morning news on the way to work , but it can't be that long , can it ?

http://digg.com/general_sciences/Fourteen_Points_of_Agreement_World_Trade_Center_Destruction
A letter has just been published in a mainstream , peer - reviewed scientific engineering journal ; this is significant because the authors , Dr. Steven E. Jones , Dr. Frank M. Legge , Kevin R. Ryan , Anthony F. Szamboti , James R. Gourley are known for hypothesizing that on 9/11 WTC 1 , 2 & 7 were destroyed by controlled demolition .
In their letter they seek to reach agreement on grounds for " productive discussion " on the subject of the destruction of WTC 1 , 2 & 7 , based on the 14 points outlined in the letter Fourteen Points of Agreement with Official Government Reports on the World Trade Center Destruction http://www.bentham-open.org/pages/content.php?TOCIEJ/2008/00000002/00000001/35TOCIEJ.SGM, which are in turn based on assertions of fact already made by NIST and FEMA .
Given that the authors agree with the NIST and FEMA reports on all 14 points listed in the article , what 's the issue ?
The issue is that the NIST and FEMA reports appear to be grossly inadequate , contradicting both their own conclusions and established facts .
Read and see for yourself whether or not you agree ; now that this has been published , the scientific community will be debating it .
Coinciding with the publication of Fourteen Points of Agreement with Official Government Reports on the World Trade Center Destruction in the Open Access OCIEJ , Dr. Jones published it in full with commentary at 911Blogger.com http://www.911blogger.com/node/15081 .
Dr. Jones notes :
" With publication in an established civil engineering journal , the discussion has reached a new level - JREF 'ers and others may attack , but unless they can also get published in a peer - reviewed journal , those attacks do not carry nearly the weight of a peer - reviewed paper .
It may be that debunkers will try to avoid the fourteen issues we raise in the Letter , by attacking the author(s ) or even the journal rather than addressing the science - that would not surprise me .
Professor Chomsky wrote to several , who passed it on to me : " You , or anyone who agrees with you , has a very simple task .
Since the evidence is so obvious and compelling , submit an article about it to Science , or Nature , or even Scientific American , or more technical journals , say those in civil engineering , where your article can refute the conclusions of the professional society of civil engineers …
To date , no one has been willing to submit an article -- at least , after probably hundreds of inquiries to Truth Movement advocates , no one has been able to mention one ... "
Would someone who has received this note from Prof .
Chomsky please send him a copy of the downloaded paper ?
Perhaps we can build a bridge with him .
You might note that the paper is published in a " technical journal [ one of those ] in civil engineering , " to use his own words , which I took as sort of a challenge .
I have published before in Nature ( e.g. , May 1986 and April 1989 ) AND Scientific American ( July 1987 ) , and this paper in a civil engineering journal I consider to be a very significant step in the history . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Warren Buffett , the world ’s richest person , said on Monday the U.S. economy is in a recession that will be more severe than most people expect .
Warren Buffett , chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway , on Capitol Hill in Washington , November 14 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
Buffett made his comments on CNBC television after his Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.NBRKb.N agreed to invest $ 6.5 billion in the takeover of chewing gum maker Wm Wrigley Jr Co WWY .N by Mars Inc in a $ 23 billion transaction .
“ This is not a field of specialty for me , but my general feeling is that the recession will be longer and deeper than most people think , ” Buffett said .
“ This will not be short and shallow .
“ I think consumers are feeling gas and food prices , ” he added , “ and not feeling they ’ve got a lot of money for other things . ”
He was not immediately available for further comment .
Known for his frugality , the 77 - year - old Buffett has lived in the same 10 - room Omaha , Nebraska , house for a half - century , despite being worth an estimated $ 62 billion .
On Wednesday , the U.S. Commerce Department is expected to say how fast the economy grew in the first quarter .
Economists on average have projected that gross domestic product grew at an annualized 0.2 percent rate in the quarter .
Two quarters of declining GDP is a traditional indicator of recession .
That last happened in 2001 .
Economists expect the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday to cut a key lending rate for a seventh time beginning last September .
Berkshire is a $ 197 billion conglomerate best known for its insurance holdings , such as auto insurer Geico Corp , but it owns more than 70 businesses .
Many of those businesses are tied to the housing market , including Acme Brick Co , insulation maker Johns Manville , and the real estate brokerage HomeServices of America Inc .
Others depend on consumers to spend more on discretionary items , such as Ben Bridge Jeweler and Borsheims Fine Jewelry .
“ In the retail businesses ... if anything , they ’ve gotten a little worse , ” Buffett said .
“ Of course , things connected with housing , whether it ’s in brick or whether it ’s in carpet , those businesses have shown no uptick at all .
Jewelry had a bad Christmas ... and it stayed that way . ”
Buffett sees no respite from the housing slump .
“ I think this is going to be fairly long and fairly deep , but who knows , ” he said .
In March , Forbes magazine pegged Buffett 's net worth at $ 62 billion , ahead of Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim's $ 60 billion and Microsoft Corp MSFT .
O Chairman Bill Gates 's $ 58 billion .
Gates is a friend of Buffett and a Berkshire director .
Yet they were both thankful .
“ My colleagues said , ‘ You ’re the lucky one .
You do n’t know how many people died , ’ ” Ms. Li said .
Of the 28 hours , Mr. Wang said , “ It was more terrifying than facing the god of death . ”
Like for millions of Chinese , the life they knew was completely eradicated at 2:28 p.m. last Monday , when the 7.9 - magnitude earthquake sent wave after wave of tremors through the river valleys and glaciated mountains of Sichuan Province , one of the most beautiful corners of China .
Mr. Wang , 40 , had just returned home two days earlier , after traveling around the country for half a year and trying his hand at small businesses .
He had lost a lot of money .
He and his wife rarely spoke .
He spent the Chinese New Year in the city of Guangzhou by himself , skipping China ’s most important family holiday .
Mr. Wang is the kind of itinerant worker found in China by the millions , wandering from city to city in these boom years , and so it was chance that brought him home two days before the earthquake .
Ms. Li was raising their daughter , Xinyi , on her own while working at a chemical factory in the town of Luoshui .
“ My husband does n’t have a stable life , ” Ms. Li said .
“ He goes wherever he can get a job .
I told him , ‘ Why do n’t you have a rest ?
Stay away from business .
Just try and enjoy life for a while . ’ ”
Last Monday , she and her husband had just sat down in her fourth - floor apartment to watch a police soap opera on DVD when the dormitory , which houses dozens of factory workers , began shaking violently .
He flung an arm around her as they sprinted for the bathroom eight feet away .
The entire building collapsed right as they got there , knocking them to the ground .
The wooden bathroom door slammed against Mr. Wang ’s back .
Clouds of dust filled their lungs .
A small California aerospace company has just unveiled a new suborbital spaceship that will provide affordable front - seat rides to the edge of space for the millions of people who want to buy a ticket .
The company , XCOR Aerospace , of Mojave , CA , announced that its two - seat Lynx suborbital spaceship will carry people or payloads to where they will experience weightlessness and see the stars above and the Earth and its atmosphere below .
This will launch XCOR into the emerging space tourism market , estimated at over a half - billion dollars .
" The Lynx will offer affordable access to space for individuals , researchers and educators , ” said XCOR CEO Jeff Greason .
“ Future versions of Lynx will offer ever - improving capabilities for scientific and engineering research and commercial applications . "
The spaceship , roughly the size of a small private airplane , will first take off in 2010 and will be capable of flying several times each day .
“ We have designed this vehicle to operate much like a commercial aircraft .
Its liquid fuel engines will provide the enhanced safety , durability , reliability and maintainability that keep operating costs low , ” Greason said .
“ These engines will also minimize the impact of these flights on the environment , ” Greason added .
“ They are fully reusable , burn cleanly , and release fewer particulates than solid fuel or hybrid rocket motors . ”
“ Lynx will be the ‘ Greatest Ride Off Earth , ’ ” said XCOR test pilot , former pilot astronaut and Space Shuttle commander , Col. Rick Searfoss ( USAF - Ret . ) .
“ The acceleration , the weightlessness , and the view will provide you with an experience that is out of this world .
And the best part of it all is that you ’ll ride right up front , like a co-pilot , instead of in back , like cargo . ”
XCOR has nine years ’ experience developing reliable , reusable and non-toxic rocket propulsion systems and has already built and flown two different rocket - powered vehicles .
The firm designed , built and flew a rocket propulsion system on its record - setting EZ - Rocket aircraft .
The XCOR team then developed a more powerful engine with an advanced pump - fed fuel system for a larger aircraft now being flight - tested for a commercial customer .
Always blame the intern : John McCain 's campaign tells TMZ that it was a " low - level unpaid staff debacle " that resulted in a bunch of Food Network recipes being fobbed off as Cindy McCain 's on the Senator 's web page .
We 're told that the intern in question has been " swiftly dealt with " and that the site 's already been taken down .
Apparently , McCain 's peeps say , the web intern saw fit to " add Rachael Ray to our policy team " ( so droll , those McCainites ) and they apologize to the Food Network for the recipe - filching , as first observed by the Huffington Post .
BLOG ON CAMLCITY .ORG : O'Caml Explained
Using Polymorphic Variants - by Gerd Stolpmann , 2008-02-05
It is one of the coolest language constructs , but its conception leads sometimes to confusion .
O'Caml allows it to form ad - hoc unions of tagged values , the so - called polymorphic variants .
They are the free - style counterpart of the " normal " variant types .
We want to shed some light on this construction in this article , and encourage programmers to try it out .
The most baffling property of the polyvariants is that one can mix tags that come from different pieces of code .
We 'll give an example of that later in the text , but first let 's explain some foundations .
Syntactically , the tags are written with a leading reverse apostrophe , so for example `Apple is a ( value - less ) tag .
Like the normal variants the tags can have attached values , so for instance ` Pear " it 's sweet man " is a tag with a string value .
It is not required to declare polyvariant types , one can simply start creating such tagged values in the code .
Data Analysis Step - By - Step
Imagine we want to analyze a string .
In a first step , we would like to classify every character of the string , and determine whether it is a letter , a digit , or something else .
Using polyvariants , this function does the job :
let classify_chars s = let rec classify_chars_at p = if p < String.length s then let c = s.[p ] in let cls = match c with | ' 0 ' ..' 9 ' ->
` Digit c | ' A '..' Z' | ' a ' ..'z ' -> ` Letter c | _ ->
` Other c in cls :: classify_chars_at ( p+1 ) else [ ] in classify_chars_at 0
So this function would return this list for the input string " a56 * " :
[ ` Letter 'a ' ; ` Digit ' 5 ' ; ` Digit ' 6 ' ; ` Other '*' ]
Note that there is no type declaration !
If you enter this function into the O'Caml toploop , you see that its type is inferred like this :
val classify_chars : string -> [>
` Digit of char | ` Letter of char | ` Other of char ] list = < fun >
Read this as :
The function returns tagged values with tags ` Digit , ` Letter , or ` Other , and every tag has an attached character .
Note the " greater than " sign at the beginning of the tag list .
It means that this tag list is compatible with being mixed with completely unrelated tags .
There are also polyvariant types where this sign is reversed ( like in [ <...] ) , or completely missing .
We 'll come back to that later .
Back to our string analysis example .
We are now interested in recognizing integer numbers in the list of classified characters .
We assume our input is a list that contains ` Digit tags , but also other tags .
In the output list , sequences of ` Digit are replaced by `Number :
let recognize_numbers l = let rec recognize_at m acc = match m with | ` Digit d :: m ' -> let d_v = Char.code d - Char.code ' 0 ' in let acc ' = match acc with | Some v ->
Some ( 10 * v + d_v ) | None ->
Some d_v in recognize_at m' acc ' | x :: m ' -> ( match acc with | None -> x :: recognize_at m' None | Some v -> ( `Number v ) :: x :: recognize_at m' None ) | [ ] -> ( match acc with | None -> [ ]
| Some v -> ( `Number v ) :: [ ] ) in recognize_at l None
The inferred type of this function is now really strange :
val recognize_numbers : ( [>
` Digit of char | ` Number of int ] as ' a ) list -> ' a list =
Basically , it says that there is a tagged list as input , and that the output list has the same tags .
Furthermore , the " > " sign again signals extensibility , so we can not only use the tags mentioned in the function , but any other tag as well .
Especially , we are free to pass ` Letter and ` Other tags in :
recognize_numbers [ ` Digit ' 1 ' ; ` Digit ' 3 ' ; ` Letter 'a ' ; ` Digit ' 2 ' ; ` Other '*' ] yields [ ` Number 13 ; ` Letter 'a ' ; ` Number 2 ; ` Other '*']
Note that the type of the recognize_numbers function does not reflect all what we could know about the function .
We can be sure that the function will never return a ` Digit tag , but this is not expressed in the function type .
We have run into one of the cases where the O'Caml type system is not powerful enough to find this out , or even to write this knowledge down .
In practice , this is no real limitation - the types are usually a bit weaker than necessary , but it is unlikely that weaker types cause problems .
The really great thing about the polymorphic variants is that it is possible to mix tags that come from different contexts .
So in our example we can combine the two functions , and apply one after the other :
let analyze s = recognize_numbers ( classify_chars s )
It is no problem that classify_chars emits tags that are completely unknown to recognize_numbers .
And both functions can use the same tag , ` Digit , without having to declare in some way that they are meaning the same .
It is sufficient that the tag is the same , and that the attached value has the same type .
This may have big advantages for structuring programs .
Of course , our example of string analysis already benefits from the loose type correspondence the polyvariants make possible .
The problem can now be divided into several steps , and every step needs only to know the tags it operates on .
There is no global type all steps have to agree upon , rather every step sees only the fraction of type information that is needed for the task .
Limiting Tags
Compare these two functions :
let number_value1 t = match t with | ` Number n -> n | ` Digit d -> Char.code d - Char.code ' 0 ' let number_value2 t = match t with | ` Number n -> n | ` Digit d -> Char.code d - Char.code ' 0 ' | _ -> failwith
" This is not a number "
The difference is that the second version explicitly catches the case of " any other tag " whereas the first version leaves this unspecified .
This leads to different typings :
val number_value1 : [< ` Digit of char | ` Number of int ] -> int val number_value2 : [>
` Digit of char | ` Number of int ] -> int
So in the first version we have a " < " sign !
This sign usually only appears for input arguments , and means that the function can only process these tags ( or less tags ) , but no other tags .
The type checker prevents that any other tag can be passed in :
# number_value1 ( `Letter 'a ' ) ; ;
This expression has type [>
` Letter of char ] but is here used with type [< ` Digit of char | ` Number of int ]
In the second version of the function , this case is handled at runtime .
From a typing perspective , the " > " sign signals that the function can also accept other tags than the mentioned ones .
However , this function actually raises an exception .
# number_value2 ( `Letter 'a ' ) ; ; Exception : Failure " This is not a number " .
So the " < " sign is a way to limit the number of tags a function can process .
The programmer gets it by not adding a " catch all " case to pattern matchings .
This kind of polyvariant is useful to enforce some strictness in programming , and the type checker catches the cases that would otherwise only be handed at runtime .
Giving Polyvariants Names
Although the mantra of this article is that we do n't need declarations , it is of course possible to define named polymorphic variants .
For example , we could introduce these named types :
type classified_char = [ ` Digit of char | ` Letter of char | ` Other of char ] type number_token = [ ` Digit of char | ` Number of int ]
Note that there is no " > " or " < " sign in such definitions - it would not make sense to say something about whether more or less tags are possible than given , because the context is missing .
Using these names , one could simplify the typings of our functions :
val classify_chars : string -> [> classified_char ] val recognize_numbers : ( [> number_token ] as ' a ) list -> ' a list val number_value1 : [< number_token ] -> int val number_value2 : [> number_token ] -> int
As you see , the " > " or " < " sign can still appear in function types using these names .
Actually , there is a special syntax behind this notation .
If you just say number_token in a type expression , exactly the definition applies ( without sign ) .
But you can also construct new polyvariants from existing ones .
For example ,
[ classified_char | number_token ]
would mean a type that combines the tags of both types , i.e. this is the same as if all four tags were enumerated .
The syntax [ < number_token ] is only a special case of this type constructor , where the new type also gets a sign .
Matching Variants
Try to compile this piece of code that ought to sum up all ` Digit and `Number tags of a list of any tags :
let rec sum l = match l with | x :: l ' -> ( match x with | ` Digit _ | ` Number _ -> number_value1 x + sum l' | _ -> sum l' ) | [ ] -> 0
It compiles , but there is a little surprise .
The compiler emits a warning that the _ -> sum l' case of the matching is unused , and the inferred type is just
val sum : [ ` Digit of char | ` Number of int ] list -> int
i.e. the " > " sign is missing that would allow us to pass any tags in .
What 's wrong ?
This is a pitfall one quickly runs into when using polyvariants .
The type checker assumes that the x in number_value1 x has the same type as the x that is matched again .
It is not sufficient to use a matched variable in the expression of the matched case to restrict its type .
Fortunately , there is a special syntax for that ( look at the bold " as " clause ) :
let rec sum l = match l with | x :: l ' -> ( match x with | ( ` Digit _ | ` Number _ ) as y -> number_value1 y + sum l' | _ -> sum l' ) | [ ] -> 0
Here , y is the value x for the case that the match applies , so y can have a stricter type than x .
Alternatively , the match condition could also have been written as :
match x with | # number_token as y -> ...
Behind The Scene
i.e. one can use named polyvariants in matchings .
This is just a convenience notation for the former .
The polyvariants might be cool , but many programmers suspect that the performance of their programs suffer when they use them .
Well , although there are some runtime cost , these are very small , and not noticeable for many programs .
Internally , the tags are represented by hash values of the names of the tags .
So the tags are simply reduced to integers at runtime .
Compared with the normal variant types , there is some additional overhead for tags with values .
In particular , for storing `X value one extra word is needed in comparison with the normal variant X value .
It is possible that the hash values of variants collide , e.g .
# type x = [ `jagJhn | `oZshTt ] ; ; Variant tags `jagJhn and `oZshTt have same hash value .
Change one of them .
As you see , the compiler checks for this rare case .
I 've never seen it in practice .
Despite rumours , there is nothing special done at link time .
The tags are already cut down to integers at this point of compiling .
Conclusion
I hope I 've shown how elegant code looks that uses polyvariants to represent data cases .
But there is some more to say , especially if you look at other programming languages .
The author of this article thinks that polymorphic variants are one of the features that makes O'Caml so different in comparison with mainstream languages like Java .
In particular , there are competing approaches for representing data cases , and one of the radical ideas of object orientation has always been that combining data and program cases into a single class construct is the best way to deal with the problem .
However , I think something has been overlooked - data and algorithms do not always walk hand in hand , and classes are inflexible if only a loose correlation between both is needed .
In contrast , polyvariants give the programmer the maximum of freedom in this respect .
Thus it is believed that polyvariants are a serious alternative for representing data cases .
THE president 's state - of - the - union message to Congress is one of the odder rituals of American politics — a mixture of pomp and circumstance ( all those Supreme Court judges in their black gowns and military leaders with their chests full of medals ) and frat - boy hugging and hollering .
The president serves up some hokum about how “ the state of the union is strong ” and America is a “ shining city on a hill ” .
Everybody stands and claps enthusiastically .
He tosses out some red meat for members of his own party .
Half the chamber rises to its feet .
He throws in an obscure scheme to please this or that cabinet secretary .
The secretary rises , while everybody else looks bemused .
It would be nice to say that it was ever thus .
The constitution , after all , requires that the president “ shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union ” .
But , like all traditions , it has gone through lots of mutations .
Washington and Adams delivered speeches to Congress .
But Jefferson regarded the practice as too monarchical and time - consuming — he sent a letter instead — and the practice of speechifying was only resumed by Woodrow Wilson in 1913 .
The current version , with its prime - time slot , boisterous applause and “ American heroes ” sitting in the first lady 's box , is a product of the television age .
Mr Bush looked as cocky as ever on Monday evening .
But his performance demonstrated how much he has changed over the years .
In his first address to Congress in February 2001 he presented himself as a compassionate centrist .
He focused on improving education .
He told Congress that “ together we are changing the tone in the nation 's capital ” .
He ended with an exhortation in Spanish : “ Juntos podemos ” , “ Together we can ” .
In his next few speeches he was Bush the warrior .
In 2002 he chastised the “ axis of evil ” .
In 2003 he pressed the case for invading Iraq .
A year later he was still talking about disrupting “ dozens of weapons - of - mass - destruction - related programme activities ” .
In 2005 he laid out a big agenda for reforming Social Security , fixing immigration and spreading freedom round the world .
On January 28th he was a diminished figure — a man whose domestic reforms have turned to dust and whose war on terror has gone wrong .
He made the case for stimulating the economy and continuing the “ surge ” in Iraq .
But he is not important to either policy : a bipartisan stimulus package is already in the works and the fate of the surge depends on his successor .
He declared war on pork - barrel spending .
But over the past seven years he has signed spending bills containing about 55,000 “ earmarks ” worth more than $ 100 billion .
The rest was either boilerplate or small bore : praise for tax cuts and free markets , schemes such as giving hiring preferences to military spouses .
The media were more interested in Barack Obama 's failure to acknowledge Hillary Clinton 's existence , even though she was sitting a few feet from him , and the way he made a point of talking to his neighbour , Edward Kennedy .
For the rest of his presidency Mr Bush will be a president in search of a soapbox .
His favourability rating stands at about 30 % , compared with over 80 % when he gave his axis - of - evil speech .
The Democratic majority in Congress has no time for him .
He is unlikely to command the global goodwill necessary to engage in the bursts of diplomacy that marked Ronald Reagan 's or Bill Clinton 's last years in office .
Mr Bush has defined American politics since he took office — commanding extraordinary loyalty from his fellow Republicans and driving Democrats into paroxysms of Bushophobia .
Political armies were raised either to demonise the president or to demonise the demonisers .
But both parties recognise that their challenge now is to fashion a new politics for a post - Bush world .
Mr Obama and Mrs Clinton agree on almost every detail of policy : they disagree bitterly about how politics ought to be conducted in this new world .
Mr Obama believes he can transcend not just Mr Bush but the partisan politics that have dominated the Bush era .
He wants to use the combination of his soaring rhetoric and his broad appeal to change the weather of American politics — hence his admiration for Mr Reagan 's power to transform politics , if not for what he did with that power .
Mrs Clinton seems to regard herself more as a new chief executive preparing to take over a company that has been run into the ground .
She emphasises that she knows how to pull the levers of power in Washington to get things done — and she regards talk of transcending partisanship as naive waffle that could lead the country to disaster .
Conservative civil war
The debate about the post - Bush world is even deeper on the right .
The Republicans are currently beset not just by wars between factions ( business versus evangelicals versus centrist McCainiacs , which could be patched up if electoral necessity demands it ) , but by fundamental philosophical divisions .
Liberated from the need to defend Mr Bush from his enemies , Republicans are asking difficult questions that have lain buried for years .
Should they return to Reaganism or ditch it ?
Is there room in conservatism for worries about global warming , prison rape or water - boarding ?
And what role should faith play in conservative politics ?
If the Republicans are defeated in November , these arguments will become a cacophony .
The results of these debates will , paradoxically , reveal a huge amount about the man who commanded the stage on Monday .
The Clintonistas may turn out to be right , and Mr Obama 's “ Yes we can ” slogan may prove as empty as Mr Bush 's “ Juntos podemos ” .
Or perhaps the conservatives will discover that the only way to keep the Republican coalition intact is to re-embrace Mr Bush 's big government , tax cuts and evangelical moralism .
As with so much else in American politics at the moment , it is a matter of waiting and seeing .
In the past , we 've been sheltered from the full force of the human horror of Hiroshima .
No longer :
The Robert L. Capp collection at the Hoover Institution Archives contains ten never - before - published photographs illustrating the immediate aftermath of the Hiroshima bombing .
These photographs , taken by an unknown Japanese photographer , were found in 1945 among rolls of undeveloped film in a cave outside Hiroshima by U.S. serviceman Robert L. Capp , who was attached to the occupation forces .
Unlike most photos of the Hiroshima bombing , these dramatically convey the human as well as material destruction unleashed by the atomic bomb .
Mr. Capp donated them to the Hoover Archives in 1998 with the provision that they not be reproduced until 2008 .
Three of these photographs are reproduced in Atomic Tragedy with the permission of the Capp family .
Now that the restriction is no longer in force , the entire set is available .
Microsoft reported third - quarter results last night , and the numbers just were n't that great .
By the numbers
Sales showed infinitesimal improvement over last year , moving from $ 14.4 billion to $ 14.45 billion .
$ 0.47 a share in adjusted net income was a happier story , compared with $ 0.38 a year ago .
Management took great pains to remind us that the year - ago quarter was the launch period for consumer - level Vista versions , so the comparisons should be tough .
With that in mind , the server software division showed some improvement while consumer software sales and profits slowed down a bit .
The entertainment segment , while still very small in the grand scheme of things , boosted revenue by an impressive 68 percent year over year and actually turned a small ( $ 89 million ) operating profit .
That 's a rarity in this holiday - light reporting period .
The online services department reported $ 843 million in sales , up from $ 603 million last year .
$ 143 million of the difference came from the recently purchased aQuantive , so the organic growth was a more modest $ 97 million , or 16 percent .
Unfortunately , higher sales did not translate into operating profits , as the segment racked up $ 228 million in losses this time , 33 percent worse than last year .
Compare and contrast
Yahoo's report on Tuesday night showed 9 percent revenue growth and essentially flat earnings of $ 0.11 per share , if you remove a one - time gain of $ 0.36 per share from investments in Chinese search engine Alibaba .
That 's way better than Microsoft 's online efforts , but the two would - be partners combined made just $ 173 million this quarter , which compares rather badly to Google 's $ 1.31 billion net profit .
So how does all of this affect Microsoft 's bid for Yahoo ?
Microsoft is still talking tough : " The strongest argument that I 've heard on why we should increase our bid , simply that we can afford to , is not one that I favor , " said CFO Chris Liddell .
" We 've yet to see tangible evidence that our bid substantially undervalues the company .
In fact we see the opposite . "
The company still very much wants an agreement with Yahoo , but Liddell left the door wide open for a hostile takeover — or dropping the deal entirely .
The bottom line
Recent price action in the two stocks involved shows growing investor skepticism towards a quick deal .
Microsoft 's stock gained nearly 9 percent in value last week while Yahoo lost 4 percent .
Given that the proposed deal is half in cash , half in Microsoft stock , that means that investors in Yahoo are willing to sell their shares at significantly less than the deal 's value .
The offer today stands at $ 30.62 per share , while Yahoo's stock sells for $ 27.30 .
That points to either a lower bid directly to shareholders , or to a Yahoo - less Redmond .
I still think the latter choice would be best for everyone involved , except Google .
Yahoo is doing fine on its own , but would become a shadow of its former self if forced into a union with Microsoft .
Glue two broken parts together , and you just get a broken , sticky mess .
As a Google shareholder , I should be rooting for a merger , but I 'd much rather see healthy competition than an easy win .
That 's just better for everybody .
One of the biggest problems with dining rooms is that they are often neglected just because they are such a trek from the kitchen .
Most often , formal dining areas are in a separate room , while informal dining areas are more commonly out in the open — frequently attached to the living room , family room , or kitchen .
Dining Room Furniture should be inspired by a sense of grandeur , impression , and elegance .
To truly make a dining room formal , you need to pay attention to details from the window treatments down to the place mats .
For a different mood , consider creating a serious , luxurious space set aside specifically for great meals and conversation .
Do n’t limit yourself to thinking that meals must be restricted to a formal table .
A kitchen island , or even a counter top fitted with stools or high - sitting chairs , can also make for a fun dining experience .
Here are some modern designs for you to get the inspiration , when planning for the dining room furniture .
OLPC runs Processing and Arduino
At NYU ’s ITP program , the Processing and Arduino programming environments are widely used .
Since my main interest in the OLPC is to use it as a controller for projects , and since most of my projects are built using those two tools , I was very interested in getting them running on the OLPC .
In addition , both Processing and Arduino are projects that have a lot in common with the OLPC project : they are focused on education , focus on making computing technology available to groups that previously would have found it difficult , are fully Open Sourced , and rely on a community - based approach to support and development .
Good news : it is strikingly easy ( with caveats ) .
The Arduino IDE runs under Sugar ( the OLPC ’s built - in user interface ) and under XFCE ( a more conventional Linux window manager ) .
Processing runs fine ( albeit slowly ) under XFCE .
However , it gets confused under Sugar , which does n’t handle multiple windows well .
Read past the break for instructions !
The Processing and Arduino development environments are based on the same underlying technology , so a lot of the installation is very similar .
You will first install Java , then make a few adjustments so that Processing and Arduino can find it .
If you are interested in installing the Arduino environment , follow Brian Jepson ’s instructions here .
Once you ’ve done that , installing Processing is as simple as downloading and decompressing a single file .
Follow Brian ’s instructions , then skip ahead to the section called “ Installing Processing ” .
Installing Java
Follow the instructions for installing Java from the OLPC Wiki .
Note that you should follow those instructions exactly , and use Java version jre 1.5.0_13 .
Do n’t use version 6 , it does not seem to work .
Once done with that , you will add a couple of lines to a file called . bashrc in your home directory .
These will allow Arduino and Processing to find the Java installation on your system .
From a terminal window , do :
su cd / home / olpc nano .
bashrc
Add the following two lines to the end of the file :
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jre1.5.0_13 / export PATH=$PATH :$JAVA_HOME/bin
Save the file by exiting nano with ctrl-x , confirming that you want to save changes .
Close the terminal session .
Installing Processing
As I mentioned before , you should really install an alternative window manager such as XFCE before trying to use Processing .
If you have done that , then all you really need to do is download the compressed Processing archive , and decompress it .
Open a terminal window , and type :
cd /home / olpc wget http://www.processing.org/download/processing-0135.tgz tar xvfz processing - 0135.tgz
You can delete the processing - 0135 . tgz file once you ’re done .
To run Processing :
cd processing - 0135 ./ processing
That ’s all !
Text and graphics functions seem to work fine .
OpenGL is very slow , as can be expected .
I have not had much luck with audio and video functions , but will keep trying to figure it out .
Being able to use the built - in OLPC camera and microphone would be very handy .

Some years ago , I was awakened early one morning by a phone call from a friend .
She had just broken up with a boyfriend she still loved and was desperate to justify her decision .
“ Can you believe it ! ” she shouted into the phone .
“ He had n’t even heard of Pushkin ! ”
We ’ve all been there .
Or some of us have .
Anyone who cares about books has at some point confronted the Pushkin problem : when a missed  or misguided  literary reference makes it chillingly clear that a romance is going nowhere fast .
At least since Dante ’s Paolo and Francesca fell in love over tales of Lancelot , literary taste has been a good shorthand for gauging compatibility .
These days , thanks to social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace , listing your favorite books and authors is a crucial , if risky , part of self - branding .
When it comes to online dating , even casual references can turn into deal breakers .
Sussing out a date ’s taste in books is “ actually a pretty good way  as a sort of first pass  of getting a sense of someone , ” said Anna Fels , a Manhattan psychiatrist and the author of “ Necessary Dreams : Ambition in Women ’s Changing Lives . ”
“ It ’s a bit of a Rorschach test . ”
To Fels ( who happens to be married to the literary publisher and writer James Atlas ) , reading habits can be a rough indicator of other qualities .
“ It tells something about ... their level of intellectual curiosity , what their style is , ” Fels said .
“ It speaks to class , educational level . ”
Pity the would - be Romeo who earnestly confesses middlebrow tastes : sometimes , it ’s the Howard Roark problem as much as the Pushkin one .
“ I did have to break up with one guy because he was very keen on Ayn Rand , ” said Laura Miller , a book critic for Salon .
“ He was sweet and incredibly decent despite all the grandiosely heartless ‘ philosophy ’ he espoused , but it was n’t even the ideology that did it .
I just thought Rand was a hilariously bad writer , and past a certain point I could n’t hide my amusement . ”
( Members of theatlasphere.com , a dating and fan site for devotees of “ Atlas Shrugged ” and “ The Fountainhead , ” might disagree . )
Judy Heiblum , a literary agent at Sterling Lord Literistic , shudders at the memory of some attempted date - talk about Robert Pirsig ’s 1974 cult classic “ Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance , ” beloved of searching young men .
“ When a guy tells me it changed his life , I wish he ’d saved us both the embarrassment , ” Heiblum said , adding that “ life - changing experiences ” are a “ tedious conversational topic at best . ”
It seems very likely that - for the tenth consecutive year - the federal government will run a healthy surplus in FY2006 - 07 .
For those of a certain age , it is perhaps difficult to believe that large surpluses have become a standard feature of the economic policy background .
How did this happen ?
It 's now been so long since deficits were a problem that even their scale is diminished by distance .
A deficit of - say - $ 37 b would be viewed as a serious problem even now .
But in 1985 , when we actually hit those depths , the problem was much worse .
Since 1985 , the economy - and therefore our ability to generate tax revenues - has grown , and inflation has eroded the real effect of a nominal deficit measured in the tens of billions of dollars .
There many ways of providing a scale to the numbers that follow .
I 'll use two : per cent of GDP , and per capita 2006 dollars .
( It turns out that it actually does make a difference which one you use . )
First up is the federal surplus / deficit :
By any measure , the scale of the deficits that ran for the span of a generation were huge .
And the arithmetic of deficits and debts took its remorseless toll :
Not that the deficit was completely ignored for a generation .
If you look at the operating surplus ( the difference between revenues and program expenditures , without debt charges included ) there were a couple of serious attempts to deal with the deficit , but they fell victim to the recessions of 1983 and 1991 :
Even though the operating budget stayed in surplus during a severe recession in the early 90's , the deficit still continued to rise as debt service charges rose .
The Bank of Canada 's attack on inflation - and the high interest rates that accompanied it - did n't help :
By the time the Liberals took power in 1993 , debt service charges alone were on the order of $ 2000 per capita in terms of 2006 buying power .
The turning point came in Paul Martin 's 1995 budget , and the measures it introduced produced a surplus within two years .
How did they do it ?
Spending cuts or tax increases ?
If you look at a graph of program spending and revenues , you 'd conclude that taxes went up , while spending stayed the same .
Real per capita program spending is pretty much where it was 25 years ago , but we 're paying $ 2000 more per capita for them :
But if you look at GDP shares , you 'd conclude that revenues stayed fairly steady at around 16 % , while program spending has fallen by 4 percentage points since the mid-90's .
After ten years of surpluses , we can perhaps breathe a little easier .
The debt is less and less of a burden , and the cost of servicing it is almost back to what it was in the 1960s .
So now that the deficit is not the burning preoccupation it once was , we can start thinking of other priorities .
Do we look at the second - last graph and decide to cut taxes ?
Or do we look at the last picture and decide to increase spending ?

I 've been traveling alone in Japan for the better part of three weeks now , and It 's been so remarkable an experience for me that I can't book a ticket home yet .
I have n't spoken very much out loud these days , but I 've been thinking to myself in what feels like surround sound .
I can see so many things clearly , and feel so connected to myself and the world around me that I need to share the perspective with you .

We were spoken to by name through a television .

And never in any other order than that .

And when it's all over , whether at the end of this fabulous career or of this life , which I hope takes place at the same time , I should look back and say that I had it good and I made the most of it while I was able .
And so should you .

CHICAGO 
Two widely prescribed cholesterol - lowering drugs , Vytorin and Zetia , may not work and should be used only as a last resort , The New England Journal of Medicine said in an editorial published on Sunday .
The journal ’s conclusion came as doctors at a major cardiology conference in Chicago saw for the first time the full results of a two - year clinical trial that showed that the drugs failed to slow , and might have even sped up , the growth of fatty plaques in the arteries .
Growth of those plaques is closely correlated with heart attacks and strokes .
Merck and Schering - Plough , the companies that make Vytorin and Zetia , said on Sunday that despite the results of the trial , they would continue to promote their medicines as first - line treatments for high cholesterol .
The medicines are among the top - selling drugs in the world , with total sales of about $ 5 billion last year .
About four million Americans take them .
Hillary Rodham Clinton pressed on with her presidential campaign Wednesday , the day after squeaking out a win in the Indiana primary and losing badly to Barack Obama in North Carolina .
As Mrs. Clinton addressed a crowd in Shepardstown , W.Va. , voices on TV and around the Internet debated whether it ’s in the Democratic party ’s best interest for Mrs. Clinton to stay in the race when her chances of grabbing enough delegates to clinch the nomination are shrinking by the day .
The top pundit calling for Senator Clinton to wave the white flag was NBC ’s Tim Russert , who said of Mr. Obama , “ We now know who the Democratic nominee ’s going to be , and no one ’s going to dispute it . ”
His remarks on primary night have been flying around the Internet as a YouTube moment .
Blogger Taylor Marsh , an outspoken Clinton supporter , published a vehemently angry post , calling Mr. Russert , among other things , a “ loud - mouthed , self - important elitist . ”
“ Whose place is it to announce we have a nominee when neither candidate has enough delegates ? ” Ms. Marsh asked .
“ I ’ll tell you who : no one . ”
But for the most part , bloggers from the left and right , with varying degrees of sensitivity , also called on Senator Clinton to withdraw .
Said Marc Ambinder of The Atlantic :
Barack Obama is , by almost every measure and by almost every unmeasurable impression , on the precipice of being able to declare victory and have his declaration be accepted by the media and his party .
Hillary Clinton needed to find a way to give superdelegates their “ Holy Moly ” moment , and she failed .
Steve Kornacki of The New York Observer :
Clinton ’s strategy since February 5 never stood much chance of working and allowed room for absolutely no slip - ups .
Now it ’s over .
John Aravosis of AmericaBlog :
There is no longer any reason for Hillary to continue in this race other than a desire to destroy Obama and make him lost in the fall so she can run again in 4 years .
This farce needs to be ended now .
And Shaun Mullen of The Moderate Voice :
Yet with 90 percent of the pledged delegates now chosen , Clinton is once again picking up those goal posts , slinging them onto her itty - bitty shoulders … and is slogging on .
This is not for the good of party or the nation , as she would have us believe , but because she cannot face up to the reality that she squandered pretty much a sure thing by engaging in the kind of divisive and fear mongering politics of which change - thirsty Americans are so fricking sick and tired .
Allahpundit at Hot Air noted , that even if she gets the Florida and Michigan delegations seated at the convention , as is her intention , she would n’t gain a popular vote advantage .
Especially not if the previously unreported caucus totals from Iowa , Washington , Maine and Nevada ( granted , the last of which Mrs. Clinton won ) are added in .
She has nothing left to commend her to the supers except an electabilty argument unsupported by a single key metric or even circumstantial evidence that Pastorgate has done Obama grievous damage at the polls .
Are they going to take the nomination from the first serious black candidate for president without any compelling data to hang their decision on ?
Not a chance .
It ’s over .
Let ’s move on .
That idea of “ let ’s move on ” seems to be the train of thought of most bloggers — but Mitt Romney , the former G.O.P. contender , ( unsurprisingly ) disagreed .
“ I applaud the ongoing battle among the Democrats and hope it continues , ” he told the conservative National Review .
No doubt because it gave the Democrats less time to campaign for the general election .
Fox News reporter Major Garrett brought up a rare point helping Mrs. Clinton ’s rationale to stay in the race — how much of an advantage did Mr. Obama gain from early voters ?
One of the key questions is whether Obama won the “ day of ” primary , meaning that he carried the votes cast on Election Day .
It ’s clear Obama crushed Clinton in early votes cast in both states .
A good portion of these votes where cast before the controversy over the Rev. Jeremiah Wright took hold a second time in the campaign and before Clinton engaged Obama in a debate over her proposal for a federal gasoline tax holiday .
This was a key difference in the Clinton and Obama strategies heading into these primaries .
Obama ’s camp worked overtime to solicit support in early voting .
Clinton made virtually no effort on this front as her campaign , by necessity , focused resources solely on Pennsylvania to ensure the biggest victory possible .
There ’s also a lot of outcry in the blogosphere over a story in the New York Daily News about how the Clinton campaign may want to stay in the race because many white voters are uncomfortable with the idea of a black president .
“ The implication being , ” wrote Dan Collins of Protein Wisdom , “ that Hillary backers are misinformed racist [ jerks ] specifically and haters generally .
The pursuit of anecdotes in the service of the narrative : it ’s amazing what these [ jerks ] will cling to . ”
Despite what Mrs. Clinton says publicly , Markos Moulitsas Zúniga of the liberal site Daily Kos wonders whether she ’s hanging around this race for another reason other than getting the party ’s presidential nomination .
So Clinton vows to stay in through the end , and surrogates like James Carville are talking tough .
But the feeling is that it ’s all posturing as the Clinton Camp negotiates for 1 . ) having Obama pay off her campaign debt , and / or 2 . ) a spot on the ticket as V.P .
Finally , Jim Geraghty of The National Review brought up a bit of history in making a case for Mrs. Clinton to stay in the contest :
A large cargo plane crashed at the end of a runway and split in two while trying to take off Sunday at Brussels airport .
Four of the five crew members on board the Boeing 747 were slightly injured and were hospitalized , said Jan Van der Cruysse , spokesman at Brussels Airport .
" The plane is very seriously damaged , " he said .
The aircraft cracked in two after it crashed at the end of runway 220 , which lies very close to a rail line and houses .
Rail services to and from the airport were suspended as a safety precaution , however the crash did not affect other flights at the airport , Van der Cruysse said .
Francis Vermeiren , mayor of the nearby town of Zaventem , said the plane did not catch on fire when it crashed after attempting to take off .
Vermeiren was coordinating rescue efforts at the airport .
" The plane is not on fire but it has split into two , " he told VRT radio .
Firefighters coated the wings of the plane with special fire retardant foam as a precaution because the plane was still full of jet fuel , the mayor said .
He said the plane was on a scheduled flight to Bahrain .
It was not known what cargo the plane was carrying .
Vermeiren said the pilot told rescue authorities he heard a large noise while trying to take off just after midday .
It was not yet clear what caused the crash .
The plane is owned by Kalitta Air , a cargo carrier based at Willow Run Airport near Ypsilanti , Michigan , and makes regular flights from Brussels , officials said .
A person who answered the telephone at Kalitta Air said Sunday morning that no one was immediately available to comment .
Pope wo n't break bread with Bush at White House Nick Juliano
Published : Friday April 11 , 2008

Print This Email This Pontiff not attending dinner in his honor , White House says The White House has scheduled a dinner next week in honor of Pope Benedict XVI 's first visit to the United States , but one guest will be conspicuously absent from the proceedings :
The Pope himself .
There are no competing events listed on the Pope 's schedule , and the White House was unable to explain Benedict 's absence from a dinner being held in his honor .
The pontiff will be greeted by the president and first lady upon his arrival to the US Tuesday and participate in a Rose Garden appearance and Oval Office meeting with President Bush the next day .
A dinner scheduled for later Wednesday night did n't make it onto the Benedict 's schedule , White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said Friday .
From Friday 's press briefing : Q Just to clarify , for the pope 's visit to the White House , you said that now there 's a dinner in the East Room in honor of the pope ?
MR. STANZEL : Yes .
Q Will the pope actually be attending that dinner ?
MR. STANZEL : I do n't believe so , no .
Q Okay .
Thank you .
[...]
Q I 'm sorry .
The pope does n't attend a dinner in his honor ?
MR. STANZEL : No .
Q ( Off mike . )
MR. STANZEL : He does n't come into the building .
Q Well , then it's not a dinner for the pope , is it ?
MR. STANZEL : It 's in honor of his visit .
There will be leaders from the Catholic community from all over the country who are in town for that visit .
Q Is there a reason the pope does n't attend the dinner ?
MR. STANZEL : I do n't know .
I do n't have the full extent of his schedule .
Benedict 's schedule does not indicate any events that would conflict with his ability to attend the 7:30 p.m. dinner that Wednesday .
He is just scheduled to return to the Vatican embassy in Washington at the same time after a meeting with US bishops at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington .
It 's unclear why the Pope wo n't be attending the dinner in his honor , but he is expected to touch on issues upon which he and President Bush disagree during the visit , especially the Iraq war .
During his visit to the United Nations a few days later , the Pope will address " the false notion that might makes right , " according to a Vatican representative .
Some experts also predict the Pope would criticize the " culture of fear " in the United States .
The Rev. David Hollenbach , director of Boston College 's Center for Human Rights , said recently that this culture is seen as integral to the US involvement in Iraq .
" Fear can lead to angry responses , " Hollenbach said , according to the Connecticut Post .
" I think the pope 's message is going to be ' Do n't be afraid . '
I think the overcoming of fear can take away the impulse for war . "
His voice shaking - either with fear or emotion - the lama explained why he felt greater pressure than at any time since he started to head his monastery .
" I am worried .
China is so big .
Tibetans are so few .
We cannot possibly win .
No good can come of this for Tibetans . "
The lama has good reason to be concerned .
The fragile harmony between Tibetan and Han Chinese communities is being ripped apart all around him .
His small monastery - nestling high in the mountains of northern Sichuan - is in the region that has experienced the worst violence outside of Lhasa .
According to overseas Tibetan groups , more than a dozen protesters have been killed in Aba county .
It is difficult to verify , but the tension is palpable .
As the unrest has spread , so has the security cordon .
The fragile - looking lama now finds his remote monastery - hundreds of miles from the initial protests - on the edge .
" Three officials came up from the town to see me today .
They told me we must not protest like the other monasteries or we would be closed off , " he said .
In the past two days several bigger monasteries in this area ( which can not be named to protect the sources ) have been locked down .
Roads in almost every direction are punctuated by police checkpoints .
Government officials , park rangers , bank managers and other administrators have been ordered to maintain a 24 - hour operation .
" We have to work overtime tonight because the Dalai Lama is trying to split our country , " one Tibetan park ranger grumbled to a colleague .
Until last week this area - at more than 3,000 metres ( 10,000 ft ) altitude - was a stopping point on the tourist trail .
The nearby highway 213 passes through some of the most stunning scenery in China , past many of Tibetan Buddhism 's most famous monasteries .
Today , however , the roads are closed .
Drivers have been warned to stay away and all the talk is of the baoluan - unrest - gripping neighbouring areas .
Route 213 has become a corridor of unrest .
Locals said there were demonstrations yesterday in Ruoergai and Langmusi , where monks held up Tibetan flags and shouted support for the Dalai Lama .
Further north police have broken up rallies in Luqu , Xiahe and Hezou in recent days .
What is going on inside the widening security zone is becoming harder to find out as the police add roadblocks , expel foreigners , warn locals to stay away and bring in truckloads of armed riot police .
At the secluded monastery it is at first hard to understand why the Tibetan community would want to rebel .
Farmers say their incomes have risen .
Many are building big houses .
Last year the government built a new road .
But there is frustration at the heavy - handed political controls they must live under .
Monks must undergo patriotic education campaigns .
There are restrictions on the age at which monasteries can enrol apprentices .
The Chinese flag must fly from the monastery roof and Communist posters have to be hung on the walls .
" Have the same heart as the party .
Follow the same direction as socialism .
Be grateful and dedicate yourself to the motherland , " reads one near the entrance .
Toughest of all for the monks to bear is the order to renounce the Dalai Lama , their spiritual leader .
" They tell me I must renounce the Dalai Lama .
When I go to public meetings that is what I have to say .
But in my heart I do n't believe the words from my mouth , " said the lama .
" We do not have freedom of worship .
We do n't have enough human rights .
Deep down I support those who demonstrate peacefully , but violence is very bad .
It does n't help . "
Mr Singh has ' not received a single visitor in prison '
Kashmir Singh was sentenced to death for spying in 1973 and is set to be reunited with his family .
Mr Singh was discovered by Ansar Burney , a social worker who tracks people lost in Pakistan 's jail system .
Hundreds of servicemen and civilians were imprisoned by India and Pakistan during hostilities between the two sides in 1965 and 1971 .
Spies
Mr Burney discovered Kashmir Singh on a recent trip to a jail in Lahore and persuaded President Musharraf to revoke his death sentence and order his release .
The elderly Indian was a former policeman who had become a trader in electronic goods .
" I feel better .
I am happy , " Mr Singh told reporters .
He was arrested in the city of Rawalpindi in 1973 and convicted of spying .
Pakistan and India frequently arrest each other 's citizens , often accusing them of straying across the border - some are treated as spies .
Mr Burney is currently the government 's caretaker minister for human rights .
He first heard of Mr Singh during a radio call - in show some years ago .
He recently won a presidential pardon for the prisoner .
The BBC's Barbara Plett says that Mr Singh is expected to be reunited with his wife and three children on Tuesday morning .
Mr Singh told Mr Burney that he had a love marriage rather than an arranged marriage .
His wife confirmed this to the minister when he called her .
" Why else would I have waited 35 years for him ? " she asked .
Local media reports say that she has been waiting at the border since she first heard news that her husband would be pardoned .
Mr Burney said last week that Mr Singh was held in a condemned prisoners cell for most of the time since his conviction and had become mentally ill .
He said that he was first informed about Kashmir Singh several years ago by members of the Indian community in London .
But he was unable to locate Mr Singh , despite visiting over 20 prisons across the country in relation to his campaign for prison reforms and prisoners ' rights .
The minister said that Mr Singh had not received a single visitor or seen the open sky and like other condemned prisoners , was locked in an overcrowded death cell for more than 23 hours a day in conditions which the minister described as " hell on earth . "
Mr Burney said he will travel to India on Tuesday to see Mr Singh re-unite with his wife as well as their two sons and a daughter .
" My real purpose in going with him to India is that when this pair of swans meet after 35 years , I want to capture it with my own eyes , " he said .
Because people are indoors more often during the winter , they are in close contact more often , and this promotes transmission from person to person .
Cold temperatures lead to drier air , which may dehydrate mucus , preventing the body from effectively expelling virus particles .
The virus may linger longer on exposed surfaces ( doorknobs , countertops , etc. ) in colder temperatures .
Increased travel and visitation due to the holiday season .
Less sunlight promotes virus survival .
Our immune systems work poorly during the cold weather .

SHEENA MASSIE , dragged by her mother to garage and estate sales as a child , once cringed at the sight of used goods .
“ The very thought of being caught by my peers buying other people ’s junk was mortifying , ” said Ms. Massie , a 25 - year - old waitress in Canal Winchester , Ohio , near Columbus .
“ If someone else did n’t want it , why would I ? ”
But , like Ms. Massie , who with her mother is opening a thrift shop , more consumers are concluding that brand new is not necessarily better .
According to the National Association of Resale and Thrift Shops , the industry is growing at a rate of 5 percent a year .
And as the prices of gasoline and groceries edge higher and debt — be it mortgage or credit card — weighs more heavily , saving money on clothes , shoes and household goods has become increasingly essential for many people .
“ With the economy in its current condition , I think people will begin turning to more thrifty ways of shopping , ” said Ms. Massie , whose store , Thrift on the Canal , opens next month .
“ We want everyone that shops with us to enjoy the same thrill we do when we go thrifting . ”
The thrift shop association estimates that there are 25,000 such stores in the United States .
Britt Beemer , the founder and chief executive of America ’s Research Group , a consumer behavior research firm , said surveys have found that 16 to 18 percent of Americans shop in thrift stores , while 12 to 15 percent visit consignment stores .
“ Thrift shops are not on the radar screen for many shoppers , ” Mr. Beemer said .
He predicted that more would turn to them , especially for back - to - school clothing .
The ThriftShopper.com , a two - year - old Web site , is viewed 70,000 times a day , mostly by women age 30 to 50 , said Mike Gold , who runs the site with his wife , Julie .
Mr. Gold said he discovered that thrift shop fans are everywhere when he met the auctioneers and experts of “ The Antiques Roadshow , ” a popular PBS series .
“ Every single one of them was an avid thrift shopper , ” he said .
Ms. Gold added , “ One said she even buys her clothes there . ”
Kara Lake , a 34 - year - old mother in Braintree , Vt. , who is home - schooling her five children , ages 8 , 7 , 6 , 3 and 6 months , said she was one of those fans , particularly since a tight budget is normal .
She said she grew up in rural Vermont wearing thrift shop clothing and “ can count on two hands when I ’ve bought something new . ”
Because many families have only one or two children , she said , the clothing is only gently used .
“ We can still give our kids the best things . ”
Ms. Lake said she easily found clothes with labels like Old Navy , the Gap and Banana Republic .
“ It does n’t make any sense to me to buy anything brand new if the clothes are well taken care of . ”
She also finds clothes for herself from midpriced labels like Ann Taylor and J. Jill , shopping twice a month and spending , in all , $ 15 to $ 20 for an armful of clothing for herself and several of her children .
Consignment shops , which typically have higher prices but offer higher - end or designer merchandise , have their fans as well .
Clothing must be washed or dry cleaned before sale , and the selection in such shops tends to be more carefully edited .
Mason Bechtel , a retired administrative assistant for a major financial services firm in Houston , grew up choosing between having several new dresses each season from Loehmann ’s , a discount store , or just one from Bonwit Teller .
“ I realized that shopping at the best shops , I felt stupid , ” she said .
“ Why pay $ 120 for a dress I could find in a resale shop ? ”
Ms. Bechtel , whose mother ran a Lilly Pulitzer shop in Westport , Conn. , admits to having expensive , if classic taste .
“ I still wear the same clothes from the same shops — but I usually pay nothing more than $ 20 . ”
Thrift and consignment shoppers love getting a bargain .
For Ms. Bechtel , it was a $ 25 Black Watch plaid blazer with a black velvet collar and $ 25 for a St.
John knit suit — new , typically costing four figures .
Julie Gold , a co-owner of TheThriftShopper.com , said buying used clothing takes more diligence than simply rifling the racks at a local retailer .
“ In a thrift store , you really have to dig , ” she said .
“ It takes a lot of time , energy and patience . ”
But , thrift shoppers say , the time demanded is repaid with single - digit price tags and a wide variety of styles in one place .
Two national chains , Buffalo Exchange and Crossroads Trading Company , allow shoppers to bring in clothes they no longer want for cash or to trade for clothes in the store .
Both promote their fashionable offerings , in an attempt to appeal to younger shoppers .
And both offer a combination of new and what they term “ recycled ” clothes .
“ A lot of the neighborhood men who shop in our store are very style - conscious , ” said Mary Dalton , the manager of a Crossroads store near the Castro district in San Francisco .
“ They can recycle their clothing and not wear it into the ground .
Sustainable businesses are becoming more trendy , so people are more open to it . ”
Prices , she said , range from $ 6 to $ 75 , and popular jeans like Diesel or G Star cost $ 50 to $ 65 a pair compared with a regular retail price that can be double or triple that .
“ People will get three or four garments for the price of one , ” she said .
“ We get all kinds of customers , from an attorney who needs work clothes to the college - age hipster .
The age range is very , very wide . ”
Consumers can also make money by selling or donating clothing or household goods to thrift and consignment shops .
Donations can offer a tax deduction , while selling items that are worth more than you paid , can make consigning lucrative , Ms. Massie said .
“ I once found a vintage Carlton Ware money box for $ 2.50 and made a $ 45 profit and a pair of Ruehl jeans for $ 9.99 that I sold for $ 60 .
I know of a lady who bought a necklace for $ 3.50 , and it was a diamond over one carat worth over $ 8,000 .
“ That ’s why I shop in thrift stores . ”

John McCain appeared on Ellen today , where he must 've realized that he would be facing questions about his stance on legalizing gay marriage posed by an actual gay person that America adores .
Ellen , who plans to get married to her girlfriend Portia de Rossi this summer , was firm without being too — oh , hell , I 'll just say it — Rosie O'Donnell -ish .
McCain , of course , was not persuaded by her points , but he wished her " every happiness . "

Welcome to Green Hands USA
One of the predicted consequences of the rise in global temperatures is a rise in ocean levels , one that may cause our infrastructure a some additional strain .
Higher temperatures cause water to expand , and have caused the retreat of mountain glaciers and loss of volume in some of the major ice caps .
A small but accelerating rise in ocean levels has been detected using tide records , but many questions about the variables that contribute to that rise remain unanswered .
A study that will be released online by Science attempts to fill one of these gaps by looking at how much water humanity has locked up in reservoirs over the last century .
The authors of the study , both from Taiwan 's National Central University , started with information from the World Register of Dams , maintained by the International Commission on Large Dams , and corrected and augmented their data using additional sources .
They were able to track the year of completion and nominal capacity of nearly 30,000 dams .
A statistical analysis of the data suggested that the total of small , unregistered reservoirs would alter their figure by less than one percent .
Their data showed a surge in construction following 1950 , which peaked around 1980 , and has rapidly tailed off ; total retained water lagged this , as reservoirs take time to fill , but should be leveling off now .
To compensate for water seeping into the surrounding soil and rock ( estimates suggest this seepage may roughly equal the reservoir capacity ) , the authors created a dynamic , time - dependent formula .
This additional factor means that the total water retention from the earlier building boom has yet to peak .
A multiplier of 0.85 was used to compensate for the fact that reservoirs are not always at capacity .
With all of that accounted for , the final estimate is that roughly 10,800 cubic kilometers of water have been kept out of the oceans by reservoirs .
That would account for roughly 30 mm , or just over an inch , of additional sea level rises .
At current rates of sea level rise , that accounts for roughly a decade 's accumulation .
The authors argue that this suggests we are underestimating the contributions of the changes in water volume and glacial melting .
Because the author 's water retention model is dynamic with time , they were able to overlay the annual amount of water held in reservoirs on top of the measured change in sea level .
Doing so essentially eliminates the acceleration in the rates of water rise that appears in the historical records .
If dams were n't in the equation , the study suggests , the oceans would have been rising at a constant rate since the 1930s , just after the modern rise in temperatures started .
I expect this wo n't be the final word on the topic ; the authors ' model requires a few assumptions that may not hold up to criticism .
They recognize that water displacement by silt is a dynamic process that is n't accounted for here .
Nearly 10 percent of the total figure could also be accounted for the loss of volume in the landlocked Aral Sea , although it 's not clear how much of that wound up diverted to reservoirs .
Regardless , the paper is a good attempt at nailing down one of the open questions about how the planet is responding to climate change , and any criticisms should get us closer to a more accurate picture of what we can expect in the future .

Debate in Congress and among financial regulatory policymakers over how to manage the housing and credit crises have mostly focused on how the interconnected crises have affected the markets — and not on how it has affected the average American .
When a large Wall Street investment bank such as Bear Stearns Cos. , which was known for its aggressive mortgage lending cum mortgage securitization practices , is allowed to avoid bankruptcy because it ’s too large to fail , but ordinary folk are told to pay heavily for their mistakes , then something is morally wrong .
When the invisible hand of the marketplace is given a hefty influx of money from the Federal Reserve ( with an implicit backing from U.S. taxpayers ) to help the credit market , many applaud the action .
But what about individual homeowners facing foreclosure ?
This essay will take the position that one essential perspective in this ménage of high finance is the plight of low - and moderate - income home - owning families living in a house facing foreclosure .
What of their lot ?
Will the invisible hand help them ?
Or do we instead need a visible helping hand to help responsible family homeowners stay in their homes ?
Families need a helping hand from government because the invisible hand imposes high social costs in the face of multiple market failures .
The analysis that follows , however , starts from a very different place than would usually be expected — detailing the fundamental philosophical and thus moral imperatives for helping low - and moderate - income homeowners keep a roof they own over their heads .
This approach requires the swift exploration of several telling philosophical truisms ; terms such as “ human claims rights ” and “ goods of agency ” and “ human agency . ”
Far from being arcane philosophical terms , these fundamental truths ( as we shall see ) underscore exactly why members of Congress have a moral obligation to help those homeowners who through no fault of their own face foreclosure and financial ruin due to housing and credit crises for which they bear little if any responsibility .

The largest carnivore that ever walked the planet – Tyrannosaurus rex – is more closely related to the modern chicken than it is to living reptiles such as the alligator or crocodile , a study of the dinosaur 's fossilised protein has found .
Researchers analysed a tiny shred of 68 - million - year - old protein taken from the leg of T. Rex and compared it to the same protein found in 21 modern species .
They confirmed that the giant predator is closely related to chickens and ostriches , but only to a lesser extent to reptiles such as alligators and crocodiles , which were thought to be more closely related to dinosaurs than other living creatures .
It is the first time that scientists have been able to trace a relationship between dinosaurs and birds through molecular analysis of animal protein , although anatomical studies have already produced convincing evidence of a link between birds and dinosaurs .

" These results match predictions made from skeletal anatomy , providing the first molecular evidence for the evolutionary relationships of a non-avian dinosaur , " said Chris Organ , a researcher in evolutionary biology at Harvard University in the US .
Proteins are composed of amino - acids arranged in a sequence that mirrors the order of chemical bases on molecules of DNA , so scientists can look at short strands of protein– called peptides – to investigate the relationships between species : alive or dead .
" Even though we only had six peptides – just 89 amino - acids – from T. rex , we were able to establish these relationships with a relatively high degree of support , " Dr Organ said .
" With more data , we would likely see the T. rex branch on the phylogenetic tree between alligators and chickens and ostriches , though we cannot resolve this position with currently available data . "
John Asara and Lewis Cantley , of Harvard Medical School , were the first experts to capture and sequence pieces of collagen protein from T. rex .
The samples were taken from the thigh bone of a T. rex unearthed in the " badlands " of Wyoming and Montana .
" Most of the collagen sequence was obtained from protein and genome databases , " Dr Asara said , " but we also needed to sequence some critical organisms , including modern alligator and modern ostrich .
" We determined that T. rex grouped with birds – ostrich and chicken – better than any other organism that we studied .
We also showed that it groups better with birds than modern reptiles , such as alligators and green anole lizards . "
The study , published in the latest edition of the journal Science , will add to the growing evidence that birds are descended directly from a group of dinosaurs that grew feathers , possibly as a form of thermal insulation , before they learnt to fly .
In China , scientists have found many examples of feathered dinosaurs , including several that may have used their wings to glide .
One fossilised dinosaur had feathers growing in both pairs of limbs , suggesting that four - winged flight may have been possible among some species .
Is Fast Memory Really Worth It ?
Memory vendors have become excellent at marketing their latest high - end products : DDR3-2000 speeds are currently considered state of the art for enthusiast Intel platforms based on Intel ’s P35 , X38 , X48 chipsets or the new Nvidia 7 series .
But how much sense do these products really make ?
While mainstream DDR2 memory has reached almost ridiculously low price levels - you can get two 2 GB DDR2 - 800 DIMMs for less than $ 80 - DDR3 memory at 1600 speed or faster easily costs five times as much , without delivering even double the performance .
In fact , for the vast majority of users , the difference between mainstream and high - end memory turns out to be extremely small .
The importance of Random Access Memory ( RAM ) has changed a lot over time .
There were noticeable performance differences between CL2 and CL3 timings back at the turn of the millennium , when first generation SDRAM at PC100 or PC133 speeds were popular .
But now , the performance delta between quick and very relaxed timings is almost negligible in using fast DDR2 - or DDR3 - SDRAM .
Although memory latencies seem to have increased from one memory generation to the next ( CL2/3 with DDR1 , CL3 - 5 with DDR2 , CL5 and up with DDR3 ) , the latencies have n’t changed much , as the clock speeds have doubled with each generation change .
The effective latencies hence remained very much the same , while throughput has increased considerably .
( Compare Prices on DDR )
Enthusiast memory does have another justification that is only indirectly based on performance : overclockers need maximum flexibility from components when they want to squeeze out maximum performance from their systems .
Increasing the system speed is often the only way to increase the CPU clock , which will automatically accelerate the memory as well , as its clock speed directly derives from the system clock speed .
Since you do n’t want to be performance - restrained by limiting memory speed , fast memory may be necessary to achieve maximum system performance .
This scenario is only valid for hardcore overclockers , however , as the benefit of fast memory over slower has become very small if the other components and parameters remain unchanged .
We wanted to know how important RAM speed and timings really are .
To test this , we assembled a Socket 775 system , which we operated using two different processors : a brand new 3.16 GHz Core 2 Duo E8500 based on the 45 nm Core 2 Duo Wolfdale core with 6 MB L2 cache ; and a 3.73 GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition single core processor .
We decided to include the old single core Netburst P4 processor since it offers a smaller and less efficient cache memory than the Core 2 Duo .
Both processors were benchmarked at DDR2 - 667 , DDR2 - 800 and DDR2 - 1066 speeds as well as DDR3 - 1066 and DDR3 - 1333 , each time using slow and fast timings .
The P4 , however , could not be benchmarked at DDR3 - 1333 speed , as it would have required FSB1333 .
How many times have we read some variation on the following lede ?
" Israeli armored forces backed by aircraft thrust into the southern Gaza Strip today , killing four Palestinians a day before Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were to begin laying the groundwork for peace talks . "
The Israelis do n’t want to negotiate , but they ’re willing to go through the motions  after all , why not ?
It ’s just another way for them to thumb their noses at everyone , including their American benefactors .
They ’ll never make meaningful concessions : there ’s no reason to as long as there are no constraints on their behavior .
As long as a steady stream of American aid and arms keeps the Israeli ship of state afloat , Israel is the regional superpower , with none of its neighbors a match for its nuclear - armed military might .
Why should the Israelis be interested in peace , when war has been so good to them ?
War gave them their country to begin with : first against the British , then against the indigenous Arabs , then against the entire Arab world  all of whom they beat handily .
The Iraq war has been very good for them , if not for us .
Israel ’s sphere of influence , which never extended much beyond Lebanon , now reaches into Kurdistan  giving them easy access to Iran .
We stood by while the Israelis bombed Lebanon , killing mostly civilians and targeting factories , waterworks , and other non-military , non-Hezbollah facilities , such as churches .
Aid to Israel has been increased , and Congress recently passed , with bipartisan support , a resolution naming a military arm of Israel ’s number one enemy in the region as an officially - designated " terrorist " group , paving the way for a shooting war .
Peace ?
Israel does n’t need it or want it .
Oh , sure , the people of Israel may want it , at least in theory .
In practice , however , the successive governments they keep electing are not the least bit interested in real negotiations with the Palestinians or anybody else in the region .
Where ’s the payoff ?
From the Israeli perspective , things are going just swimmingly , thank you : no need to upset the apple cart .
There have been a few setbacks , however , but nothing serious .
Their drive to push us into a military confrontation with Iran has been stalled , for the moment  but that just means the road to war with Tehran is going to be a little longer .
No one really cares that Iran stopped its alleged nuclear program in 2003  that is , if it ever had one , which I seriously doubt .
The whole issue has been trumped up by the West for the sole purpose of humiliating the Persians , and disabusing the mullahs of any illusions that the humbling of Iraq will prove a boon to them .
Israel is sitting pretty , right now , openly threatening its patron and financier , the United States government , with taking the Iranian nuke matter into its own hands and launching an attack on suspected nuclear facilities  leaving U.S. troops in Iraq to face the Iranians and their Iraqi allies .
Gee , thanks a lot , guys .
This kind of blackmail would n’t be tolerated by Washington coming from any other country on earth : it would be considered a hostile act , carried out by a rogue nation .
Yet Israel is not just any other country : it has the distinction of commanding Washington ’s most powerful lobby in the foreign policy realm .
And its power is not limited to Washington : as John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt , authors of The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy , point out , the Lobby " strives to ensure that public discourse portrays Israel in a positive light , by repeating myths about its founding and by promoting its point of view in policy debates .
The goal is to prevent critical comments from getting a fair hearing in the political arena .
Controlling the debate is essential to guaranteeing U.S. support , because a candid discussion of U.S. - Israeli relations might lead Americans to favor a different policy . "
It ’s all about stifling debate , and , if that ’s no longer possible , framing the debate in terms that are advantageous to Israel ’s partisans .
For example , Mearsheimer and Walt ’s recent visit to Princeton was an occasion of high controversy , which a reading of The Daily Princetonian shows to have been a perfect example of how and why the Lobby is so successful .
No less than three articles cover this brouhaha in all its aspects , the first being a news account of the event itself .
Mearsheimer and Walt delivered their lecture , which " drew strong reactions from the audience , " and not exactly in their favor , as telegraphed by the headline : " Critics of Israeli lobby draw fire . "
The piece goes on to report what Mearsheimer and Walt actually said , which is that Israel is simply not treated as a " normal country " by the U.S. government .
We give a level of aid and unconditional support that undermines our own interests in the region , and makes the task of fighting terrorism directed at the United States much more difficult .
With the end of the Cold War , the divergence of American and Israeli interests is even more radical , yet the " special relationship " persists and grows even more perilously " special . "
But of course Israel is not treated like a normal country , especially when there is any discussion of the delicate subject at hand , namely the existence of the Lobby .
In this case , Princeton could not permit the unvarnished message of Mearsheimer and Walt to stand alone : it had to have a corrective at hand , in the form of a " moderator , " Wilson School Professor Robert Keohane , who proffered this penetrating analysis of the presentation :
" Keohane , in response to the authors ’ presentation , said he believed Mearsheimer and Walt ’s ideas were presented ‘ in good faith ’ but also called their book ‘ a flawed work of political science . ’
Keohane referenced what he saw as numerous ‘ inconsistencies with realities ’ in their thesis , noting that Syria recently participated in Middle East peace talks despite opposition from some pro-Israel groups and observing that Israel - Palestinian policies in Europe were consistent with those in America despite the lack of a strong pro-Israel base on the continent . "
Pretty weak tea .
So the U.S. acknowledged Syria ’s existence  so what ?
( They still have n’t sent an ambassador to Damascus . )
And the allies are marching in lockstep with Uncle Sam .
Well , they had better .
The real bone of contention , however , was the thesis advanced by Mearsheimer and Walt that the Lobby  properly understood as an alliance of various groups including major Jewish organizations and neoconservatives in the administration and on the periphery  was the decisive factor driving us to war in Iraq .
Amid " supportive shouts from the audience , " Keohane denied the key role played by the neoconservatives and offered up the quite - tired - by - now post - 9/11 " everything changed " argument to explain the invasion and occupation of a country that had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon .
The rest of the Daily Princetonian " news " account is devoted to a summary of the pans the Mearsheimer - Walt book has received at the hands of its pro-Israel critics , and ends by wondering if they are n’t anti-Semitic .
Well , according to Keohane , yes and no :
" Much attention has been paid to the question of whether the authors or their work are in any sense anti-Semitic .
I do not believe that this is relevant .
Whether out of ignorance or a desire to court controversy , the authors have chosen to make use of language and imagery similar to that deployed in the past by avowed anti-Semites . "
Translation :
These guys are either Nazis or just plain stupid .
Take your pick .
Just to make sure that anyone exposed to the malicious ignorance of Mearsheimer and Walt do n’t come away with any wrong ideas , the Daily Princetonian features two other pieces , one an " open letter " from Professor Aaron Friedberg of the Wilson School directed to the sponsors of the event , chastising them for even issuing the invitation , and the other an op - ed by a trio of pro-Israel students who disingenuously declare at the outset that Mearsheimer and Walt had their day on campus " unimpeded by any protest whatsoever "  except , of course , for the contentious Professor Keohane , without whom the students would have been forced to examine and judge the arguments all by their lonesome selves .
Even in the act of debating the Mearsheimer - Walt thesis , the Princetonian trio contest the legitimacy of even posing the question of how and why the Lobby is so successful : " their argument against the ‘ Israel lobby ’ actually sours the environment for the debate "  and therefore no one should ever bring up the subject , which is " sloppy , " " illogical , " and has been " criticized by both sides of the political spectrum . "
How fortunate for the Lobby that the parameters of the political spectrum  as defined by themselves  place all criticism and even mention of the Lobby beyond the pale .
To top it off , Mearsheimer and Walt are " ignoring the American democratic process , " according to these critics , who apparently do n’t realize that this is precisely what Mearsheimer and Walt are n’t ignoring .
Their argument is that the " democratic " process itself is quite amenable to determined pressure by a concerned minority , which is perfectly legitimate and understandable  just as it ’s perfectly legitimate and understandable to raise this issue and point out how the Lobby distorts American foreign policy in the Middle East .
What do they teach them at Princeton , aside from how to make solipsistic arguments ?
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I just got my copy of the Dec. 17 issue of The American Conservative , which contains my article , " Robinson Jeffers , Peace Poet . "
I would n’t count on them putting it online , so go out and get yourself a copy .
I love this anecdote from Jonathan Schwartz 's blog .
As is demonstrated again and again , enterprises have no idea just how awash in open - source software they are ... until they ask .
The CIO responded categorically with " we do n't run MySQL , we run [ name withheld to protect the proprietary ] . "
The CISO said , " We can't just let developers download software off the net , you know , we 've got regulation and security to worry about . "
The CTO smiled .
Everyone else appeared to be sitting on their hands .
I was going to leave it at that .
Thanks for the business .
Until a ( diplomatically ) assertive Sun sales rep piped up , " Um ... no , I connected with a buddy of mine over at MySQL , and had him check - you 've downloaded MySQL more than 1,300 times in the last twelve months . "
After a profoundly awkward silence , one of the individuals from their internal development team piped up , " Actually , everybody uses it .
Why bother hassling with license agreements when MySQL 's got you covered . "
Indeed .
Now the only thing missing in that conversation is the enterprise stepping up to pay for some or all of its free - loading adoption of MySQL .
This is what is prompting MySQL to consider new licensing models .
It would be very easily resolved by enterprises for owning up to and paying for the value they derive from open source , very little of which comes down to a lower price tag .
Now that Firefox 3 is approaching the home stretch it is important that Mozilla starts to throw in performance improvements to really make the browser purr .
Over in our forum xpgeek pointed out that a Profile - Guided Optimization ( PGO ) build of Firefox 3 had been created which greatly improved the performance of JavaScript in the browser .
While PGO itself has n’t yet landed in the nightly builds there have been some significant improvements to the JavaScript engine .
I ’m sure what most of you care the most about are the facts , and so I ’ve compiled the results of the SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark test for each of the different browsers .
All of the tests below were performed on the same Windows machine , and the Firefox 3 nightly builds definitely came out on top .
Here are the results sorted from best to worst ( each one is hyperlinked to the full stats ) :
Firefox 3 Nightly ( PGO Optimized ) : 7263.8ms Firefox 3 Nightly ( 02/25/2008 build ) : 8219.4ms Opera 9.5.9807 Beta : 10824.0ms Firefox 3 Beta 3 : 16080.6ms Safari 3.0.4 Beta : 18012.6ms Firefox 2.0.0.12 : 29376.4ms Internet Explorer 7 : 72375.0ms
It ’s important to know that every time you run the SunSpider Benchmark it conducts each test five times , and the result is the average of the five tests .
So it is a rather thorough test , and definitely shows off the speed improvements that Firefox 3 is going to be bringing to the table .
What does this all mean for you ?
Depending on what browser you typically use you may not notice a huge speed difference , but the change will be the most noticeable on sites that use JavaScript heavily .
With the Web 2.0 era upon us all JavaScript speed enhancements are welcomed with open arms .
Firefox 3 Beta 4 is expected to be released in the next few weeks , and you can expect to see these ( and many more ) improvements shining through !
Some refer to it as economy class syndrome .
To others it 's know as a coach class clot .
But whatever you call it , sitting squeezed into an airplane seat until you develop deep vein thrombosis is no way to die .
And that 's why this strange new seat is worth checking out .
The Cozy Suite ( sort of a cheesy name , we know ) is a staggered seat configuration designed to give passengers a better shot at getting some shut - eye during their flight .
Delta just put in a big order for the seats , and surprisingly , plans to install them in the often overlooked coach class cabin .
A new airplane seat is n't something you just throw together during a lunch break .
Thompson Solutions , the UK company responsible for the Cozy Suite , spent nearly seven years designing , testing , and refining the product .
They started by observing passenger behavior on both short - and long - haul flights .
Thompson 's Brian Rogers says the design team came away with two main findings : passengers trying to sleep on long flights tend to position themselves at an angle , and those sitting at the window seat generally seem slightly less miserable because they can rest their head against the wall .
With this information Thompson developed and patented the idea of a staggered seat .
They then began the long process of designing a prototype , refining it , and running usability tests .
It 's product design 101 , except that Thompson had to balance passenger comfort with some very specific technical specs .
" It does n't make sense to change the product if it wo n't be certified , " Rogers says .
" ( The ) engineering ( team ) needed to involved at all stages of development .
The finished product , at least on paper , seems great .
Because seats are n't lined up in a straight row , each passenger has a place to rest their head .
The staggered design also creates a sense of personal space , and gives passengers four inches of additional legroom .
It might seem surprising that cash - strapped Delta would be the first customer to order the Cozy Suite , but the seats will provide the airline with competitive advantage in the brutally competitive transatlantic market .
And from a business standpoint , the design allows Delta to fit eight seats in a row instead of seven , which means they can wring more revenue out of each flight .
Delta wo n't say how much they 're paying for the seats , but they plan to install them on 100 777 and 767 widebodies beginning in 2010 .
As far as future sales go , Rogers says Thompson has a verbal agreement with one middle eastern airline ( we 're guessing Emirates ) , and is close to deals with several others .
But usability tests are different than actual flights , and he admits the new seats are a gamble .
Having spent too many hours cramped in coach , we think they 're probably better than what 's out there now .

Tiny snippets of DNA , buried in the human genome , reveal that an ancient family of viruses took up permanent residence in our simian ancestors some 30 million years ago .
This viral DNA resembles a gene that HIV uses during its reproductive cycle within human cells .
Buried within the genetic blueprint of every human is a snippet of DNA that resembles a gene sequence from the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .
Humans have been carrying this unwanted genetic baggage around for more than 30 million years , according to researchers from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute ( HHMI ) at Duke University .
" We 're all walking around with a little bit of an HIV - like sequence in our genes , " said Bryan Cullen , an HHMI investigator at Duke University .
Certain disease - causing tools used by HIV may have been around much longer than we had previously thought .
Bryan R. Cullen
According to Cullen and his colleagues , an ancient family of viruses , known as HERV-K ( for human endogenous retrovirus K ) , took up permanent residence in the genetic material of Old World monkeys shortly after they diverged from New World monkeys .
The viruses then traveled with their simian and pre-human hosts as these species moved along the evolutionary path that led to Homo sapiens .
Cullen 's group published its findings in the November 9 , 1999 , issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
During infection , some viruses insert their DNA into the host 's genome and direct the host 's cellular machinery to make the proteins needed to assemble more viruses .
If this gene insertion takes place in a cell that will become an egg or a sperm , the host 's offspring will have a copy of the virus in every single cell .
" Once it 's in there , it does n't get out , " Cullen said .
Because of these viral gene insertion events , genetic material from inactive viruses accounts for roughly 3 percent of the human genome .
Cullen says that 30 - 50 copies of HERV-K exist in the human genome , and that some of the copies appear to be active at a low level in normal testicular and placental tissue .
The HERV-K genes show even more activity in certain cancers , especially those involving the testes , " but there does n't seem to be a harmful effect from the activity of these genes , " Cullen said .
The consistent presence of HERV - Ks , however , offers insight into the evolution of both humans and viruses .
First , it offers " very good evidence confirming that humans evolved from monkeys , specifically Old World monkeys . "
Perhaps more importantly , though , Cullen and his group determined that the HERV-K viral protein , K - Rev , functions in a manner similar to the HIV Rev protein .
" This suggests that certain disease - causing tools used by HIV may have been around much longer than we had previously thought , " said Cullen .
Rev , a protein which is produced by human T - cell leukemia viruses in addition to HIV , ushers viral messenger RNAs from the nucleus of a host cell into the cytoplasm , where they direct the cell 's machinery to make the building blocks for more viruses .
Rev accomplishes this transport by controlling a human protein known as Crm1 .
Without this Rev-Crm1 pair , viral messenger RNA would remain trapped inside the host 's nucleus , and the virus would be unable to reproduce .
Until now , scientists had thought this activity was unique to HIV and human T - cell leukemia viruses , but Cullen and colleagues disagree .
Though K - Rev appears quite different structurally from HIV's Rev , Cullen and his colleagues have demonstrated that K - Rev also hijacks Crm1 to transport mRNA from a cell 's nucleus to its cytoplasm .
" The gene has been sitting in our genome all these millions of years , and it's in perfect working order , " Cullen said .
Is HIV , then , descended from a virus that humans have carried for millions of years ?
" Probably not , " Cullen said .
" It 's much more likely that HERV-K and HIV descended from a common ancestral virus that had Rev-like activity or that the two viruses exchanged genetic material somewhere in their evolutionary history to create Rev activity . "
Cullen said that this discovery could have implications for xenografts , the untested practice of transplanting animal organs , such as kidneys , into humans .
With any transplant , the recipients receive not only the organ , but also any viruses that may be living in its cells .
In the case of animal - to - human transplants , the procedure brings genetic material from two different species into close contact .
" You now give these viruses an opportunity for genetic exchange , an opportunity not too different from what may have created the REV activity in the first place , " explained Cullen .
But beyond such implications , Cullen believes there is a more important insight coming out of this work with K - Rev .
" If we had a better idea of how viruses evolve , we might develop better strategies for countering the threats of viral infection , " Cullen said .

上記URLから、「 音声通 話SIM 」「音声通話SIM+端末セット」の契約でキャッシュバックが獲得出来ます。
残念ながら、 「 デー タ SIM 」 「デー タSIM+端末セット」の契約はキャッシュバック対象外となっています。
キャッシュバック額は契約プランにより、5,000～13,000円となっています。
高速データ+音声SIMプラン：5,000 円
たっぷりプラ ンS・おしゃべりプランS：10,000 円
たっぷりプラ ンM・おしゃべりプランM：10,000 円
たっぷりプラ ンL・おしゃべりプランL：13,000 円
キャッシュバック申請方法と受け取り方法
契約月を1ヶ月目として、4ヶ月目にUQモバイルからキャッシュバックの案内メールが、契約時に入力した自分のメールアドレス宛に届きます。
メール記載のURLから、振込先情報を登録すると基本的には翌営業日に振り込まれます。
まとめますと 、
契約の3ヶ月後にメールが届くので、記載のURLからキャッシュバック申請。
受け取りは、キャッシュバック申請時に入力した銀行口座に入金。
という流れになります。
キャッシュバックは代理店経由がお得？
UQモバイルのキャッシュバックは代理店でも実施されています。
UQモバイル公式のキャッシュバック特典との違いは、キャッシュバックが受け取れるまでの期間にあります。
キャッシュバック額はUQモバイル公式経由でも、代理店経由でも同額となっています。
代理店は現在 、BIGLOBEとLinkLifeの2社があり、それぞれのキャッシュバックを解説していきます。
UQモバイル公式では、4ヶ月目でキャッシュバック
BIGLOBE 経由では、6ヶ月目でキャッシュバック
LinkLife経由では、8ヶ月目でキャッシュバック
上記のようになっているので、UQモバイル公式からの申し込みが一番オススメとなっています。
UQ モバイルで25,000円キャッシュバック！？
一部サイトでは 、UQモバイル契約で25,000円キャッシュバックという記載をしているサイトもありますが、これはウソです。
正確に書くなら 、 「 UQモバイル +UQ Wimaxの契約で合計25,000円キャッシュバック」です。
25,000円と聞くとかなりお得に思えますが、Wimaxの二年総額で考えると、GMOとくとくBBの方が安いので、WiMAXも検討しているのであれば、UQモバイル+GMOとくとくBBが一番お得でしょう。
UQ モバイルは実質負担額108円の端末が多い
UQモバイルで販売されている端末の中には実質負担額108円で販売されているものも多いので、キャッシュバックを加味すると、かなりお得に契約できる計算になります。
実 質108円の端末で13,000円キャッシュバックを獲得すれば、2年総額は相当安いです。（プランSなら6万円以下）
Y!mobileとUQモバイルは現在では、ほぼ同じ額の料金プラン設定となっていますが、キャッシュバック金額や端末の実質負担額を計算すると、UQモバイルの方が安いと言えるでしょう。
エントリーコードの方がお得？
UQモバイルでは、エントリーパッケージと言う、初期費用が無料となるパッケージが数百円程度で販売されています。
キャッシュバックが実施されていないときには、こちらのエントリーパッケージを活用した方がお得に入会できたのですが、キャッシュバックキャンペーンが開催されている現在では、公式サイトからキャッシュバックを獲得したほうがお得です。
というのも、エントリーパッケージを利用した場合、キャッシュバック対象外となってしまう為です。
これからUQモバイルの契約を検討している方は、この点にご注意ください。
UQモバイルのキャッシュバックとY!mobileのキャッシュバック
UQモバイルのキャッシュバックとY!mobileのキャッシュバックについて、比較していきたいと思います。
まず、UQモバイルのキャッシュバックは音声SIMのみが対象で、SIM単体でも端末セットでもキャッシュバック対象となっています。
かたや、Y!mobileのキャッシュバックも音声SIMのみ対象ですが、端末セットの場合キャッシュバック対象外となっています。
つまり、端末セットで購入する場合は、UQモバイルでしかキャッシュバックが獲得できませんので、端末セットでの契約を検討している方は、UQモバイルの方がお得です。
SIMのみの契約で考えた場合、一見 、UQモバイルの方がお得に見えますが、実際はどうでしょう。
人気のiPhone SE 32GBで契約した場合で比較シミュレーションしてみましょう！
i Phone SE 32GB の2年総額比較
下記が比較表になります。
ただし、2つ注意点があります。
UQモバイルが5分以内の通話かけ放題であるのに対し、
Y!mobileでは10分以内の通話かけ放題です。
※ UQモバイルでは5分かけ放題じゃなく無料通話付きのプランも選べます。
また、UQモバイルの2年総額は、キャッシュバックキャンペーンを適用した場合の金額で計算しています。
店舗からの申込やエントリーコード利用での申込の場合、下記表の金額よりも高くなります。
ということで、やっぱ りUQモバイル安い！
UQモバイルのキャッシュバックについてまとめましたが、UQモバイルの基本情報についてもまとめておきます。
最近人気 のUQモバイルとは？
最近は格安simというのが一般的になってきて多くの人が大手のキャリアから格安simに移行しています。
そしてその数ある格安simの中でも特に知名度があるのがUQモバイルです。
なぜなら数ある格安simの中でも早くからテレビのコマーシャルを流したりして確実にその認知度を上げていったからでした。
ま たUQモバイルというのは単に認知度が高いだけでなく格安simは品質が悪いと言われていたのを払拭したMVNOです。
それはどういう事かというと格安simは大手のキャリアよりも速度が遅いと言われていたのですが
UQモバイルはそういう事はなくて多くの人が使う昼休憩の時間でも速度がほとんど変わらないというのがあるからです。
なので数ある格安simでも人気なのがUQモバイルです。
UQ モバイルの実店舗はどこにあるか？
これから格安simで有名なUQモバイルに申し込みをしたいと思っている人もいるかと思います。
ですが実際にUQモバイルに申し込もうと思った時にできればスタッフから色々聞いてからU契約したいと思っている人も多いかと思います。
ですが格安simの中には実店舗で契約できないものも結構あります。
それが嫌という人もいて格安simを使うのをためらっている人もいるかと思います。
ですがUQモバイルの場合は実店舗からも申し込む事ができます。
それは全国にある有名な家電量販店やスーパー等に行けばUQモバイルは実店舗でも契約できます。
例えばヤマダ電機やエディオンやビックカメラやジョーシンやイトーヨーカドー等です。
これらの店舗に行けば問題なくUQモバイルを契約できます。
UQモバイルはiPhoneを扱っているのか？
これからスマホを格安simにしようと思っている人の中にはUQモバイルにしたいと思っている人も多いかと思います。
ですが実際にUQモバイルを契約したいと思っていても中にはここはiPhoneを扱っているか気になるという人もいるかと思います。
その点は心配ないです。確かにMVNOの中にはiPhoneを扱っていないMVNOもあります。
ですがUQモバイルの場合はちゃんとiPhoneも扱ているので自分はスマホはiPhoneしか使わないという人も安心して
UQモバイルで契約して欲しいと思います。
UQモバイルならiPhoneも扱っているのでiPhoneユーザーも安心して利用できます。
なので特に心配しなくても良いです。
UQモバイルの端末はどういうのがあるか？
これから格安simにしようと思っている人でUQモバイルはどういう端末があるか気になるという人もいるかと思います。
確かに実際にこれから格安simにしようと思った時にそこが自分が使いたいと思っている端末に対応していないと困ります。
では、実際にUQモバイルはどういう端末に端末に対応しているかというと
HUAWEI nova 2 やSHARP AQUOS sense やHUAWEI P10 liteやarrows M04 PREMIUM やKYOCERA DIGNO VやASUS ZenFone 4 や
BLADE V770 やAlcatel SHINE LITEやarrows M03等様々な端末に対応しています。
キャリアからのMNPに対応しているのか？
今現在大手のキャリアと契約していてこれから格安simのUQモバイルにしたいと思っている人も多いかと思います。
ですが実際にこれまで大手キャリアでスマホを使っていた人に取って気になるのがUQモバイルに移行しようと思った時に
本当にMNPに対応しているのかというのがあるかと思います。
確かにまだ格安simを利用した事がない人からすれな本当にこれまで大手のキャリアで使っていた電話番号がそのまま
使えるか気になると思います。ですが、その点も全く気にしなくても良いです。
普通にUQモバイルに申し込みをすればMNP利用で契約するかどうかの選択ができるので簡単にMNP利用で
契約できます。なのでこれまで大手キャリアで使っていた番号もそのまま使えます。
UQ モバイルのおすすめの学割とは
UQモバイルにしようと思っている人の中にはまだ学生の人も学割がないか気になっている人もいるかと思います。
では実際にUQモバイルの学割はどういうサービスかというとここはUQゼロ学割というのがあって学割言っても必ずしも学生である必要はなくて
5歳から18歳までの年齢なら学割の対象になります。
それで通常の料金よりも割引された金額でUQモバイルのスマホが使えるようになります。
なので自分はまだ18歳でもすでに学生でないから学割は適用されないと思う事はないです。
年齢の条件がしっかり満たされていれば学割が適用されるのでそして利用し始めてから最初の3か月は
基本料金が無料になってさらに機種変更まで契約プランの2倍通信できるというのがあります。
UQモバイルの家族割がすごいのはどういう点か
すでにスマホはUQモバイルを使っているという人もいるかと思います。
ですが中には自分だけでなく家族にもUQモバイルを使わせたいけれどもどの程度お得なるか気になる人もいるかと思います。
なぜなら多くの格安simは家族割というのがあっても大した割引がなくお得感が少ないからです。
なので家族もUQモバイルに移行させたいと思っても家族割が大した事がないと家族が渋る事もあるからです。
ですがその心配はな くUQモバイルの場合は家族もUQモバイルにすれば家族の月額料金を500円割り引いてくれるという
ものです。なので格安simの家族割はお得感があまりないというイメージがあったという人もUQモバイルならかなりお得なのでおすすめです。
UQモバイルの解約方法はどうなっているか
そして初めてUQモバイルで契約しようと思っている人の中にはUQモバイルを解約したいと思った時は
大手キャリアみたいにすんなり解約できないのではないかと心配してしまう人もいるかと思います。
ですがその点も特に心配はなく専用のダイヤルに電話して解約の申し込みをすれば簡単に解約できます。
なので特にUQモバイルの解約で大変な事はないです。
また解約する時は通話機能があるプランを解約する時は1年以内だと違約金が発生しますが
データプランのみの場合は違約金は発声しないです。
なので注意する点があるとすれば通話機能もあるプランを契約する場合は1年は使わないと
違約金が発生するという点くらいです。そこだけ気を付けていれば大丈夫です。
UQモバイルのキャンペーンはどういうのがあるか
これから大手のキャリアからUQモバイルにしたいと思っている人の中には
UQモバイルがどういうキャンペーンをやっているか気になっている人もいるかと思います。
今 UQモバイルがやっているキャンペーンにはUQモバイルを誰かに紹介したりまた紹介されただけで
Amazonギフト券2000円分もらえるというキャンペーンがあります。
そして紹介人数が最大10人までこのキャンペーンが適用されるので最大で20000円分のAmazonギフト券がもらえます。
これが良いのは紹介してもされても良い点です。
なのでUQモバイルを紹介する人もされる人ももらえるので積極的にこのキャンペーンを活用した方がお得になります。
紹介する人がいるならドンドン使った方が良いです。
UQモバイルのお得なキャッシュバックとは
UQモバイルを契約しようと思っている人の中にはUQモバイルにしてどれだけキャッシュバックがあるか気になっている人もいるかと思います。
UQモバイルは現在UQモバイルのサイトから申し込みをすれば最大で25000円のキャッシュバックを受ける事ができます。
その内容なプラ ンLの申し込みで13000円、プランMで12000円、プランSの申し込みで11000円のキャッシュバックを受ける事ができます。
さらにUQWimaxも一緒に申し込めばこれにさらに12000円のキャッシュバックを受ける事ができます。
しかもUQモバイルのキャッシュバックが良いのはよくある1年後にキャッシュバックを受ける事ができるという
ものでなく申し込んでから数カ月で受ける事ができるので受け取り忘れがないのが良いです。

The latest unbelievable argument from the Clinton campaign is that she actually leads in the popular vote if the unrecognized elections in Michigan and Florida are included .
Here is what the Clinton campaign put out today via press release .
“ After last night ’s decisive victory in Pennsylvania , more people have voted for Hillary than any other candidate , including Sen. Obama .
Estimates vary slightly , but according to Real Clear Politics , Hillary has received 15,095,663 votes to Sen .
Obama ’s 14,973,720 , a margin of more than 120,000 votes .
ABC
News reported this morning that ‘ Clinton has pulled ahead of Obama ’s in the popular vote .
This count includes certified vote totals in Florida and Michigan . ”
What I am trying to figure out is how does the popular vote still count in primary elections which broke the rules and are not recognized by the national party ?
The obvious answer is that it does n’t .
Advertisements
I have had a sense all day that the Obama supporters are worried that Clinton will use her big state wins to take the nomination from Obama , but the Democratic Party knows that if they take the nomination away from Obama , then they might as well kiss their chances of winning in November good bye .
It is one thing for Obama to stumble down the stretch and create doubt in people ’s minds , but I do n’t think that will happen .
At worst , I see Obama and Clinton splitting the remaining contests .
According to email sent out by Obama campaign manager David Plouffe today , they are only 293 delegates short of the nomination .
It is likely that they will be even closer to clinching the nomination after the last seven contests .
The argument that Clinton is using is why I did n’t and could never vote for her .
Her campaign ’s reasoning makes no sense .
Now they want to count the popular vote in unrecognized primaries .
Even if her standard was accepted , delegates count not popular votes .
Obama should not be penalized for playing by the rules .
This whole thing makes no sense , and listening to the ridiculous spin coming out of her camp makes me wish that Obama would have ended this last night .

In his only public comment on the raid , Syria ’s president , Bashar al - Assad , acknowledged this month that Israeli jets dropped bombs on a building that he said was “ related to the military ” but which he insisted was “ not used . ”
A senior Israeli official , while declining to speak about the specific nature of the target , said the strike was intended to “ re-establish the credibility of our deterrent power , ” signaling that Israel meant to send a message to the Syrians that even the potential for a nuclear weapons program would not be permitted .
But several American officials said the strike may also have been intended by Israel as a signal to Iran and its nuclear aspirations .
Neither Iran nor any Arab government except for Syria has criticized the Israeli raid , suggesting that Israel is not the only country that would be disturbed by a nuclear Syria .
North Korea did issue a protest .
The target of the Israeli raid and the American debate about the Syrian project were described by government officials and nongovernment experts interviewed in recent weeks in the United States and the Middle East .
All insisted on anonymity because of rules that prohibit discussing classified information .
The officials who described the target of the attack included some on each side of the debate about whether a partly constructed Syrian nuclear reactor should be seen as an urgent concern , as well as some who described themselves as neutral on the question .
The White House press secretary , Dana Perino , said Saturday that the administration would have no comment on the intelligence issues surrounding the Israeli strike .
Israel has also refused to comment .
Nuclear reactors can be used for both peaceful and non-peaceful purposes .
A reactor ’s spent fuel can be reprocessed to extract plutonium , one of two paths to building a nuclear weapon .
The other path — enriching uranium in centrifuges — is the method that Iran is accused of pursuing with an intent to build a weapon of its own .
Syria is known to have only one nuclear reactor , a small one built for research purposes .
But in the past decade , Syria has several times sought unsuccessfully to buy one , first from Argentina , then from Russia .
On those occasions , Israel reacted strongly but did not threaten military action .
Earlier this year , Mr. Assad spoke publicly in general terms about Syria ’s desire to develop nuclear power , but his government did not announce a plan to build a new reactor .
The Gulf Cooperation Council , a group of Persian Gulf states , has also called for an expansion of nuclear power in the Middle East for energy purposes , but many experts have interpreted that statement as a response to Iran ’s nuclear program .
They have warned that the region may be poised for a wave of proliferation .
Israel is believed to be the only nuclear - armed nation in the region .
NASA has revealed " the highest resolution terrain mapping to date " of the Moon 's south pole , revealing that it's " much more rugged than previously understood " .
Scientists at the agency 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena used * the Goldstone Solar System Radar in the Mojave Desert to capture the 20 metres per pixel data - 50 times the resolution of the previous best of one kilometre per pixel returned by the Clementine spacecraft .
The result of their efforts is a series of images and animations , including this digital elevation map :
The findings are significant because the area around the pole 's " Shackleton Crater " has been mooted as a possible landing site for future manned exploration .
Doug Cooke , deputy associate administrator for the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington , said : " The south pole of the Moon certainly would be a beautiful place to explore .
We now know the south pole has peaks as high as Mt McKinley and crater floors four times deeper than the Grand Canyon .
There are challenges that come with such rugged terrain , and these data will be an invaluable tool for advance planning of lunar missions . "
Cooke denied the terrain might prompt NASA to reconsider the area as a suitable landing site , telling reporters : " I do n't think it 's less attractive . "
NASA lunar programme scientist Kelly Snook agreed , insisting : " It really calls on us to rise to the challenge of getting there , rather than having engineering constraints limit us . "
That mission planners are still prepared to consider a landing in the area around the Shackleton Crater is because it may contain critical water ice .
Cooke stressed : " Having water ice gives us a source of water and gives us a source of hydrogen and oxygen , which can be made into fuel .
One of the things we 're interested in doing as we explore the Moon and eventually Mars is to learn how to take advantage of the resources that are there to enhance the missions and reduce the amount of resupply and logistics from Earth . "
NASA 's next close - up view of the lunar surface will be provided by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , slated for a late 2008 launch and which will return images at resolutions to one metre , as well as " temperature maps , ultraviolet images , characterisation of radiation on the Moon and a high resolution 3 - D map " .
This data will give scientists " knowledge of polar illumination conditions , identify potential resources and hazards , and enable safe landing site selection " . ®
Bootnote
* NASA explains : " Three times during a six - month period in 2006 , scientists targeted the Moon 's south polar region using Goldstone 's 70 - meter radar dish .
The antenna , three - quarters the size of a football field , sent a 500 - kilowatt strong , 90 - minute long radar stream 231,800 miles to the moon .
" The radar bounced off the rough - hewn lunar terrain over an area measuring about 400 miles by 250 miles .
Signals were reflected back to two of Goldstone 's 34 - meter antennas on Earth .
The roundtrip time , from the antenna to the Moon and back , was about two - and - a - half seconds . "
Snubbed by Fox , Paul holds own N.H. forum

MANCHESTER , N.H. —
Shut out of a GOP presidential candidate forum sponsored by Fox News , Ron Paul staged his own televised town hall meeting today in which he fielded questions from undecided voters two days before the key primary election here .
The Lake Jackson Republican congressman faced a range of questions from the audience of about 100 people in the public access television station several miles from where four other presidential contenders were to later participate in the Fox debate .
Paul responded to one participant who asked why he should chose the libertarian - leaning Texan over more mainstream GOP contenders such as Mitt Romney or Mike Huckabee , saying he had been more consistent in his views than his rivals .
" They are seen as flip - floppers , " Paul said .
" People look at my record and say he 's a stick - to - his guns guy . "
One voter noted that Paul was running hard - hitting ads that pledged a crackdown on illegal immigration .
He suggested that the campaign promise would entail a beefed up federal bureaucracy and would be inconsistent with Paul 's philosophy of reduced government .
Paul said his plan would not mean more federal employees , but rather would bring home border guards now serving in Iraq .
Asked about his views on the Arab Israeli conflict , Paul suggested that he had been unfairly portrayed as anti-Semitic because he opposed U.S. aid to Israel .
The congressman said he would also block foreign aid to Arab countries , which would be to Israel 's benefit .
The one - hour forum was choreographed to portray Paul in a positive light .
He was introduced and questioned by his campaign chairman , Kent Snyder .
On the side of the studio sat his supporters , who clapped enthusiastically after each of his answers .
At times Paul took a professorial approach , lecturing the crowd on the history of monetary policy and his view that abandoning the gold standard was a critical mistake .
The decision by Fox to limit participation in the forum infuriated Paul supporters and even drew the ire of the New Hampshire Republican Party , which withdrew its sponsorship of the event .
Fox had invited Republican candidates Rudolph Giuliani , John McCain , Romney , Huckabee and Fred Thompson to the forum , but excluded Paul as well as California congressman Duncan Hunter .
Paul protested , arguing that he raised $ 20 million in the last quarter of 2007 , almost the same amount as Hillary Clinton .
Furthermore , a Research 2000 poll published in the Concord Monitor released Sunday showed Paul garnering 7 percent of the vote , besting Thompson and only 1 point behind Giuliani in the state .
Throughout the day Paul was accompanied by Barry Goldwater , Jr. , the son of the late Arizona GOP senator who unsuccessfully ran for president in 1964 .

The campaign against climate change could be set back by the global food crisis , as foreign populations turn against measures to use foodstuffs as substitutes for fossil fuels .
With prices for rice , wheat , and corn soaring , food - related unrest has broken out in places such as Haiti , Indonesia , and Afghanistan .
Several countries have blocked the export of grain .
There is even talk that governments could fall if they cannot bring food costs down .
One factor being blamed for the price hikes is the use of government subsidies to promote the use of corn for ethanol production .
An estimated 30 % of America 's corn crop now goes to fuel , not food .
" I do n't think anybody knows precisely how much ethanol contributes to the run-up in food prices , but the contribution is clearly substantial , " a professor of applied economics and law at the University of Minnesota , C. Ford Runge , said .
A study by a Washington think tank , the International Food Policy Research Institute , indicated that between a quarter and a third of the recent hike in commodities prices is attributable to biofuels .
Last year , Mr. Runge and a colleague , Benjamin Senauer , wrote an article in Foreign Affairs , " How Biofuels Could Starve the Poor . "
" We were criticized for being alarmist at the time , " Mr. Runge said .
" I think our views , looking back a year , were probably too conservative . "
Ethanol was initially promoted as a vehicle for America to cut back on foreign oil .
In recent years , biofuels have also been touted as a way to fight climate change , but the food crisis does not augur well for ethanol 's prospects .
" It takes around 400 pounds of corn to make 25 gallons of ethanol , " Mr. Senauer , also an applied economics professor at Minnesota , said .
" It 's not going to be a very good diet but that 's roughly enough to keep an adult person alive for a year . "
Mr. Senauer said climate change advocates , such as Vice President Gore , need to distance themselves from ethanol to avoid tarnishing the effort against global warming .
" Crop - based biofuels are not part of the solution .
They , in fact , add to the problem .
Whether Al Gore has caught up with that , somebody ought to ask him , " the professor said .
" There are lots of solutions , real solutions to climate change .
We need to get to those . "
Mr. Gore was not available for an interview yesterday on the food crisis , according to his spokeswoman .
A spokesman for Mr. Gore 's public campaign to address climate change , the Alliance for Climate Protection , declined to comment for this article .
However , the scientist who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mr. Gore , Rajendra Pachauri of the United Nations 's Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change , has warned that climate campaigners are unwise to promote biofuels in a way that risks food supplies .
" We should be very , very careful about coming up with biofuel solutions that have major impact on production of food grains and may have an implication for overall food security , " Mr. Pachauri told reporters last month , according to Reuters .
" Questions do arise about what is being done in North America , for instance , to convert corn into sugar then into biofuels , into ethanol . "
In an interview last year , Mr. Gore expressed his support for corn - based ethanol , but endorsed moving to what he called a " third generation " of so - called cellulosic ethanol production , which is still in laboratory research .
" It does n't compete with food crops , so it does n't put pressure on food prices , " the former vice president told Popular Mechanics magazine .
A Harvard professor of environmental studies who has advised Mr. Gore , Michael McElroy , warned in a November - December 2006 article in Harvard Magazine that " the production of ethanol from either corn or sugar cane presents a new dilemma : whether the feedstock should be devoted to food or fuel .
With increasing use of corn and sugar cane for fuel , a rise in related food prices would seem inevitable . "
The article , " The Ethanol Illusion " went so far as to praise Senator McCain for summing up the corn-ethanol energy initiative launched in the United States in 2003 as " highway robbery perpetrated on the American public by Congress . "
In Britain , some hunger - relief and environmental groups have turned sharply against biofuels .
" Setting mandatory targets for biofuels before we are aware of their full impact is madness , " Philip Bloomer of Oxfam told the BBC .
Biofuel advocates say they are being made a bogeyman for a food crisis that has much more to do with record oil prices , surging demand in the developing world , and unusual weather patterns .
" The people who seek to solely blame ethanol for the food crisis and the rising price of food that we see across the globe are taking a terribly simplistic look at this very complex issue , " Matthew Hartwig of the Renewable Fuels Association said .
Mr. Hartwig said oil companies and food manufacturers are behind the attempt to undercut ethanol .
" There is a concerted misinformation campaign being put out there by those people who are threatened by ethanol 's growing prominence in the marketplace , " he said .
The most obvious impact the food crisis has had in America , aside from higher prices , is the imposition of rationing at some warehouse stores to deal with a spike in demand for large quantities of rice , oil , and flour .
The CEO of Costco Wholesale Corp. , James Sinegal , is blaming press hype for the buying limits , which were first reported Monday in The New York Sun .
" If it had n't been picked up and become so prominent in the news , I doubt that we would have had the problems that we 're having in trying to limit it at this point , " Mr. Sinegal told Fox News Thursday .
" I mean , I can't believe the amount of attention that is being paid to this . "
The Sun 's article , which came as food riots were reported abroad , circulated quickly on the Internet , was republished in newspapers as far away as India , and prompted local and network television stories .
Speaking in Kansas City , Mo. , yesterday , the federal agriculture secretary , Edward Schafer , blamed emotion for the spurt of rice buying at warehouse stores .
" We do n't see any evidence of the lack of availability of rice .
There are no supply issues , " he told reporters , according to Reuters .
The World from Berlin ' Germany 's Neo-Nazi Party Is in Self - Destruct Mode '
With the arrest of the NPD party 's national treasurer on Thursday , things are looking increasingly grim for the far - right organization .
Cooked books , poor finances and internal corruption are all leading to self - strangulation .
Good riddance , say German newspapers .

Modern farming ' harms poor and environment '
Free trade in agricultural markets can undermine attempts to ease poverty in developing countries and harm the environment , says a UN and World Bank backed report .
" Opening national markets to international competition ... can lead to long - term negative effects on poverty alleviation , food security and the environment , " says the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development ( IAASTD ) report .
The report urges agricultural science to pay greater attention to safeguarding natural resources .
It promotes ' agro - ecological ' practices , such as the use of natural fertilisers and traditional seeds and reducing the distance between the farm and the consumer .
Professor Robert Watson , director of the report 's secretariat , says while calling for changes to agricultural practices is an " old message " , it " has not always had resonance in some parts of the world " .
" If those with power are now willing to hear it , then we may hope for more equitable policies that do take the interests of the poor into account , " he says .
Environmental impacts
The IAASTD also calls for a careful study of the environmental impacts on genetically modified crops and biofuels without taking a clear overall stance on either issue .
Some 60 governments , including Brazil , China , France and India , have approved the report .
But the US , Australia and Canada have not endorsed the entire report and the UK has not yet officially responded .
" The US objection [ to the report ] was primarily around the trade issue ... They also felt we were not as positive as they would have liked on some of the new forms of biotechnology and transgenics .
They have a less nuanced perspective than us , " Watson says .
Poverty gap
The IAASTD , whose co-sponsors also include the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization , says the benefits of increases in agricultural production are unfairly distributed with the current system often increasing the gap between rich and poor .
The report aims to set the agenda for hunger and poverty reduction in the next 50 years when demand for food is expected to rise sharply .
Food prices have already started to climb , which Watson says has been driven by increased demand , unfavourable weather , export restrictions , commodity market speculators , increased land use for biofuels , particularly in the US , and rising energy costs .
Dr John Williams , a commissioner to the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research and a member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists , says the report shows we can't just focus on agricultural research that deals with increasing production alone .
He says the report highlights the " huge problem " we have in finding ways to produce sufficient food for a rapidly growing population and halting the damage and increasing pressure on our natural resources , soils , water and biodiversity .
" We 've got to look at whole ecological , energy and water systems to appreciate the impacts or the footprint of our food on our natural resource base , " he says .
Urgency means ' technology essential '
But Dr Eric Craswell , a visiting fellow at the Fenner School of Environment and Society at the Australian National University and former senior academic advisor to the United Nations Institute for Environment and Human Security , criticises how the report handles issues like trade and biotechnology .
" With the urgency of food production problems we can't afford to be so picky about some of these issues .
Why should developing country farmers be denied the opportunities of modern science in biotechnology , fertilisers and so on ? "
While the report does not say poor countries should be denied access to such technologies , it recommends assessing their risks and benefits .
Craswell welcomes , however , how the report draws together the ideas of scientists and non-government organisations , especially in relation to the link between agriculture and the environment .
When Shivani Sud was 6 , a relative developed a brain tumor .
The cancer turned out to be benign , but the experience piqued the girl ’s interest in cancer research .
And on Tuesday night , Shivani , now 17 , a high school senior in Durham , N.C. , took home top honors and a $ 100,000 scholarship in the Intel Science Talent Search for her project on colon cancer .
“ I was wobbly , waiting for them to announce the top 10 , ” said Shivani , who attends Charles E. Jordan High School , and whose project identified patients at high risk for tumor recurrence and proposed potential drugs for treatment .
“ I was sitting on the tip of my chair . ”
Intel announced the winners of its contest , formerly known as the Westinghouse Science Talent Search , at a gala in Washington .
Katie Banks , 17 , of Brooklyn , was the only New York City student  from five finalists  to be a top winner .
She attends Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan and says she is averse to dressing up , especially for ceremonies .
She came in fourth for her project calculating the number of lattice points that can fit inside a nine - sided convex lattice polygon .
She took home a $ 25,000 scholarship .
Sony builds pizza - order function into ' Everquest II '
Peter Svensson , Associated Press
NEW YORK  Demonstrating a deep understanding of what matters to its computer - gaming audience , Sony has built the ability to order pizza into its latest online multiplayer game .
Type the command " / pizza " while playing Everquest II , a fantasy game with 330,000 active players , and get the Pizza Hut Web site , where you can place orders for delivery .
Chris Kramer , spokesman for Sony Online Entertainment , said he believes this is the first time a game accepts orders for real - world items .
Sony plans to integrate the pizza function more tightly into the game , so players can charge pizza to their monthly game subscription bill .
" The goal for the future is to eventually let people do more things like this , " Kramer said .
" They could type / harry potter and get the new Harry Potter book delivered or / star wars and get the new Star Wars DVD . "
Many games incorporate ads and product placements , but such opportunities are limited with fantasy games like Everquest .
Though the new pizza feature might satisfy appetites , caution is required as the game does n't pause while you 're ordering .
" You would n't want to order pizza in the thick of combat , but anywhere that 's safe is a good place , " said Kramer .

Cows farts causing global warming
Scottish scientists may have found a solution to slowing global warming .
Limiting cow flatulence with fumaric acid .
The average cow contributes as much to global warming as a family car that travels 12,000 miles .
Fumaric acid is a food acidulent used since 1946 because it is non -toxic .
It also has a fruit - like taste .
LONDON -- Scientists in Scotland said they 've found a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions by curbing cow and sheep flatulence .
The Rowett Research Institute in Aberdeen said 60 percent of global methane formation is due to agricultural activities , with just under half of that produced by ruminants such as cows and sheep , the Scottish government said Wednesday in a release .
Researchers said the average cow contributes as much to global warming as a family car that travels 12,000 miles , The Daily Telegraph reported .
The scientists found that adding fumaric acid to animal feed can inhibit the production of methane that occurs naturally as part of the animal 's digestive process .
Tests of the feed additive on lambs showed methane production can be cut by up to 70 percent .
The feed also resulted in lambs gaining weight faster .
Do n’t let the bedbugs swipe !
The blood - sucking insects are n’t just living with New Yorkers at home – they ’re on the subways , too , according to one of the city ’s leading bedbug authorities .
At a recent Department of Housing , Preservation and Development forum on the subject , a city bedbug educator admitted to seeing the pests on benches in subway stations – in one case , catching a ride on an unsuspecting straphanger ’s caboose at Brooklyn ’s Hoyt - Schermerhorn station , according to people at the meeting .
The official , identified as Edward Brownbear , also reported seeing the bugs on wooden benches at the Union Square and Fordham Road stations in Manhattan and The Bronx , respectively .
Sharis Lugo , 20 , of Brooklyn leaped off a bench at the Union Square station when she heard the news , saying , “ Ewww !
That ’s nasty . . .
They ’ve got to take these benches out of here ! ”
BANGKOK
Myanmar ’s military government yesterday defended its handling of the relief effort after a devastating cyclone swept across the south of the country , while foreign aid workers waited anxiously in Bangkok , Thailand , for clearance to launch a major relief effort .
In a rare press conference , information minister Brig - Gen Kyaw Hsan defended the military ’s crisis response , saying the government was “ doing its best ” to help the victims , and reiterated the desire for international assistance to cope with the crisis .
“ The task is very wide and extensive , and the government needs the cooperation of the people and well - wishers from at home and abroad , ” the minister told a news conference in the capital , Yangon , three days after tropical cyclone Nargis slammed into the country .
Shortly after his press conference , state television reported that the death toll from the disaster had soared to over 22,000 , with another 40,000 people missing .
UN humanitarian officials now estimate that one million survivors are in urgent need of relief supplies , especially in the low - lying delta of the Irrawaddy River , which was swamped by a massive storm surge , and much of which may remain submerged .
Yangon , Myanmar 's largest city , has been without power since the storm , and the authorities admit that repairing the electricity grid will be a huge , time - consuming job , while the prices of food and other essentials in the city are reported to be sky - rocketing .
The military government has received offers of a wide range of assistance , from emergency relief materials to much - needed logistical help to reach some of the remote , now isolated regions .
However , the military rulers have yet to open the country ’s doors to this assistance .

On Tuesday US President George Bush even offered to send American naval forces to help in search - and - rescue and relief operations .
US officials said the US had two naval ships conducting disaster response exercises , loaded with fresh drinking water and temporary shelters , two days ’ sailing from the disaster area .
“ We ’re prepared to help move US Navy assets to help find those who have lost their lives , to help find the missing , and to help stabilise the situation , ” Bush said .
“ Let the US come and help you help the people . ”
In Bangkok , UN officials were waiting anxiously for visas so they could begin a potentially massive relief operation .
“ The OCHA [ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ] team has assembled in Bangkok and is ready to deploy as soon as possible , ” said Richard Horsey , a spokesman for the OCHA .
“ We are waiting for the green light on visas . ”
So far , shipments of emergency relief supplies from India , Thailand and other Asian countries have been sent , and the local Red Cross has also been distributing materials they had stockpiled in the country .
Major donors have made multimillion - dollar funding pledges and some non-governmental organisations have launched appeals for cash .
Horsey said that , given the lack of transportation , aid agencies were struggling to get supplies into the remote areas where they were needed .
The military has made some helicopters and boats available to carry supplies to remote areas , but it appears that far more will be needed .
“ The major bottleneck will be the local delivery , rather than getting stuff in to the Rangoon [ former name of Yangon ] airport , ” Horsey said .
“ We need distribution channels . ”
Analysts say Myanmar ’s generals are unlikely to follow the example of Indonesia and other countries hit by the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami , which allowed US military forces and their equipment to help in the wake of the disaster .
Sean Turnell , an economics professor at Australia ’s Macquarie University , said he believed the military was still anxious about throwing open their doors to an onslaught of foreign aid workers .
“ The regime worries that events could move out of their control if they let in Western aid groups . ”

It is made of wax , is barely three inches across and comes in any colour you like , as long as it's black .
And it could save more greenhouse gas emissions than taxes on gas guzzling cars , low energy light bulbs and wind turbines on houses combined .
It is the e-cube , and it is coming soon to a fridge near you .
Invented by British engineers , the £ 25 gadget significantly reduces the amount of energy used by fridges and freezers , which are estimated to consume about a fifth of all domestic electricity in the UK .
If one was fitted to each of the 87 million refrigeration units in Britain , carbon dioxide emissions would fall by more than 2 million tonnes a year .
The patented cube mimics food and is designed to fit around a fridge 's temperature sensor , which usually measures the temperature of the circulating air .
Because air heats up much more quickly than yoghurt , milk or whatever else is stored inside , this makes the fridge work harder than necessary .
With the cube fitted , the fridge responds only to the temperature of the food , which means it clicks on and off less often as the door is open and closed .
Trials are under way with supermarkets , breweries and hotels .
One of the largest , the Riverbank Park Plaza hotel in London , fitted the device to each of the hotel 's 140 major fridges and freezers .
David Bell , chief engineer , says energy use decreased by about 30 % on average - enough to slash the hotel 's annual electricity bill by £ 17,000 .
The Park Plaza group plans to fit them throughout its UK hotels , and to recommend them overseas .
An independent report by Campden and Chorleywood Food Research Association Group said : " The devices do indeed save energy .
The slightly increased variation in temperatures in dummy loads would indicate that food safety would not be compromised . "
Spencer Freedman of Ecube Distribution said about 10,000 of the devices have now been sold , and tests are under way at the Dorchester hotel in London , as well as Asda , GreeneKing IPA , Iceland , Netto and Starbucks .
Guy Lamstaes , co-inventor of the device , said heightened concern about climate change had made companies more interested in saving energy .
" We tried to market these for years but nobody was interested . "
Mr Freedman said the devices would have the biggest impact in the large freezers and open chill cabinets used in the catering and supermarket industries .
They do reduce the energy consumption of domestic fridges , but the saving is not so great because the door is not opened very often .
The company is talking to supermarket chains about fitting them to the refrigerated lorries used to ferry chilled and frozen foods .
The company is also about to report the results of trials at a central London pub , which had them fitted to 34 fridges .
Ecube Distribution claims the results will show the brewery could save around £ 3.5 m and 17,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year if it used them nationwide .
Energy efficiency is one of the key pillars of a government pledge to save 60 % of UK carbon emissions by 2050 , which will be made legally binding by the climate change bill announced this week .

The figure of £ 25 was removed from the headline .
In addition eCube advises that £ 25 was an introductory offer at the wholesale price .

Startling official statistics show that as a new economic recession stalks the United States , a record number of Americans will shortly be depending on food stamps just to feed themselves and their families .
Dismal projections by the Congressional Budget Office in Washington suggest that in the fiscal year starting in October , 28 million people in the US will be using government food stamps to buy essential groceries , the highest level since the food assistance programme was introduced in the 1960s .
The increase – from 26.5 million in 2007 – is due partly to recent efforts to increase public awareness of the programme and also a switch from paper coupons to electronic debit cards .
But above all it is the pressures being exerted on ordinary Americans by an economy that is suddenly beset by troubles .
Housing foreclosures , accelerating jobs losses and fast - rising prices all add to the squeeze .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Emblematic of the downturn until now has been the parades of houses seized in foreclosure all across the country , and myriad families separated from their homes .
But now the crisis is starting to hit the country in its gut .
Getting food on the table is a challenge many Americans are finding harder to meet .
As a barometer of the country 's economic health , food stamp usage may not be perfect , but can certainly tell a story .
Michigan has been in its own mini-recession for years as its collapsing industrial base , particularly in the car industry , has cast more and more out of work .
Now , one in eight residents of the state is on food stamps , double the level in 2000 .
" We have seen a dramatic increase in recent years , but we have also seen it climbing more in recent months , " Maureen Sorbet , a spokeswoman for Michigan 's programme , said .
" It 's been increasing steadily .
Without the programme , some families and kids would be going without . "
But the trend is not restricted to the rust - belt regions .
Forty states are reporting increases in applications for the stamps , actually electronic cards that are filled automatically once a month by the government and are swiped by shoppers at the till , in the 12 months from December 2006 .
At least six states , including Florida , Arizona and Maryland , have had a 10 per cent increase in the past year .
In Rhode Island , the segment of the population on food stamps has risen by 18 per cent in two years .
The food programme started 40 years ago when hunger was still a daily fact of life for many Americans .
The recent switch from paper coupons to the plastic card system has helped remove some of the stigma associated with the food stamp programme .
The card can be swiped as easily as a bank debit card .
To qualify for the cards , Americans do not have to be exactly on the breadline .
The programme is available to people whose earnings are just above the official poverty line .
For Hubert Liepnieks , the card is a lifeline he could never afford to lose .
Just out of prison , he sleeps in overnight shelters in Manhattan and uses the card at a Morgan Williams supermarket on East 23rd Street .
Yesterday , he and his fiancée , Christine Schultz , who is in a wheelchair , shared one banana and a cup of coffee bought with the 82 cents left on it .
" They should be refilling it in the next three or four days , " Liepnieks says .
At times , he admits , he and friends bargain with owners of the smaller grocery shops to trade the value of their cards for cash , although it is illegal .
" It can be done .
I get $ 7 back on $ 10 . "
Richard Enright , the manager at this Morgan Williams , says the numbers of customers on food stamps has been steady but he expects that to rise soon .
" In this location , it 's still mostly old people and people who have retired from city jobs on stamps , " he says .
Food stamp money was designed to supplement what people could buy rather than covering all the costs of a family 's groceries .
But the problem now , Mr Enright says , is that soaring prices are squeezing the value of the benefits .
" Last St Patrick 's Day , we were selling Irish soda bread for $ 1.99 .
This year it was $ 2.99 .
Prices are just spiralling up , because of the cost of gas trucking the food into the city and because of commodity prices .
People complain , but I tell them it's not my fault everything is more expensive . "
The US Department of Agriculture says the cost of feeding a low - income family of four has risen 6 per cent in 12 months .
" The amount of food stamps per household has n't gone up with the food costs , " says Dayna Ballantyne , who runs a food bank in Des Moines , Iowa .
" Our clients are finding they are n't able to purchase food like they used to . "
And the next monthly job numbers , to be released this Friday , are likely to show 50,000 more jobs were lost nationwide in March , and the unemployment rate is up to perhaps 5 per cent .

The answers to these questions -- and others that we have n't thought of yet -- await us in space .
But some people believe that groups of powerful individuals already know secrets about space that the rest of us do n't .
Here we enter the realm of conspiracy theories .
These theories range from educated guesses to wild speculation .
Some also feature a cast of colorful characters , including secret governments and hyperintelligent alien species .

Let 's begin .
Officers of the Security Service , MI5 , are being accused of " outsourcing " the torture of British citizens to a notorious Pakistani intelligence agency in an attempt to obtain information about terrorist plots and to secure convictions against al - Qaida suspects .
A number of British terrorism suspects who have been arrested in Pakistan at the request of UK authorities say their interrogation by Security Service officers , shortly after brutal torture at the hands of agents of Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence agency ( ISI ) , has convinced them that MI5 colluded in the mistreatment .
Those men have given detailed accounts of their alleged ordeals at the hands of the ISI over the last four years .
Some of them appear to have been taken to the same secret interrogation centre in Rawalpindi , where they say they were repeatedly tortured before being questioned by MI5 .
Tayab Ali , a London - based lawyer for two of the men , said : " I am left with no doubt that , at the very worst , the British Security Service instigates the illegal detention and torture of British citizens , and at the very best turns a blind eye to torture . "
One man from Manchester says that in 2006 he was beaten , whipped , deprived of sleep and had three fingernails slowly extracted by ISI agents at the Rawalpindi centre before being interrogated by two MI5 officers .
A number of his alleged associates were questioned in Manchester at the same time and two were subsequently charged .
This man 's lawyers say his fingernails were missing when they were eventually allowed to see him , more than a year after he was first detained .
They say they have pathology reports that prove the nails were forcibly removed .
A second man , from Luton , Bedfordshire , alleges that two years earlier he was whipped , suspended by his wrists and beaten , and threatened with an electric drill , possibly at the same torture centre .
His interrogation was coordinated with the questioning of several associates at Paddington Green police station , west London , and the questioning of a further suspect in Canada .
MI5 does not dispute questioning him several times during his 10 months ' detention in Pakistan .
At his trial , the judge accepted he had been mistreated but said he believed the claims were exaggerated .
No attempt was made to extradite either man to be questioned by police officers in the UK , and they received no assistance from British consular officials .
They were eventually arrested on arrival in Britain after being placed aboard aircraft and flown in without extradition hearings .
The accusation that MI5 is at the very least turning a blind eye to the torture of British citizens - and may have actually colluded in their torture - is to surface in a number of forthcoming court cases , including the trial of the man who lost his fingernails , an appeal lodged by the man from Luton after he was convicted of terrorism offences , and a separate civil action being pursued on his behalf .
MI5 is thought to be considering a defence based on its officers ' insistence that they had no reason to know that the ISI might have been torturing the men - a position that Pakistani lawyers and human rights activists in Pakistan and the UK say beggars belief .
Even a high - ranking Scotland Yard counter - terrorism detective has conceded privately that there is little doubt that the Luton man was tortured .
The Guardian is aware of claims by a number of other British citizens that they were tortured after being detained as terrorism suspects in Pakistan .
The allegations being made by these men and their lawyers , which are detailed in today 's Guardian , are expected to be raised by human rights groups .
Andrew Tyrie , Conservative MP for Chichester and a campaigner against the abuse of the human rights of terrorism suspects , is considering asking a series of questions about the matter in the Commons .
Under the Criminal Justice
Act 1988 it is an offence for British officials to instigate or consent to the inflicting of " severe pain or suffering " on any person , anywhere in the world , or even to acquiesce in such treatment .
Any such offence could be punished by life imprisonment .
Last week it was disclosed that eight men freed from US custody at Guantánamo Bay had issued writs against MI5 and the Secret Intelligence Service , MI6 , alleging they were complicit in their illegal detention and subsequent abuse .
The Security Service declined to comment on the allegations , but pointed to recent reports by the all - party Intelligence and Security Committee , which said all MI5 officers receive training about possible mistreatment of detainees held by foreign intelligence agencies .
The Foreign Office said it was aware of five British citizens being detained in Pakistan over the last four years for questioning about alleged terrorism offences , but would not say how many were detained before 2004 .
It admitted it had attempted to seek consular access to only two of these people , but declined to say how many had been seen by other British officials .
The FO also declined to say how many had complained of mistreatment , saying : " We have a duty to respect the privacy of the individuals concerned . "

The US administration is pressing the 27 governments of the European Union to sign up for a range of new security measures for transatlantic travel , including allowing armed guards on all flights from Europe to America by US airlines .
The demand to put armed air marshals on to the flights is part of a travel clampdown by the Bush administration that officials in Brussels described as “ blackmail ” and “ troublesome ” , and could see west Europeans and Britons required to have US visas if their governments balk at Washington ’s requirements .
According to a US document being circulated for signature in European capitals , EU states would also need to supply personal data on all air passengers overflying but not landing in the US in order to gain or retain visa - free travel to America , senior EU officials said .
And within months the US department of homeland security is to impose a new permit system for Europeans flying to the US , compelling all travellers to apply online for permission to enter the country before booking or buying a ticket , a procedure that will take several days .
Washington is also asking European airlines to provide personal data on non-travellers – for example family members – who are allowed beyond departure barriers to help elderly , young or ill passengers to board aircraft flying to America , a demand the airlines reject as “ absurd ” .
As part of a controversial passenger data exchange programme allegedly aimed at combating terrorism , the EU has for the past few months been supplying the American authorities with 19 items of information on every traveller flying from the EU to the US .
Brussels is pressing European governments not to sign the bilateral deals with the Americans to avoid weakening the EU bargaining position .
To European ears , the US demands sound draconian .
“ This would oblige the European countries to allow US air marshals on US flights .
It ’s controversial and difficult , ” an EU official said .
At the moment the use of air marshals is discretionary for European states and airlines .
The US Transport Security Administration has also asked the European airlines to supply personal data on “ certain non-travelling members of the public requesting access to areas beyond the screening checkpoint ” .
The AEA said this was “ absurd ” because the airlines neither obtain nor can obtain such information .
The request was “ fully unjustified ” .

The Bush administration has pledged to support Saudi Arabia ’s nuclear power program , including supplying enriched uranium for nuclear reactors .
The agreement came out of President Bush ’s visit to the Saudi kingdom last week , during which Bush also pledged new US assistance in guarding Saudi oil reserves .
Let me see …
Iran has n’t attacked us , but we are threatening to bomb them because we do n’t want them to have any nuclear technology that can be used to possibly develop weapons .. , and yet we are planning on giving uranium to Saudi Arabia so they can have nuclear capabilities that will enable them to develop nuclear weapons , even though 15 of the 19 supposed hijackers of 9/11 came from Saudi Arabia – as in : they DID attack us ..
And now we are giving them uranium ..
How much sense does this make ?

One of her desires was to dispel the rumors that the famous Beatle was depressed and reclusive during the last years of his life .
She declares that nothing could have been farther from the truth and offers up her montage as proof that he was deeply engaged in living prior to his murder at age 40 in 1980 .
Make no mistake - this is not May Pang 's first entry into the writing arena .
She published a book in 1983 titled Loving John , where she poured out her heart and soul .
This new effort is an added gift to all of Lennon 's fans , young and old , who welcome another opportunity to see the talented man doing everyday things .
Check out more of the Lennon photos after the jump .

The discovery could lead to treatments for social phobia A nasal spray which increases our trust for strangers is showing promise as a treatment for social phobia , say scientists from Zurich University .
They found that people who inhaled the " love hormone " oxytocin continued to trust strangers with their money - even after they were betrayed .
Brain scans showed the hormone lowered activity in the amygdala - a region which is overactive in social phobics .
Drug trials are under way and early signs are promising say the scientists .
We hope and indeed we expect that we can improve sociability by administering oxytocin
Dr Thomas Baumgartner
Zurich University Nicknamed the " cuddle chemical " , oxytocin is a naturally produced hormone , which has been shown to play a role in social relations , maternal bonding , and also in sex .
Lead researcher Dr Thomas Baumgartner said : " We now know for the first time what exactly is going on in the brain when oxytocin increases trust .
" We found that oxytocin has a very specific effect in social situations .
It seems to diminish our fears .
" Based on our results , we can now conclude that a lack of oxytocin is at least one of the causes for the fear experienced by social phobics .
" We hope and indeed we expect that we can improve their sociability by administering oxytocin . "
Powerful effect Previous studies have shown that participants in " trust games " took greater risks with their money after inhaling the hormone via a nasal spray .
In this latest experiment , published in the journal Neuron , the researchers asked volunteer subjects to take part in a similar game .
They were each asked to contribute money to a human trustee , with the understanding that the trustee would invest the money and decide whether to return the profits , or betray the subject 's trust by keeping the profit .
The subjects also received doses of oxytocin or a placebo via a nasal spray .
After investing , the participants were given feedback on the trustees .
When their trust was abused , the placebo group became less willing to invest .
But the players who had been given oxytocin continued to trust their money with a broker .
" We can see that oxytocin has a very powerful effect , " said Dr Baumgartner .
" The subjects who received oxytocin demonstrated no change in their trust behaviour , even though they were informed that their trust was not honoured in roughly 50 % of cases . "
In a second game , where the human trustees were replaced by a computer which gave random returns , the hormone made no difference to the players ' investment behaviour .
" It appears that oxytocin affects social responses specifically related to trust , " Dr Baumgartner said .
Defence barriers
During the games , the players ' brains were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
The researchers found that oxytocin reduced activity in two regions which act as natural " defence barriers " .
They are the amygdala , which processes fear and danger , and an area of the striatum , which helps to guide future behaviour , based on reward feedback .
The amygdala has been found to be extremely active in the brains of sufferers of social phobia .
Dr Baumgartner 's colleague , Professor Markus Heinrichs , has begun a study where social phobia sufferers are given either oxytocin or a placebo , in combination with cognitive and behavioural therapy .
The trials are ongoing , but Dr Baumgartner said that early signs appear " promising " .
The hormone could also be a candidate for treating patients with autism , he says .
" Autistic people also have a fear of social situations and have problems interacting , so it is very likely that oxytocin could help , " he said .
" This hormone seems to play a very specific role in social situations so might be able to improve autism .
But so far I am not aware of any studies . "
Mauricio Delgado , a psychologist at Rutgers University , said : " This study has significant implications for understanding mental disorders where deficits in social behaviour are observed .
" While a degree of wariness may protect one from harm , being able to '' forgive and forget ' ' is an imperative step in maintaining long - term relationships .
" The reported oxytocin finding could provide a bridge for potential clinical applications . "

Photo of Clipper ’s 2.5 Megawatt turbine — the 7.5 megawatt turbine will be much larger .
The Queen is investing in the world ’s largest wind turbine .
It ’s a prototype of a new line of wind turbines called “ The Britannia ” which will be produced by Clipper Windpower , based in California .
The turbine tower stands about 328 feet , has a diameter of 492 feet , and can generate 7.5 megawatts .
Currently , the largest installed wind turbine is the massive Enercon E - 126 , which is rated at 7 megawatts ( see of our previous post here ) .
The sale was made to the British Crown Estate , which owns most of the seabed off Britain ’s shores , regularly leases out its land to wind farm projects but has never invested in the turbines .
The prototype turbine is part of Britain ’s ambitious goal of generating 33 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2020 .
The Crown Estate press release says :
This investment will allow The Crown Estate to gain firsthand knowledge of the challenges facing the development of wind turbines specialised for deep water marine deployment as the process of engaging industry to develop the next phase of offshore windfarms begins .
If the industry is to reach the current delivery target of a total capacity of up to 33 GW by 2020 , this kind of support and research will be invaluable .
In addition to a unique and diverse property portfolio , encompassing urban and rural estates , the marine interests of The Crown Estate include almost the entire UK territorial seabed out to 12 nautical miles and around 55 per cent of the UK ’s coastal foreshore .
In addition , The Crown Estate has the rights to lease seabed for the generation of renewable energy on the continental shelf within the Renewable Energy Zone which extends out to approximately 200 nautical miles .

The co-owner and executive editor of alternative newspaper chain Village Voice Media , which publishes the Phoenix New Times , has apologized for using a racial slur at a journalism gathering .
Michael Lacey was accepting an award from the local chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists on Friday when he used the N - word to refer to his late friend , Pulitzer Prize winning reporter Tom Fitzpatrick .
His short speech also included vulgar phrases .
The group also presented a special recognition award to the mother of late East Valley Tribune sportswriter Bob Moran , a Black journalist .
Moran died last month , and his mother was accompanied by fellow Tribune journalist Billye Paulson , who also is Black .
Paulson called the speech " offensive " and sent an angry e-mail to Lacey demanding an apology .
" I found your acceptance speech at the April 4 SPJ awards banquet disgusting , inappropriate and vulgar .
And I DID take offense .
But the obscenities take a back seat to the use of the n-word , which was not necessary and very insulting , " she wrote in the e-mail .
On Monday evening , Lacey said he was sorry that " comments about a dead colleague rankled listeners . "
" My words , meant to honor a friend , were inappropriate , " Lacey said .
" All present have my sincere apology .
It is regrettable that any phrase of mine offended those attending a First Amendment awards banquet . "
Lacey was accepting the SPJ's President 's Award , which recognizes outstanding contributions in the field of journalism .
Lacey and business partner Jim Larkin were honored for stories they wrote and published that exposed the Maricopa County attorney 's attempts to obtain Internet records of anyone who had ever visited the Phoenix New Times Web site through a grand jury subpoena .
The story led to their late - night arrest on suspicion of violating grand jury secrecy , although charges were soon dropped .
I have n’t yet received a PageRank from Google , I am in a highly saturated niche , and this site is only coming up on its fourth month of being active , yet despite having so many things going against it , the growth of this site has outpaced over twenty of its competitors .
Where am I getting this comparison ?
Well , earlier this month , I was at the 121st position on the 45n5.com Top 100 Make Money Online Blogs list , and I made it my goal to get into the Top 100 .
A goal that some friends of mine said was pretty much impossible .
Heck , some were surprised that once the list was expanded to over two hundred , that I was still sitting so high , but I was already working hard to build this site , and make it the best it could be .
As of today , I am sitting at a ranking of 101 , and while that is still one spot away from my goal , it is still a jump of twenty positions over other blogs working hard to improve their ranks in the same niche .
Competition Does n’t Matter
One of the biggest complains I hear from bloggers is that the niche they selected is too crowded , or that it has all been done before , and if you are going to go around believing that , then you are setting yourself up for failure .
You ca n’t concern yourself with your competition .
They are great to help you set goals , and think up content ideas , but otherwise , you ca n’t let them make you feel inferior .
If you have something to say , even if it has been said before , it is still worth getting your opinion out there .
Do Something New
With this blog , I added a weekly podcast , showcasing other people ’s content and ideas , as well as adding my own thoughts and opinions to the subjects at hand .
This lead me to stand out in this niche , and it is not like podcasting is a new idea .
Mark at 45n5.com came out with a Top 100 list , another idea that has been around for ages , but he made it his own by focusing it on a single niche , and promoting it well .
If you are going to really stand out from the crowd , you need to do something different .
It does n’t have to be innovative or new , but it has to set you apart from others in your niche , and help spread your message , and build your popularity .
Promote Your Content
If no one knows about your blog , then no one will read it .
Seems to be a simple path of logic for me , but so many people do n’t promote their content , and those that do , do n’t always give it enough time or effort .
On some of my best articles , I will spend upwards of an hour promoting it .
I contact my friends via e-mail that are willing to help me out from time to time .
I have found e-mail newsgroups that help each other out with a link or an approving thumbs up if they like the article .
I ask friends to submit the link to social bookmarking sites .
I come up with custom , personalized e-mails for a variety of site owners that are in the same niche as me , and ask them to look over the article and send me any for of feedback they have time for .
Sure this might seem laborious and tedious , but done well on your best posts , you can gain a huge influx of links , traffic , and new ideas .
A few links , placed on really popular sites , can double all the stats on a new site , over night .
Make Friends
One of the biggest avenues for promotion , and one of the best tips I can give you is to make friends .
Network with people both inside and outside your niche .
Surrounding yourself with people that understand you can lead to great feedback , the occasional link , and help with every bit of your site , from the design , to the content .
Also , as a side note , friends can open avenues of promotion through their blogs , but allowing you to guest post , and I have said how amazing guest posts can be for your blogs , numerous times .
It has been one of my largest sources of traffic this month .
Conclusion
So there you have it , with a little hard work , a positive attitude , and a lot of promotion , you can push your site up the rankings as well .
Do n’t let a little hard work scare you away .
Pick a niche you are passionate about and enjoy your blogging time .
The US Federal Reserve scrambled to shore up nerves on Wall Street in the wake of Bear Stearns ' financial crisis last night by announcing a series of emergency measures to make it easier for banks to access funds .
In a rare intervention on a Sunday evening , the Fed said it was cutting the discount rate on its loans to banks by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.25 % .
Furthermore , the central bank said it was setting up a new lending facility for primary dealers on the financial markets .
" Liquid , well - functioning financial markets are essential for the promotion of economic growth , " the Fed said .
The US authorities are alarmed at the prospect of Bear Stearns ' difficulties sapping already shaky confidence among market participants .
There was a sense of shock at the speed with which one of Wall Street 's biggest brokerages lurched to the brink of collapse .
Such is the level of official concern that the Fed agreed to stand behind $ 30 bn ( £ 14.8 bn ) of Bear Stearns ' liabilities in order to persuade JP Morgan Chase to rescue the 85 - year - old firm .
Described as " less liquid assets " , these liabilities amount to most of Bear 's $ 33bn in exposure to mortgage - backed securities - including $ 2bn of positions in sub - prime home loans .
On a conference call , JP Morgan 's chief financial officer , Mike Cavanagh , said his firm had needed this reassurance before bailing out Bear Stearns .
" In doing our due diligence , one of the areas we needed comfort on was some of these illiquid assets on their balance sheet , " said Cavanagh .
The deal , which will take 90 days to complete , is contingent on approval from shareholders in both firms .
But JP Morgan 's head of investment banking , Bill Winters , said that in the meantime Bear Stearns would be operating as usual .
" Bear Stearns is open for business today with all the credit backing we can provide and obviously intends to remain fully active in the market up to and through the date of closure of the transaction . "
JP Morgan will hold talks with credit rating agencies in the hope of securing an investment - grade rating for Bear Stearns ' debt .
JP Morgan has told its own investors that the buyout will ultimately add $ 1bn of earnings annually .
Many of Bear Stearns ' 14,000 staff will be out of pocket over the deal .
The firm 's management has encouraged an unusually high level of staff share ownership .
The rock - bottom price amounts to a huge financial debacle for the British - born billionaire Joe Lewis , who paid some $ 960 m for an 8 % stake in Bear Stearns at the end of last year .
His shares will be worth barely $ 18 m under the takeover .
Executives worked around the clock to find a way to escape bankruptcy and staff worked work through the weekend compiling lists of clients , liabilities and pending transactions for potential bidders .
As well as JP Morgan , the private equity firms JC Flowers and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts held talks about a joint offer .
Bear Stearns ' difficulties began a week ago , when rumours began to circulate that it was short of liquidity .
By Thursday , trading partners began to refuse to do business and customers were withdrawing money , prompting Bear Stearns to plead for a temporary cash lifeline backed by the Fed .
Bear Stearns ' chief executive , Alan Schwartz , handled the bank run without the firm 's veteran chairman , Jimmy Cayne , by his side .
Cayne , 74 , was in Detroit competing at the North American Bridge Championships when customers began removing funds on Thursday .
He finished fourth in a field of 130 , but his ranking dived to 26th on Friday , according to the championship 's website - possibly because he was distracted .
As the market absorbs the news of Bear Stearns ' rescue , eyes will turn to the Fed 's rate - setting meeting tomorrow .
Analysts at Citigroup have suggested the central bank may drop rates by a full percentage point .
As Wall Street 's problems seep into the consciousness of the broader public , Democrats are seeking to pin the blame on the White House .
" This has become the Bush recession , " said Charles Schumer , a Democratic senator from New York who compared the present administration to the regime during the Great Depression .
" The president 's hands - off attitude is reminiscent of Herbert Hoover . "
Scientists usually study natural selection at a single level , such as genes or individuals or even a population , says biophysical complexity researcher Maya Paczuski – but it takes place at all these levels simultaneously , and what happens at each scale resonates through the web of life in ways we 're just beginning to comprehend .
I talked to Paczuski , founder of the University of Calgary 's Complexity
Science Group , for a recent Wired.com story on the expansion of evolutionary theory to include complexity and emergence .
These phenomena do n't replace the classic mechanisms of genetic mutation and natural selection , but work with them ; and accompanying this expanded conception of evolution is the multi-scale perspective espoused by
Paczuski .
Here 's what she told me :
You always get into trouble if you say these things out loud with creationists around .
It 's not that the whole theory of evolution is going to come tumbling down – there 's no doubt that evolution has taken place on the earth , and that we definitely understand certain parts of it and that they fit together .
But there really are fundamental conceptual problems with the whole notion of fitness and therefore the whole notion of selection , and therefore in how evolution actually takes place in evolutionary systems of which biology is one example , but there are others – the meme , the evolution of societies or of technology , or in principle any kind of system where new things are created that did n't exist before .
Most people understand the notion of selection at the level of the individual .
If you do n't reproduce , then you are not fit , and you do n't leave your genes behind .
On the other hand , Richard Dawkins has made to some extent valid arguments that selection does n't happen at the level of the individual , but rather the gene .
But you can also make arguments that selection happens at the level of groups of individuals : if you have n't enough genetic diversity , you have a whole population wiped out by an epidemic , by some bacteria or virus that comes through .
That 's why we have all these genetic variants that are n't necessarily increasing the fitness of any individual , but have at the same time presumably increased the fitness of the population .
You have selection at the level of the individual , the level of the gene , and at the level of populations of individuals , and can even make good arguments that selection happens at the level of ecosystems .
The whole ecosystem has got to be functional to keep going .
And these organisms evolve in relation to all the other organisms that they exist with , because their environment is made up of all the other species and individuals that they encounter .
So when you talk about selection , selection probably happens at all scales , from gene to individual to species to collection of species to ecosystem to we do n't even know what .
That 's my personal point of view .
And when you get into the lab and you try to measure fitness , you 're only going to measure it at some particular level , such as which bacteria outcompetes another on a food source .
That gives you a quantititve measure of that system , but it 's not clear how that explains the complex evolution of the biosphere .
One of the things that complexity theory teaches us is that you have emergent properties – like ecosystems – so you have to think of selection happening at many different scales .
That problem has n't been addressed in any coherent way in scientific literature .
It 's one of the great complex problems of the future .
Neo -Darwinian evolution is n't fixated at one level .
It 's being applied at different levels – but in a given study , only at one level .
There 's been arguments :
Dawkins argues that it happens at the gene , others at the level of individuals , and others at the level of species – but there 's now more of a growing consensus that it happens at all these different levels , and we do n't understand how that comes about .
When you get into the notion of different levels , you deal with problem of selection at different time scales – for instance , when you talk about a particular individual , it 's about what happens during their lifetime .
They either make or do n't make children .
When you talk about human populations and human dynamics ... what 's the time scale over which selection is happening there ?
It 's not individual anymore .
It 's a longer scale altogether ....
What time scales are relevant ?
It seems you end up with lots of different possible time scales .
How do you unify all these different mechanisms taking place ?
And why are there all these different levels ?
That 's the fundamental thing that makes life complex .
And those points are n't accounted for by Darwinian evolution .
In any complex system , what happens at the larger scale can affect what happens at the smaller scale .
It 's not just that everything goes up from genes to individuals to groups of individuals to ecosystems and species .
You also have feedback going back the other way , all the way down .
That 's part of the whole selection mechanism , and we do n't really understand that .
These kind of questions are absolutely the most fantastic questions you can ask nowadays .
I then asked Paczuski about non-linearity and emergence – the dynamics underlying the sort of sudden , radical jumps of complexity seen in ( to pick a particularly vivid example ) honeybee colonies .
You can't get anything new from linear systems .
Linear systems do n't have property of emergence .
What are the rules for the jumps of complexity ?
The best answer is that these are just things that just appear from the dynamics of the system itself .
It 's not predictable what they 're going to be .
You can't describe life by describing where the atoms are of everything on earth .
It would n't give you the relevant information you 're interested in .
What are the right levels to study the jumps ?
The levels where you can make the most compact description of things that you 're interested in .
It 's a subjective thing .
You look at the system , see things going on , and figure out what 's interesting to you , and those are the levels .
You do have cells , which have boundaries , eukaryotes and so on – they really are distinct structures .
When you talk about individuals , it 's pretty obvious that these cells get together and move around and reproduce together .
You can still make good decisions about what a species is .
Then it gets a little more complicated , because then you have to talk about , what 's a community ?
What 's a society ?
Definitions rely on information at the lowest level .
On boundaries – the notion of a self - replicating unit .
But at the higher level , it 's not really so clear anymore really what they are relying on .
At least it is n't to me .
I suppose if you talked to some other people , they 'll come up with some highfaluting theory , some absolute definition for the relevant emergent structures , but we really do n't know all that well .
If you have a complex system , you should expect that there 's going to be many different levels at which selection acts .
The whole landscape of selection is getting more integrated , more complicated , and that 's why you can't say that selection acts on one particular level .
And once you admit that , there 's no end to the emergent forms , the ones where we have n't yet realized that selection is acting .
Biologists have success showing selection in defined domains – but none of those domains give a well - defined picture of how you can get all this complexity ....
What are the real mechanisms over which selection acts at the level of species ?
At the level of families ?
At the levels in the tree of life ?
You 've had episodes in geological time where whole phyla went extinct – those were much higher levels .
It 's not just random how extinction events happen .
They happen in bursts .
That suggests many different levels of selection .
I have to say that I really do n't know what drives the jumps in complexity .
Now we 're talking about a fundamental problem in physics :
we cannot , as physicists , explain how something new happens .
Something that did n't exist before .
We know that in evolution , this is a very structured process .
This problem of emergence is very much related to the problem of selection , the levels at which selection happens , and how that creates space or niches for new species to emerge in the biosphere .
Those two things are very much related to each other .
Its ' a fascinating problem , but a frustrating one .
I have n't seen a promising way forward at the moment .
But the most important thing as a scientist is to know the difference between something you do n't understand and something you do .
The first step is that we do n't have a conceptual understanding of many - level selection .
This whole notion of emergence , of many levels – that you cannot describe life at any given level at all in particular , which is the notion that came out of complexity theory – it's a pretty new field .
There was very little work in complexity until the advent of the personal computer , where you could actually do the simulations .
Now you have people out there , students and people who work with research institutes , and people trying things on there own who can make their own little world with rules and see what happens .
We still do n't have a very good grasp of it , but it 's a necessary field to develop as part of understanding biology , life , and the organization of human societies and how signaling communication networks evolve .
Phew !
There 's a lot going on there .
But if it caught your interest , be sure to check out the story .

The misery index was initiated by economist Arthur Okun , an adviser to President Lyndon Johnson in the 1960's .
It is simply the unemployment rate added to the inflation rate .
It is assumed that both a higher rate of unemployment and a worsening of inflation both create economic and social costs for a country .
A combination of rising inflation and more people out of work implies a deterioration in economic performance and a rise in the misery index .

4 Factors Slowing Solar Energy Growth in US
April 4th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
Despite all the talk about solar energy , it only generates a measly .1 % of electricity in the US .
Meanwhile , national demand for electricity is growing by 2 % annually .
Considering that solar technology has been in use for decades , why is it not more widespread ?
Cheap Fossil Fuels
Even though sunlight is free , fossil fuels in the US have been widely available at a very low cost .
There are extensive coal fields all across the country .
Nationally , coal produces about 50 % of our electricity , with a majority of it being used for base load .
That means that coal plants produce a steady stream of electricity a majority of the time .
Natural gas however has skyrocketed in price over the last 6 years .
It is widely used to generate electricity during peak times , typically on warmer days when we are cranking up the air conditioning .
Natural gas plants can start up quickly and come to the rescue when needed , but the cost of fuel has gotten quite high recently .
Solar energy is very capable of producing peak electricity and is ideally suited for for it .
Solar radiation is what causes us to need air conditioning in the first place .
The utility companies have started taking notice of solar energy ’s potential to generate electricity during peak demand .
Real Cost Pricing
When we turn on a light , we do n’t pay the real cost of generating that electricity .
The federal government absorbs some of that cost through subsidies and the environmental cost is rarely taken into account .
For example , asthma is linked to the burning of coal , but I do n’t pay for asthma attacks when I pay my electric bill .
A carbon tax is one method for accounting for some of these hidden costs .
Scale and Price of Solar
Remember how much cell phones cost when they first hit the market ?
When larger manufacturing plants are constructed , the cost per unit typically decreases compared to smaller plants .
Germany , Japan , and California have all stimulated the solar market .
Photovoltaic solar panels have already come down in price by 90 % over the last 20 years .
Stable Solar Energy Policy
The US had impressive solar energy incentives under the Carter administration , which quickly vanished when Reagan took office .
There is currently a 30 % commercial tax credit for solar energy , but it is set to expire at the end of the year .
There are purchase agreements for 3.2 gigawatts of concentrated solar power during 2007 , but solar power plants cannot be constructed before the tax credit expires .
The coal , nuclear , and oil industries have stable energy policies and the same is needed for solar energy to thrive .

Lakes can form on ice sheets as melt water pools during warm summer days .
These lakes decrease the albedo of the surface , leading to more melting .
Once enough water collects , the pressure it creates can cause a fracture in the underlying ( less dense ) ice , allowing the lake to drain catastrophically .
These events take on added significance due to what happens to that water .
If the lake drains to the bottom of the ice sheet , it can lubricate the bed of the ice sheet , and thus increase rates of movement .
That movement can lead to an increased flux of water into the ocean , thus raising sea levels .
A report in today 's Science describes how researchers recorded the drainage of one such lake in Greenland .
The lake was roughly 5.6 km2 , but drained completely in less than an hour and a half .
The lake 's contents rapidly made their way down to the bottom of the ice sheet , 980 m below the surface .
During this period , the average drainage rate was 8700 m3/s .
For reference , the average flow rate for Niagara Falls is only 5700 m3/s .
In the 16 hours prior to the catastrophic drainage , they noted a slow decrease in water level .
They suggest that this corresponds to the slow initial fracturing of the ice .
During this period , the lake was only filling the fracture it was creating .
Once this fracture reached the base , the researchers believe that the water spread out in an existing subglacial network , which facilitated the rapid lake drainage .
Along with this drainage , the team recorded movement of the ice sheet ( both vertically and horizontally ) , along with a corresponding increase in glacial seismic activity .
As the lake drained , the ice sheet was temporarily lifted by a meter .
As the water spread out at the base of the ice sheet , the surface elevation slowly decreased back to its initial level over the course of 24 hours .
Along with this lifting came a very rapid shift north of almost one meter , followed by a slow drift back south and movement west of less than one meter .
The fracture created by this lake remained on the surface as a conduit for future melt water .
The team also noted that other post - drainage lake beds they came across exhibited the same type of fractures , suggesting that the process they recorded is quite common .
Indeed , thousands of lakes are formed each summer season , and they must go somewhere .
A related study also published in Science today looked at the change in ice movement related to basal lubrication .
The study found that , while the water lubricating the base of the ice sheet caused seasonal speedups of its motion on the order of 50 to 100 percent , the speedup of outlet glaciers , where the ice sheet drains into the ocean , was only about 15 percent .
While other factors are causing outlet glaciers to speed up , lubrication of the base does n't seem to be the main cause .

A girl of three seriously injured after falling 100ft from an escalator was " improving " in hospital .
The toddler is thought to have fallen over the side as it travelled up to the third floor of a Primark store in Liverpool city centre .
The youngster was described as " stable but poorly " after previously being " critical " following the fall at Primark in Liverpool .

The toddler was taken to Royal Liverpool Hospital after falling 100ft from an escalator
She was initially treated at the Royal Liverpool Hospital before she was transferred to intensive care at Alder Hey Children 's Hospital .
A Merseyside Police spokeswoman said : " The girl 's condition has now been downgraded from critical to stable but poorly .
" She suffered a broken left leg and left arm which have both been recast and she also received internal injuries . "
The girl toppled backwards through the gap between the upward and downward escalators , on to the lower ground floor , at lunch time yesterday .
Police and paramedics were on the scene within minutes .
But the girl 's mother was inconsolable , shoppers said .
Her daughter , who is believed to have several broken bones and some internal injuries , was taken unconscious to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital .
There , doctors were put on alert to receive the girl , who remained in a critical condition last night .
Paul Donnelly , 15 , who saw the accident , said : " At first I thought it was just a bag that had been dropped but then I realised it was a child .
I saw her hit the floor .
" People were rushing over and the security guards came and pushed people back .
There was a lot of panic and raised voices .
Everyone was asking if she was okay .
" I had to leave the store because I felt that I was going to faint .
" It looked like a very bad accident .
We were just hoping and praying that somehow she would be okay . "

James Lashbrook , 14 , and Paul Donnelly , 15 , witnessed the accident
Lyndsey Wilcox , a 30 - year - old student , said : " I heard an almighty scream and as I looked over I saw the body of a young girl lying on the basement floor .
She was not moving .
" People came rushing and started clambering over one another to see what had happened .
I felt physically sick .
" Others were oblivious to what was happening and carried on shopping .
Then the mother arrived .
She was screaming and shouting in her grief .
" She was uncontrollable , screaming and wailing , and people were trying to console her .
I can't understand how the girl could have fallen . "

The Primark store is one of the biggest in the UK
The Primark store in Liverpool - at 84,000 sq ft , one of the biggest in the UK - opened in September .
A spokesman for the chain , which is renowned for its budget fashion clothing , said : " We are obviously profoundly shocked and saddened to learn of the accident in our Liverpool store this afternoon .
" We are doing all we can to assist the authorities in their investigation .
All our thoughts are with the little girl and her family . "
The store was evacuated and closed for police and health and safety examinations .
The “ continuing tsunami ” affecting Pakistan is heart wrenching but after 2 weeks , it does not warrant the headlines but it is tucked away and given passing mention by the worlds media as an afterthought .
The calls for aid went unheard and the later tepid response surprised the Pakistani government to its core .
But then again what was there to be surprised about ?
It is estimated that 90 % of the national budget goes either to the military or is dissipated and the countries leadership , through the years was more interested in in their own political survival rather than the survival of the nation or its development .
Ordinary Pakistanis themselves shocked the government by refusing to donate in the government fund drive as they did generously in the previous earth quake but preferred direct private action .
The consensus was that the money would never reach the victims .
To add to their embarrassment two media personalities who launched their own fund , raised more money in 2 days that did the government in ten days .
Their conclusions , as is the national consensus , is that the government is suffering from a massive credibility deficit .
The victims complain that no civil servants have even visited them and this complete absence has led the people wholly reliant on the military , whenever and wherever they appear … if they do at all .
This is dangerous because generally a nations military is always regarded as an extension of a government but in Pakistan ’s history the military has ruled the country longer than any civilian government ……. the time seems ripe … … and with popular support … . who knows … .
And will all the international aid received be used for its intended aims and purposes ?
The Officious Bystanders response would be “ Of course its possible , but not probable “ .
Boys and girls may learn differently , but American parents should think twice before moving their children to sex - segregated schools .
A new Tel Aviv University study has found that girls improve boys ' grades markedly at school .
" Being with more girls is good for everybody , " says Prof.
Analia Schlosser , an economist from the Eitan Berglas School of Economics at Tel Aviv University .
" We find that both boys and girls do better when there are more girls in the class . "
She investigated girls and boys in mixed classrooms in the elementary , middle , and high - school grades of the Israeli school system .
In an unpublished paper , Prof .
Schlosser concluded that classes with more than 55 percent of girls resulted in better exam results and less violent outbursts overall .
" It appears that this effect is due to the positive influence the girls are adding to the classroom environment , " says Prof. Schlosser .
She carried out the study while on a post - doctoral fellowship at Princeton University , and will study the effects of gender in higher education lecture halls next .
This is one of few studies of its kind to use scientific data to address the question of gender effects in school .
The Report Card
Boys with more female peers in their classes show higher enrollment rates in both advanced math and science classes , but overall benefits were found in all grades for both sexes .
Prof .
Schlosser found that primary - school classrooms with a female majority showed increased academic success for both boys and girls , along with a notable improvement in subjects like science and math .
In the middle schools , girls were found to have better academic achievement in English , languages and math .
And in high school , the classrooms which had the best academic achievements overall were consistently those that had a higher proportion of girls enrolled .
An Educated Guess
A higher percentage of girls lowers the amount of classroom disruption and fosters a better relationship between pupils and their teacher , a study of the data suggests .
Teachers are less tired in classrooms with more girls , and pupils overall seem to be more satisfied when a high female - to - male ratio persists .
Prof .
Schlosser was inspired to the study by a " renewed interest on the effects of classroom gender composition on students ' learning , since a new amendment to America 's Title IX regulations gives communities more flexibility in providing single - sex classes and schools . "
Prof .
Schlosser concludes that American educators should reconsider the effects of the new trend of same - sex segregation on different sectors of society .
Gains for girls from classroom gender segregation could be offset by the loss of boys .

After weeks of intense pressure , and more than a year after announcing her presidential candidacy , Sen .
Hillary Clinton has offered little explanation for why she has delayed releasing the tax returns made public by most other Democratic presidential candidates in recent years .
" What is the holdup ? " said Sheila Krumholz of the Center for Responsive Politics , a nonprofit group that tracks the role of money in politics .
" She has n't exactly made it clear as to what process is making it so cumbersome to just release them . "
Past Democratic presidential candidates have set a precedent for releasing their tax returns before or during the primary season .
Sen .
John Kerry released his in December of 2003 , and former Vice President Al Gore 's were in the public domain while he was in office .
Clinton 's opponent , Sen. Barack Obama , released his 2006 return last April .
" This is a level of disclosure the American people have come to expect and deserve from those in the White House , or those who aspire to the White House , " said Mary Boyle of Common Cause , a government reform advocacy group .
The pressure on Clinton to release her tax returns has been intensifying since it was revealed that she loaned her campaign $ 5 million in January .
Clinton had repeatedly stated that she would release her tax returns upon becoming the Democratic nominee , but her spokesman Howard Wolfson said last week that the campaign now planned to release the returns " in or around April 15 . "
Wolfson did not respond to requests for comment for this story .
The lack of disclosure leaves the public with an obscure picture of how the Clintons have managed the multi-million - dollar fortune they have amassed since leaving the White House , say government watchdog groups .
Personal financial disclosure filings , required by government ethics rules , only offer a broad glimpse of the Clintons ' finances .
Since 1999 , the couple 's net worth has increased from somewhere between $ 1.25 million and $ 5.7 million to between $ 10 million and $ 50 million , according to filings .
In 2006 , the Clintons earned hundreds of thousands of dollars from book royalties , and former President Bill Clinton made $ 10 million in dozens of paid speeches .
The disclosures shed some light on President Clinton 's role in two companies run by longtime friends and fundraisers .
Clinton earned an unspecified amount as a consultant for InfoUsa , a data company run by longtime friend and fundraiser Vin Gupta , according to the filings .
The forms also showed ten of thousands of dollars invested in funds with the Yucaipa Companies , a private equity firm run by another close friend , Ron Burkle .
Many of the specific details surrounding the Clintons ' income and assets remain unknown .
" The disclosure forms are so limited in what they require , " says Krumholz .
" For example , there 's nothing about your primary house or other houses you live in or use . "
Tax forms would help fill in the blanks where the disclosure forms leave off , says Boyle , including exact amounts for income and stock gains and losses as well as details like how much was paid in mortgage interest , charitable deductions and personal exemptions taken .
" In this very extended primary season and competitive environment where people are really struggling to weigh these two candidates , this would be helpful for people to know , " said Boyle .

Fears about the rapid spread of an intestinal virus that has killed 26 young children reached the Chinese capital today , as it emerged that doctors have recorded almost 1,500 cases of hand , foot and mouth disease in Beijing .
The nationwide tally leapt to 11,905 today after the government ordered all local health officials to notify it of cases .
More than half are in Fuyang City , in eastern Anhui province , where 22 of the victims died after becoming infected with Enterovirus 71 .
The virus has caused sporadic outbreaks of the disease in the Asia - Pacific region since 1997 .
Hand , foot and mouth does not normally kill children , but in its severest forms can lead to complications including heart and respiratory problems and meningitis .
It is most easily spread through contact with infected blisters or faeces .
The Beijing News reported today that the city has had 1,482 cases of hand , foot and mouth .
It is not yet clear if they involved the EV71 strain or another virus .
Staff at a children 's hospital told the Guardian they were treating " many " cases of the disease , but declined to give further details .
One mother said she would avoid taking her child to crowded places such as
markets and parks and would disinfect his bottles daily .
But Belle Zhao , whose son is eight months old , added : " They think it 's not as frightening as Sars [ the disease which killed almost 350 people in China
in 2002 - 3 ] . "
The city 's Centre for Disease Control has advised that infected children should be isolated at home , and that any class with more than three infected children should be suspended .
Today the state news agency Xinhua reported that authorities in Anhui had punished 10 doctors and officials for mishandling the outbreak .
Two doctors were criticised for delaying moving a patient to a larger hospital , while others were fined for illegally injecting immune globulin into children , claiming it could prevent EV71 - for which there is no vaccine .
Five county - level officials were reprimanded for failing to inform the public of the problem .
The official media has attacked the authorities in Anhui for not announcing the outbreak until weeks after it began .
This week the World Health Organisation said the delay was caused by the difficulty of diagnosing the disease , as many victims did not have the usual symptoms .
The fatality rate has dropped dramatically , but the rapid spread of the illness is still causing concern and experts believe numbers will not peak until later this month or even next , when the disease is normally at its height .
" The fact that the current outbreak in China continues , with so many cases and deaths , is worrying , " said Professor Tom Solomon of Liverpool University , who is researching EV71 outbreaks in Asia .
He said it was unclear why some patients died , but that it probably related to the severity of the virus as well as their immune response and how late they arrived at hospital .
Solomon said the virus was not a major problem when it was first recognized
in California in the 1960s .
He added : " In 1997 the virus caused a large unexpected outbreak of hand ,
foot and mouth disease in Sarawak , with many fatalities .
Since then the
virus has plagued the Asia - Pacific region with outbreaks most years .
An
outbreak in Taiwan in 1998 was estimated to affect 1.5 million people .
" We do n't know why the virus has suddenly started causing these outbreaks ,
or whether they will spread beyond Asia .
It probably relates to the virus's
fast rate of evolution , and the emergence of new genetic subtypes . "

In Baghdad , power supply may get worse
Output from hydroelectric plants has been cut in half by drought
BAGHDAD — Mohammed Abbas stares into a cooler case in his small grocery store and says the electricity to run it eats up half his profits .
He expects to pay $ 150 a month this summer to keep the meat and cheese from spoiling .
That means his wife and four children must sweat out another summer with a ceiling fan .
There is n't enough power or money to run an air conditioner .
They suffer heat rashes , headaches and , because windows are left open to catch the breeze , mosquito bites .
Getting electricity — especially when summer temperatures soar into triple digits — may be the most important issue for Iraqis after security .
Last year 's increase in U.S. troops , or " surge , " helped reduce violence , allowing many shops in the capital to reopen .
So electricity demand , which has been growing 7 % to 9 % each year , " could be greater " this year because of the rise in economic activity , says Charles Ries , the State Department 's coordinator for economic transition in Iraq .
In the summer , demand can spike about 20 % as Iraqis power up their air conditioners , he says .
" There is no chance we will be able to meet demand in the summer , " Ries says , even though new power plants are coming on line .
Last July and August , massive blackouts stretched across parts of Baghdad .
This summer could be worse because drought has cut in half power generated by hydroelectric plants .
Add war , attacks on transmission lines , antiquated equipment , overdue maintenance and local corruption or bureaucracy and reliable electricity remains out of reach for most Iraqis .
" With demand significantly outpacing available generation capability , rolling blackouts are the norm across most of the country , " says Navy Capt .
Joe Konicki , who works with the Army Corps of Engineers .
The U.S. government has spent about $ 4.3 billion since 2003 to rebuild and expand Iraq 's electrical sector and has told Iraq not to expect much more .
Iraq 's Ministry of Electricity last estimated two years ago that $ 27 billion is needed to reconstruct the nation 's power grid .
About $ 6 billion has been spent so far .
The State Department says Iraq needs to generate up to 9,000 megawatts of electricity to meet demand but estimates that less than 4,200 megawatts are currently being produced .
The Ministry of Electricity , however , says it is generating 5,500 megawatts .
As much as 11,000 megawatts could be needed at peak summer hours , according to the State Department .
The Army Corps says Iraq averages 15 hours a day of electricity , while Baghdad gets 12 hours .
" You talk to any Iraqi , they say they only get an hour of power every day .
But we have the numbers , we know what 's being produced , " says Albert Herman , with the U.S. Iraq Transition Assistance Office .
Aziz Sultan , spokesman for the Ministry of Electricity , says , " The Iraqis do n't know what 's going on and what 's wrong .
They only want to be provided with power for 24 hours .
…
We are doing our best . "
When power is flowing , it 's just a trickle compared to American standards .
Instead of using traditional air conditioners , people are scooping up low - power models .
Appliance store owner Ali Abbas says he can't keep them in stock , even at a hefty $ 350 apiece .
U.S. and Iraqi officials blame fuel shortages and a lack of spare parts that often shut down power plants .
Iraq has 33 major power plants and several small ones that are connected to form the national power grid .
Sultan says attacks on electrical equipment and siphoning from main power lines are a problem .
" Governors and city councils are removing ( meters ) so they can get more power than others , " he says .
Herman says , " Many of the substation operators are threatened if they actually follow the orders of the national dispatch center " that allocates power .
" These threats come from both officials in the area or the militias who operate in certain areas . "
In Baghdad , hospitals , water treatment plants and other critical facilities do get power 24 hours a day from giant generators .
Most high - ranking government officials also get electricity .
Umm Sagad , 32 , says her family spends most of the summer at her parents ' house in the same neighborhood as Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and receives power all the time .
When she is at her own home , she rushes to iron her husband 's shirts , wash clothes and cook in the few hours the government provides inexpensive power .
When the power grid shuts down , up to 50,000 private generators fire up , the State Department estimates .
Asad Al - Wazan 's noisy , smoke - belching generator on Zewiyah Street supplies electricity to 200 nearby homes through a canopy of makeshift wires .
He says his neighborhood gets as little as one hour of government - generated electricity a day .
People there are " almost totally depending on private generators , " he says .
Electrician Ahmed Jasim , 21 , pays $ 55 a month to a neighborhood generator that should switch on seconds after the city 's power goes down .
He says the private source " steals " by waiting 15 minutes to rev up .
Like many , Jasim can't afford electricity all day , so his family tries to keep cool when the power is off at night by sleeping on a tile floor covered in water .
Still , there are some signs of progress .
The government last month installed solar panels atop streetlights in one neighborhood .
Transmission towers are rising in a district in south Baghdad and will soon be connected to a new substation that could improve service there .
" The electric grid was built for 1950 , " says Maj .
Tom Clark , an Army engineer who works on electricity issues .
" The Iraqi government is trying to play catch - up . …
It 's not something you can fix overnight . "
Brüno is a gay Austrian fashion guru .
He has his own fashion based television show , Funkyzeit , the most popular German - language show of its kind outside of Germany .
After he disgraces himself in front of his Funkyzeit fan base , he is ruined in German speaking Europe .
He decides that in his quest for worldwide fame , he will move to Los Angeles and reinvent himself .
Accompanying him to the US is Lutz , his former assistant 's assistant .
Lutz is the only person left in his circle that still believes in Brüno 's greatness .
Brüno goes through one reinvention of himself after another , ultimately straying to areas far removed from his own self .
Perhaps when Brüno finds an activity that he truly does love , he will also find that über - fame he so desperately desires .

To be sure , the situations of Bear Stearns and Enron are different in many ways .
For starters , just in terms of company stock , top executives at Enron encouraged workers to load up their 401 ( k ) ’s with company shares .
That was n’t the case with Bear .
Nevertheless , the rapid collapse of the investment bank ’s shares  they fell to about $ 10 from $ 70 in around three weeks  offers yet another reminder of the risks associated with making concentrated bets on your employer ’s stock , even if it appears to be a blue - chip investment .
Conventional wisdom says company stock is n’t that big a problem now .
Thanks to the bear market and blow - ups at companies like Enron and WorldCom at the start of the decade , as well as the Pension Protection Act of 2006 , retirement investors are n’t as concentrated in company stock as they once were .
In general , the numbers bear this out .
In 2001 , when Enron filed for bankruptcy , investors in 401 ( k ) plans that offered company stock held 28 percent of their retirement account in employer shares , on average , according to Hewitt Associates , the employee benefit research firm .
By the end of last year , that figure had dropped to 16 percent .
But many financial planners say 16 percent is still way too much to invest in a single stock , let alone that of your own employer .
Think about it : $ 100,000 invested in the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index would have shrunk to $ 90,760 since January .
But had a Bear Stearns employee invested 16 percent of his money in company stock  with the remainder going into the S.& P. 500  his account would have fallen to below $ 78,300 .
This at a time when his job may be in jeopardy .
The mix of bad luck , explosives and carelessness in the face of extreme danger would have caught the attention of writers in the heyday of Ealing comedies .
Picture the scene : a large second world war bomb washes up on an English beach , causes panic and the evacuation of a seaside town before it is towed out to sea for safe detonation .
But the relief is short lived .
The bomb detaches from its leash and is lost , unexploded .
This is how the 1,000 lb German SC shell , which washed on to Felixstowe beach last week , has come to be currently lost off the coast .
The 1942 bomb is thought to be one of the largest ever to have beached on Britain 's coastline with an explosive strength sufficient to flatten parts of Felixstowe 's seafront .
Today , Royal navy divers admitted it could take weeks to find the " misplaced " bomb .
The bomb was towed out to sea last Tuesday , with the intention of detonating it the same day , but conditions delayed the operation .
Strong currents moved the bomb 's position overnight , and the straps connecting it to the ship broke .
Officers said no global positioning system device had been attached to the bomb .
Divers had been confident the bomb was within a 200 - metre perimeter of where they originally dropped it but have now scoured four other similar - sized areas to no avail .
The 13 - strong team are now using an unmanned computer - operated submarine called Remus to picture the seabed to locate suspicious objects for their dives .
The 1.72 m ( 5ft 8 in ) torpedo - shaped device was driven down to Felixstowe from Scotland , while the divers themselves made the trip from the south coast .
" The contacts we have been finding with the Remus equipment have proved not to be the bomb , " said Lieutenant Commander Mark Hankey .
" The good news is the equipment is working and we are finding a variety of things and able to look at this stuff and we are now widening the search area .
" We are doing this as diligently as we can and this takes time .
The main thing is this bomb is off the beach and away from an area where it can do significant damage or harm . "
Warrant Officer Robin Rickard , who is leading the dive team , said they were now working 15 - hour days in an attempt to finish the job .
Conditions were still said to be hampering the operation with underwater visibility at zero and strong tidal streams meaning the bomb could have moved a " significant " distance .
" We will continue to search until we are told not to , " said Hankey .
" That is an operational requirement and if another job comes up and we have been here a month then we might have to say the bomb has rolled out to sea .
But we will continue to search for the foreseeable future . "
He added : " We may be here days , weeks - it is a decision that has not been looked at yet . "
The navy team is staying at a hotel in the town while the recovery work is carried out and the overall cost of the operation is already believed to have cost tens of thousands of pounds .
Last night , the team said money had not been wasted and insisted the bomb would be found and dealt with , however long it took .
Hankey said : " What you have to bear in mind is the navy is paid for whatever they are doing .
At the end of the day the only expense going on here as I see it is travel and subsistence - they are in a hotel . "
Experts from the Royal navy 's bomb disposal unit said the bomb had the potential to " flatten " a huge area of the town 's seafront if it exploded on the beach - and cause collateral damage up to half a mile inland .

Those who do n't wanna live in ' hate ' houses should 've never thrown stones !
by Jeremy Hooper
So remember on Friday when we told you how the Southern Poverty Law Center has added the virulently anti-gay group MassResistance to its list of known American " hate groups " ?
Yea , well that same Massachusetts organization is now making the absurd case that it is actually SPLC that is the true hater , with the duo that heads MassResistance using their own characteristics as families to try and discredit the label with which they 've been branded .
" Hate gays ?
Nonsense !
Some of my best friends are black and / or Jewish ! "
This is the sort of absurd logic being presented on MR 's blog :
MassResistance blog has identified the communist Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) as a " HATE GROUP " ( along with Bay Windows , QueerToday , MassEquality , BAGLY , the Mass .
Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth , GLSEN , PFLAG , Human Rights Campaign , etc. -- the list is endless ... ) , following SPLC 's libel of MassResistance and other pro-family groups , including the Traditional Values Coalition .
...
The claims by SPLC are absurd on their face .
MassResistance is led by an Orthodox Jew , yet the HUGE majority of “ hate crimes ” they report in Massachusetts between 2003 - 2007 are against Jews !
Second are crimes based on race , then ethnic group , then religion , then “ sexual orientation ” .
“ Hate Crimes ” in Mass. , 2003 - 2007 , as reported by Southern Poverty Law Center
Anti-Semitic : 76
Racist : 32
Ethnic : 13
Religion : 5 +
“ Sexual Orientation ” : 5
[ NOTES : Numbers approximate , due to overlap for instance with KKK referring to blacks , Jews , and religion .
The overwhelming majority were non-violent slurs delivered verbally , or through graffiti and pamphleting . ]
So according to SPLC , MassResistance , led by a Jew , is fanning the flames of anti-Semitism in Massachusetts ?
And another MassResistance leader , who has an interracial family , is fanning the flames of racism in Massachusetts ?
Or are they somehow responsible for a ruffian yelling insults at a homosexual individual because they oppose the normalization of sodomy , and homosexual " marriage " ?
Uhm , Brian , Amy : Nice try , but nobody is claiming that you all are a " hate group " on the basis of racism or anti-Semitism .
And your own religious identification or family makeup does not change the fact that your anti-gay activities have landed you on this dishonorable list !
In fact , you all could belong to a liberal Jewish temple that fully supports gay marriage and could have a transgender child in your family , and it still would n't change the fact the you continue to lob cruel insults at the LGBT community on a daily basis !
Are there hate crimes that occur with greater frequency than those against the LGBT community ( a relatively small minority ) ?
Absolutely !
Nobody has ever claimed otherwise .
But the ones that are waged against the queer community are just as reprehensible and in just as much need of address .
And it 's not only the crimes that need to be looked at , but also the sort of mentality that creates a hateful breeding ground .
MassResistance 's niche on SPLC 's dubious register is the one that demonizes gay existences , discredits same - sex couplings , and fights LGBT equality at every turn .
The positive support they may show for other communities changes nothing in terms of the negative environment that they foster for gay folks .
Southern Poverty Law Center Identified as " HATE GROUP " [ MassResistance ]
Your thoughts
Since when has Jews and interracial couples became the umbrella for homosexuals ?
Sally Kern and this kooky twosome needs to shart sharing their medications .
And I recommend a cuddling session for each of them , with Richard Cohen too .

Oh come on , everyone knows that all homosexuals are really mixed - race Jews .
Posted by : Timothy Kincaid | Mar 31 , 2008 4:41:57 PM
Well , Timothy , this Gentile certainly does have some Jew in me .
Frequently .
His name 's Andrew .

MassResistance does not speak for all of us on the far Right of America 's political spectrum .
There are many people who , on the surface , must pretend to be something we are n't , because our faith says we must .
I am the chairman of the Christian Film & Television Commission , and founder of the website www.movieguide.org...and
I am also a proud , yet quiet , member of the Log Cabin Republicans .
Yes , exactly what that implies .
While I must play the role of Bible - thumping Southerner , replete with the " hatred " for gays and Muslims and immigrants , deep down I am more the liberal than I can let on .
To reconcile these sides is tough .
It is a hard thing to do .
And this MassResistance , like the Commission I founded , must by necessity play to the wealthy Christian fear - base while at the same time , without question , harbouring nothing but the best wishes for the gay / lesbian / transgendered community .
If we could but each be what we really are , in today 's America .

Put your gamertag here too .
I once created a fake college and I ’m proud of it .
This might strike you as odd , because most people who create diploma mills are doing so to make a quick buck by passing out bogus college degrees .
These fake diplomas , in turn , allow unqualified people to get promotions and or get jobs for which they are not qualified .
The people with these fake diplomas often obtain government jobs , but they are sometimes securing positions of serious responsibility in the private sector , such as in engineering and other technical fields .
Providing fake diplomas is a huge national industry , as it has been for many decades .
When I created my fake college , I did not do it to make money .
I created my diploma mill while I was working as an Assistant Attorney General for the state of Missouri .
I worked in the Trade Offense Division , where I was an attorney charged with investigating and prosecuting criminal and civil fraud .
The year was 1988 and I had been investigating diploma mills ( among other types of investigations ) , often working in tandem with the FBI .
Missouri was a hotbed for diploma mills , I learned .
It was amazing to me that a person could obtain a degree from a college simply by submitting papers over the period of a few months and then obtain an advanced degree , often an MBA but sometimes a Ph.D. in a specialized or sophisticated field .
I had noticed that several of the bogus colleges I was investigating were “ accredited . ”
One particular accrediting organization showed up repeatedly during my investigations : “ The International Accrediting Commission for Schools , Colleges and Theological Seminaries . ”
This one organization was responsible for accrediting many hundreds of small and medium - sized colleges across the United States , as well as colleges in other countries .
Many of these colleges had impressive names .
Many of these schools were small Bible colleges and other schools of religious affiliation .
There were many secular schools too .
The IAC accredited - colleges granted advanced degrees in a wide variety of subjects .
The IAC was based in my own state of Missouri .
I arranged for my investigator to call the IAC to see what it took to get accredited .
My investigator discussed the accreditation process with the president of the IAC , “ Dr. George Reuter . ”
Reuter explained that he would need make an on - site visit of a college before granting accreditation and that he charged a schedule of fees that ran upwards of $ 500 , plus his transportation costs to get to the college or university .
He also insisted on being reimbursed for meals during the day of his onsite visit .
While making this phone call , my investigator , Rick Kastan , called himself “ Dr. Richard Taylor , ” and indicated that he was in the process of starting a brand - new college , The Eastern Missouri Business College , located in St. Louis .
Rick explained to Dr. Rueter that Eastern Missouri Business College would be offering master ’s degrees and Ph.D. ’s through the mail ( remember .
. . there was no Internet 18 years ago ) in such diverse topics as Genetic Engineering , Social Work , Administration of Justice , Marine Biology and Aerospace Science .
Dr. Rueter indicated that we should call him to arrange a site visit when our school was up and running .
As I mentioned , I worked for a state law enforcement office .
We managed to scrape up enough money to pay for our accreditation fees , however .
We called Dr. Rueter again a few weeks later and arranged for him to come St. Louis to make an official visit to the Eastern Missouri Business College .
Although Rueter did not sound very impressive over the phone ( he sounded low - energy and not very sharp ) , we were a bit concerned that when he actually showed up he would want to really know at least some information about our college .
We assumed that he might actually ask SOME questions .
If we told the full truth about what we were doing , we would instantly be exposed .
If we lied too well , however , perhaps no one would blame Rueter for accrediting us .
We went with my gut hunch that Rueter was totally in this for the money and had little to no interest in making sure that our school was legitimate .
Therefore , we did some pretty ridiculous things , things that any legitimate accrediting organization would instantly notice .
For instance , we filled our college catalog faculty roster with the names of fictitious faculty members bearing the names of TV characters such as The Three Stooges and various characters from comedy shows such as “ Green acres ” ( e.g. , the TV pig named Arnold Ziffel taught at our college ) and “ Leave it to Beaver ” ( Eddie Haskell also taught at EMBC ) .
We recruited about a dozen volunteers to pose as professors and administrators and we convinced a local office management firm to donate the use of a 2000 square foot office space for one week .
We knew we needed to have some sort of a library , so we borrowed a small bookshelf and stocked it with some books , including a child ’s book on fishes called “ The Golden Book of Fishes ” ) .
We carted over some furniture that we gathered from our midtown office , including some file cabinets .
We stocked our “ school ” with a few boxes worth of meaningless paperwork , but we had no transcripts , no student records , no accounting records and no legitimate records of any kind .
Our school had no classrooms .
We had a typewriter .
We had a few pens and pencils .
If Reuter had asked us for any sort of document that a real college maintained ( for instance , any student transcript or any class syllabus ) we would have been exposed instantly .
Before Dr. Rueter arrived for his inspection , we had an impromptu training session for our “ faculty , ” our “ staff ” and our “ administrators . ”
We told them to generally act as though they worked there , but to freely disclose any information that was requested of them by the “ accrediting commission . ”
We planted a few microphones in the the flowerpots , but it proved unnecessary .
Dr. Rueter seemed to enjoy the fact that this upstart new college was excited to have him visit–he was more than happy to allow us to take lots of pictures of him during his inspection .
We had created a college catalog that had an official college seal , complete with Latin phrases for “ Education is for the birds ” and “ Everything from petty theft to grand larceny . ”
We handed a copy of this college catalog to Dr. Rueter when he arrived to inspect our school .
He looked around the “ school ” for about half an hour and then made it clear that he ’d seen enough and that he was ready to go have a nice steak lunch with “ Dr. Taylor . ”
During this lunch , Dr. Rueter told “ Dr. Taylor ” that he was quite impressed with our college .
Before leaving for lunch , the administration presented Dr. Rueter with payment for his accreditation services .
Reuter was happy to pose with Rick for a picture of the “ official passing of the accreditation check . ”
Reuter ( the man in the blue suit on the right ) was not a bona fide proficient college accreditor .
At one time , he was a professor at a college ( he , himself , held a degree from a reputable school ) .
He had long since retired from teaching and made a good living from travelling the country annually inspecting dozens of schools at more than $ 500 / each .
But he was not qualified to be an accreditor and he put no legitimate effort into inspecting our “ school ” or any other school .
As I suggested at the top of this post , Reuter ’s fraudulent work gave legitimacy to many crooked schools–diploma mills –that merely sold degrees long - distance without any meaningful attempt to provide an education .
I realize that “ measuring ” the quality of education is a tough job , especially when trying to distinguish good schools from especially good schools .
But I can assure you that , over the years , many “ schools ” make little or no effort at all to educate and they should be shut down .
A conscientious accreditor can identify those schools by carefully reviewing the schools official records and by actually interviewing the teachers and staff .
Here is a copy of the complete “ college catalogue . ”
As soon as George Rueter left our campus , our volunteers took apart our college .
Within an hour , it was once again an empty office space .
A couple days after the “ college ” inspection , Dr. Taylor discussed the inspection with Dr. Rueter over the phone .
Rueter indicated that the IAC was going to grant us accreditation .
It was now our choice ( he advised ) whether we would like to have a “ fancy plaque ” to hang in our college .
We decided to pay the extra $ 25 for the fancy plaque .
We were elated that we pulled off this stunt , because it made for a fun case and a good story .
Telling a good story was in important aspect of my job , because it could illustrate a serious problem for the public and the media .
After we received our “ fancy plaque ” I filed a lawsuit to close down The International Accrediting Commission for Schools , Colleges , and Theological Seminaries .
Dr. George Rueter , represented by an attorney , quickly agreed to shut down his organization and pay a fine of $ 15,000 .
The story played quite well in the press , which led to considerable media attention being paid to the many bogus colleges that were handing out their bogus degrees .
One of those media outlets that picked up the story was the Chronicle Of Higher Education ( in its November 22 , 1989 edition ) .
To celebrate our success , we purchased dozens of T - shirts bearing the official seal of the Eastern Missouri Business College .
You can see from the picture below that the Attorney General himself was quite pleased with our sting operation .
While I was doing this investigation , I was surprised to learn that any private individual or company can offer its services to accredit colleges .
It does n’t take any government certification to be an accreditor .
On the other hand , legitimate accreditors put real effort into the project and produce detailed reports of what they find .
Reuter never produced anything in writing .
He merely told us that we were a good college and sent us our “ fancy plaque . ”
It is good to remember this lesson when considering any organization that “ certifies ” or “ accredits ” any business .
Some of them are incredibly thorough and honest and others are shams , set up and controlled by the very industry they “ monitor . ”
Yes , in a perfect world we would have accreditors of accreditors .
And accreditors of accreditors of accreditors .
Speaking of scams , soon after completing the sting operation , I grew out of favor with the Missouri Attorney General , William L. Webster .
When I took the job as an Assistant Attorney General , I assumed that I was supposed to prosecute people and businesses that were perpetrating frauds on the public and that this could include car dealers and other large businesses that contributed to the political campaign of the Attorney General .
It eventually became obvious to me that my beliefs were not shared by many of my supervisors .
To make a long story short , I was asked to transfer to different Division of the Attorney General ’s Office ( out of the Trade Offense Division ) after I insisted on prosecuting crooked car dealers and other businesses who were violating the law .
I was told that several terrific cases I was handling were “ weak ” and that I should drop the prosecutions or at least allow car dealers who had systematically stolen millions of dollars to merely promise that they would stop stealing .
After I refused that transfer I was fired .
I refused to take the transfer because to do so would be to acquiesce in a big fraud .
A friend of mine , also an Assistant Attorney General with the state of Missouri , was trying to do his best to prosecute other large crooked businesses .
He lost his job too .
His firing is another long story and it also involves corruption in high places .
Fast forward a few years ( 1992 ) and Webster , who was running for governor of Missouri , started being heavily investigated for many things , including the manner in which he kept his own attorneys from vigorously investigating some crooked businesses .
Many of those news leaks concerned my own cases , and many of those leaks occurred during the last few months I worked at the office , leading to considerable suspicion that I was leaking information on my own cases ( I would suggest that anyone considering leaking to the press regarding crooked things going on in their own place of employment should be prepared for a rough ride ) .
Webster eventually lost his race for governor and ended up going to prison for two years for misusing state property .
It recently occurred to me that this story about the IAC might be a good story to share , even though it ’s a few days after April Fools ’ Day .
If you want to know more about how this college sting operation was set up , feel free to read this post on ( believe it or not ) Car Talk or this post in Education Week .
I had to laugh when I just noticed that EMBC showed up on a suspect college list published by the state of Michigan ( we never issued a diploma ) .
I truly enjoyed working for the Attorney General ’s Office .
Being able to set up sting operations–an ongoing part of my job –was a lot of fun and we ended up stopping more than a few businesses from ripping off the public .
While I was thinking about writing about this sting operation , I went through some old photos and found this picture of me 18 years ago when I worked as an Assistant Attorney General .
This photo brings out lots of emotions .
It brings back some pride that I vigorously investigated and prosecuted a wide variety of fraud , but it also brings back the grave disappointment I felt in some people who should have stood up and done the right thing while I was being forced out of the office .
It could have all been so much easier if only a couple more well - placed people stood up and told the truth .
Now it all seems so very long ago . . .
Epilogue : I should make clear that there are many reputable schools that offer highly valuable and legitimate degrees in low residency or no residency programs .
I ’m not trying to impugn all colleges that lack traditional brick - and - mortar campuses .
Here are a few more pics showing the front and the inside of our “ college ” :
At Culver Academy , a military - style boarding school in Indiana , he and his friend Nick Moore would fire up “ Apocalypse Now ” or “ Platoon ” on a laptop  critiques of war , but never mind  turn the sound down and talk about serving .
“ The testosterone was flying , ” Mr. Moore said in an interview .
“ He ’d say , ‘ I ’m just going to go in there guns blazing ! ’ ”
Jimmy wanted to attend the Naval Academy , he told Mr. Moore , and then learn to fly .
But how he would get there was uncertain .
In interviews , classmates and teachers described him as the kind of kid who contributed impressive thoughts to classroom discussions but did not always turn in assignments , who was always collecting demerits for minor offenses like smoking  descriptions that echo those of his father at the same age .
He left Culver after his sophomore year , making it the second school he passed through in two years .
Sometime in the next year , Jimmy enlisted in the Marine Corps .
He only called his parents to tell them afterward , according to Lance Cpl. Casey Gardiner , a friend from boot camp .
Iraq was tilting toward civil war , with blasts of improvised explosive devices at their highest levels yet .
Jimmy McCain was 17 , so young that Cindy McCain had to sign consent forms for his medical tests before he could report for duty , according to Gunnery Sgt. Edward Carter , a recruiter in Phoenix who handed her the papers .
By enlisting in the Marines , Jimmy seemed to be giving up his birthright .
The Navy is , by reputation , the most aristocratic of the armed forces , the McCains among its most storied families .
Now he would hold the lowest rank in a branch known for its grittiness .
“ The first time I heard he was going to be in the company , I could n’t believe it , ” said First Lt. Sam Bowlby , one of Lance Corporal McCain ’s officers in Iraq .
“ He did n’t want to be in the shadow of his father , ” Lance Corporal Gardiner said .
But the new marine was fulfilling his father ’s legacy in at least one way .
John McCain had become a hero not for the missions he had flown or the men he had led , but for the privileges he had refused and the hardships he had endured .
The North Vietnamese wanted to free Mr. McCain ahead of other captives because he was the son of a Navy admiral and Pacific commander .
Mr. McCain refused .
Now his son was carving a humble new path that the father , academy - bound since birth , never had .
Jimmy began boot camp on Sept. 11 , 2006 .
He took extra abuse for his last name , said Lance Cpl. Gregory Aalto , a member of his training platoon .
Recruits are not even allowed their own eyeglasses , so Jimmy had to wear the standard - issue Marine ones , so unappealing they are known as “ birth - control goggles . ”
My favorite lessons build an hour of complicated , engaging mathematics from a simple picture , question , or anecdote .
This is one of those lessons .
The Question How many Styrofoam cups would you have to stack to reach the top of your math teacher ’s head ?
Mess With Your Students
Tell them you ’re 200 centimeters tall ( if you ’re me ) .
Measure a cup in front of them and tell ’em it ’s around 10 centimeters tall .
Act like you blew it and overestimated the question ’s difficulty .
Ask them for a fast answer .
Someone will divide quickly and tell you “ twenty cups , ” at which point you hold up a stack of 20 cups and let them wonder how they underestimated so grossly .
Let them figure out which math problem they actually solved :
Offer Them Materials
Ask them what they need from you .
Some will ask for hundreds of cups .
Offer them ten .
They ’ll want a ruler .
Offer that .
Some will chase you around the room , running after your feet with their stack of cups , asking you to hold still so they can eyeball the answer .
Do n’t offer them that .
Let It Go
The rest largely runs itself .
Just walk around , ask good questions , and correct faulty assumptions .
Good Questions
How many parts of the cup are there ?
Two .
Which part of the cup matters most over the long run ?
The lip .
The base only counts once but you count the lip every time .
If I asked you to tell me how tall a stack of sixty cups would be , what would you do ?
Add the height of sixty lips to the height of the base .
If I asked you to go backwards and tell me how many cups are in a 200 - centimeter - tall stack , what would you do ?
Subtract the height of the base and then divide by the height of the lip .
Does it matter if you round to the nearest centimeter ?
It definitely does .
Get A Graph And An Equation Kids will solve this pretty well without either â€ ” two groups socked the answer right on the nose â€ ” but this is pretty meaningful context for graphs and equations .
The lip - height is the slope and the base - height is the y - intercept .
Actually Stack Them After you ’ve a ) taken secret - ballot estimates from each group , and b ) written them down on the board in descending order , have one member from each group i ) count her cups , ii ) stack them by your feet , and iii ) call out the quantity for the rest of the class to tally up .
If , just for instance , you ’re twice as tall as some of your students , have one student stand on a chair to eyeball the answer .
( “ One more .
Okay , one more .
Nope , too much . ” )

It is a rare researcher who can fundamentally change our picture of our place in the universe .
In the 16th century , Nicolaus Copernicus did it by arguing that Earth is just one planet among many revolving around the sun ; in 1924 , Edwin Hubble did it by showing that our galaxy is just one among many .
This year DISCOVER honors David Charbonneau , a Harvard University astronomer whose research could soon lead to an equally stunning revelation :
By studying alien worlds , he may find the first direct evidence of life beyond Earth , a sign that our living planet is — yet again — one among many .
Astronomers currently know of roughly 200 planets circling nearby stars , and more and more of these so - called exoplanets are discovered every year .
Most of the newfound bodies are so strange that scientists have had to coin new terms , like “ hot Jupiters ” and “ super - Earths , ” to describe them .
Playing the celestial detective , Charbonneau has systematically gone about investigating these impossible planets and uncovering their secrets .
In 1999 , he led the team that made the first observation of a transiting exoplanet — one that passes directly between its parent star and Earth .
By examining how the planet blocks out some of the light from its star , Charbonneau can see what gases are present in the planet ’s atmosphere .
In 2001 , Charbonneau and astronomer Tim Brown of the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder , Colorado , used this technique to “ sniff ” the atmosphere of a huge , broiling planet called HD 209458 b , even though it is 150 light - years away — 4 billion times as distant as the moon .
Just a few months ago , Charbonneau ’s team at Harvard made another breakthrough and created the first weather map of an exosolar planet .
The forecast : hot and windy , same as yesterday , same as tomorrow .
Charbonneau ’s personal journey to becoming a planet hunter began with his desire to be a marine biologist .
Born to a physician and a geologist , Charbonneau was no stranger to science .
As a teenager growing up in Ontario , he visited the tide pools at the Pacific Rim National Park in British Columbia during a family vacation and witnessed firsthand the wild diversity of life at the border of the sand and the sea .
His dedication to biology gave way to a passion for physics when he encountered special relativity , quantum mechanics , and Stephen Hawking ’s A Brief History of Time .
Theoretical physics then led him to astronomy , a passion that now colors every part of his life ( his daughters are named Stella and Aurora ) .
For his next act , the 33 - year - old Charbonneau wants to move beyond the exotic and bizarre planets he has studied so far .
Now he is looking for something far more familiar : a smallish rocky planet with an atmosphere that bears the chemical imprint of life , like the abundant ( and otherwise inexplicable ) oxygen that plants pump into our own air .
Charbonneau hopes to refine the transit technique so that even the faint wisps of an Earth - size planet ’s atmosphere can soon be detected and analyzed .
If he spots the signature of alien biology on such a world , we will know that we are not alone in the universe .
If he fails , it will strongly support the idea that we are truly unique .
That is why David Charbonneau is DISCOVER ’s Scientist of the Year .
You were one of the first people to use the transit method to study exoplanets , and suddenly that technique is really taking off .
Why now ?
Why it ’s suddenly working may have two factors .
One , the astronomical community has slowly figured out how to get very good data on tens of thousands of stars , night after night after night .
We ’ve also gotten very good at understanding most of the little winks and blips in our data .
The other answer is the same reason as “ why the four - minute mile ? ”
Why did n’t people run a four - minute mile before 1954 ?
There was this perception that it was extremely difficult and perhaps could n’t be done .
Most astronomers thought that most solar systems looked like our own .
That meant that the planets that were big enough , the ones that blocked enough of the light , were far from their stars .
That meant that they would only transit once every few years instead of once every few days .
The probability of a transit was very small with this model .
No one was looking because we had entrenched ideas .
What are some of the planets that you ’ve studied like ?
How strange are they ?
189733b orbits a K dwarf , a smaller , redder star than the sun .
Basically , its star is more of a lightweight compared to the sun , so it ’s a bigger planet orbiting a smaller star .
With 189733 b , the excitement is that it ’s the first planet that we really have a feeling for what it looks like .
We actually have a weather map .
It ’s the first planet that I have a mental map of in my head because we ’ve actually measured , to some degree , the physical map .
We know where the hot and cold areas are , and so on .
The nightside of the planet is actually quite hot .
It did n’t have to be the case — it could have been that these planets were very , very hot on the dayside and very cold on the nightside , but apparently there are these very strong winds that can move energy around to the cold side , so the nightside on those planets is really quite hot .
In a sense , that planet feels the closest because we have this image of it .
TrES - 4 is a newcomer on the scene .
What we know about it is that it is extremely low density .
I think TrES - 4 is really going to be difficult to explain — it really pushes the laws of physics to try to understand how it can maintain such a low density when it should want to contract under its own gravity .
HD 209458 b is very hot .
It ’s tucked in very close to its star ; it orbits its star every three and a half days .
Its temperature is probably about 1400 degrees Kelvin !
It ’s very puffy , so it ’s very low density , which means that given its mass — which is less than that of Jupiter — its diameter is bigger than we expect , and so the puffiness of this planet is actually still somewhat of a puzzle .
Its star is rather like the sun , maybe a little bit hotter .
Basically , its star is a twin of the sun , so that ’s why it ’s intriguing , because the star is similar to the sun in terms of its age and its mass , and yet the planets around it are obviously so much different from the planets of our own solar system .
Does that mean that our solar system is exceptional ?
We do n’t know the answer yet .
We do n’t have any clue about systems with terrestrial [ Earth - like ] planets because no one has yet looked with enough precision to find them .
What we have learned is that the diversity of exoplanet systems is immense .
The basic architecture of our solar system , where things go in circles , and there are small rocky planets close to the sun and big massive gas giants far from the sun , is certainly not the only architecture .
It may not even be the most common architecture .
There are many ways to make a planetary system , so , for example , the planets could be on eccentric orbits , or you could have the most massive planets right up next to the star , even closer than Mercury , and those might even be more common .
What ’s it like to be the first person to see an exoplanet ?
You know , the discovery moment now in astronomy is n’t at the telescope looking through the eyepiece but at a computer screen when you ’re analyzing that data .
But there is still that moment where you make that first plot , and you look at it — and right there , no question , there is the signal .
The first time that we measured the actual emitted light from these planets , or the first time that we detected that one of them had an atmosphere , those were very unambiguous signals .
And the first time you see that , that ’s the most rewarding moment in science .
You ’re now working on the MEarth project , which is going to look for Earth - size planets orbiting close to “ M dwarfs , ” which are small , dim stars .
How long until it ’s up and running , and how long until it gives its first results ?
The project is being built now in southern Arizona , and we hope to have two telescopes working in October and then six more by January , so we hope to start the survey early in 2008 , and the nominal survey will take three years .
Our telescopes are pretty humble by astronomy standards .
The telescopes are 16 - inch telescopes — tiny compared to what we often use for our research , telescopes that are 10 meters [ about 400 inches ] in size .
But I think that it ’s not unrealistic that someone will make the first detection of a transiting planet in the habitable zone of its star in the next couple of years .
Suppose you find a planet the size of Earth .
How do you then look for life ?
We are very biased by having grown up here on Earth , but there ’s a huge challenge in asking yourself the question , “ What different forms might life take ? ”
It would be so difficult to recognize life if it were very different chemically from life on Earth .
The easier question is to look for life that is very similar to life on Earth .
That ’s probably going to be our first step .
When we talk about life on other planets , we ’re talking about life as we know it .
The first measurement is to determine that the planet has an atmosphere .
You need a thick atmosphere for life as we know it .
Then the trick is to examine the atmosphere spectroscopically for the presence of certain molecules .
If we look at the spectrum of Earth , we see there ’s a lot of oxygen .
All of that oxygen is driven by biological activity .
The only way Earth ’s atmosphere has this large quantity of oxygen , especially in the presence of methane and other things that would like to react with oxygen , is that there ’s this driver , which is life , which through photosynthesis supports this equilibrium .
We look to see if life has done things to that distant atmosphere that we know it did to the atmosphere here on Earth — that ’s a nice remote - sensing approach ; it does n’t require any assumptions about the life , like that it wants to communicate with us or anything fancy like that .
If you stepped back from the solar system and you took a spectrum of Earth and Mars and Venus , you would see that there ’s something really special about Earth .
The atmospheres of Venus and Mars have mostly carbon dioxide , which is not a good molecule for life .
However , if you do n’t see those [ Earth - like ] signals , you ca n’t conclude that there is n’t life , because the life may be completely different ; it may proceed in some chemical pathway that we might mistake for nonbiotic processes , for geologic processes .
How do you think people will be affected if we discover that there is another living world out there ?
Philosophically , if it were the case that the galaxy is full of habitable planets , and perhaps even other civilizations , I think that people would think of themselves quite differently .
Or to know that Earth was truly unique in that it was the only habitable planet would affect how many people view their place in the universe .
When I went to school , there were n’t planets around the stars — they were there , of course , but nobody had ever detected them .
My daughters will grow up in a world where there were always planets around the stars .
They ’ll learn in school that of course there are planets around the stars — hundreds of them .
By the time they go to school , even a few years from now , there may be a thousand .
And maybe even by the time they ’re in a university , and hopefully before then , it ’ll just be a fact that there is life on some of those planets .
There will be this amazing change , and they ’ll have just grown up in this world where that was always the case .
What are we learning about our own lives on Earth as we look at these distant planets ?
Well , I think there is certainly a very clear answer to that if we look ahead .
If we find life on other planets , what we want to know is whether the basic forces of evolution and biology are universal .
You kind of wonder about how life started on Earth .
Maybe it ’s the case that you just have to cook up a planet with roughly the right properties and life is unavoidable — life will just spontaneously get going on any such planet , and that it ’s a very universal process .
Or maybe that ’s a really rare process .
Maybe it ’s not enough to have all the right conditions .
Even if you have those right conditions , it ’s still one in a billion .
So I think it really is something that is very close to home .
Has there been any specific new research triggered by these studies of planets around other stars ?
We want to understand a lot of the molecules that we look at in planets around other stars .
Those molecules are the exact same molecules as here on Earth , but we now want to see them under very different conditions , very high temperatures and pressures .
And so we have to go and study them here on Earth .
We ’ve been learning a lot about the spectral signatures of water and methane , motivated by these exoplanet studies .
Those molecules are crucial to us here on Earth .
You ’d think we would know everything there is to know about water , but that ’s not true .
Did you ever worry that you would n’t find anything when you began searching for planets ?
I was very nervous at the time that we would n’t find any of these planets , or that it would n’t turn into a very rich field .
It ’s given me a great sense of delight to see that those risks were rewarded many times beyond my expectations .
But it ’s only with accepting a level of risk that there ’s the possibility of a truly novel discovery .
If you do a very conservative project that you know will be productive , in the sense that it ’s going to yield some results , there ’s a limit on what is the most exciting thing that could happen within that project .
If that thing is n’t something that would really keep you up at night , then why are you going through the motions ?
How has planet hunting changed since you started ?
Maybe 10 , certainly 20 , years ago — if you talked about looking for life on other planets , then you were kind of nutty , right ?
It was probably a very dangerous thing to do if you were a junior faculty who might be looking for tenure , let ’s say .
And that ’s completely changed — I think now there ’s this huge sense that we are really going to make this work , and we ’re going to figure out how to actually study the atmospheres of these planets that we ’re detecting and look for the chemical signatures of biological activity .
So that has gone from being a kind of crazy scientific idea that could never be tested to something that ’s really at the heart of the big funding agencies , in particular NASA .
Why search for distant planets when there ’s still so much we do n’t know about our own Earth ?
Look back through history and you can find writings from the Greeks that talk about life on planets orbiting other stars .
I think there ’s been this abiding human question about whether we are alone in the universe .
And I think that strikes at the very soul of humanity — of how we picture ourselves in the cosmos .
We ’ve learned in the last hundred years of the incredible physical size and age of the universe .
And now the question is , as it has always been , are we truly alone ?
And I think that everybody is willing to put in a little bit of money to actually get at the answer to that question .
Most fathers now attend the birth of their baby Maternity services across the UK are disadvantaging children from birth by " shutting out " their fathers , a think tank has warned .
The Fatherhood Institute said the benefits of the father 's active involvement from birth were profound .
New parents should be allowed to stay together overnight in hospital and midwives should have more training on including fathers , they recommended .
But the NCT said some of the issues raised were also important for mothers .
In a report published on Monday the Institute said in focusing almost entirely on mothers , most maternity units tend to overlook fathers .
There are no clear guidelines and no formal requirement for maternity services to recognise fathers - to - be and ensure they are involved in the birth and early days of their baby 's life , the report said .
While the mother 's responsibilities are reinforced at every opportunity , the first message many fathers get after the birth is ' leave this place now '
Duncan Fisher , Fatherhood Institute Yet fathers ' behaviour and experiences before , during can have a powerful impact on mothers and children .
And fathers who are highly involved with their babies from the start are more likely to remain so for life and both infant and mother tend to do well in the weeks and months after birth , the Institute said .
While 86 % of fathers now attend the birth of their child , the report found that many still feel excluded at the birth and can be literally shut out when visiting time is over .
Their research also showed many new dads feel they have no clear role and are offered very little information .
More support
The Institute wants to see a change in birth registration practice so that both parents sign the birth certificate .
And for maternity services to allow and encourage fathers to be present for doctor 's ward round and when support is given on baby care skills .
A co-ordinated government programme is needed to give targeted antenatal support to young mothers and vulnerable fathers , the report added .
Fatherhood Institute chief executive Duncan Fisher said : " Research clearly shows that the positive involvement of fathers right from the start is crucial ; and that when professionals engage with fathers , particularly young or otherwise vulnerable dads , this makes a huge difference to mother and baby .
" What actually happens now is that while the mother 's responsibilities are reinforced at every opportunity , the first message many fathers get after the birth is ' leave this place now ' .
" Currently , we do n't ask questions if a father fails to show for the antenatal appointment or does n't sign the birth certificate .
" If things are going to change , we have got to start sending both mums and dads some very different signals . "
Belinda Phipps , chief executive of the National Childbirth Trust said both mothers and fathers needed help to settle into their new roles as parents to their new baby .
" The recommendations in this report focus primarily on fathers however many of the issues they raise are just as relevant for mothers .
" Maternity services do not currently fully meet the needs of all parents and particularly those with additional needs as a result of their own specific circumstances .
" Separating services based on gender may not be the most useful way to serve the needs of all parents . "

And that 250 GB should be plenty .
The biggest month I ever had was about 12 GB up & down combined and that was watching a few TV shows online I missed on TV and downloading one of those infamous linux distros .
And what makes you think that DSL providers wo n't follow suit ?
Once a big ISP like Comcast and TW do this , the rest will follow .

The question is , why would a DSL provider cap when they do n't have to ?
While I understand that DSL is also shared , it does n't seem to have the same level limitations as DOCSIS 1.1 ( which most of Comcast uses IIRC ) that lead Comcast to think of capping .

You 're right .
And the smart LECs used USF funds to get it done without costing them a penny .
Just look at Bellsouth's ( now AT&T ) DSLAM and remote terminal ployments in Mississippi as an example .

Because capping has nothing to do with the line between the customer and the ISP ; but the line between the ISP and other ISP 's , which is an issue for every ISP regardless of how they deliver service to the customer .

I do n't know if I agree with that .
Carrier bandwidth is the cheapest bandwidth you can buy ; it 's generally a small number of massive circuits with large commits so Internet bandwidth itself is dirt cheap .
The DS1 / DS3 / OC3 circuits to feed the remote terminals , on the other hand , require buildout of the telco ATM cloud which is definitely not cheap bandwidth .

This held true even for POTS services .
Recall how the price of long distance dropped like a stone after the AT&T divestiture while the price of local service has done nothing but increase .
AT&T was using long distance revenue to subsidize the last mile and could n't keep doing that once other players entered the long distance market .

There is no transit and backbone level bandwidth shortage , it is entirely in the last mile .
Chuck , you 've got it backwards ...
Take it from someone who has worked / still works with enterprises that purchase transit bandwidth ...
Transit is the cheap bandwidth .
Bandwidth for regional , long haul backbone and local access networks ( last mile ) are where the costs are for providers because they have to run fibre / coppper , install nodes / RTs , etc .

The big gains on DOCSIS 3.0 deployments are in enabling switch digital video , allowing greater channel density without further degrading quality from compression .
That you can get additional HSI bandwidth is just a nice cherry on the package .
The reason FiOS is being deployed by Verizon is that they needed a plant overhaul to be able to get into the video services distribution business .

Even though video services occupy the overwhelming majority of a cable system , what do you figure the ratio is for service calls on video vs data ?
My guess would be 1:10 for video : data .
Not all services are created equal , even if they use the same amount of capacity on the plant .
Video is largely identical downstream replication , and it's a gift that keeps on giving in terms of subscriber revenue * AND * advertising insert revenue .
The engineering is less complex , there are no DoS attacks / worms / DMCA complaints / SPAM floods / etc in the video world .
The capacity is fixed 24x7 , making the infrastructure easy to plan for , and people are accustomed to paying premium rates for content .

We can play all day with what the term unlimited means in respect to your connection and the ISP 's obligation to you and YOUR obligation to the ISP .
Bottom line is , as been pointed out numerous times already , they do not use the term Unlimited and have n't for quite some time .
You want unlimited bandwidth to download all the crap you want , then pony up the cash and get it or stop the whining .

Yes , transit WAS more expensive back when the " invisi- cap " sprang up , but that was partly because interfaces and hardware just for those transit circuits was more expensive ( think about how much a router that could handle a dozen or two GigE or OC48 or OC192 interfaces cost back then compared to now ) .
There also was n't as much capacity on the backbone and access portions of the major carriers ' networks that ISPs connect to as there is now ( thanks to DWDM , etc. ) .
But if it was being said that transit costs were part of the reason for the " invisi- caps " ...
That would be true ...
As for now , with most ISPs connecting to transit providers ( or being their own transit providers ) at , in most places , 1 and 10 Gbps , there definitely is not issue with transit .
The problem is that the last mile is much harder to upgrade than a router card swap or installing a new router .
Well , most of " everyone " back then , like now too , probably have no idea of how transit bandwidth is purchased and priced .

Because the telcos are hemorrhaging customers left and right to cable 's triple play offerings and need something to use as a competitive advantage , even if said advantage wo n't matter to 99 % of their customers ?

This competition has forced Cox to be more customer focused in Fairfax VA .

250 GB seems fair .... but the $ 15.00 for 10 GB is steep .
$ 1.50 a GB is way too high ....
It 's obviously designed as a penalty to try and get people to cut usage , otherwise , why not just give the 250GB and then meter the rest above that for a realistic figure , say 10 c a GB ...
The reason is most likely to do with the infrastructure configuration .
They think the nodes could become overloaded at the neighborhood level .
So they will use the steep pricing to encourage people to stay down on usage .

It 's about time they started considering a sane pricing model .
One of two things will happen :
1 ) Their low - margin customers will pay a premium for overages
or
2 ) Their low - margin customers will go be low - margin DSL customers
Just freaking tell me exactly what I get for how much .
The same flat - rate " UNLIMITED " data transfer pricing model is not sustainable for both casual and hard - core users .

However , I can also look at my router logs .
The router logs have entries for constant port scans and messenger SPAM from malware infected computers on THEIR network .
This is NOT included in the bandwidth measurement I have taken because they just bounce off my router .
If they do n't exclude these unsolicited attempts to connect to my computer / network , it will distort the statistics of my bandwidth usage .
This idea is not going to work very well .
I think that companies that have TV content provided through other channels ( such as Comcast / TimeWarner / et.al. ) are trying to limit the adoption of Internet TV and other video Internet sources that are already available in Europe in order to maintain their revenue .

Comcast will just NAT and therefore firewall everyone and no more incoming traffic , of any kind .
If you want an IP you will have to get business class .

If Cable companies put a cap on bandwith - and charge the proposed 1.50 per 10 GB - then users who use under their proposed 250 GB should be allowed to roll - over their unused bandwith for lets say a year .
Sort of like the phone companies do .
Seems fair to me .

Now we 're talking ..
I 've always said that Comcast 's " invisible " caps was a good thing because if they made the caps known , then they would lower them to something like 60 GB , otherwise all the abusers would use exactly that amount per month .
250GB is PLENTY PER MONTH .
Would be nice if we could have a website where we can see our monthly usage .

DOCSIS 3 will be the financial windfall alternative to node splitting except in FIOS markets where it will be used for speed competition .
Caps will still apply since Comcast would want heavy bandwidth users to leave by their own will to FIOS .

If the ISPs all start capping usage and charging for overage , I 'll throw in the towel and go back to dialup .
After all , the only reason for having high - speed in the first place is to be able to download large files in a reasonable amount of time .
When it starts costing too much , I 'll quit .

The number is almost too large to believe .
If it only affects .1 % , and presumably cuts only a portion of the usage of that .1 % , then it would seem to have little to no effect on congestion .

Verizon has free bandwidth for FIOS .
They do own the first Internet backbone provider ( UUNet ) and every other Tier 2 and Tier 3 backbone provider PAYS Verizon for access onto Verizon 's backbone , and Verizon has free peering with all other Tier 1s .
So FIOS is just a way to increase the value of Verizon 's Tier 1 backbone by adding tons of high speed content sinks ( residential customers ) .
The faster that FIOS customers can suck bandwidth , the more expensive other Tier 2s and Tier 3s peering bandwidth costs get with Verizon which means more profit for Verizon .
As S.B.A. administrator , he was responsible for revamping the government ’s Disaster Assistance Program , which was still reeling from the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005 when he arrived .
He was also responsible for supporting the nation ’s small businesses with an $ 80 billion portfolio of direct and guaranteed business loans , venture capital investments and disaster loans .
Earlier this year , Mr. Preston was sharply criticized when Democrats in Congress learned that his agency had given a $ 1.2 million contract to a former Bush administration official who lacked experience in helping small businesses compete for government contracts .
The contract went to the VBP Group , a company based in Paradise Valley , Ariz .
The company ’s owner , Vernon B. Parker , served as assistant secretary for civil rights in the Agriculture Department from April 2003 to January 2006 .
Mr. Preston called on the agency ’s inspector general to investigate .
“ Based on the information provided by your staff , and some research conducted by my staff , I believe there is sufficient cause for concern over the events surrounding this contractor , ” Mr. Preston wrote to Nydia Velázquez , the New York Democrat who is chairwoman of the committee .
Mr. Jackson , 64 , prided himself on working to keep vulnerable families in their homes , to revitalize public housing and to preserve affordable housing as head of the $ 37 billion housing department .
But Mr. Jackson began stirring controversy soon after he was named housing secretary .
In 2004 , less than two months after his confirmation , Mr. Jackson told a House panel that he believed poverty “ is a state of mind , not a condition , ” provoking strong criticism .
Two years later , he said in a speech that he had canceled a contract for a company after its president told him that he did not like Mr. Bush .
Mr. Jackson later said he had made the story up .
In March , Mr. Jackson took a pounding from senators who demanded that he respond to accusations that he had steered hundreds of thousands of dollars to friends for work at the Virgin Islands housing authority and the reconstruction in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina .
Senior Democrats called on him to resign .
An estimated two million people have been displaced in the five - year conflict
A Sudanese government air strike on a school in Darfur has killed at least seven children , according to the aid organisation Darfur Diaries .
The group 's spokeswoman says six more people were killed when a market was bombed during the same attack on the village of Shegeg Karo on Sunday .
A rebel group says there were four air raids in total in North Darfur .
The Sudanese air force has made no comment .
Under a UN resolution , all offensive flying is banned in Sudan .
Since the conflict began in Darfur five years ago , the UN estimates that some 300,000 have died and two million have been displaced .
The UN and African Union Mission to Darfur ( Unamid ) said the reported bombings were " unacceptable acts against civilians " .
Its peacekeeping force of 26,000 has yet to be completely deployed to Darfur , and officials say it is unlikely to be up to full strength this year .
' Surveying '
Shegeg Karo's primary school was bombed as the pupils sat in classes on Sunday afternoon , according to Darfur Diaries , one of the organisations that funds the school .
Darfur Diaries spokeswoman Jen Marlowe said the youngest victim was five years old .
Two more children were seriously hurt , another 30 received minor injuries and one classroom was completely destroyed , she said .
Twenty shops were destroyed in the market bombing , she added .
Eyewitnesses told Ms Marlowe that an Antonov aircraft flew above the village for a long time before attacking .
A spokesman for the rebel Justice and Equality Movement said the attacks in North Darfur started early on Sunday and went on throughout the day .
Unamid said its helicopters and medical teams were ready to evacuate casualties .
A Unamid statement condemned " the total lack of commitment shown by the government and movements to the peace process " .
It urged all sides to cease hostilities immediately .
The Future of American Power
On June 22 , 1897 , about 400 million people around the world -- one - fourth of humanity -- got the day off .
It was the 60th anniversary of Queen Victoria 's ascension to the British throne .
The Diamond Jubilee stretched over five days on land and sea , but its high point was the parade and thanksgiving service on June 22 .
The 11 premiers of Britain 's self - governing colonies were in attendance , along with princes , dukes , ambassadors , and envoys from the rest of the world .
A military procession of 50,000 soldiers included hussars from Canada , cavalrymen from New South Wales , carabineers from Naples , camel troops from Bikaner , and Gurkhas from Nepal .
It was , as one historian wrote , " a Roman moment . "
In London , eight - year - old Arnold Toynbee was perched on his uncle 's shoulders , eagerly watching the parade .
Toynbee , who grew up to become the most famous historian of his age , recalled that , watching the grandeur of the day , it felt as if the sun were " standing still in the midst of Heaven . "
" I remember the atmosphere , " he wrote .
" It was : ' Well , here we are on top of the world , and we have arrived at this peak to stay there forever .
There is , of course , a thing called history , but history is something unpleasant that happens to other people .
We are comfortably outside all of that I am sure . ' "
But of course , history did happen to Britain .
The question for the superpower of the current age is , Will history happen to the United States as well ?
Is it already happening ?
No analogy is exact , but the British Empire in its heyday is the closest any nation in the modern age has come to the United States ' position today .
In considering whether and how the forces of change will affect the United States , it is worth paying close attention to the experience of Britain .
There are many contemporary echoes .
The United States ' recent military interventions in Somalia , Afghanistan , and Iraq all have parallels in British military interventions decades ago .
The basic strategic dilemma of being the only truly global player on the world stage is strikingly similar .
But there are also fundamental differences between Britain then and the United States now .
For Britain , as it tried to maintain its superpower status , the largest challenge was economic rather than political .
For the United States , it is the other way around .
Through shrewd strategic choices and some sophisticated diplomacy , Britain was able to maintain and even extend its influence for decades .
In the end , however , it could not alter the fact that its power position -- its economic and technological dynamism -- was fast eroding .
Britain declined gracefully -- but inexorably .
The United States today faces a problem that is quite different .
The U.S. economy ( despite its current crisis ) remains fundamentally vigorous when compared with others .
American society is vibrant .
It is the United States ' political system that is dysfunctional , unable to make the relatively simple reforms that would place the country on extremely solid footing for the future .
Washington seems largely unaware of the new world rising around it -- and shows few signs of being able to reorient U.S. policy for this new age .
BRITANNIA'S DEMISE
Today , it is difficult even to imagine the magnitude of the British Empire .
At its height , it covered about a quarter of the earth 's land surface and included a quarter of its population .
London 's network of colonies , territories , bases , and ports spanned the globe .
The empire was protected by the Royal Navy , the greatest seafaring force in history , and linked by 170,000 nautical miles of ocean cables and 662,000 miles of aerial and buried cables .
British ships had facilitated the development of the first global communications network , via the telegraph .
Railways and canals ( the Suez Canal most importantly ) deepened the connectivity of the system .
Through all of this , the British Empire created the first truly global market .
Americans often talk about the appeal of their culture and ideas , but " soft power " really began with Britain .
The historian Claudio Véliz points out that in the seventeenth century , the two imperial powers of the day , Britain and Spain , both tried to export their ideas and practices to their western colonies .
Spain wanted the Counter - Reformation to take hold in the New World ; Britain wanted religious pluralism and capitalism to flourish .
As it turned out , British ideas proved more universal .
In fact , Britain has arguably been the most successful exporter of its culture in human history .
Before the American dream , there was an " English way of life " -- one that was watched , admired , and copied throughout the world .
And also thanks to the British Empire , English spread as a global language , spoken from the Caribbean to Cape Town to Calcutta .
Not all of this was recognized in June 1897 , but much of it was .
The British were hardly alone in making comparisons between their empire and Rome .
Paris ' Le Figaro declared that Rome itself had been " equaled , if not surpassed , by the Power which in Canada , Australia , India , in the China Seas , in Egypt , Central and Southern Africa , in the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean rules the peoples and governs their interests . "
The Kreuz - Zeitung in Berlin described the empire as " practically unassailable . "
Across the Atlantic , The New York Times gushed , " We are a part , and a great part , of the Greater Britain which seems so plainly destined to dominate this planet . "
Britain 's exalted position , however , was more fragile than it appeared .
Just two years after the Diamond Jubilee , Britain entered the Boer War , a conflict that , for many scholars , marks the moment when British power began to decline .
London was sure that it would win the fight with little trouble .
After all , the British army had just won a similar battle against the dervishes in Sudan , despite being outnumbered by more than two to one .
In the Battle of Omdurman , it inflicted 48,000 dervish casualties in just five hours while losing only 48 soldiers of its own .
Many in Britain imagined an even easier victory against the Boers .
After all , as one member of Parliament put it , it was " the British Empire against 30,000 farmers . "
The war was ostensibly fought for a virtuous reason : to defend the rights of the English - speaking people of the Boer republics , who were treated as second - class citizens by the ruling Boers .
But it did not escape the attention of London that after the discovery of gold in the region in 1886 , these republics had been producing a quarter of the world 's gold supply .
In any event , the Boers launched a preemptive strike , and war began in 1899 .
Things went badly for Britain from the beginning .
It had more men and better weapons and was fielding its best generals ( including Lord Kitchener , the hero of Omdurman ) .
But the Boers were passionate in defending themselves , knew the land , and adopted successful guerrilla tactics that relied on stealth and speed .
The British army 's enormous military superiority meant little on the ground , and its commanders resorted to brutal tactics -- burning down villages , herding civilians into concentration camps ( the world 's first ) , sending in more and more troops .
Eventually , Britain had 450,000 troops fighting a militia of 45,000 .
The Boers could not hold back the British army forever , and in 1902 they surrendered .
But in a larger sense , Britain lost the war .
It had suffered 45,000 casualties , spent half a billion pounds , stretched its army to the breaking point , and discovered enormous incompetence and corruption in its war effort .
Its brutal wartime tactics , moreover , gave it a black eye in the view of the rest of the world .
At home , all of this created , or exposed , deep divisions over Britain 's global role .
Abroad , every other great power -- France , Germany , the United States -- opposed London 's actions .
" They were friendless , " the historian Lawrence James has written of the British in 1902 .
Fast - forward to today .
Another superpower , militarily unbeatable , wins an easy victory in Afghanistan and then takes on what it is sure will be another simple battle , this one against Saddam Hussein 's isolated regime in Iraq .
The result : a quick initial military victory followed by a long , arduous struggle , filled with political and military blunders and met with intense international opposition .
The analogy is obvious ; the United States is Britain , the Iraq war is the Boer War -- and , by extension , the United States ' future looks bleak .
And indeed , regardless of the outcome in Iraq , the costs have been massive .
The United States has been overextended and distracted , its army stressed , its image sullied .
Rogue states such as Iran and Venezuela and great powers such as China and Russia are taking advantage of Washington 's inattention and bad fortunes .
The familiar theme of imperial decline is playing itself out one more time .
History is happening again .
THE LONG GOODBYE
But whatever the apparent similarities , the circumstances are not really the same .
Britain was a strange superpower .
Historians have written hundreds of books explaining how London could have adopted certain foreign policies to change its fortunes .
If only it had avoided the Boer War , say some .
If only it had stayed out of Africa , say others .
The historian Niall Ferguson provocatively suggests that had Britain stayed out of World War I ( and there might not have been a world war without British participation ) , it might have managed to preserve its great - power position .
There is some truth to this line of reasoning ( World War I did bankrupt Britain ) , but to put things properly in historical context , it is worth looking at this history from another angle .
Britain 's immense empire was the product of unique circumstances .
The wonder is not that it declined but that its dominance lasted as long as it did .
Understanding how Britain played its hand -- one that got weaker over time -- can help illuminate the United States ' path forward .
Britain has been a rich country for centuries ( and was a great power for most of that time ) , but it was an economic superpower for little more than a generation .
Observers often make the mistake of dating its apogee by great imperial events such as the Diamond Jubilee .
In fact , by 1897 , Britain 's best years were already behind it .
Its true apogee was a generation earlier , from 1845 to 1870 .
At the time , it was producing more than 30 percent of global GDP .
Its energy consumption was five times that of the United States and 155 times that of Russia .
It accounted for one - fifth of the world 's trade and two - fifths of its manufacturing trade .
And all this was accomplished with just two percent of the world 's population .
By the late 1870s , the United States had equaled Britain on most industrial measures , and by the early 1880s it had actually surpassed it , as Germany would about 15 years later .
By World War I , the United States ' economy was twice the size of Britain's , and together France 's and Russia 's were larger as well .
In 1860 , Britain had produced 53 percent of the world 's iron ( then a sign of supreme industrial strength ) ; by 1914 , it was making less than 10 percent .
Of course , politically , London was still the capital of the world at the time of World War I , and its writ was unequaled and largely unchallenged across much of the globe .
Britain had acquired an empire in a period before the onset of nationalism , and so there were few obstacles to creating and maintaining control in far - flung places .
Its sea power was unrivaled , and it remained dominant in banking , shipping , insurance , and investment .
London was still the center of global finance , and the pound still the reserve currency of the world .
Even in 1914 , Britain invested twice as much capital abroad as its closest competitor , France , and five times as much as the United States .
The economic returns of these investments and other " invisible trades " in some ways masked Britain 's decline .
In fact , the British economy was sliding .
British growth rates had dropped below two percent in the decades leading up to World War I .
The United States and Germany , meanwhile , were growing at around five percent .
Having spearheaded the first Industrial Revolution , Britain was less adept at moving into the second .
The goods it was producing represented the past rather than the future .
In 1907 , for example , it manufactured four times as many bicycles as the United States did , but the United States manufactured 12 times as many cars .
Scholars have debated the causes of Britain 's decline since shortly after that decline began .
Some have focused on geopolitics ; others , on economic factors , such as low investment in new plants and equipment and bad labor relations .
British capitalism had remained old - fashioned and rigid , its industries set up as small cottage - scale enterprises with skilled craftsmen rather than the mass factories that sprang up in Germany and the United States .
There were signs of broader cultural problems as well .
A wealthier Britain was losing its focus on practical education , and British society retained a feudal cast , given to it by its landowning aristocracy .
But it may be that none of these failings was actually crucial .
The historian Paul Kennedy has explained the highly unusual circumstances that produced Britain 's dominance in the nineteenth century .
Given its portfolio of power -- geography , population , resources -- Britain could reasonably have expected to account for three to four percent of global GDP , but its share rose to around ten times that figure .
As those unusual circumstances abated -- as other Western countries caught up with industrialization , as Germany united , as the United States resolved its North - South divide -- Britain was bound to decline .
The British statesman Leo Amery saw this clearly in 1905 .
" How can these little islands hold their own in the long run against such great and rich empires as the United States and Germany are rapidly becoming ? " he asked .
" How can we with forty millions of people compete with states nearly double our size ? "
It is a question that many Americans are now asking in the face of China 's rise .
Britain managed to maintain its position as the leading world power for decades after it lost its economic dominance thanks to a combination of shrewd strategy and good diplomacy .
Early on , as it saw the balance of power shifting , London made one critical decision that extended its influence by decades : it chose to accommodate itself to the rise of the United States rather than to contest it .
In the decades after 1880 , on issue after issue London gave in to a growing and assertive Washington .
It was not easy for Britain to cede control to its former colony , a country with which it had fought two wars and in whose recent civil war it had sympathized with the secessionists .
But it was a strategic masterstroke .
Had Britain tried to resist the rise of the United States , on top of all its other commitments , it would have been bled dry .
For all of London 's mistakes over the next half century , its strategy toward Washington -- one followed by every British government since the 1890s -- meant that Britain could focus its attention on other critical fronts .
It remained , for example , the master of the seas , controlling its lanes and pathways with " five keys " that were said to lock up the world -- Singapore , the Cape of Good Hope , Alexandria , Gibraltar , and Dover .
Britain maintained control of its empire and retained worldwide influence with relatively little opposition for many decades .
( In the settlement after World War I , it took over 1.8 million square miles of territory and 13 million new subjects , mostly in the Middle East . )
Still , the gap between its political role and its economic capacity was growing .
By the twentieth century , the empire was an enormous drain on the British treasury .
And this was no time for expensive habits .
The British economy was reeling .
World War I cost over $ 40 billion , and Britain , once the world 's leading creditor , had debts amounting to 136 percent of domestic output afterward .
By the mid-1920s , interest payments alone sucked up half the government 's budget .
Meanwhile , by 1936 , Germany 's defense spending was three times as high as Britain's .
The same year that Italy invaded Ethiopia , Mussolini also placed 50,000 troops in Libya -- ten times the number of British troops guarding the Suez Canal .
It was these circumstances -- coupled with the memory of a recent world war that had killed more than 700,000 young Britons -- that led the British governments of the 1930s , facing the forces of fascism , to prefer wishful thinking and appeasement to confrontation .
World War II was the final nail in the coffin of British economic power : in 1945 , the United States ' GDP was ten times that of Britain .
Even then , Britain remained remarkably influential , at least partly because of the almost superhuman energy and ambition of Winston Churchill .
Given that the United States was paying most of the Allies ' economic costs , and Russia was bearing most of the casualties , it took extraordinary will for Britain to remain one of the three major powers deciding the fate of the postwar world .
( The photographs of Franklin Roosevelt , Joseph Stalin , and Churchill at the Yalta Conference in February 1945 are somewhat misleading : there was no " big three " at Yalta ; there was a " big two " plus one brilliant political entrepreneur who was able to keep himself and his country in the game . )
But even this came at a cost .
In return for its loans to London , the United States took over dozens of British bases in Canada , the Caribbean , the Indian Ocean , and the Pacific .
" The British Empire is handed over to the American pawnbroker -- our only hope , " said one member of Parliament .
The economist John Maynard Keynes described the Lend - Lease Act as an attempt to " pick out the eyes of the British Empire . "
Less emotional observers saw that the transition was inevitable .
Toynbee , by then a distinguished historian , consoled Britons by noting that the United States ' " hand will be a great deal lighter than Russia 's , Germany 's , or Japan's , and I suppose these are the alternatives . "
THE ENTREPRENEURIAL
EMPIRE
Britain was undone as a global power not because of bad politics but because of bad economics .
Indeed , the impressive skill with which London played its weakening hand despite a 70 - year economic decline offers important lessons for the United States .
First , however , it is essential to note that the central feature of Britain 's decline -- irreversible economic deterioration -- does not really apply to the United States today .
Britain 's unrivaled economic status lasted for a few decades ; the United States ' has lasted more than 120 years .
The U.S. economy has been the world 's largest since the middle of the 1880s , and it remains so today .
In fact , the United States has held a surprisingly constant share of global GDP ever since .
With the brief exception of the late 1940s and 1950s , when the rest of the industrialized world had been destroyed and its share rose to 50 percent , the United States has accounted for roughly a quarter of world output for over a century ( 32 percent in 1913 , 26 percent in 1960 , 22 percent in 1980 , 27 percent in 2000 , and 26 percent in 2007 ) .
It is likely to slip , but not significantly , in the next two decades .
Most estimates suggest that in 2025 the United States ' economy will still be twice the size of China 's in terms of nominal GDP .
This difference between the United States and Britain is reflected in the burden of their military budgets .
Britannia ruled the seas but never the land .
The British army was sufficiently small that Otto von Bismarck once quipped that were the British ever to invade Germany , he would simply have the local police force arrest them .
Meanwhile , London 's advantage over the seas -- it had more tonnage than the next two navies put together -- came at ruinous cost .
The U.S. military , in contrast , dominates at every level -- land , sea , air , space -- and spends more than the next 14 countries combined , accounting for almost 50 percent of global defense spending .
The United States also spends more on defense research and development than the rest of the world put together .
And crucially , it does all this without breaking the bank .
U.S. defense expenditure as a percent of GDP is now 4.1 percent , lower than it was for most of the Cold War ( under Dwight Eisenhower , it rose to ten percent ) .
As U.S. GDP has grown larger and larger , expenditures that would have been backbreaking have become affordable .
The Iraq war may be a tragedy or a noble endeavor , but either way , it will not bankrupt the United States .
The price tag for Iraq and Afghanistan together -- $ 125 billion a year -- represents less than one percent of GDP .
The war in Vietnam , by comparison , cost the equivalent of 1.6 percent of U.S. GDP in 1970 , a large difference .
( Neither of these percentages includes second - or third - order costs of war , which allows for a fair comparison even if one disputes the exact figures . )
U.S. military power is not the cause of its strength but the consequence .
The fuel is the United States ' economic and technological base , which remains extremely strong .
The United States does face larger , deeper , and broader challenges than it has ever faced in its history , and it will undoubtedly lose some share of global GDP .
But the process will look nothing like Britain 's slide in the twentieth century , when the country lost the lead in innovation , energy , and entrepreneurship .
The United States will remain a vital , vibrant economy , at the forefront of the next revolutions in science , technology , and industry .
In trying to understand how the United States will fare in the new world , the first thing to do is simply look around : the future is already here .
Over the last 20 years , globalization has been gaining breadth and depth .
More countries are making goods , communications technology has been leveling the playing field , capital has been free to move across the world -- and the United States has benefited massively from these trends .
Its economy has received hundreds of billions of dollars in investment , and its companies have entered new countries and industries with great success .
Despite two decades of a very expensive dollar , U.S. exports have held ground , and the World Economic Forum currently ranks the United States as the world 's most competitive economy .
GDP growth , the bottom line , has averaged just over three percent in the United States for 25 years , significantly higher than in Europe or Japan .
Productivity growth , the elixir of modern economics , has been over 2.5 percent for a decade now , a full percentage point higher than the European average .
This superior growth trajectory might be petering out , and perhaps U.S. growth will be more typical for an advanced industrialized country for the next few years .
But the general point -- that the United States is a highly dynamic economy at the cutting edge , despite its enormous size -- holds .
Consider the industries of the future .
Nanotechnology ( applied science dealing with the control of matter at the atomic or molecular scale ) is likely to lead to fundamental breakthroughs over the next 50 years , and the United States dominates the field .
It has more dedicated " nanocenters " than the next three nations ( Germany , Britain , and China ) combined and has issued more patents for nanotechnology than the rest of the world combined , highlighting its unusual strength in turning abstract theory into practical products .
Biotechnology ( a broad category that describes the use of biological systems to create medical , agricultural , and industrial products ) is also dominated by the United States .
Biotech revenues in the United States approached $ 50 billion in 2005 , five times as large as the amount in Europe and representing 76 percent of global biotech revenues .
Manufacturing has , of course , been leaving the country , shifting to the developing world and turning the United States into a service economy .
This scares many Americans , who wonder what their country will make if everything is " made in China . "
But Asian manufacturing must be viewed in the context of a global economy .
The Atlantic Monthly 's James Fallows spent a year in China watching its manufacturing juggernaut up close , and he provides a persuasive explanation of how outsourcing has strengthened U.S. competitiveness .
What it comes down to is that the real money is in designing and distributing products -- which the United States dominates -- rather than manufacturing them .
A vivid example of this is the iPod : it is manufactured mostly outside the United States , but most of the added value is captured by Apple , in California .
Many experts and scholars , and even a few politicians , worry about certain statistics that bode ill for the United States .
The U.S. savings rate is zero ; the current account deficit , the trade deficit , and the budget deficit are high ; the median income is flat ; and commitments for entitlements are unsustainable .
These are all valid concerns that will have to be addressed .
But it is important to keep in mind that many frequently cited statistics offer only an approximate or an antiquated measure of an economy .
Many of them were developed in the late nineteenth century to describe industrial economies with limited cross - border activity , not modern economies in today 's interconnected global market .
For the last two decades , for example , the United States has had unemployment rates well below levels economists thought possible without driving up inflation .
Or consider that the United States ' current account deficit -- which in 2007 reached $ 800 billion , or seven percent of GDP -- was supposed to be unsustainable at four percent of GDP .
The current account deficit is at a dangerous level , but its magnitude can be explained in part by the fact that there is a worldwide surplus of savings and that the United States remains an unusually stable and attractive place to invest .
The decrease in personal savings , as the Harvard economist Richard Cooper has noted , has been largely offset by an increase in corporate savings .
The U.S. investment picture also looks much rosier if education and research - and - development spending are considered along with spending on physical capital and housing .
The United States has serious problems .
By all calculations , Medicare threatens to blow up the federal budget .
The swing from surpluses to deficits between 2000 and 2008 has serious implications .
Growing inequality ( the result of the knowledge economy , technology , and globalization ) has become a signature feature of the new era .
Perhaps most worrying , Americans are borrowing 80 percent of the world 's surplus savings and using it for consumption : they are selling off their assets to foreigners to buy a couple more lattes a day .
But such problems must be considered in the context of an overall economy that remains powerful and dynamic .
EDUCATION NATION
" Ah , yes , " say those who are more worried , " but you are looking at a snapshot of today .
The United States ' advantages are rapidly eroding as the country loses its scientific and technological base and suffers from inexorable cultural decay . "
A country that once adhered to a Puritan ethic of delayed gratification , the argument goes , has become one that revels in instant pleasures ; Americans are losing interest in the basics -- math , manufacturing , hard work , savings -- and becoming a society that specializes in consumption and leisure .
No statistic seems to capture this anxiety better than those showing the decline of engineering in the United States .
In 2005 , the National Academy of Sciences released a report warning that the United States could soon lose its privileged position as the world 's science leader .
The report said that in 2004 China graduated 600,000 engineers , India 350,000 , and the United States 70,000 -- numbers that were repeated in countless articles , books , and speeches .
And indeed , these figures do seem to be cause for despair .
What hope does the United States have if for every one qualified American engineer there are more than a dozen Chinese and Indian ones ?
For the cost of one chemist or engineer in the United States , the report pointed out , a company could hire five Chinese chemists or 11 Indian engineers .
The numbers , however , are wrong .
Several academics and journalists investigated the matter and quickly realized that the Asian totals included graduates of two - or three - year programs training students in simple technical tasks .
The National Science Foundation , which tracks these statistics in the United States and other nations , puts the Chinese number at about 200,000 engineering degrees per year , and the Rochester Institute of Technology 's Ron Hira puts the number of Indian engineering graduates at about 125,000 a year .
This means that the United States actually trains more engineers per capita than either China or India does .
And the numbers do not address the issue of quality .
The best and brightest in China and India -- those who , for example , excel at India 's famous engineering academies , the Indian Institutes of Technology ( 5,000 out of 300,000 applicants make it past the entrance exams ) -- would do well in any educational system .
But once you get beyond such elite institutions -- which graduate under 10,000 students a year -- the quality of higher education in China and India remains extremely poor , which is why so many students leave those countries to get trained abroad .
In 2005 , the McKinsey Global Institute did a study of " the emerging global labor market " and found that 28 low - wage countries had approximately 33 million young professionals at their disposal .
But , the study noted , " only a fraction of potential job candidates could successfully work at a foreign company , " largely because of inadequate education .
Indeed , higher education is the United States ' best industry .
In no other field is the United States ' advantage so overwhelming .
A 2006 report from the London - based Center for European Reform points out that the United States invests 2.6 percent of its GDP in higher education , compared with 1.2 percent in Europe and 1.1 percent in Japan .
Depending on which study you look at , the United States , with five percent of the world 's population , has either seven or eight of the world 's top ten universities and either 48 percent or 68 percent of the top 50 .
The situation in the sciences is particularly striking .
In India , universities graduate between 35 and 50 Ph.D.'s in computer science each year ; in the United States , the figure is 1,000 .
A list of where the world 's 1,000 best computer scientists were educated shows that the top ten schools are all American .
The United States also remains by far the most attractive destination for students , taking in 30 percent of the total number of foreign students globally , and its collaborations between business and educational institutions are unmatched anywhere in the world .
All these advantages will not be erased easily , because the structure of European and Japanese universities -- mostly state - run bureaucracies -- is unlikely to change .
And although China and India are opening new institutions , it is not that easy to create a world - class university out of whole cloth in a few decades .
Few people believe that U.S. primary and secondary schools deserve similar praise .
The school system , the line goes , is in crisis , with its students performing particularly badly in science and math , year after year , in international rankings .
But the statistics here , although not wrong , reveal something slightly different .
The real problem is one not of excellence but of access .
The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study ( TIMSS ) , the standard for comparing educational programs across nations , puts the United States squarely in the middle of the pack .
The media reported the news with a predictable penchant for direness : " Economic Time Bomb : U.S. Teens Are Among Worst at Math , " declared The Wall Street Journal .
But the aggregate scores hide deep regional , racial , and socioeconomic variation .
Poor and minority students score well below the U.S. average , while , as one study noted , " students in affluent suburban U.S. school districts score nearly as well as students in Singapore , the runaway leader on TIMSS math scores . "
The difference between the average science scores in poor and wealthy school districts within the United States , for instance , is four to five times as high as the difference between the U.S. and the Singaporean national average .
In other words , the problem with U.S. education is a problem of inequality .
This will , over time , translate into a competitiveness problem , because if the United States cannot educate and train a third of the working population to compete in a knowledge economy , this will drag down the country .
But it does know what works .
The U.S. system may be too lax when it comes to rigor and memorization , but it is very good at developing the critical faculties of the mind .
It is surely this quality that goes some way in explaining why the United States produces so many entrepreneurs , inventors , and risk takers .
Tharman Shanmugaratnam , until recently Singapore 's minister of education , explains the difference between his country 's system and that of the United States : " We both have meritocracies , " Shanmugaratnam says .
" Yours is a talent meritocracy , ours is an exam meritocracy .
We know how to train people to take exams .
You know how to use people 's talents to the fullest .
Both are important , but there are some parts of the intellect that we are not able to test well -- like creativity , curiosity , a sense of adventure , ambition .
Most of all , America has a culture of learning that challenges conventional wisdom , even if it means challenging authority . "
This is one reason that Singaporean officials recently visited U.S. schools to learn how to create a system that nurtures and rewards ingenuity , quick thinking , and problem solving .
" Just by watching , you can see students are more engaged , instead of being spoon - fed all day , " one Singaporean visitor told The Washington Post .
While the United States marvels at Asia 's test - taking skills , Asian governments come to the United States to figure out how to get their children to think .
THE GRAY ZONE
The United States ' advantages might seem obvious when compared with conditions in Asia , which is still a continent of mostly developing countries .
Against Europe , the margin is slimmer than many Americans believe .
The eurozone has been growing at an impressive clip , about the same pace per capita as the United States since 2000 .
It takes in half the world 's foreign investment , boasts strong labor productivity , and posted a $ 30 billion trade surplus in the first ten months of 2007 .
In the World Economic Forum 's Global Competitiveness Index , European countries occupy seven of the top ten slots .
Europe has its problems -- high unemployment , rigid labor markets -- but it also has advantages , including more efficient and fiscally sustainable health - care and pension systems .
All in all , Europe presents the most significant short - term challenge to the United States in the economic realm .
But Europe has one crucial disadvantage .
Or , to put it more accurately , the United States has one crucial advantage over Europe and most of the developed world .
The United States is demographically vibrant .
Nicholas Eberstadt , a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute , estimates that the U.S. population will increase by 65 million by 2030 , whereas Europe 's population will remain " virtually stagnant . "
Europe , Eberstadt notes , " will by that time have more than twice as many seniors older than 65 than children under 15 , with drastic implications for future aging .
( Fewer children now means fewer workers later . )
In the United States , by contrast , children will continue to outnumber the elderly .
The United Nations Population Division estimates that the ratio of working - age people to senior citizens in western Europe will drop from 3.8:1 today to just 2.4:1 in 2030 .
In the U.S. , the figure will fall from 5.4:1 to 3.1:1 . "
The only real way to avert this demographic decline is for Europe to take in more immigrants .
Native Europeans actually stopped replacing themselves as early as 2007 , and so even maintaining the current population will require modest immigration .
Growth will require much more .
But European societies do not seem able to take in and assimilate people from strange and unfamiliar cultures , especially from rural and backward regions in the world of Islam .
The question of who is at fault here -- the immigrant or the society -- is irrelevant .
The reality is that Europe is moving toward taking in fewer immigrants at a time when its economic future rides on its ability to take in many more .
The United States , on the other hand , is creating the first universal nation , made up of all colors , races , and creeds , living and working together in considerable harmony .
Consider the current presidential election , in which the contestants have included a black man , a woman , a Mormon , a Hispanic , and an Italian American .
Surprisingly , many Asian countries ( with India an exception ) are in demographic situations similar to or even worse than Europe's .
The fertility rates in China , Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan are well below the replacement level of 2.1 births per woman , and estimates indicate that the major East Asian nations will face a sizable reduction in their working - age populations over the next half century .
The working - age population in Japan has already peaked ; by 2010 , Japan will have three million fewer workers than it did in 2005 .
The worker populations in China and South Korea are also likely to peak within the next decade .
Goldman Sachs predicts that China 's median age will rise from 33 in 2005 to 45 in 2050 , a remarkable graying of the population .
And Asian countries have as much trouble with immigrants as European countries do .
Japan faces a large prospective worker shortage because it can neither take in enough immigrants nor allow its women to fully participate in the labor force .
The effects of an aging population are considerable .
First , there is the pension burden -- fewer workers supporting more gray - haired elders .
Second , as the economist Benjamin Jones has shown , most innovative inventors -- and the overwhelming majority of Nobel laureates -- do their most important work between the ages of 30 and 44 .
A smaller working - age population , in other words , means fewer technological , scientific , and managerial advances .
Third , as workers age , they go from being net savers to being net spenders , with dire ramifications for national savings and investment rates .
For advanced industrialized countries , bad demographics are a killer disease .
The United States ' potential advantages today are in large part a product of immigration .
Without immigration , the United States ' GDP growth over the last quarter century would have been the same as Europe's .
Native - born white Americans have the same low fertility rates as Europeans .
Foreign students and immigrants account for 50 percent of the science researchers in the country and in 2006 received 40 percent of the doctorates in science and engineering and 65 percent of the doctorates in computer science .
By 2010 , foreign students will get more than 50 percent of all the Ph.D. 's awarded in every subject in the United States .
In the sciences , that figure will be closer to 75 percent .
Half of all Silicon Valley start - ups have one founder who is an immigrant or a first - generation American .
In short , the United States ' potential new burst of productivity , its edge in nanotechnology and biotechnology , its ability to invent the future -- all rest on its immigration policies .
If the United States can keep the people it educates in the country , the innovation will happen there .
If they go back home , the innovation will travel with them .
Immigration also gives the United States a quality rare for a rich country -- dynamism .
The country has found a way to keep itself constantly revitalized by streams of people who are eager to make a new life in a new world .
Some Americans have always worried about such immigrants -- whether from Ireland or Italy , China or Mexico .
But these immigrants have gone on to become the backbone of the American working class , and their children or grandchildren have entered the American mainstream .
The United States has been able to tap this energy , manage diversity , assimilate newcomers , and move ahead economically .
Ultimately , this is what sets the country apart from the experience of Britain and all other past great economic powers that have grown fat and lazy and slipped behind as they faced the rise of leaner , hungrier nations .
LEARNING FROM THE WORLD
In 2005 , New York City got a wake - up call .
Twenty - four of the world 's 25 largest initial public offerings that year were held in countries other than the United States .
This was stunning .
The United States ' capital markets have long been the biggest in the world .
They financed the turnaround in manufacturing in the 1980s and the technology revolution of the 1990s , and they are today financing the ongoing advances in bioscience .
It is the fluidity of these markets that has kept American business nimble .
If the United States is losing this distinctive advantage , it is very bad news .
Much of the discussion around the problem has focused on the United States ' regulation , particularly post -Enron laws such as Sarbanes - Oxley , and the constant threat of litigation that hovers over businesses in the United States .
These obstacles are there , but they do not really get at what has shifted business abroad .
The United States is conducting business as usual .
But others are joining in the game .
What is really happening here , as in other areas , is simple : the rise of the rest .
The United States ' sum total of stocks , bonds , deposits , loans , and other financial instruments -- its financial stock , in other words -- still exceeds that of any other region , but other regions are seeing their financial stock grow much more quickly .
This is especially true of the rising countries of Asia , but even the eurozone is outpacing the United States .
Europe 's total banking and trading revenues , $ 98 billion in 2005 , have nearly pulled equal to the United States ' revenues .
And when it comes to new derivatives based on underlying financial instruments such as stocks or interest - rate payments , which are increasingly important for hedge funds , banks , and insurers , London is the dominant player already .
This is all part of a broader trend .
Countries and companies now have options that they never had before .
In this and other regards , the United States is not doing worse than usual .
It functions as it always has -- perhaps subconsciously assuming that it is still leagues ahead of the pack .
U.S. legislators rarely think about the rest of the world when writing laws , regulations , and policies .
U.S. officials rarely refer to global standards .
After all , for so long the United States was the global standard , and when it chose to do something different , it was important enough that the rest of the world would cater to its exceptionality .
The United States is the only country in the world other than Liberia and Myanmar that is not on the metric system .
Other than Somalia , it is alone in not ratifying the Convention on the Rights of the Child .
In business , the United States did not need to benchmark .
It was the one teaching the world how to be capitalist .
But now everyone is playing the United States ' game , and playing to win .
For most of the last 30 years , the United States had the lowest corporate tax rates of the major industrialized countries .
Today , it has the second highest .
U.S. rates have not gone up ; others have come down .
Germany , for example , long a staunch believer in its high - taxation system , has cut its rates in response to moves by countries to its east , such as Austria and Slovakia .
This kind of competition among industrialized countries is now widespread .
It is not a race to the bottom -- Scandinavian countries have high taxes , good services , and strong growth -- but a quest for growth .
U.S. regulations used to be more flexible and market - friendly than all others .
That is no longer true .
London 's financial system was overhauled in 2001 , with a single entity replacing a confusing mishmash of regulators , which is one reason that London 's financial sector now beats out New York 's on some measures .
The entire British government works aggressively to make London a global hub .
Regulators from Warsaw to Shanghai to Mumbai are moving every day to make their systems more attractive to investors and manufacturers .
Washington , by contrast , spends its time and energy thinking of ways to tax New York , so that it can send its revenues to the rest of the country .
Being on top for so long has its downsides .
The U.S. market has been so large that Americans have assumed that the rest of the world would take the trouble to understand it and them .
They have not had to reciprocate by learning foreign languages , cultures , or markets .
Now , that could leave the United States at a competitive disadvantage .
Take the spread of English worldwide as a metaphor .
Americans have delighted in this process because it makes it so much easier for them to travel and do business abroad .
But it also gives the locals an understanding of and access to two markets and cultures .
They can speak English but also Mandarin or Hindi or Portuguese .
They can penetrate the U.S. market but also the internal Chinese , Indian , or Brazilian one .
Americans , by contrast , have never developed the ability to move into other people 's worlds .
The United States is used to being the leading economy and society .
It has not noticed that most of the rest of the industrialized world -- and a good part of the nonindustrialized world as well -- has better cell - phone service than the United States .
Computer connectivity is faster and cheaper across the rest of the industrialized world , from Canada to France to Japan , and the United States now stands 16th in the world in broadband penetration per capita .
Americans are constantly told by their politicians that the only thing they have to learn from other countries ' health - care systems is to be thankful for their own .
Americans rarely look around and notice other options and alternatives , let alone adopt them .
Learning from the rest is no longer a matter of morality or politics .
Increasingly , it is about competitiveness .
Consider the automobile industry .
For more than a century after 1894 , most of the cars manufactured in North America were made in Michigan .
Since 2004 , Michigan has been replaced by Ontario , Canada .
The reason is simple : health care .
In the United States , car manufacturers have to pay $ 6,500 in medical and insurance costs for every worker .
If they move a plant to Canada , which has a government - run health - care system , the cost to them is around $ 800 per worker .
This is not necessarily an advertisement for the Canadian health - care system , but it does make clear that the costs of the U.S. health - care system have risen to a point where there is a significant competitive disadvantage to hiring American workers .
Jobs are going not to low - wage countries but to places where well - trained and educated workers can be found : it is smart benefits , not low wages , that employers are looking for .
For decades , American workers , whether in car companies , steel plants , or banks , had one enormous advantage over all other workers : privileged access to American capital .
They could use that access to buy technology and training that no one else had -- and thus produce products that no one else could , and at competitive prices .
That special access is also gone .
The world is swimming in capital , and suddenly American workers have to ask themselves , What can we do better than others ?
It is a dilemma not just for workers but for companies as well .
When American companies went abroad , they used to bring with them capital and know - how .
But when they go abroad now , they discover that the natives already have money and already know how .
There really is not a Third World anymore .
So what do American companies bring to Brazil or India ?
What is the United States ' competitive advantage ?
This is a question few American businesspeople thought they would ever have to answer .
The answer lies in something the economist Martin Wolf noted .
Economists used to discuss two basic concepts , capital and labor .
But these are now commodities , widely available to everyone .
What distinguishes economies today are ideas and energy .
A country can prosper if it is a source of ideas or energy for the world .
DO - NOTHING POLITICS
The United States has been and can continue to be the world 's most important source of new ideas , big and small , technical and creative , economic and political .
( If it were truly innovative , it could generate new ideas to produce new kinds of energy . )
But to do that , it has to make some significant changes .
The United States has a history of worrying that it is losing its edge .
Today 's is at least the fourth wave of such concern since World War II .
The first was in the late 1950s , a result of the Soviet Union 's launching of the Sputnik satellite .
The second was in the early 1970s , when high oil prices and slow growth convinced Americans that Western Europe and Saudi Arabia were the powers of the future .
The third one arrived in the mid-1980s , when most experts believed that Japan would be the technologically and economically dominant superpower of the future .
The concern in each of these cases was well founded , the projections intelligent .
But none of the feared scenarios came to pass .
The reason is that the U.S. system proved to be flexible , resourceful , and resilient , able to correct its mistakes and shift its attention .
A focus on U.S. economic decline ended up preventing it .
The problem today is that the U.S. political system seems to have lost its ability to fix its ailments .
The economic problems in the United States today are real , but by and large they are not the product of deep inefficiencies within the U.S. economy , nor are they reflections of cultural decay .
They are the consequences of specific government policies .
Different policies could quickly and relatively easily move the United States onto a far more stable footing .
A set of sensible reforms could be enacted tomorrow to trim wasteful spending and subsidies , increase savings , expand training in science and technology , secure pensions , create a workable immigration process , and achieve significant efficiencies in the use of energy .
Policy experts do not have wide disagreements on most of these issues , and none of the proposed measures would require sacrifices reminiscent of wartime hardship , only modest adjustments of existing arrangements .
And yet , because of politics , they appear impossible .
The U.S. political system has lost the ability to accept some pain now for great gain later on .
As it enters the twenty - first century , the United States is not fundamentally a weak economy or a decadent society .
But it has developed a highly dysfunctional politics .
What was an antiquated and overly rigid political system to begin with ( now about 225 years old ) has been captured by money , special interests , a sensationalist media , and ideological attack groups .
The result is ceaseless , virulent debate about trivia -- politics as theater -- and very little substance , compromise , or action .
A can - do country is now saddled with a do - nothing political process , designed for partisan battle rather than problem solving .
It is clever contrarianism to be in favor of sharp party politics and against worthy calls for bipartisanship .
Some political scientists have long wished that U.S. political parties were more like European ones -- ideologically pure and tightly disciplined .
But Europe 's parliamentary systems work well with partisan parties .
In them , the executive branch always controls the legislative branch , and so the party in power can implement its agenda easily .
The U.S. system , by contrast , is one of shared power , overlapping functions , and checks and balances .
Progress requires broad coalitions between the two major parties and politicians who will cross the aisle .
That is why James Madison distrusted political parties , lumping them together with all kinds of " factions " and considering them a grave danger to the young American republic .
Progress on any major problem -- health care , Social Security , tax reform -- will require compromise from both sides .
It requires a longer - term perspective .
And that has become politically deadly .
Those who advocate sensible solutions and compromise legislation find themselves being marginalized by their party 's leadership , losing funds from special - interest groups , and being constantly attacked by their " side " on television and radio .
The system provides greater incentives to stand firm and go back and tell your team that you refused to bow to the enemy .
It is great for fundraising , but it is terrible for governing .
THE RISE OF THE REST
The real test for the United States is the opposite of that faced by Britain in 1900 .
Britain 's economic power waned even as it managed to maintain immense political influence around the world .
The U.S. economy and American society , in contrast , are capable of responding to the economic pressures and competition they face .
They can adjust , adapt , and persevere .
The test for the United States is political -- and it rests not just with the United States at large but with Washington in particular .
Can Washington adjust and adapt to a world in which others have moved up ?
Can it respond to shifts in economic requirements and political power ?
The world has been one in which the United States was utterly unrivaled for two decades .
It has been , in a broader sense , a U.S. - designed world since the end of World War II .
But it is now in the midst of one of history 's greatest periods of change .
There have been three tectonic power shifts over the last 500 years , fundamental changes in the distribution of power that have reshaped international life -- its politics , economics , and culture .
The first was the rise of the Western world , a process that began in the fifteenth century and accelerated dramatically in the late eighteenth century .
It produced modernity as we know it : science and technology , commerce and capitalism , the agricultural and industrial revolutions .
It also produced the prolonged political dominance of the nations of the West .
The second shift , which took place in the closing years of the nineteenth century , was the rise of the United States .
Soon after it industrialized , the United States became the most powerful nation since imperial Rome , and the only one that was stronger than any likely combination of other nations .
For most of the last century , the United States has dominated global economics , politics , science , culture , and ideas .
For the last 20 years , that dominance has been unrivaled , a phenomenon unprecedented in history .
We are now living through the third great power shift of the modern era -- the rise of the rest .
Over the past few decades , countries all over the world have been experiencing rates of economic growth that were once unthinkable .
Although they have had booms and busts , the overall trend has been vigorously forward .
( This growth has been most visible in Asia but is no longer confined to it , which is why to call this change " the rise of Asia " does not describe it accurately . )
The emerging international system is likely to be quite different from those that have preceded it .
A hundred years ago , there was a multipolar order run by a collection of European governments , with constantly shifting alliances , rivalries , miscalculations , and wars .
Then came the duopoly of the Cold War , more stable in some ways , but with the superpowers reacting and overreacting to each other 's every move .
Since 1991 , we have lived under a U.S. imperium , a unique , unipolar world in which the open global economy has expanded and accelerated .
This expansion is driving the next change in the nature of the international order .
At the politico - military level , we remain in a single - superpower world .
But polarity is not a binary phenomenon .
The world will not stay unipolar for decades and then suddenly , one afternoon , become multipolar .
On every dimension other than military power -- industrial , financial , social , cultural -- the distribution of power is shifting , moving away from U.S. dominance .
That does not mean we are entering an anti-American world .
But we are moving into a post - American world , one defined and directed from many places and by many people .
There are many specific policies and programs one could advocate to make the United States ' economy and society more competitive .
But beyond all these what is also needed is a broader change in strategy and attitude .
The United States must come to recognize that it faces a choice -- it can stabilize the emerging world order by bringing in the new rising nations , ceding some of its own power and perquisites , and accepting a world with a diversity of voices and viewpoints .
Or it can watch as the rise of the rest produces greater nationalism , diffusion , and disintegration , which will slowly tear apart the world order that the United States has built over the last 60 years .
The case for the former is obvious .
The world is changing , but it is going the United States ' way .
The rest that are rising are embracing markets , democratic government ( of some form or another ) , and greater openness and transparency .
It might be a world in which the United States takes up less space , but it is one in which American ideas and ideals are overwhelmingly dominant .
The United States has a window of opportunity to shape and master the changing global landscape , but only if it first recognizes that the post - American world is a reality -- and embraces and celebrates that fact .

A French flick from 1931 called La Fin du Monde was a special effects blockbuster for its time , featuring a giant comet about to smash into the Earth , and amazing chases up and down the Eiffel Tower .
So of course , an American film distributor got hold of it and decided to do the old " Raymond Burr Godzilla " hatchet job on the poor movie , editing out most of the characters and adding in a bunch of random English subtitles to " explain " the action .
Plus , the Americans added a long , strange speech at the beginning from a real astronomer explaining that comets could hit the Earth , and in fact many already had .
Thus the Americanized , 1934 version of " The End of the World " was born - the one you see here .
This is the most action - packed part , and it 's amazing how closely it resembles today 's " danger from space " action sequences in movies like Deep Impact or Armageddon .

Here 's our checklist for what a " danger from space " sequence always contains , and you 'll notice that it 's all here , back in the early 1930s , in this clip :
Race against time !
Awesome , giant landmark under seige !
Martial law !
Cool shiny thing zooming through the sky !
Fire !
Yelling into a telephone !
Elevator crash !
Crowds yelling !
Birds are afraid !
More insanely bright shit in the sky !

See how the more things change , the more science fiction about comets crashing into the Earth stays the same ?
Spesso e volentieri sento dire che un pizzico di gelosia in una relazione è sempre ben accetta .
Io personalmente non sono mai stata gelosa dell ’ uomo col quale stavo , forse è capitato più spesso il contrario .
Su tutti ricordo il mio ex e alcune sue scenate veramente assurde , inerenti a fantomatiche telefonate ricevute da ipotetici amanti , dubbi sul mio essere in un luogo piuttosto che in un altro , o inesistenti sguardi allusivi e vogliosi a me rivolti …… …le mie parole però non rendono .
Avrei dovuto fotografare lo sguardo truce ed offeso che mi lanciava !
Se l’ avessi saputo , magari col senno di poi… …
Anyway .
Io , che mi sono sempre considerata una persona equilibrata e poco incline a tale sentimento .
Io , che ho sempre indirizzato il senso del possesso che mi distingue al massimo verso oggetti materiali inanimati , ieri , sono stata vittima di un attacco di gelosia !!!!!!
Vittima , si si , decisamente vittima , perchè come dice Vasco la gelosia è una malattia …….. se nn addirittura una follia , visto che ieri , appunto , se avessi avuto tra le mani una certa donna le avrei volentieri sbattuto la testa al muro per poi farle mangiare i residui di materia cerebrale … …
Inspiegabile , assolutamente basita !
Io , che ho sempre adottato comportamenti diplomatici nei confronti di coloro che esternavano tale sentire che personalmente mal sopportavo , io …….. ci sono cascata come una pera !
Spiegazioni in merito non ne ho , magari come qualcuno mi ha rammentato oggi “ fondamentalmente siamo animali , anche se evoluti .
Ma l’ istinto non muore mai ”
As if 35 mpg by 2020 was n’t bad enough , auto makers may have to hit 75 mpg by 2030 .
Margo Oge , director of the Environmental Protection Agency ’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality , said Monday that that ’s the level of fuel - consumption needed to meet a scientific - community proposal to cut emissions by up to 80 percent by 2050 from 2000 levels .
Currently , Congress has mandated an industry - wide average of 35 mpg by 2020 , a 40 percent increase over current level requirements .
“ There are a lot of strategies you need to consider — both engines and fuels , ” Oge said in an interview .
Automakers “ need to be thinking of those investments for the long term basis , ” beyond the energy bill , Oge said .
Worldwide oil use is expected to rise to 120 million barrels a day by 2030 , quite an increase from the current average of 85 million .
The auto sector accounts for two thirds of U.S. ’s oil use .

Artist 's rendering of the light echo of a high - energy flash from a black hole .
When a star is disrupted by a black hole in the nucleus of a galaxy , its debris is inevitably attracted and absorbed by the black hole .
This sudden increase in the accretion rate causes an abrupt burst of ultraviolet and X - ray light because the gas from the disrupted star becomes very hot .
As the high - energy radiation travels through the core of the galaxy it illuminates surrounding matter and so makes it possible to probe regions of the galaxy that would otherwise be unobservable .
In a distant galaxy , a star orbiting a massive central black hole strays too close to the insatiable giant and is torn apart .
But before it can be devoured , the star lets out one last scream in a flare of light that slowly echoes across the galaxy .
Astronomers on Earth pick up this faint call and use it to map the nucleus of the galaxy from which it emanated .
This scenario is no bit of science fiction — a team of astronomers discovered one of these rare and dramatic events while combing through the Sloan Digital Sky Survey last December .
Their observations are detailed in the May issue of Astrophysical Journal Letters .
The team is still monitoring the " light echo , " and for the first time , one of these events can be observed in great detail , allowing astronomers " to probe different regions of the galaxy , " said study leader Stefanie Komossa of the Max Planck Institute for extraterrestrial Physics .
Campfire physics
The light echo currently coursing through galaxy SDSSJ0952+2143 likely originated as in the scenario above , with the following details :
One of the stars orbiting the galaxy 's central black hole likely strayed off course ( perhaps after being nudged into " a fatal orbit , " as Komossa called it , after interacting with another star ) .
Eventually the pull of the black hole would rip the star apart , but before the stellar material was pulled into the accretion disk , it emitted a burst of high - energy radiation .
Komossa likens the sudden emission of light to throwing tinder into the smoldering embers of a campfire .
" Imagine a campfire which is almost extinguished so there is not much light around , and so you cannot recognize your surroundings .
In a sense , that is like the core of a normal galaxy , " she told SPACE.com .
" If you throw some pieces of wood into the fire , it will shortly lighten up , and you can see the environment clearly .
And sort of in the same way , in this galaxy , we observed a star was thrown into the black hole , like the piece of wood into the fire , " Komossa added .
Just as the campfire would illuminate the people sitting around it and the trees in the background , this burst of radiation illuminates the regions of the galaxy as it hits them , only the immensity of the galaxy creates a time - delay effect .
" The dimensions of a galaxy are much bigger , so the light needs a lot of time to travel through the core of the galaxy , " Komossa explained .
" And whenever [ the light ] reaches a certain region , the gas [ in that region ] will temporarily shine up brightly and then will fade away again . "
Time delay
Galactic nuclei are normally hard to resolve because a permanent accretion disk of dust and gas around the black hole illuminates everything simultaneously .
" But this light echo effect makes different components shine up temporarily , but … at different times .
That is an exciting way to do some mapping of the components of the nucleus , " Komossa said .
Different parts of the galaxy , such as the molecular torus ( a swirling structure of gas and dust that shrouds the black hole and its accretion disk ) , have a " fingerprint " of atoms in their gases , and by examining the strong change the light echo creates in these fingerprints , the astronomers can tell what part of the galaxy the echo is traveling through .
Then by timing how long it takes the echo to traverse the region , the scientists can estimate its dimensions .
The light echo that Komossa and her team are tracking is thought to have started in 2004 , when the telescope of Sloan Digital Sky Survey routinely imaged and took spectral readings of the radiation in this and thousands of other galaxies .

Bebo has 40 million members worldwide
Bebo is the third - biggest social networking site in the US , behind MySpace and Facebook .
AOL says that Bebo has more than 40 million members worldwide who view an average of 78 pages per day each .
The price - tag is tiny when compared with the valuations of similar websites .
Microsoft bought 1.6 % of Facebook last year for $ 240m .

Social networking sites are seen as a valuable location for online advertising , because members post information about themselves and can then be targeted with products and services likely to appeal to them .
The transaction comes at a time when Time Warner is considering splitting its business to part company with its AOL unit .
Bebo was the world 's ninth most popular social networking site in January , according to the internet statistics provider ComScore , which also ranked it as the second most visited in the UK .
It was founded in California by Michael Birch , a British entrepreneur , who still owns a big stake in the business and so will make a great deal from the sale .
While Facebook made all the media noise last year , Bebo was in some ways more innovative

Alex Burmaster , European Internet Analyst for Nielsen Online , said : " It comes as no great surprise to see another traditional publisher buying in to the power of the social networking phenomenon .
" Microsoft did it with Facebook , News Corp did it with MySpace so Bebo was the next logical target . "
He added : " Bebo has an incredibly strong brand identity , particularly with the teenage and young adult market , so it will be very interesting to see how AOL makes best use of their new youthful Trojan horse . "

With McCain likely to face Obama in the general election , it appears his staff has realized they have an uphill marketing battle ahead of them .
Obama has some of the best marketing money can buy .
He has a brilliant logo , multiple slogans , a pretty face , and he ’s even laid claim to the words “ change ” and “ hope . ”
The following memo by a high level McCain staffer was accidentally leaked to the press .
It shows the McCain campaign ’s struggle to find the perfect slogan .
Over the past four years Lee Camp has performed stand - up comedy at over 300 colleges nationwide , but we do n’t hold that against him .
He was called one of the best New Faces at the Montreal Comedy Festival , and he ’s been featured on Comedy Central .
He has also performed countless shows with Laughing Liberally , and writes and produces comedic activism videos .
He recently went on Fox News ’s morning show and called them a “ parade of propaganda and a festival of ignorance . ”
The clip was viewed over half a million times online .
An unmarked black SUV now follows him everywhere he goes .
Renowned game developer Blizzard has filed suit against a man named Michael Donnelly , the creator of a software program that allows users to automate play of the company 's popular title , World of WarCraft .
Blizzard is arguing that Donnelly 's tool , entitled " MMO Glider , " infringes on the End User License Agreement ( EULA ) of WoW .
Donnelly contends that because the game client is not copied , it does not infringe on Blizzard 's copyright .
Blizzard has countered by saying that the tool actually copies the game into RAM in order to circumvent WoW 's anti-cheat protection .
" Blizzard 's designs expectations are frustrated , and resources are allocated unevenly , when bots are introduced into the WoW universe , because bots spend far more time in - game than an ordinary player would and consume resources the entire time , " Blizzard 's statement reads .
" Blizzard permits its licensees to load the WoW game client software into RAM to play WoW .
As such , Blizzard 's licensees cannot violate Blizzard 's exclusive rights under the Copyright Act to make copies simply by loading a copy of the program into RAM to play WoW , " Donnelly 's statement contests .
Donnelly reportedly decided to fight in the courts after what he describes as " audacious threats " from Blizzard .
He says he was made aware of the potential legal repercussions of his Glider application after a private investigator and lawyer from Blizzard 's parent company Vivendi Universal showed up at his home .
" When they arrived , they presented Donnelly with a copy of a complaint that they indicated would be filed the next day in the US District Court for the Central District of California if Donnelly did not immediately agree to stop selling Glider and return all profits that he made from Glider sales , " he wrote in his statement .
The basic version of the MMO Glider application runs $ 25 , and Donnelly has sold more than 100,000 keys thus far .
An " Elite " subscription service is also available , which further expands on the functionality of the application by background gliding , scripts , automatic login , and , in the future , even remote monitoring .
" Botting , " as it's known in the world of MMORPGs , is not a new thing .
Players use a software program to automatically play the game while they do something else with their time .
Many of these programs are best used for the more mundane aspects of these games , such as crafting items or gathering materials from the world .
Donnelly 's Glider follows a long line of botting programs that go back as far as the genre itself .
However , Donnelly 's bot is particularly powerful .
While many popular bots , such as the infamous Fishing bot from Final Fantasy XI or the crafting macro- botting of Star Wars Galaxies , are limited to a single task , Glider can automate the majority of the game .
" Glider works a lot like a regular player .
It looks at your health , mana , energy , etc .
It moves the mouse around and pushes keys on the keyboard , " the software 's web site explains .
" You tell it about your character , where you want to kill things , and what to kill .
Then it kills for you , automatically .
You can do something else , like eat dinner or go to a movie , and when you return , you 'll have a lot more experience and loot . "
The case is still in its early stages , but it 's likely to take some pretty deft maneuvering on the part of Donnelly in order to tip - toe around the EULA .
Historically , these cases have not ended in the favor of the bot -makers .
" Almost 232 years ago , a group of concerned Americans took matters in their own hands and did what they needed to do by declaring that the time had come for a change , " Nutter said as he signed the bills in front of a table of confiscated weapons outside the police evidence room in City Hall .
Clemens apologizes for ' mistakes , ' still denies drug use Clemens regrets personal ' mistakes '
He apologizes to family and again denies using steroids

In his first comments since a tabloid linked him to extramarital affairs last week , Roger Clemens on Sunday acknowledged making " mistakes " in his personal life .
For those mistakes , he apologized to his family and the public , but the seven - time Cy Young Award winner remained steadfast in his denials that he has used steroids or human growth hormone .
" I know that many people want to know what I have to say about the recent articles in the media , " Clemens , who has raised his four children with his wife , Debbie , in the Katy and Memorial areas , said in a statement to the Houston Chronicle .
" Even though these articles contain many false accusations and mistakes , I need to say that I have made mistakes in my personal life for which I am sorry .
I have apologized to my family and apologize to my fans .
Like everyone , I have flaws .
I have sometimes made choices which have not been right . "
While not admitting to any specific mistakes , Clemens did remain adamant that he never used steroids or HGH .
He has been fighting to clear his name since Dec. 13 , when he was implicated in the use of performance - enhancing drugs in the report former Sen.
George Mitchell prepared for Major League Baseball .
" I believe my personal life has nothing to do with the accusations of steroid and HGH use , " he said in the statement .
" I have already made clear that I did not use them . "

Clemens also addressed the notion that he may have started an improper relationship with country singer Mindy McCready when she was 15 .
Citing numerous anonymous sources , the New York Daily News reported last week that Clemens began his relationship with McCready when she was 15 .
The tabloid claimed Clemens " carried on a decade - long affair with country star Mindy McCready , a romance that began when McCready was a 15 - year - old aspiring singer performing in a karaoke bar and Clemens was a 28 - year - old Red Sox ace and married father of two . "
In his statement , Clemens addressed the McCready story .
" Now , I have been accused of having an improper relationship with a 15 - year - old girl .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
This relationship has been twisted and distorted far beyond reality .
It is just one of many , many accusations that are utterly false . "
McCready , however , told the Daily News that she " cannot refute anything in the story " about her relationship with Clemens .
Request for privacy
The Daily News also reported that Clemens had extramarital relationships with two other women , including the former wife of pro golfer John Daly
Clemens is adamant that he wo n't confess just so the scrutiny will go away .
" I realize that many people want me to simply confess and apologize for the conduct that I have been accused of , but I cannot confess to , nor apologize for , things I did not do , " he said .
" I have apologized to my family for my mistakes .
And having offered this apology to the public , I would ask that you let me and my family deal with these matters in private . "
Clemens ' former trainer , Brian McNamee , told the Mitchell investigators that he injected the 11 - time All - Star with performance - enhancing drugs .
On Jan. 6 , Clemens filed a defamation lawsuit against McNamee in Houston .
On Feb. 13 , he maintained his claims of innocence before a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing .

The Obama “ mistake ” : Breaking the taboo on discussing class in America
By Patrick Martin
17 April 2008
Over the past five days , media commentary on the US presidential election campaign has focused on the supposedly disastrous “ gaffe ” made by Democrat Barack Obama in his comments earlier this month at a San Francisco fundraiser , where he remarked on the mood of anger and bitterness in small - town and rural America , and how this was expressed in various political and ideological forms .
It is worth restating again the offending words , since they have provoked an outpouring of denunciation , distortion and ( in the case of Obama ’s liberal supporters ) lamentation :
“ You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania and , like a lot of small towns in the Midwest , the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing ’s replaced them .
And they fell through the Clinton administration , and the Bush administration , and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are going to regenerate and they have not .
And it ’s not surprising then they get bitter , they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who are n’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations . ”
It should be noted that Obama made these frank observations at a private meeting with presumably well - off potential contributors , not in a public forum .
They came to light only when they were published by the Huffington Post some days later .
Obama was attempting to answer a participant at the gathering who asked why his opponent , Hillary Clinton , retained a lead in the polls leading up to the April 22 Democratic primary in Pennsylvania .
Nevertheless , the candidate — more intelligent and observant than the average bourgeois politician — said a mouthful , and perhaps more than he intended .
He violated the conventional rules of big business politics in the United States on at least three counts .
First , he touched on the reality of class alienation , noting that millions of working people face increasingly difficult economic circumstances and are bitter over the refusal of the political establishment , in both Democratic and Republican administrations , to help them .
Second , he suggested that working people are not only materially distressed , but also ideologically misled .
Popular anger over vanishing jobs and falling wages has been diverted into various blind alleys by right - wing political campaigns over guns , abortion , immigration and trade ( the first three mainly from Republicans , the last mainly from Democrats , including Obama himself ) .
Third ( and worst , as far as Obama and his liberal supporters are concerned ) , he implicitly equated religion with the other nostrums used to misinform and confuse workers .
For this he has been denounced by the Republican presidential candidate John McCain and , even more vociferously , by his Democratic opponent , Hillary Clinton .
Right - wing and pro-Republican pundits have savaged Obama for the alleged slur on religion , while trying as much as possible to ignore the substance of his observations about the economic conditions facing the working class .
Commentators like the Wall Street Journal editorial page and New York Times columnist William Kristol denounced Obama as a closet Marxist .
“ As political psychoanalysis , this is what they believe in Cambridge and Hyde Park , ” the Journal declared .
“ Guns and God are the opiate of the masses , who are being gulled by Karl Rove and rich Republicans .
If only they embraced their true economic self - interest , these pure [ presumably the editors meant “ poor ” ] saps would n’t need religion and they would n’t dislike non-white immigrants . ”
The liberal commentators are typified by E. J. Dionne of the Washington Post .
They regard what Obama said as true , indeed almost a truism , but believe that to say it is a political blunder .
Dionne bemoaned “ Obama ’s mistake , ” but then devoted his column to criticizing Hillary Clinton for her attacks on Obama .
“ Something does n’t parse when a Wellesley and Yale Law School graduate whose family made $ 109 million since 2001 relentlessly assails a former community organizer on the grounds that he is an elitist , ” he wrote .
“ It has been sickening over the years to watch Republicans , who always rally to the aid of the country ’s wealthiest citizens , successfully cast themselves as pork - rind - eating , NASCAR - watching , gun-toting populists , ” he concluded . ”
He did not , however , address the most important question — how this political burlesque has been enabled by the Democratic Party ’s drastic shift to the right and abandonment of any program of social reform and wealth redistribution .
An alternate liberal perspective , if anything more reactionary , came from New York Times columnist Bob Herbert , who wrote Tuesday , “ Senator Obama fouled up when he linked frustration and bitterness over economic hard times with America ’s romance with guns and embrace of religion .
But , please , let ’s get a grip .
What we ought to be worked up about is the racism that still prevents some people from giving a candidate a fair chance because of his skin color . ”
Herbert , who is black , faulted Obama for ducking what the columnist regards as the central issue : the endemic racism of the white working class .
In his view , racism , not religion , guns , immigration or trade , is the main means of diverting working - class anger and the main obstacle to the success of Obama ’s candidacy .
What none of these commentators care to confront is the extraordinary scale of the economic disaster facing millions of working people , not only in the de-industrialized towns of Pennsylvania , Indiana and North Carolina , a focus of the current stage of the presidential campaign , but throughout the country , in large cities and their suburbs as well as rural and small - town America .
It is worth citing in this context the figures reported April 12 by a New York Times economics columnist , Floyd Norris , on the growth of unemployment .
Norris examines the contrast between the official unemployment rate and other measures of joblessness , which show a far more difficult position facing working people .
For men aged 25 to 54 , the prime working years , the official unemployment rate is 4.1 percent .
This figure is artificially low since it does not count people who have given up looking for work .
The US Labor Department reported that in March the actual proportion of men 25 to 54 without jobs stood at 13.1 percent .
Norris observes , “ Only once during a post - World War II recession did the rate ever get that high .
It hit 13.3 percent in June 1982 , the 12th month of the brutal 1981 - 82 recession . ”
Norris cites another series of Labor Department statistics which calculate jobs lost based on a three - month moving average , a method that evens out fluctuations and suggests the longer - term trend .
He notes : “ The government breaks down the figures by race , and those figures show that over the last year almost all the jobs lost by men in the 25 to 54 age group have been lost by whites , with most of those losses affecting men ages 35 to 44 . ”
These figures suggest that while unemployment for black men has been and remains high , the biggest change in the past year has been a sharp increase in jobs lost by white men in the prime working years — precisely those who were the focus of Obama ’s remarks in San Francisco .
There is thus a close connection between the semi-hysterical response in the political establishment and the corporate - controlled media to Obama ’s statement , and the rapidly deepening economic crisis .
The Democratic candidate ’s too - candid comment is seen as dangerous , akin to throwing a lighted match on the social power keg that is 2008 America .
It is notable that while the “ bitter ” flap has roiled the Washington punditry , it has caused little stir in Pennsylvania itself .
It has been difficult for bourgeois journalists to find workers who were outraged over being described as “ bitter . ”
USA Today , reporting from conservative York County , Pennsylvania , found that , “ in more than a dozen interviews here , even conservative Republicans could n’t muster the sort of outrage over Obama ’s remarks that Clinton backers were expressing Sunday ... nearly everyone allowed that , in fact , many small - town residents are indeed bitter ” over the state of the economy .
A retired telephone worker told the newspaper , “ Hell , yeah , they ’re bitter . ”
When Clinton sought to use the issue at a forum in Pittsburgh attended by steelworkers , many audience members shouted , “ No ! ” as she declared , referring to Obama , “ Many of you , like me , were disappointed by recent remarks he made . ”
When she continued , saying that voters in Pennsylvania might find these remarks “ offensive , ” there were further shouts of “ No ! ” according to press accounts .
I like reading magic books .
I do n’t do magic .
Not often ( and not well ) .
But reading the books is fun .
It ’s a vicarious thing , imagining how a trick might work , visualizing the effect and then smiling at how the technique is done .
One after another , it ’s a pleasant adventure .
A lot of people read business books in just the same way .
They cruise through the case studies or the insights or examples and imagine what it would be like to be that brilliant entrepreneur or that successful CEO or that great sales rep .
A pleasant adventure .
There ’s a huge gap between most how - to books ( cookbooks , gardening , magic , etc. ) and business books , though .
The gap is motivation .
Gardening books do n’t push you to actually do something .
Cookbooks do n’t spend a lot of time trying to sell you on why making a roast chicken is n’t as risky as you might think .
The stakes are a lot higher when it comes to business .
Wreck a roast chicken and it ’s $ 12 down the drain .
Wreck a product launch and there goes your career …
I ’m passionate about writing business books precisely for this reason .
There are more business books sold than most other non-fiction categories for the same reason .
High stakes , high rewards .
The fascinating thing is this : I spend 95 % of my time persuading people to take action and just 5 % of the time on the recipes .
The recipe that makes up just about any business book can be condensed to just two or three pages .
The rest is the sell .
The proof .
The persuasion .
Which leads to your role as the reader .
How to read a business book … it ’s not as obvious as it seems .
Bullet points are not the point .
If you ’re reading for the recipe , and just the recipe , you can get through a business book in just a few minutes .
But most people who do that get very little out of the experience .
Take a look at the widely divergent reviews for The Dip .
The people who ‘ got it ’ understood that it was a book about getting you to change your perspective and thus your behavior .
Those that did n’t were looking for bullet points .
They wasted their money .
Computer books , of course , are nothing but bullet points .
Programmers get amazing value because for $ 30 they are presented with everything they need to program a certain tool .
Yet most programmers are not world class , precisely because the bullet points are n’t enough to get them to see things the way the author does , and not enough to get them motivated enough to actually program great code .
So , how to read a business book :
1. Decide , before you start , that you ’re going to change three things about what you do all day at work .
Then , as you ’re reading , find the three things and do it .
The goal of the reading , then , is n’t to persuade you to change , it ’s to help you choose what to change .
2 . If you ’re going to invest a valuable asset ( like time ) , go ahead and make it productive .
Use a postit or two , or some index cards or a highlighter .
Not to write down stuff so you can forget it later , but to create marching orders .
It ’s simple : if three weeks go by and you have n’t taken action on what you ’ve written down , you wasted your time .
3 . It ’s not about you , it ’s about the next person .
The single best use of a business book is to help someone else .
Sharing what you read , handing the book to a person who needs it … pushing those around you to get in sync and to take action – that ’s the main reason it ’s a book , not a video or a seminar .
A book is a souvenir and a container and a motivator and an easily leveraged tool .
Hoarding books makes them worth less , not more .
Effective managers hand books to their team .
Not so they can be reminded of high school , but so that next week she can say to them , " are we there yet ? "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton leads Barack Obama by 6 points among likely Pennsylvania Democratic primary voters but he is chipping away at her lead , according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Tuesday .
With two weeks to go until the state ’s April 22 primary , Clinton has a 50 percent to 44 percent lead , the poll found .
In the last poll on April 2 , Clinton had a 9 - point lead over the Illinois senator , 50 percent to 41 percent .
Obama and Clinton , a New York senator , are fighting to be their party ’s nominee in the November presidential election against Republican Sen. John McCain .
Among Pennsylvania women , support for Clinton remained steady at 54 percent , but Obama gained ground in the new poll with 41 percent .
In the earlier survey , 37 percent of women favored Obama .
The poll found that among white voters , Obama gained 4 points to 38 percent support , while Clinton slipped 3 points to 56 percent .
Among voters under age 44 , support for Obama was up 4 percentage points to 55 percent .
Clinton dropped 2 points to 40 percent support in that age group , the poll found .
Fifty - two percent of Pennsylvania Democrats said the economy was the single most important issue in deciding their primary vote , followed by 22 percent who said the war in Iraq and 15 percent who cited health care .
Voters who list the economy as the top issue gave Clinton a small 49 percent to 45 percent margin over Obama , down from 53 percent to 39 percent .
Voters who say the war is the preeminent issue back Obama 51 percent to 44 percent for Clinton .

My question was , " How realistic is EIA 's Chart 5 scenario ?
If you look at Chart 5 , it looks like there is no need to conserve . "
I was invited to a blogger 's conference call on April 1 , hosted by the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) .
We were told that each blogger would be allowed to ask one question of Peter Robertson , Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Chevron Corporation .
The material we were provided in advance was the written statement of Mr. Robertson , prepared for the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming .
It included a number of charts , including this one :
This was the discussion :
03:35 MS . TVERBERG : I was looking at the charts that you sent out earlier today with various projections of things .
If you look at Chart 5 : U.S. Domestic Oil Supply and Demand , if you look at it , it basically says that including imports , the total amount of oil available will continue to go up through 2025 , and that the amount that the U.S. will produce including enhanced oil recovery and new discoveries will go up .
I mean , this pretty much gives the view that you do n’t need to conserve because there ’s plenty of oil that ’s going to be available .
How realistic do you think this scenario that the EIA has put together is ?
04:21 MR. ROBERTSON : Well , I mean , you know , of course this does n’t – this is the U.S. So – MS .
TVERBERG : Well , this is the U.S. , right .
04:28 MR. ROBERTSON : This is the U.S. so this says that we ’re going to have to import , you know , about the same amount of oil , according to this case and the next 20 years , and the real problem is , you know , is that available to be imported ?
I mean , everybody else in the world is obviously competing for that 11.5 million barrels as well .
So you know , what is going to happen to prices during this period and how tight is the rest of the world going to be ?
So I mean , I think the point of this chart was really to make a point about U.S.
We need – there are existing crude and – this is oil now , this is not gas , so this is just what ’s going to be needed – oil , this is really almost a transportation fuel chart because the main thing that oil is used for – , not the only thing , but the main thing it ’s used for is transportation fuels .
And so far , we have difficulty substituting something for transportation fuels .
So this is sort of an oil chart , but what it says is that look how important our existing oil production is in the United States and look how it declines unless we do additional exploration and we get some new technology and we , you know , we get some areas where we can explore and all of these things , because the biofuels – and the biofuels part of this chart is what – you know , is the – what happened in the energy bill last year , so that ’s – and you can see the impact of that .
It ’s still – it ’s important , but it ’s still not going to change the position .
05:50 So even after all this , even if we do – if we ’re able to keep the existing crude production flat – which we have n’t done for many , many , many years – you know , as you guys know where it was nine million barrels a day about 20 years ago , now we ’re about five million barrels a day in the U.S .
You know , and that – that sort of trend line is besides a blip here , probably from the Gulf of Mexico .
You know , the trend line has sort of been down for a long time .
So we ’re going to have hard work just keeping this flat .
It says that , you know , we ’re still going to have to import a lot of oil , and that ’s the problem .
And the opportunity is to shrink that amount of oil that we import , because we are going to be competing with the rest of the world for it , and who knows what the price of it will be .
John Felmy , API 's Chief Economist , then pointed out what is easy to miss .
EIA 's top line is really an estimate of demand .
Demand is estimated based on an economic model that includes the desired level of economic growth together with a growth in efficiency equal to what it has been in the past -- about 1.6 % per year , plus the expected impact of the new fuel economy requirements from the 2007 legislation .
Thus , Chart 5 does have some efficiency growth built into it , but even including the efficiency gains , it is indicating an increase in expected oil consumption .
EIA determines expected imports by subtracting its estimate of the amount of oil the US will produce from its estimate of future demand .
This produces the 11.5 million barrels a day of oil imports it shows as expected for 2025 .
The EIA makes the assumption that someone , somewhere , will have oil available to export , when it is needed .
I never really got an answer regarding how realistic Mr. Robertson thought this scenario was .
Clearly he thought the forecast for US oil production was a stretch , and import costs would be high .
Mr. Robertson 's prepared charts did not include EIA 's estimates of the future cost of oil , but the EIA 2008 Energy Outlook Report shows them to be as follows :
It sounded like neither Mr. Robertson nor Mr. Felmy had much confidence in these cost estimates .

Other Questions
Carter Wood said that the low dollar had been a boon to companies doing exports , and wondered what Chevon 's position was on the level of the dollar .
Mr. Robertson said that Chevron wanted the dollar higher , so that oil would n't be so expensive for customers .
Geoff Styles wondered if there were any areas of agreement , where the industry and government might work together .
Mr. Robertson indicated improved energy efficiency was one such area .
Another was allowing more drilling in restricted areas .
A third was raising people 's view of the industry so that they view it as an important industry , doing high tech things , so that young people will be attracted to studying to be geologists and engineers .
Margot Gerritsen commented on the current lack of funding by the Department of Energy on oil and gas projects of all kinds , such as enhanced oil recovery and research on improved methods for unconventional gas and oil recovery .
Mr. Robertson said that the industry was paying a lot of money in royalties and fees , and that at least a little of that is set aside for research under the recent energy bill .
Ms. Gerritsen observed that fashions in funding change , and now the money is going to carbon sequestration and renewable fuels .
Brain Westenhaus asked about how decisions were made for allocating capital among the various different choices , such as renewables , enhanced oil recovery and new drilling .
Mr. Robertson said that they evaluate and are involved with a lot of different projects .
Historically , oil has had the best return for stockholders .
Renewables are mostly not too far along , are expensive for the purchaser , and hard to scale up .
It is often difficult to get permitting for oil and gas processing facilities in the United States .
This can force the company to build facilities overseas instead .
Changing the Conventional Wisdom
In Mr. Robetson 's prepared statement , he closes with a section he calls " Changing the Conventional Wisdom " , in which he lays out what action steps he thinks are necessary .
This is a shortened version of those steps .
First , we need to value energy as a precious resource .
Energy efficiency is the most immediate and important action that each of us can take to contribute to rising energy prices .
The United States must become a nation of energy savers .
Second , I would urge you to be sensitive to the issue of scale and timeframe .
I hope that I have been able to demonstrate Chevron ’s commitment to the development of alternative sources of energy .
This is an ambitious undertaking and one that we are embracing .
But the scale of the energy system means that despite our combined efforts , renewables will meet less than 10 percent of demand in 2030 , according to EIA estimates .
We must continue to bring traditional energy supplies to market , even as we are developing alternatives sources of energy .
Third , on the supply side , we need your help to open up the 85 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf that is now off limits to environmentally responsible oil and gas exploration and development .
We cannot expect other countries to expand their resource development to meet America ’s needs when our government limits development at home .
Finally , I would encourage careful evaluation of policies that can lead to unintended consequences and create inefficiencies in the gasoline supply system .
Today we have 17 “ boutique ” fuel requirements across the country , requiring us to blend unique gasoline products for different states and different localities .
More requirements on fuels are being added through renewable fuel mandates and proposed climate policies .
Comments
Whether or not Mr. Robertson and Chevron believe in peak oil , I think Mr. Robertson approaches are reasonable ones .
I do n't think that anyone would disagree with energy efficiency .
It is hard to see how alternative fuels will scale up in a short time frame , and nearly everyone can agree that having a having too many fuel types is a problem .
I personally think that drilling at home is a far better solution than pointing fingers at someone overseas , and accusing them of not pumping as much oil as they are able to .
I think blaming the National Oil Companies is all too easy a solution , and I am glad Chevron did not take this route .
I know many people are opposed to opening up the outer continental shelf to drilling .
With the long lead times involved , it will take many years - quite possibly ten - before any oil can be produced , and many years after that before all of the oil is removed .
As a comparison , it become economically attractive to drill in the North Sea in the mid-1970s , and we are still producing oil and gas there now .
I know a lot of people think we should save this oil and gas for future generations , but it seems to me that producing this oil very much depends on having the required infrastructure in place - things like roads , pipelines , the electrical grid , trained engineers , and companies set up to handle all of the logistics involved .
It seems to me that if we wait too long , we may never be able to produce this oil and natural gas .
I doubt that the quantity makes a difference from a climate change point of view .
If we wait too long , the quantities of oil and gas in pipelines will drop below the minimum operating level , or pipelines will fall into disrepair , so they can not be used .
Road surfaces may not be adequately maintained to bring necessary equipment to desired locations .
Equipment such as helicopters needed for production may no longer by available .
Trained personnel may be hard to find .
We need to be planning thirty or more years ahead , and things can change a lot in that time .
These top advisers signed off on how the CIA would interrogate top al Qaeda suspects – whether they would be slapped , pushed , deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning , called waterboarding , sources told ABC news .
The advisers were members of the National Security Council ’s Principals Committee , a select group of senior officials who met frequently to advise President Bush on issues of national security policy .
At the time , the Principals Committee included Vice President Dick Cheney , former National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell , as well as CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft .
As the national security adviser , Rice chaired the meetings , which took place in the White House Situation Room and were typically attended by most of the principals or their deputies .
The so - called Principals who participated in the meetings also approved the use of “ combined ” interrogation techniques – using different techniques during interrogations instead of using one method at a time – on terrorist suspects who proved difficult to break , sources said .
Contacted by ABC News , spokesmen for Tenet and Rumsfeld declined to comment about the interrogation program or their private discussions in Principals meetings .
The White House also declined comment on behalf of Rice and Cheney .
Ashcroft could not be reached .
ABC News ’ Diane Sawyer sat down with Powell this week for a previously scheduled interview and asked him about the ABC News report .
Powell said that he did n’t have “ sufficient memory recall ” about the meetings and that he had participated in “ many meetings on how to deal with detainees . ”
Powell said , “ I ’m not aware of anything that we discussed in any of those meetings that was not considered legal . ”
In his interview with ABC News , Bush said the ABC report about the Principals ’ involvement was not so “ startling . ”
The president had earlier confirmed the existence of the interrogation program run by the CIA in a speech in 2006 .
But before Wednesday ’s report , the extraordinary level of involvement by the most senior advisers in repeatedly approving specific interrogation plans – down to the number of times the CIA could use a certain tactic on a specific al Qaeda prisoner – had never been disclosed .
Critics at home and abroad have harshly criticized the interrogation program , which pushed the limits of international law and , they say , condoned torture .
Bush and his top aides have consistently defended the program .
They say it is legal and did not constitute torture .
In interview with ABC ’s Charles Gibson last year , Tenet said : “ It was authorized .
It was legal , according to the Attorney General of the United States . ”
The discussions and meetings occurred in an atmosphere of great concern that another terror attack on the nation was imminent .
Sources said the extraordinary involvement of the senior advisers in the grim details of exactly how individual interrogations would be conducted showed how seriously officials took the al Qaeda threat .
It started after the CIA captured top al Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah in spring 2002 in Faisalabad , Pakistan .
When his safe house was raided by Pakistani security forces along with FBI and CIA agents , Zubaydah was shot three times during the gun battle .
At a time when virtually all counterterrorist professionals viewed another attack as imminent – and with information on al Qaeda scarce – the detention of Zubaydah was seen as a potentially critical breakthrough .
Zubaydah was taken to the local hospital , where CIA agent John Kiriakou , who helped coordinate Zubaydah ’s capture , was ordered to remain at the wounded captive ’s side at all times .
“ I ripped up a sheet and tied him to the bed , ” Kiriakou said .
But after Zubaydah recovered from his wounds at a secret CIA prison in Thailand , he was uncooperative .
“ I told him I had heard he was being a jerk , ” Kiriakou recalled .
“ I said , ‘ These guys can make it easy on you or they can make it hard . ’
It was after that he became defiant . ”
The CIA wanted to use more aggressive – and physical – methods to get information .
The agency briefed high - level officials in the National Security Council ’s Principals Committee , led by then - National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and including then - Attorney General John Ashcroft , which then signed off on the plan , sources said .
It is unclear whether anyone on the committee objected to the CIA ’s plans for Zubaydah .
The CIA has confirmed Zubaydah was one of three al Qaeda suspects subjected to waterboarding .
After he was waterboarded , officials say Zubaydah gave up valuable information that led to the capture of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammad and fellow 9/11 plotter Ramzi bin al - Shibh .
Mohammad , who is known as KSM , was also subjected to waterboarding by the CIA .
In the interview with ABC News Friday , Bush defended the waterboarding technique used against KSM .
“ We had legal opinions that enabled us to do it , ” Bush said .
“ And no , I did n’t have any problem at all trying to find out what Khalid Sheikh Mohammed knew . ”
The president said , “ I think it ’s very important for the American people to understand who Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was .
He was the person who ordered the suicide attack – I mean , the 9/11 attacks . ”
At a hearing before a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay March 10 , 2007 , KSM , as he is known , said he broke under the harsh interrogation .
COURT : Were any statements you made as the result of any of the treatment that you received during that time frame from 2003 to 2006 ?
Did you make those statements because of the treatment you receive from these people ?
KSM : Statement for whom ??
COURT : To any of these interrogators .
?
KSM : CIA peoples .
Yes .
At the beginning , when they transferred me … ?
Lawyers in the Justice Department had written a classified memo , which was extensively reviewed , that gave formal legal authority to government interrogators to use the “ enhanced ” questioning tactics on suspected terrorist prisoners .
The August 2002 memo , signed by then head of the Office of Legal Counsel Jay Bybee , was referred to as the so - called “ Golden Shield ” for CIA agents , who worried they would be held liable if the harsh interrogations became public .
Old hands in the intelligence community remembered vividly how past covert operations , from the Vietnam War-era “ Phoenix Program ” of assassinations of Viet Cong to the Iran - Contra arms sales of the 1980s were painted as the work of a “ rogue agency ” out of control .
But even after the “ Golden Shield ” was in place , briefings and meetings in the White House to discuss individual interrogations continued , sources said .
Tenet , seeking to protect his agents , regularly sought confirmation from the NSC principals that specific interrogation plans were legal .
According to a former CIA official involved in the process , CIA headquarters would receive cables from operatives in the field asking for authorization for specific techniques .
Agents , worried about overstepping their boundaries , would await guidance in particularly complicated cases dealing with high - value detainees , two CIA sources said .
Highly placed sources said CIA directors Tenet and later Porter Goss along with agency lawyers briefed senior advisers , including Cheney , Rice , Rumsfeld and Powell , about detainees in CIA custody overseas .
“ It kept coming up .
CIA wanted us to sign off on each one every time , ” said one high - ranking official who asked not to be identified .
“ They ’d say , ‘ We ’ve got so and so .
This is the plan . ' ”
Sources said that at each discussion , all the Principals present approved .
“ These discussions were n’t adding value , ” a source said .
“ Once you make a policy decision to go beyond what you used to do and conclude it ’s legal , [ you should ] just tell them to implement it . ”
Ashcroft was troubled by the discussions .
He agreed with the general policy decision to allow aggressive tactics and had repeatedly advised that they were legal .
But he argued that senior White House advisers should not be involved in the grim details of interrogations , sources said .
According to a top official , Ashcroft asked aloud after one meeting : “ Why are we talking about this in the White House ?
History will not judge this kindly . ”
The Principals also approved interrogations that combined different methods , pushing the limits of international law and even the Justice Department ’s own legal approval in the 2002 memo , sources told ABC News .
At one meeting in the summer of 2003 – attended by Cheney , among others – Tenet made an elaborate presentation for approval to combine several different techniques during interrogations , instead of using one method at a time , according to a highly placed administration source .
A year later , amid the outcry over unrelated abuses of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib , the controversial 2002 legal memo , which gave formal legal authorization for the CIA interrogation program of the top al Qaeda suspects that was leaked to the press .
A new senior official in the Justice Department , Jack Goldsmith , withdrew the legal memo – the Golden Shield – that authorized the program .
But the CIA had captured a new al Qaeda suspect in Asia .
Sources said CIA officials that summer returned to the Principals Committee for approval to continue using certain “ enhanced interrogation techniques . ”
Rice , sources said , was decisive .
Despite growing policy concerns – shared by Powell – that the program was harming the image of the United States abroad , sources say she did not back down , telling the CIA : “ This is your baby .
Go do it . ”

The scene looks like true fascism out of Hitler 's playbook of the 1930s .
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday 26 September in London 's Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park against Britain 's restrictive and oppressive COVID measures .
In a brief 3 - minute speech , Dr. Heiko Schöning spoke Truth to Power , about the COVID - lie and what it did to humanity and to the global economy .
He spoke to a journalist when he was suddenly arrested by police , handcuffed , pushed into a police car , and driven to Wandsworth Custody Center , where he was detained for 22 hours , simply for telling the truth about COVID - 19 .
On 27 September Dr. Schöning was released and cheered by the public outside the police station .
He briefly spoke to the people who received him , saying the police confiscated his cell phone , his computer , and a book , called Corona False Alarm , by Dr. Karina Reiss and Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi , both renown German scientists .
Dr. Bhakdi is a microbiologist and epidemiologist for infectious diseases , and Dr. Reiss is a professor and researcher at the Christian - Albrechts - University in Kiel .
The book is already a bestseller in Germany and its English translation may follow a similar success path , worldwide .
When he spoke in front of the police station , Dr. Schöning called upon the people to stand up for their rights .
To fight on .
To resist .
He reminded people of huge peaceful anti-COVID measures and anti-oppression demonstrations that will take place on 10 October 2020 ( 10 - 10 - 20 ) in Berlin , where they expect hundreds of thousands of people , like was the case in the peaceful protests on 1 August and 29 August 2020 .
He invited all to come to Berlin and participate , mentioning also that Robert Kennedy Jr. was with him on stage on 29 August in Berlin .

SWITZERLAND
Almost simultaneously , in its last September session , the Swiss Parliament extended the COVID - 19 State of Emergency until 31 December 2021 , granting the Swiss Federal Council ( Executive ) extra-Constitutional Powers .
The date can of course be extended , should the Parliament decide so .
What is most striking , within that law , consisting of 21 Articles and countless sub-sections , is that the Federal Government is authorized to impose on the Swiss citizens the vaccine that modifies the human genome , i.e. the Moderna ( Bill Gates ) vaccine , of which already close to 5 million doses have been ordered , according to earlier Swiss news reports .
It could be applied under an accelerated approval procedure - whatever that means .
It is known that the vaccine has so far only been tested on 45 healthy volunteers , all of whom had devastating side effects that required hospitalization .
Another test - round with 600 healthy volunteers is foreseen to start shortly .
You should be aware that this vaccine changes your DNA forever .
If something goes wrong , it can not be " corrected " or healed .
It may create a permanent defect that might also be passed on to your children and children 's children .
Even if nothing goes " wrong " , you are no longer yourself , as your DNA has been changed permanently .
A people 's referendum against this law is being launched on 6 October 2020 .
Swiss citizens , and citizens of the world : Beware of the Moderna vaccine !

Recently , I learned you can add the sale of child brides in Afghanistan to the list of social ills caused by the Drug War .
A bumper crop of Afghan opium was produced in 2007 , which is expected to be repeated in 2008 .
Despite these record poppy crops , farmers are deeply in debt .
The average Afghan poppy grower ’s per capita income is about $ 300 , and farmers have to borrow money for seeds , fertilizer , food , and basic necessities from traffickers .
The farmers are unable to pay their debts when their crops are eradicated , or they are pressured by local governments and westerners to stop growing .
Westerners do n’t keep promises to provide free seeds for substitute crops , and creditors demand child wives in payment for debts .
The growers ’ daughters are called “ opium flowers “ , and moneylenders seek them out in case of crop failure or family emergency .
It is a traditional Afghan custom for a family to pay off a debt by marrying a daughter to a relative of the creditor .
Now the practice is being used to pay off debts to drug traffickers .
Mr Isamuddin , 68 , stopped growing poppies because of a government crack down ; further up the valley helicopters sprayed the poppy fields with insecticide .
He explained , “ ” If people here cannot earn enough to feed their families , they will start growing opium again . ”
Even though production of Afghan opium is high , world demand has not increased largely .
Afghanistan is accused of stockpiling opium , and the US supports aerial spraying programs for eradication .
Afghan and British officials oppose aerial spraying , as it would increase support for the Taliban for fear the herbicide would poison growers and their families .
The Bush administration supports expansion of eradication programs , whereas Afghanistan wants to emphasize long - term crop substitution for opium poppy plants .
One goal of the drug war is increase prices in order to deter usage , only the ones profiting from such prohibition are the drug traffickers .
The farmers have tried other crops , such as wheat , but poppies bring in 10 times the amount and are hardier than grains .
It is the only reliable cash crop they know .
Opium growers ask for advances on their crops from the drug traffickers , which they are then unable to pay .
Sayed Shah was forced to pay his debt to a trafficker with the marriage of his 9 - year - old daughter .
According to Newsweek :
Shah borrowed $ 2,000 from a local trafficker , promising to repay the loan with 24 kilos of opium at harvest time .
Late last spring , just before harvest , a government crop-eradication team appeared at the family ’s little plot of land in Laghman province and destroyed Shah ’s entire two and a half acres of poppies …
“ I never imagined I ’d have to pay for growing opium by giving up my daughter , ” says Shah …
” It ’s my fate , ” the child says .
Poppy eradication causes many Afghan daughters to be turned into child brides .
Whether a farmer loses his crop to Drug War eradication or his substitute wheat crop fails , US policies should not be causing such practices to continue in Central Asia .
“ Until the end of my life I will feel shame because of what I did to my daughter , ” said a former poppy grower .
“ I still ca n’t look her in the eye . ”

When looking at next - generation renewable technologies , you ’ll hear a lot of claims about how cheaply they can create electricity .
Usually the figures hover around 10 cents per kilowatt - hour , which is about low enough to compete with the mix of coal , oil and nuclear power most utilities use .
No such small ambitions , for a new startup called Sunrgi , which is unveiling its technology today at the annual National Energy Marketers Association convention .
Sunrgi claims it can provide power for as little as half the above figure , at about 5 - 7 cents per kWh .
That ’s low enough to undercut damn near everything , with the possible exception of cheap , dirty coal — for which prices have been going up .
Conventional solar cells cost upwards of 20 cents per kWh .
Sunrgi uses a concentrating solar power design , which generally means you start off with a tiny , highly efficient solar panel and focus in the sun ’s rays on it with mirrors and lenses .
A variety of companies already do this , including SolFocus , which has raised heaps of cash and even sparked a small bidding war toward commercializing the concept .
It ’s debatable whether concentrated solar power can compete , long - term , with regular solar panels , but Sunrgi says it has two tricks to magnify CSP ’s advantage .
The first is a special , lens - only concentrating design with built - in solar trackers , which can focus over 1,500 “ suns ” on a single point ( by comparison , one of the previous biggest claims for concentration levels was Greenvolts ’ 625 suns ) .
For an idea of how this might work , try to think of the most ingenious way possible to torch ants with magnifying glasses .
This scheme causes a problem , namely heating the solar cell that ’s supposed to be generating electricity to over 1,600 degrees Celsius ( or over 3,000 Fahrenheit ) .
That ’s where the second part of Sunrgi ’s technology comes in , with a special cooling design , combining active and passive measures , that keeps the cell at around 30 - 40 degrees C ( 86 -104 F ) .
Cooling is important above a certain level to avoid actually burning the solar cell , and below that point to reduce the failure rate .
This ties in heavily to the cost equation , co-founder Dr. KRS Murthy told me in an interview — where other companies will have to pay heavy maintenance and replacement costs , Sunrgi ’s well - chilled cells will last much longer , he said .
But beyond the details I ’ve laid out , Sunrgi is n’t saying a great deal .
The members of the management team who joined me on a call declined to give any further details of exactly how they cool the solar cells .
While they did suggest a size for their utility - scale generation modules — 14 inches square , with a solar cell of less than a centimeter square in the center — they are still applying for patents , and so do n’t want to describe the units further ( although you can get an idea from the pictures at right and below ) .
What they did say is that they ’re still conducting field testing on the units , continuing to optimize the basic design , and working on models for different markets ( aside from utility generation , they ’re looking at smaller commercial and industrial applications ) .
That said , perhaps the second most surprising assertion Sunrgi has to make , after the price , is that they ’ll be manufacturing within 12 - 15 months .
If Sunrgi can pull it off , that would be one of the faster production turnarounds a new energy generation technology has yet seen .
On the other hand , if the price claims can be proven on a large scale , there will be plenty of investment dollars lining up to grease the industrial gears .
Speaking of funding , that ’s the one missing part in the company ’s claims .
While the founders and executives have solid backgrounds , they have n’t yet announced where their backing is coming from .
I ’m told that several top VC firms are in talks with the company , though , as well as a “ major strategic partner ” , with announcements due in a week or two — so stay tuned for more .

An article about the Prophet Muhammad in the English - language Wikipedia has become the subject of an online protest in the last few weeks because of its representations of Muhammad , taken from medieval manuscripts .
In addition to numerous e-mail messages sent to Wikipedia.org , an online petition cites a prohibition in Islam on images of people .
The petition has more than 80,000 “ signatures , ” though many who submitted them to ThePetitionSite.com , remained anonymous .
“ We have been noticing a lot more similar sounding , similar looking e-mails beginning mid-January , ” said Jay Walsh , a spokesman for the Wikimedia Foundation in San Francisco , which administers the various online encyclopedias in more than 250 languages .

In a commentary also published online , Nancy Knowlton and Jeremy B. C. Jackson , coral experts at Scripps and the Smithsonian Institution , said the new work was notable because it produced data at sites “ across a full spectrum of human impacts . ”
Without this kind of data , they write , studying coral reefs is like trying to discern the ecological structure of the Amazon rain forest by looking at the cattle ranches and soybean fields that have replaced much of it .

Actually , they write , it is even worse .
Scientists can still visit vast areas of intact rain forest and have decades of data from earlier researchers .
“ The situation is very different for the oceans , ” Dr. Knowlton and Dr. Jackson wrote , because degradation of ocean ecosystems is so pervasive , and underwater observation is relatively recent .
As a result , they said , scientists disagree over the relative importance for coral of local factors like overfishing and pollution as against global problems like climate change and the acidification of oceans it causes .
The Line Islands work will not settle those arguments .
But the scientists noted great differences in the fish communities at inhabited and uninhabited reefs , which they attributed to fishing pressure on shark , grouper , snapper and other large predators , said Enric Sala , an ecologist formerly at Scripps and now at the National Council for Scientific Research in Spain .
Kingman is unpopulated  in fact , none of it is permanently above water .
Palmyra was dredged extensively in the 1940s , the researchers said , and fishing has occurred there , but today both atolls are protected by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Pacific / Remote Islands National Wildlife Refuge .
A camp at Palmyra , with a capacity of 20 , has its own sewage treatment center .
Tabuaeran , with a growing population estimated in 2005 at 2,500 , and Kiritimati , with 5,100 people and growing even faster , are part of the Republic of Kiribati .
People there subsist on fishing and have no sewage treatment facilities .
Barely 30 km from Mayawati's Lucknow , 300 school students in Bibipur village are refusing to eat their midday meal because the cook is a Dalit woman .
For the last four days , district administration and education officials have been visiting the Bibipur Primary School and the Junior High School to persuade the students to eat , but to no avail .
Every day , uneaten meals are being thrown away .
On Friday , The Indian Express found barely a hundred students eating the meal , tehri , rice and vegetables cooked together .
The rest ate food brought from home , a practice that started on December 10 , the day the Dalit woman , Phool Kumari Rawat , started cooking .
Senior students who are boycotting the food say Phool Kumari 's cooking is unhygienic .
Kaushal Srivastava , Block Resource Centre in - charge , who was present on Friday , told the students that there was nothing wrong with the food .
He even ate it in front of them to allay their apprehensions .
But the students refused to budge .
Younger students are more direct , readily admitting that it was Phool Kumari 's caste that was the problem .
" I will not eat anything cooked by that lady .
I have heard my family members say that she is from some low caste .
So I bring my own lunch box , " said Shivani Singh Chauhan , a student of Class IV .
Ateet Kumar , student of Class V , said the school was in a Thakur area and they refuse to eat whatever she cooks .
" Only children from Phool Kumari 's area are eating , " he said .
Both administration officials and the teachers agree that the students are being instigated .
Lucknow District Magistrate Chandra

I have asked my officers to find out the person and that person will be punished . "

Saudi building boom looks past petroleum Awash in cash from higher oil prices , kingdom diversifying
The alarm bell sounded the end of the lunch break here one November afternoon , and suddenly thousands of workers - on foot , on bicycles and in buses - streamed in , seemingly from out of nowhere , and jolted this huge construction site to life .
Amid a forest of cranes , towers and beams rising from the desert , more than 38,000 workers from China , India , Turkey and beyond have been toiling for two years in unforgiving conditions - often in temperatures exceeding 100 degrees - to complete one of the world 's largest petrochemical plants in record time .
By the end of the year , this huge city of steel at the edge of the Red Sea will take its place as a cog of globalization :
Plastics produced here will be used to make televisions in Japan , cell phones in China and thousands of other products to be sold in the United States and Europe .
Construction costs at the plant , which spreads over 8 square miles , have doubled to $ 10 billion because of shortages in materials and labor .
The amount of steel being used is 10 times the weight of the Eiffel Tower .
" I 've worked on many big things in my life , but I 've never worked on anything this big , " an American project manager said during a bus tour of the project , called Petro Rabigh , a joint venture of the state - run oil company Saudi Aramco and Sumitomo Chemical of Japan .
Size is n't the only consideration .
The project is Saudi Arabia 's boldest bet yet that this oil - rich kingdom can transform itself into an industrial powerhouse .
The plant is part of a $ 500 billion investment program to build new cities , create millions of jobs and diversify the economy away from petroleum exports over the next two decades .
" The Saudi economy was in idle mode for 20 years , " said John Sfakianakis , the chief economist at SABB , formerly known as the Saudi British Bank , who is in Riyadh , the Saudi capital .
" Today , the feeling here is , ' We 've won the lottery ; let 's not waste it . ' "
The kingdom's lofty economic goals would have been unthinkable without the jump in energy prices that has filled the coffers of oil producers .
Oil prices have quadrupled since 2002 and reached $ 100 a barrel in New York this month .
Persian Gulf countries earned $ 1.5 trillion in oil revenue from 2002 to 2006 , twice as much as in the previous five - year period , according to the Institute of International Finance , a global association of banks that is based in Washington .
As the top exporter , Saudi Arabia has been the main beneficiary .
Despite all the recent headlines about Middle East investors bailing out troubled American banks like Citigroup , a growing share of today 's petrodollars are staying at home to finance mega-projects like Petro Rabigh , analysts say .
That money is financing the biggest economic boom in a generation , helping to build not only the high - rises of Dubai , where the world 's tallest tower is going up , but also telecommunications networks , roads and universities throughout the Middle East .
Abu Dhabi is planning to spend close to $ 1 billion for a new museum with the help of the Louvre , in Paris .
Dubai 's latest grandiose idea is to build a small - scale replica of the French city of Lyon , complete with housing , a museum , a culinary school and a soccer club .
In Saudi Arabia , Riyadh looks like a boomtown : Sprawling over 40 miles , it is teeming with shopping malls , electronics stores and luxury boutiques .
But while times are good today , many Saudis realize that their country is locked in a race against time to create industries that produce more than just oil in order to keep a young and growing population employed .
The kingdom , which has a population of 24.5 million , including nearly 7 million foreigners , has what one analyst called a " human time bomb . "
About 40 percent of Saudis are under 15 , and because the country has one of the world 's highest birthrates , the population is expected to reach nearly 40 million by 2025 .
" It has been a social , and therefore a political , imperative of the Saudi government to develop the economy and to create employment opportunities , " said Timothy S. Gray , the chief executive of HSBC Saudi Arabia .
That could well mean that higher oil prices are here to stay .
One paradox of modern - day Saudi Arabia is that while it seeks to reduce the importance of petroleum to its economy , it needs those exports more than ever .
To be sure , the region 's economies are too small to absorb all the oil riches on their own .
Too much money is chasing too few assets , analysts say , forcing oil producers to invest some of their revenue abroad and diversify their holdings , either through opaque state - owned investment funds or through direct private investments .
Last year , for example , a fund controlled by the government of Abu Dhabi bought a stake in Citigroup for $ 7.5 billion , while another run by Dubai 's ruler bought a large share in Sony .
Sabic , a major Saudi petrochemical company , bought the plastics division of General Electric for $ 11.6 billion , and the Kuwait Petroleum Corp. bought half of Dow Chemical 's commodity - plastics unit for $ 9.5 billion .
In recent weeks , other big banks plagued by losses from the mortgage crisis , like Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley , have raised tens of billions of dollars from a variety of Middle Eastern and Asian funds , including ones from Kuwait or Saudi Arabia .
According to data compiled by Bloomberg News , overseas investments by Persian Gulf countries reached a record $ 75 billion in 2007 .
Arms deals , a timeworn way of recycling petrodollars , remain popular in the region ; the United States is pushing for a $ 20 billion weapons sale to Saudi Arabia , for example .
But while oil - rich states are still buying American Treasury bonds or military hardware from the West , analysts say the more significant trend is for a growing share of their investments to be pumped into local projects .
" The vision is to turn the kingdom into a major industrial power by 2020 , " said Jean - Francois Seznec , a professor at Georgetown University who is a specialist in industrial policies in the Persian Gulf .
" A billion dollars here and a billion there , and soon you 're talking about real money . "
Projects like Petro Rabigh , Seznec said , will allow Saudi Arabia to become one of the top three chemical producers in the world within a few years .
Unlike Kuwait or Abu Dhabi , Saudi Arabia does not have a sovereign fund responsible for investing the country 's petroleum riches .
Ali Al - Naimi , the kingdom's energy minister and one of the grand architects of Saudi industrial policy , summed up the country 's goals at the dedication ceremony for Petro Rabigh in 2006 .
" I would like to highlight the fact that the Petro Rabigh project is part of a bigger picture , " Naimi said at the time .
" This strategy includes expanding the base of the Saudi economy , diversifying national income sources , attracting international investments and reaping the direct and indirect benefits that these types of projects will accrue to the Saudi citizen . "
The trend to modernize and develop the economy is not entirely new , of course .
Saudi Arabia has been trying to diversify itself for over two decades .
It famously tried to make the desert bloom in the 1970s and ' 80s by investing heavily in water desalinization plants and growing crops .
But a long period of low oil prices , from the mid-1980s through the 1990s , stalled much of its effort .
The government still relies on petroleum exports for 90 percent of its revenue ; oil sales account for half of the country 's gross domestic product .
The current level of oil prices has given the country 's industrialization strategy a new spring , allowing the government to improve its finances while investing in large infrastructure projects .
The Saudi GDP has doubled in the last five years .
Not counting oil , economic growth has been 4 to 6 percent a year since 2002 .
Oil has not been the only engine of growth .
The country 's private sector has also thrived and now accounts for 45 percent of the economy , compared with just 20 percent about 20 years ago .
Since the 1990s , the share of private Saudi money invested at home has doubled , and now represents about 20 percent of total holdings , according to SABB .
" There is a lot of money looking for investment opportunities , " said Gray at HSBC .
The financial turnaround has been spectacular .
In 1999 , the Saudi government 's debt amounted to 120 percent of GDP .
That number has dropped to less than 20 percent as the government paid back its obligations and put its finances in order .
Last year , the government recorded a budget surplus of $ 48 billion , five times the surplus of 2003 .
This year , it has built its biggest budget to date around a conservative estimate of oil prices of $ 45 a barrel ; that will almost certainly yield a substantial surplus at the end of the year .
All of that is a far cry from the 1990s , when oil averaged $ 20 a barrel , thanks mostly to Saudi concerns at the time to keep oil prices low .
One of the most noticeable illustrations of the industrialization push is a plan championed by King Abdullah , the 83 - year - old Saudi monarch , to create six cities throughout the country - including the King Abdullah Economic City on the western coast , near the city of Rabigh ; the Knowledge Economic City , near Medina ; and the Prince Abdulaziz bin Mousaed Economic City , in the north .
The intent is to create industrial centers that double as housing and commercial hubs for the country 's young and growing population .
The Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority , a government agency , expects these cities to add $ 150 billion to the country 's GDP by 2020 , create 1 million jobs and be home to as many as 5 million people .
Drawings of these new towns depict a cross of the futuristic " Blade Runner " and traditional Arabic design .
But the new cities are also expected to become new industrial centers that focus on four main sectors : petrochemicals , aluminum , steel and fertilizers .
According to SABB , these cities together will have four times the geographical area of Hong Kong , three times the population of Dubai , and an economic output equal to Singapore's .
Other plans include building four refineries , two petrochemical plants and a modern graduate - level university with an endowment of $ 10 billion .
The frenzied growth of the economy has had some serious downsides .
Inflation has been rampant in the last year ; food prices and rents have risen sharply .
Traffic jams in Riyadh and other Saudi cities have become a constant affliction , while real estate values have soared and the construction sector is strained by a lack of workers .
The stock market , meanwhile , has yet to recover from its collapse two years ago .
From 2000 to early 2006 , the local Tadawul stock index surged from 2,000 points to a peak of 19,870 , a return of almost 900 percent .
But the overvalued market went into a panicky free fall that caused it to lose two - thirds of its value in a matter of months .
After being flat for most of 2007 , the market has recovered in the last quarter , gaining more than 40 percent .
Still , its value is only about half that of its peak two years ago .
One reason for the partial rebound was anticipation of the sale of shares in Petro Rabigh earlier this month .
For the first time , Saudi investors had a chance to buy a major asset linked to Aramco .
The initial public offering , for 25 percent of Petro Rabigh , raised $ 1.23 billion and was the largest stock sale in Saudi history .
The stock is expected to begin trading at the end of the month .
The project itself is still about a year away from completion .
Once in operation , it will produce 2.4 million tons of plastics a year .
This venture , along with dozens of other megaprojects , will firmly anchor Saudi Arabia as one of the world 's top suppliers of chemical products as well as oil .
" Saudi Aramco has a vision of itself as Exxon Mobil , " Seznec of Georgetown said , " except much bigger . "

A new report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that the common value of > 98 % similarity of DNA between chimp and humans is incorrect .
A new report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that the common value of > 98 % similarity of DNA between chimp and humans is incorrect .
1 Roy Britten , author of the study , puts the figure at about 95 % when insertions and deletions are included .
Importantly , there is much more to these studies than people realize .
The >98.5 % similarity has been misleading because it depends on what is being compared .
There are a number of significant differences that are difficult to quantify .
A review by Gagneux and Varki2 described a list of genetic differences between humans and the great apes .
The differences include ‘ cytogenetic differences , differences in the type and number of repetitive genomic DNA and transposable elements , abundance and distribution of endogenous retroviruses , the presence and extent of allelic polymorphisms , specific gene inactivation events , gene sequence differences , gene duplications , single nucleotide polymorphisms , gene expression differences , and messenger RNA splicing variations . ’3
Specific examples of these differences include :
Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes while chimpanzees have 24 .
Evolutionary scientists believe that one of the human chromosomes has been formed through the fusion of two small chromosomes in the chimp instead of an intrinsic difference resulting from a separate creation .
At the end of each chromosome is a string of repeating DNA sequences called a telomere .
Chimpanzees and other apes have about 23 kilobases ( a kilobase is 1,000 base pairs of DNA ) of repeats .
Humans are unique among primates with much shorter telomeres only 10 kilobases long .
4
While 18 pairs of chromosomes are ‘ virtually identical ’ , chromosomes 4 , 9 and 12 show evidence of being ‘ remodeled . ’5
In other words , the genes and markers on these chromosomes are not in the same order in the human and chimpanzee .
Instead of ‘ being remodeled ’ as the evolutionists suggest , these could , logically , also be intrinsic differences because of a separate creation .
The Y chromosome in particular is of a different size and has many markers that do not line up between the human and chimpanzee .
6
Scientists have prepared a human - chimpanzee comparative clone map of chromosome 21 in particular .
They observed ‘ large , non-random regions of difference between the two genomes . ’
They found a number of regions that ‘ might correspond to insertions that are specific to the human lineage . ’7
These types of differences are not generally included in calculations of percent DNA similarity .
In one of the most extensive studies comparing human and chimp DNA, 8 the researchers compared > 19.8 million bases .
While this sounds like a lot , it still represents slightly less than 1 % of the genome .
They calculated a mean identity of 98.77 % or 1.23 % differences .
However , this , like other studies only considered substitutions and did not take insertions or deletions into account as the new study by Britten did .
A nucleotide substitution is a mutation where one base ( A , G , C , or T ) is replaced with another .
An insertion or deletion ( indel ) is found where there are nucleotides missing when two sequences are compared .
A G T C G T A C C | | | | | | | | A G T C A T A C C A G T C G T A C C | | | | | | | | A G T C T A C C
The Britten9 study looked at 779 kilobase pairs to carefully examine differences between chimpanzees and humans .
He found that 1.4 % of the bases had been substituted , which was in agreement with previous studies ( 98.6 % similarity ) .
However , he found a much larger number of indels .
Most of these were only 1 to 4 nucleotides in length , although there were a few that were > 1000 base pairs long .
Surprisingly , the indels added an additional 3.4 % of base pairs that were different .
While previous studies have focused on base substitutions , they have missed perhaps the greatest contribution to the genetic differences between chimps and humans .
Missing nucleotides from one or the other appear to account for more than twice the number of substituted nucleotides .
Although the number of substitutions is about ten times higher than the number of indels , the number of nucleotides involved in indels is greater .
These indels were reported to be equally represented in the chimp and human sequences .
Therefore , the insertions or deletions were not occurring only in the chimp or only in the human and could also be interpreted as intrinsic differences .
Will evolution be called into question now that the similarity of chimpanzee and human DNA has been reduced from > 98.5 % to ~95 % ?
Probably not .
Regardless of whether the similarity was reduced even below 90 % , evolutionists would still believe that humans and apes shared a common ancestor .
Moreover , using percentages hides an important fact .
If 5 % of the DNA is different , this amounts to 150,000,000 DNA base pairs that are different between them !
A number of studies have demonstrated a remarkable similarity in the nuclear DNA and mtDNA among modern humans .
In fact , the DNA sequences for all people are so similar that scientists generally conclude that there is a ‘ recent single origin for modern humans , with general replacement of archaic populations .
’10 To be fair , the estimates for a date of a ‘ most recent common ancestor ’ ( MRCA ) by evolutionists has this ‘ recent single origin ’ about 100,000 - 200,000 years ago , which is not recent by creationist standards .
These estimates have been based on comparisons with chimpanzees and the assumption of a chimp / human common ancestor approximately 5 million years ago .
In contrast , studies that have used pedigrees or generational mtDNA comparisons 11,12,13have yielded a much more recent MRCA — even 6,500 years !14
Research on observable generational mutation events leads to a more recent common ancestor for humans than phylogenetic estimates that assume a relationship with chimpanzees .
Mutational hotspots are believed to account for this difference .
15 However , in both cases , they are relying on uniformitarian principles — that rates measured in the present can be used to extrapolate the timing of events in the distant past .
The above examples demonstrate that the conclusions of scientific investigations can be different depending on how the study is done .
Humans and chimps can have 95 % or > 98.5 % similar DNA depending on which nucleotides are counted and which are excluded .
Modern humans can have a single recent ancestor < 10,000 or 100,000 - 200,000 years ago depending on whether a relationship with chimpanzees is assumed and which types of mutations are considered .
Wikileaks fights on after court 's shutdown attempt Nick Juliano

It may not be at Wikileaks.org anymore , but the whistle - blowing Web site that prides itself in exposing secrets is still publishing and vows to fight a court 's attempt to shut it down .
While Wikileaks will return to court Feb. 29 , the ruling sets a " disturbing precedent " that could make it easier for judges or lawmakers to censor online content , says Steve Aftergood , who researches government secrecy , told RAW STORY .
" It will make it easier for a court to do the same thing in the future and that 's regrettable , " said Aftergood , head of the Federation of American Scientists ' Project on Government Secrecy .
Aftergood runs a blog for the organization , where he frequently posts internal government documents .
A federal judge in California ordered Dynadot , which hosted the wikileaks.org domain name , to shut down access to the Web address .
But Aftergood notes Wikileaks content can still be accessed through its Internet Protocol address , http://88.80.13.160/wiki/Wikileaks.
" The domain [ Wikileaks.org ] no longer points to where the files are still hosted on the Web , but they are still on the Web , " Aftergood says .
" Their strategy is redundancy .
If one site is blocked another pops up to circumvent the barrier , and it's been a fairly successful strategy up to this point . "
The court case involves a lawsuit from a Swiss banking group based in the Caymen Islands .
Documents posted to Wikileaks implicated the bank , Julius Baer , in a money laundering scheme .
" Wiki leaks is not defying the government of China or Iran , they are allegedly violating banking secrecy laws , which is to my mind a more questionable kind of action , " Aftergood said .
He has more thoughts on his blog .
" It is too early to say who has won or lost more in this confrontation .
Wikileaks has demonstrated the willingness and the ability to sustain a robust publication capability in defiance of legal authority , though it may have lost its domain name for the foreseeable future , " he writes .
" Bank Julius Baer , whom most people would have never heard of , will now be permanently linked in many minds with vague allegations of financial misconduct . "
In the US , however , Zander sought and found a very different clientele .
His award at the 1876 Centennial and International Exposition in Philadelphia for best mechanical design provided a launching pad for marketing Zander machines as upscale devices for the rising American business class .
His machines offered , Zander explained to an American audience , “ a preventative against the evils engendered by a sedentary life and the seclusion of the office . ”
In fact , Zander claimed , there was no treatment quite so appropriate for these emerging white - collar men ( and their wives ) as his mechanized system .
While doctors ’ pills and potions might be easier to procure and quicker to ingest , the “ increased well - being and capacity for work ” gained by those who used his machines , he argued , was “ rich compensation for the time bestowed on them . ”
By the early twentieth century , extensive collections of Zander machines could be found at elite health spas such as Homestead in Hot Springs , Arkansas , and at private institutes such as the one Zander set up near Central Park in New York .
Access to these health machines was a mark of status at the turn of the century .
Health spas and gymnasia were not subsidized by the state as they were in Sweden , and the American working class would not have been able to afford the fees required to receive Zander treatments .
Nor were the working class thought to need such treatments ; their “ hearty ” bodies were not yet impaired by the sedentary habits of affluent modern life .
In mechanized workouts , white - collar Americans pumped up their own superiority .
By declaring that “ fitness ” equaled a perfectly balanced physique , rather than the ability to perform actual physical tasks , body power was shifted from laborers to loungers .
If to our twenty - first - century eye , Zander ’s horse rider hardly looks “ fit , ” one must see her in context .
Not only is she riding a horse ( itself a mark of status ) , but one whose rhythms had been perfected by science .
Her mechanical horse , hooked up to an engine , delivered a precise set of trots per second and provided her with a workout that had no equal .
The same applies to the suited gentleman receiving his requisite abdominal punches .
Once “ health ” was separated from tasks and turned into “ tone , ” machines became a way for those with means to define their bodies as superior .
In this respect , Zander ’s machines do resemble our contemporary Stairmasters , Cybexes , and Pilates devices .
Consider how much you pay , if you do pay , to go to the gym .
Consider that complicated regimen that the instructor puts you on at your first “ complimentary ” consultation : fifteen reps on the thigh extender , thirteen on the bicep pulleys , two sets of ten on the abdominal flexers .
Consider the ways in which gyms , especially elite gyms , still function as pick - up joints for the affluent and beautiful .
Of course , gyms are far more available — and affordable — than they were in Zander ’s day .
Even so , the time to spend working on each muscle and the ability to separate muscular labor from actual physical work continues to bestow a particular superior status on those who sculpt at the gym over those who are merely strong .
We are , in other words , still “ suiting up ” by going to the gym .

A bit over a week ago we moved a slightly modified version of our project skeleton into the open source mochiweb repository , which gets you a start shell script , a skeleton application following ( most of ) the OTP paradigms , a Makefile , and a web server that serves static files out of priv / www .
The first thing you have to do is make sure mochiweb is built :
$ cd ~/ src/ mochiweb $ make ( cd src ; make ) make [ 1 ] : Nothing to be done for `all ' .
After that you just run ./scripts/new_mochiweb.erl with the project name and destination ( you can put a symlink of that script on your PATH somewhere ) .
$ ./scripts/new_mochiweb.erl mochidemo ~/src ...
Starting it is easy , just build with make and then run start.sh or start - dev.sh from ~/ src/ mochidemo .
The only difference between the two at the moment is that start - dev.sh will poll for changes in ebin files and purge them automatically when they 're updated .
The default port is 8000 listening on all IPs and it's configured in src/ PROJECT_sup.erl .

Scientists develop new sensors that will use sensory capabilities of biological cells to sense the danger .
The study conducted at University of Maryland 's A. James Clark School of Engineering is aimed at creating new technology that will incorporate biological cells on a microchip .
The small sensors will be only a few millimeters in size , being faster and more precise than today 's biochemical detectors .
Researchers are working to integrate living cells into tiny chips that will be able to alert about chemical and biological pathogens .
This will give the possibility to detect explosive materials , spoiled food and polluted water .
Depending on the task , the researchers can incorporate different types of cells on the microchips .
For example , they will use olfactory cells and sensing circuit in order to spot an explosive device .
Cells , exposed to harmful agents will show stress or die and sensing circuits will deliver an alert about the presence of the danger .
The cell - based sensors will have applications not only in national security systems , but also making great advancements in basic science .
In pharmaceutical industry , this gives an opportunity for testing new drugs much faster than animal and human trials .
It may also help in detecting harmful bacteria in food , to monitor water quality or to test the level of air pollution .
The study won the University of Maryland 's 2004 Invention of the Year Award in the physical science .

Enlarge By Chris Greenberg , AP Justice Antonin Scalia has been criticized for stating his opinions on controversial issues that could come before the court .
Enlarge By Tim Dillon , USA TODAY Supreme Court Justices : ( back row from left ) Stephen Breyer , Clarence Thomas , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Samuel Alito , ( front row from left ) Anthony Kennedy , John Paul Stevens , Chief Justice John Roberts , Antonin Scalia and David Souter .
WASHINGTON  Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia 's declaration this week that torture may be justified in some situations is the latest in a pattern of blunt assertions that is rare for a sitting justice .
His off - the - bench actions have , on a few occasions , led to requests that he bow out of particular pending cases .
Scalia 's defense of torture in some instances in a BBC interview that aired Tuesday does not coincide with a pending case at the court .
Still , it comes as the nation is focused on " waterboarding " and other aggressive interrogations .
CIA Director Michael Hayden told Congress that the simulated drowning technique was used on three suspects captured in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks .
One , Khalid Sheik Mohammed , was among the six detainees charged Monday with plotting the attacks .
On Wednesday , the Senate joined the House in voting to ban the CIA from using waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods .
" It 's extremely unusual for a justice to be so opinionated about a controversy that may well come before the court , " says Northwestern University law professor Steven Lubet , who teaches legal ethics .
In an interview with BBC Radio 4 , Scalia said torture might be permissible to gain information about an imminent threat such as a bomb .
He did not address waterboarding but spoke generally of torture .
" It would be absurd to say that you … could n't do that , " Scalia said .
" Once you acknowledge that , we 're into a different game .
How close does the threat have to be ?
How severe can the infliction of pain be ?
I do n't think these are easy questions at all , in either direction .
" But I certainly know you can't come in smugly and with great self - satisfaction and say , ' Oh , it 's torture , and therefore it 's no good . '
You would not apply that in some real - life situations . "
Scalia , 71 , said the Constitution 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment " is referring to punishment for crime , " not actions in the course of interrogations .
The comments of the 22 - year Supreme Court veteran recalled his remarks at an international judicial conference in Canada last year while discussing the TV character Jack Bauer .
Scalia reportedly defended the fictional federal agent in 24 , who often tortures terrorist suspects to save lives .
A year earlier , at the University of Freiburg in Switzerland , Scalia expressed skepticism about the rights of Guantanamo detainees .
That prompted five retired U.S. military officers who had entered a high - court case on the side of detainee Salim Ahmed Hamdan to seek Scalia 's recusal .
Scalia declined .
Washington , D.C. , lawyer David Remes , who represented the retired generals and admirals , criticized Scalia 's new remarks .
" He was brushing aside principles of international and domestic law that have long governed the treatment of captives , " Remes said .
" He was treating difficult issues as easy .
This is disturbing . "
Scalia recused himself from a 2004 dispute over the Pledge of Allegiance after criticizing a lower court ruling against inclusion of " under God " in the Pledge .
He declined , however , a request to drop out of a 2004 case involving Vice President Dick Cheney , with whom Scalia had gone hunting .
Scalia called his decision to stick with the case , despite public criticism , " the proudest thing " he had done as a justice .

PA poll : ' Bitter ' flap has n't changed Obama 's numbers Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday April 15 , 2008

Print This Email This Barack Obama 's off - the - cuff comment about small - town Pennsylvanians being " bitter " over their low status on the economic totem poll does n't seem to have lowered his standing in the state , according to a poll conducted since the comment was reported .
The latest Quinnipiac Poll of likely Pennsylvania primary voters shows Hillary Clinton maintaining her lead in the state .
The 50 - to - 44 percent edge Clinton holds in the poll is unchanged from its last survey a week ago .
The poll is significant because about half of the survey was conducted after Clinton and Republican nominee John McCain harshly criticized Obama over his comments at a San Francisco fundraiser that were reported last Friday .
The Quinnipiac survey was conducted April 9 - 13 , and the pollster 's noted " there was no noticeable " change in the in results after Obama 's comments were reported .
Gallup 's national daily tracking poll also shows Obama 's standing unaffected by the flap over his comments .
He maintains a 10 - point lead in the national survey , Gallup 's first since the ' bitter ' remark was reported .
While Clinton 's lead is down from the double - digit leads she held in the Keystone State as of a few weeks ago , the poll seems to show she 's managed to staunch the flow of voters into the Obama camp .
" She seems to have halted the erosion of whites and white women in particular from her campaign , " Clay F. Richards , assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute , said in a press release .
" She even gained back some ground in the Philadelphia suburbs - the area where elections are won and lost in the Keystone State .
She now trails Obama by just two points in this critical area , while she was 11 points behind a week ago . "
The poll also showed a quarter of Clinton voters would switch to McCain in the fall if Obama were to get the nomination , while about a fifth of Obama supporters would bolt to the GOP rather than support Clinton .
The poll shows that 55 percent of Pennsylvania Democratic voters -- including one in three Clinton supporters -- believe Obama will win .
" Two big questions are whether the Clinton forces can keep from getting discouraged by all the talk she can't win the nomination even if she wins Pennsylvania , " Richards said , " and whether enthusiasm for Obama will translate into a record turnout of blacks and young first - time voters that would deny Clinton the victory she needs to stay alive .

Another Clinton loan ?
I asked Clinton campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe just now whether Clinton had given or loaned her campaign more money in the run-up to North Carolina and Indiana .
" Might be .
Might not be , " McAuliffe said , adding that the campaign would release more fundraising details tomorrow .
In the past , Clinton aides have denied a second Clinton loan , but McAuliffe said tonight his policy is not to talk about fundraising details .
State troopers wrote more than 4,000 tickets in Jefferson and Cullman counties this weekend during two separate crackdowns on traffic violations , according to a trooper spokesman .
In Cullman County , where troopers embarked on a '' Take Back Our Highways : 50/4 '' campaign -- named because approximately 50 additional troopers hit the streets for four days -- 3,534 tickets were written , according to Trooper Dave Richards .
Along Interstate 459 in Jefferson County , an increased presence by troopers resulted in approximately 560 tickets being issued over the weekend , Richards said .
That effort was not part of the " Take Back Our Highways " campaign , Richards said .
The tickets in Cullman County included 18 citations for driving under the influence , 1,254 for speeding , 53 for following too closely , 21 for illegal lane changes , and 847 for safety belt and child restraint violations .
Details about the nature of the tickets written in Jefferson County were not available , Richards said .
Cullman County had a high number of traffic fatalities in 2007 , as did the other counties -- Baldwin , Chilton , and Mobile counties -- previously targeted in the '' Take Back Our Highways : 50/4 '' campaign , Richards said .
April 21 , 2008  --
Did a Rupert Murdoch company go too far and hire hackers to sabotage rivals and gain the top spot in the global pay - TV war ?
This is the question a jury will be facing in a spectacular five - year - old civil lawsuit that is finally being tried this month in California but which has , oddly , received little notice from U.S. media .
The case involves a colorful cast of characters that includes former intelligence agents , Canadian TV pirates , Bulgarian and German hackers , stolen e-mails and the mysterious suicide of a Berlin hacker who had been courted by the Murdoch company not long before his death .
On the hot spot is NDS Group , a UK - Israeli firm that makes smartcards for pay - TV systems like DirecTV .
The company is a majority - owned subsidiary of Murdoch 's News Corporation .
The charges stem from 1997 when NDS is accused of cracking the encryption of rival NagraStar , which makes access cards and systems for EchoStar 's Dish Network and other pay - TV services .
Further , it 's alleged NDS then hired hackers to manufacture and distribute counterfeit NagraStar cards to pirates to steal Dish Network 's programming for free .
NagraStar and one of its parent companies , EchoStar , are seeking about $ 101 million for damages for piracy , copyright infringement , misconduct and unfair competition .
The list of witnesses in the case includes EchoStar 's founder and CEO Charlie Ergen ; several hackers and pirates ; and Reuven Hazak , an Israeli who heads security for NDS and is a former deputy head of Shabak , or Shin Bet , Israel 's domestic security agency ( the equivalent of Britain 's MI5 ) .
The case , which began April 9 in the U.S. District Court 's Central Division in Santa Ana , California , could conceivably result in an award of hundreds of millions of dollars , although neither side is expected to emerge unscathed from testimony that threatens to expose the messy underbelly of the high - stakes pay - TV industry .
As if to emphasize this point , U.S. District Judge David O. Carter said after the proceedings began that he was concerned that the case would hinge on testimony from known lawbreakers like hackers and pirates , who have been employed by the companies on both sides of the lawsuit .
The judge urged the plaintiffs and defendant to settle rather than face potentially devastating harm to their reputations .
EchoStar would n't comment on the case while it 's ongoing , but Jim Davis , a senior analyst with the 451 Group , a market research firm , said the company is n't likely to settle .
" It gets taken very personal when your security product has been hacked , " he said .
" And to have a competitor do that through , allegedly , the services of a known hacker , has got to be particularly galling to NagraStar . "
As for NDS , which currently has more than 75 million access cards on the market , Davis says the company probably sees the trial as an opportunity to defend against the image that it is " simultaneously promoting a product that secures networks while working with folks that work outside the law [ to break networks ] . "
The company said in a statement to Wired.com : " We are confident our position will be upheld at a trial . "
According to court documents , the scheme began to unravel in 2000 when law - enforcement agents in Texas seized suspicious packages containing CD and DVD players stuffed with more than $ 40,000 in cash .
Parcels similar to this were being sent almost daily from Canada , via Texas , to a hacker in California named Christopher Tarnovsky , who was working for NDS as an engineer .
The money was allegedly part of the conspiracy between Tarnovsky and NDS Group to sabotage NagraStar 's cards .
As laid out in the allegations , NDS ' hacking is said to have begun in 1997 after its own access cards were cracked and it was at risk of losing clients like DirecTV , which was being hit hard from pirates who were selling unfettered access to its system .
But rather than deal with its security breach , NDS hired Tarnovsky and other pirates who had compromised its system to help the company hack and pirate its competitors ' cards and even out the playing field , it is alleged .
In addition to Tarnovsky , the company also hired Oliver Kommerling , a hacker known for writing the primer on cracking smartcards .
Kommerling has acknowledged in an affidavit that he helped NDS set up a research lab in Haifa , Israel , where NagraStar 's smartcard was allegedly cracked by NDS engineers .
NDS did n't hire only hackers , however .
According to EchoStar / NagraStar , it also hired a handful of other people with colorful pasts who they say had a role in hacking and pirating EchoStar / NagraStar .
There was Reuven Hazak , who had been deputy head of Israel 's Shin Bet during the notorious Bus 300 incident ( when two Palestinian terrorists who hijacked an Israeli bus were killed in custody by a Shin Bet agent .
Hazak eventually blew the whistle on the subsequent cover - up ) .
NDS also hired a former U.S. Navy intelligence officer named John Norris and a former Scotland Yard commander named Ray Adams .
Finally , it hired a former would - be terrorist , Yossi Tsuria , who became chief technical officer of its lab in Israel .
Tsuria was part of a radical group of Jewish Israelis in the 1980s that plotted to bomb the Dome of the Rock -- a shrine that sits on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem , a holy site for both Jews and Muslims .
NDS has maintained in public statements that Hazak , Norris and its other security officers were hired to help it track down hackers and pirates and get them arrested .
But EchoStar and NagraStar allege that Hazak and Norris played central roles in committing hacking and piracy as well .
In late 1997 , NDS researchers in Israel reportedly cracked the NagraStar card after about six months of effort , using an electron microscope .
NagraStar became aware its card was hacked in late 1998 when meeting with DirecTV to discuss the pay - TV company 's desire to switch from the hacked NDS cards to NagraStar 's cards .
But DirecTV employees surprised NagraStar at the meeting when they informed NagraStar that its cards had also been hacked .
EchoStar / NagraStar claim that NDS , aware that DirecTV was about to abandon its cards in favor of NagraStar cards , cracked NagraStar 's card to discourage DirecTV from making the switch .
After NDS cracked its rival 's card , Tarnovsky and his associates allegedly created and sold counterfeit NagraStar cards through a piracy site based in Canada , among others , that allowed pirates to access Dish Network programs for free .
Tarnovsky is also accused of later posting on the Canadian site the code , secret keys and instructions for hacking the microprocessor on EchoStar 's access cards , allowing pirates to flood the market with even more cards .
He has denied the allegations .
Hazak and Norris are accused of providing Tarnovsky with the code so he could post it online , but NDS maintains this did n't happen .
According to court documents , the sabotage scheme worked remarkably well throughout 1998 and 1999 as counterfeit NagraStar cards flooded the market .
It was around this time , however , that a German hacker in Berlin known as Boris Floricic , aka Tron , disappeared while walking home from his parents ' home one day .
He was found several days later hanging from a belt in a park .
Among his possessions , authorities found correspondence from NDS .
NDS later said it had offered Boris a job , which he had rejected .
Prior to his death , Boris had obtained source code and information about hacking access cards that were being used in a German satellite TV system .
His friends in the German hacker group , Chaos Computer Club , were convinced that he'd met with foul play .
Although his death was officially ruled a suicide , there were enough details around it to create suspicion .
Floricic 's feet were on the ground when he was found hanging , for example , and other evidence suggested that his body might have been placed in the park after he died .
During this time , NagraStar was n't the only alleged victim of NDS hacking and piracy .
In 2002 , the French pay - TV service Canal Plus filed a damages suit against NDS , from which the EchoStar / NagraStar case emerged .
In an affidavit from that case , Kommerling disclosed that NDS had cracked the Canal Plus cards using a method he had taught its engineers in Israel .
Then , he revealed , the company instructed Tarnovsky to post the Canal Plus code on the internet .
The Canal Plus suit fizzled after its parent company , Vivendi Universal , struck a business deal with News Corporation that included a condition that Canal Plus would drop its suit against NDS .
This is when EchoStar joined the litigation .
Before Canal Plus 's case against NDS died , Tarnovsky indicated to the company that Reuven Hazak had given him the Canal Plus code to post it on the internet .
He reportedly told the French firm he would testify in the case , but later backed out , citing fear for his life and his family .
In May 2002 , two months after Canal Plus filed its suit , someone broke into the car of one of its U.K. employees and stole the hard drive from his laptop , making off with thousands of NDS documents and e-mails .
EchoStar / NagraStar say the e-mails provide proof of NDS ' hacking and piracy activities .
NDS has suggested that the e-mails might be fabricated and has battled to keep them out of the court proceedings .
NDS has denied the lawsuit allegations .
The company maintains that it was simply engaging in reverse - engineering , as any company would do to understand rivals and compete in the marketplace , but that it did not distribute cards or information about hacking NagraStar 's encryption to pirates .
In an e-mail statement to Wired.com , the company took a dig at its competitor 's competence and touted its superior skills .
" The hacking of EchoStar was the result of inferior technology arising from inadequate investment in research and development by [ NagraStar ] , " said the statement .
" NDS , on the other hand , invests heavily in research and development ... we reinvested over 30 percent of our revenues into R&D -- and the result is that we have zero piracy and the platforms of our customers are completely secure . "
The trial is expected to last at least two more weeks .

Algorithms for Nearest Neighbor Search ( by Yury Lifshits )
Similarity Search : A Web Perspective ( by Yuri Lifshits )
Lecture description :
Similarity search is the problem of preprocessing a database of N objects in such a way that given a query object , one can effectively determine its nearest neighbors in database .
" Geometric near - neighbor access tree " data structure , an early work ( 1995 ) by Sergey Brin , is one of the most known solutions to this problem .
Similarity search is closely connected to many algorithmic problems in the web .
Similarity search is an abstraction of many algorithmic problems we face in data management .
In this talk we will focus on :
- Personalized news aggregation : Searching for news articles that are most similar to the user 's profile of interests .
- Behavioral targeting : Searching for the most relevant advertisement for displaying to a given user .
- Social network analysis : Suggesting new friends .
- Computing co-occurrence similarities .
- " Best match search " : Searching resumes , jobs , boyfriends , girlfriends , cars , apartments .
The lecture describes features that make web applications somewhat different from previously studied models .
Thus the lecturer re-examine the formalization and the classical algorithms for similarity search .
This leads us to new algorithms ( Yuri present two of them ) and numerous open problems in the field .

[ Chicken - users ] macro systems and chicken ( long )
From : Alex Shinn Subject : [ Chicken - users ] macro systems and chicken ( long ) Date : Fri , 04 Apr 2008 20:56:59 +0900 User-agent : Gnus / 5.11 ( Gnus v5.11 ) Emacs /22.1.50 ( darwin )
There seems to be a lot of confusion in the Chicken community , and the Lisp community in general , about the different macro systems , so I thought provide some background information and discussion of the eggs available in Chicken and their uses .
--- Background ---
There are two completely orthogonal aspects of macro systems - whether they are hygienic or unhygienic , and whether they are low - level or high - level .
Low - level means direct manipulation of sexps to produce sexps - you 're generating code expressions by hand .
High - level means you use some higher abstraction like templating - the underlying processing may or may not make use of sexps at all .
Low - level of course offers the most control .
High - level has nice benefits such as providing a location in source code for line - number debug info , and easier analysis by other tools like analysers and editors .
Neither of these have anything to do with hygiene .
Hygiene is a relatively newer concept , so all the old macro systems were either unhygienic + low - level or unhygienic + high - level .
defmacro is the former - it 's low - level manipulation of sexps .
The C preprocessor can be thought of as the weakest , most poorly designed instance of unhygienic high - level macros .
It 's a templating system without any kind of destructuring , conditionals or polymorphism .
Other alternatives like the m4 macro preprocessor and pretty much every assembly preprocessor are more powerful instances of high - level macro systems .
Anyway , in the Lisp community we had defmacro , and it was good .
You had to be careful to use gensyms , and never to shadow or redefine any core procedures anywhere in your program , but if you stuck to those rules there were n't many problems .
Then Scheme came along , and nicely unified the CL namespace mess into a single consistent namespace .
The problem was this made conflicts much more likely .
It became much more important to be able to automatically avoid problems , without burdening the programmer with mentally keeping track of everything in all lexical scopes .
Thus hygiene was born .
A good description of why hygiene is necessary can be found at http://community.schemewiki.org/?hygiene-versus-gensym.
A very brief time - line : 1986 : Kohlbecker - introduced the idea of hygiene , low - level , used an O( n ^ 2 ) coloring algorithm 1987 : Kohlbecker - introduced declare - syntax , high - level , the precursor to syntax - rules 1988 : Bawden & Rees - " Syntactic closures , " low - level , faster than Kohlbecker 's algorithm 1991 : Clinger & Rees - Explicit renaming , low - level , based on syntactic - closures but also supports syntax - rules 1992 : Dybvig - Syntax - case , primary motivation to remove the distinction between low - level and high - level You can find the papers for these at library.readscheme.org .
--- Using The Low - level Systems ---
I 'm assuming everyone is familiar with syntax - rules , if not there are good tutorials available elsewhere .
I 'm also going to skip Kohlbecker 's original system since it is n't used anywhere .
The syntactic closures idea is very simple .
Instead of the macro just being passed the expression to transform , it 's passed the expression plus environment information .
You can think of it like ( define - syntax foo ( lambda ( form usage - environment macro - environment ) ... ) ) which is indeed how it 's implemented , but you never use that directly , you use one of the transformer abstractions .
The most basic is sc- macro - transformer ( " sc " is for syntactic closures ) .
A good discussion can be found at http://community.schemewiki.org/?syntactic-closures or in the MIT Scheme reference manual http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/documentation/mit-scheme-ref/SC-Transformer-Definition.html but basically the idea is you write macros like ( define - syntax foo ( sc- macro - transformer ( lambda ( form usage - environment ) ... ) ) )
You can then manipulate FORM as a normal sexp just like in defmacro .
The resulting sexp is then interpreted in the macro's syntactic environment .
To make parts of FORM refer to their bindings in the calling environment , you need to wrap them in syntactic - closures with the USAGE - ENVIRONMENT parameter .
As an example , ( define - syntax swap !
( sc - macro - transformer ( lambda ( form env ) ( let ( ( a ( make - syntactic - closure env '( ) ( cadr form ) ) ) ( b ( make - syntactic - closure env '( ) ( caddr form ) ) ) ) `( let ( ( value , a ) ) ( set ! , a , b ) ( set ! , b value ) ) ) ) ) )
FORM is the full form ( swap ! var1 var2 ) , so we 're binding A to var1 and B to var2 , in the context of the usage environment .
The other identifiers in the returned sexp ( LET , VALUE and SET ! ) all refer to the original macro environment , so even if they had been locally shadowed in the usage environment , this will still work .
The second argument to make - syntactic - closure ( just '( ) above ) is used when you want to deliberately break hygiene .
See the other links for details .
The next transformer is rsc-macro - transformer , which is essentially the reverse - the env parameter is the macro environment , and bare identifiers in the result are implicitly handled in the usage environment .
( define - syntax swap !
( rsc - macro - transformer ( lambda ( form env ) ( let ( ( a ( cadr form ) ) ( b ( caddr form ) ) ( value ( make- syntactic - closure env '( ) ' value ) ) ( let -r ( make - syntactic - closure env '( ) ' let ) ) ( set ! -r ( make - syntactic - closure env '( ) ' set ! ) ) ) `( , let - r ( ( , value , a ) ) ( , set ! -r , a , b ) ( , set ! -r , b , value ) ) ) ) ) )
Here A and B are just passed as - is , and the normal Scheme constructs ( LET and SET ! ) need to explicitly refer to the macro environment .
It looks a little more busy - since most of what you write in a macro expansion will be new code , rather than rearranging the old cold .
However , if you look at that , the reason we make VALUE a syntactic - closure is so that it wo n't conflict with any instances of VALUE in A or B .
An alternate way of achieving the same result would be to use gensym .
Now , if you 're programming by the old defmacro conventions of never redefining or shadowing core forms and functions like LET and SET ! , they would have the same meaning in both environments .
So , a safe - only - by - convention way of writing this is : ( define - syntax swap !
( rsc - macro - transformer ( lambda ( form env ) ( let ( ( a ( cadr form ) ) ( b ( caddr form ) ) ( value ( gensym ) ) ) `( let ( ( , value , a ) ) ( set ! , a , b ) ( set ! , b , value ) ) ) ) ) )
But that 's exactly the way you write this in defmacro !
People who argue against hygiene saying " you can have defmacro when you take it from my cold , dead hands " are simply unaware that you can do * exactly * the same style of programming with hygiene .
The only extra code above is the rsc-macro - transformer line .
============================================================ = IF YOU FIND HYGIENE CONFUSING , WRITE EVERYTHING WITH = = RSC - MACRO -TRANSFORMER AS THOUGH IT WERE DEFMACRO .
YOU = = CAN ADD IN HYGIENE SEEMLESSLY IF AND WHEN ANY PROBLEMS = = ARISE .
= ============================================================
The next transformer is er-macro - transformer , where " er " stands for " Explicit Renaming . " ( define - syntax swap !
( er- macro - transformer ( lambda ( form rename compare ) ( let ( ( a ( cadr form ) ) ( b ( caddr form ) ) ) `( , ( rename ' let ) ( ( , ( rename ' value ) , a ) ) ( , ( rename ' set ! ) , a , b ) ( , ( rename ' set ! ) , b , ( rename ' value ) ) ) ) ) ) )
The result is handled just like in rsc-macro - transformer - raw identifiers are handled in the usage environment .
Instead of an reference to the macro environment , we 're given a RENAME procedure which explicitly makes a syntactic closure for the macro environment .
RENAME is referentially transparent , so even though it 's called twice on VALUE above the results are the same , where sameness is by comparison with the COMPARE procedure .
I.e. ( compare ( rename ' foo ) ( rename ' foo ) ) => #t
Though you can of course rename everything you need once outside to preserve readability of the expression .
--- The Hybrid System ---
The syntax - case macro system is sort of a hybrid , combining high - level and low - level features .
Our example would become : ( define - syntax swap !
( lambda ( stx ) ( syntax - case stx ( ) ( ( swap ! a b ) ( syntax ( let ( ( value a ) ) ( set! a b ) ( set ! b value ) ) ) ) ) ) )
The SYNTAX - CASE form destructures the STX input just like SYNTAX - RULES does .
However , the body is n't a template , but rather is evaluated normally .
SYNTAX is another special form that works to instantiate a template .
Because this use of SYNTAX occurs lexically inside the ( swap ! a b ) pattern , the instances of A and B in the syntax template hygienically refer to those parameters of the macro .
If you moved the SYNTAX to a helper function it would break .
So you can think of SYNTAX - CASE as unhygienically inserting some lexical environment information that SYNTAX refers to .
The nice thing is that this example actually does more than any of our previous SWAP !
definitions in that it checks syntax and will signal a syntax error if not given two arguments .
On the other hand , for this example SYNTAX - RULES beats everybody : ( define - syntax swap ! ( syntax - rules ( ) ( ( swap ! a b ) ( let ( ( value a ) ) ( set! a b ) ( set ! b value ) ) ) ) )
The advantage of SYNTAX - CASE over SYNTAX - RULES is that you do n't have to just use SYNTAX , you can perform some arbitrary computation on sexps and then convert it to syntax .
The basic pattern here would be : ( define - syntax swap !
( lambda ( stx ) ( syntax - case stx ( ) ( ( swap ! a b ) ( let ( ( a ( syntax - object - > datum ( syntax a ) ) ) ( b ( syntax - object - > datum ( syntax b ) ) ) ) ( datum - > syntax - object ( syntax swap ! ) `( let ( ( value , a ) ) ( set ! , a , b ) ( set ! , b value ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
That is , you destructure with SYNTAX - CASE , access the destructured info with SYNTAX , convert these to sexps with syntax - object -> datum , perform arbitrary defmacro - style computations , and then convert it back to syntax with datum -> syntax - object .
Got it ?
There are also utilities to streamline this somewhat like quasisyntax ( which even gets its own new read syntax ) and with - syntax , and a whole huge library of stuff .
It 's a very large and baroque system .
For pure template - style syntax , SYNTAX - RULES wins , and for pure low - level handling the other systems win because they do n't get in your way as much .
SYNTAX - CASE has a niche in medium - level complexity macros that benefit from destructuring plus a small amount of computation .
On the other hand , if you do n't tightly bind one specific destructuring idiom to your macro system , you can take your pick of any external matching or syntax - verifying libraries you want ( e.g. use explicit renaming macros with the MATCH macro for destructuring ) .
Oh , there 's another really serious problem here .
Remember how all the syntactic closures based transformers were wrapped in a macro like sc- macro - transformer or er-macro - transformer ?
Well , the syntax case macro system does n't have that : ( define - syntax foo ( lambda ( stx ) ... ) ) i.e. a macro is _always_ _explicitly _ a procedure of one argument , which is a syntax object ( and contains all the syntax case semantics thereof ) .
So if you implemented your system such that macros take three arguments ( the form and the two environments ) , you 're screwed .
You have to resort to very ugly hacks to get these to work together .
So to summarize SYNTAX - CASE does let you write both high and low level macros and preserve hygiene , and has some nice ideas , but I really dislike it and discourage it 's use for the following reasons : 1 ) very , very large and baroque API and reader extensions 2 ) forces a single destructuring idiom tightly integrated with the macro system , when this should be a purely orthogonal concept 3 ) makes it very difficult to play along with alternate macro systems 4 ) implicit unhygienic interaction between SYNTAX - CASE and SYNTAX , and in general confusing semantics 5 ) identifier syntax ( another huge , ugly can of worms I wo n't even get into here ) --- Macros in Chicken ---
OK , so now what macro systems are available in Chicken and how do we use them ?
Core chicken by itself has define - macro , which is unhygienic .
All of the alternative systems hook into Chicken by registering themselves as the macro expander , thus effectively throwing away any existing macros .
They then reload their own versions of the standard Chicken macros ( use , cond - expand , when , unless , define - macro , etc. ) .
Thereafter ( yes , load order matters here ) any new macros are defined in terms of the new macro system .
The hygienic systems mostly do provide a define - macro definition , but it should be avoided , as it becomes even more fragile than usual when combined with hygienic macros ( interleaving them basically just does n't work ) .
The alternative hyienic macro systems are : syntax - rules ?
low - level ?
compiled - macros ?
alexpander O X X syntax - case O O X simple - macros O O X syntactic - closures O O X riaxpander O O O alexpander is a simple , lightweight implementation of syntax - rules only , with a few extensions , written by Al* Petrofsky .
It 's the only option here that does n't have any low - level macros .
syntax - case is as bashed thoroughly above .
If you use it I reserve the right to taunt you endlessly : P simple - macros is a more recent system by Andre van Tonder which contains a full implementation of syntax - case .
So it 's an even bigger system , and I believe more semantically complex , but I 'm not too familiar with it .
The syntactic - closures egg is the original implementation by Bawden , modified heavily by Chris Hanson , and is the macro system currently used in MIT Scheme .
It provides all three of the transformers ( sc- , rsc - and er - ) described above , as well as SYNTAX - RULES .
It 's the most light - weight of the low - level hygienic macro systems .
The riaxpander egg is a recent , clean implementation of syntactic - closures by Taylor Campbell , and is fully compatible with the syntactic - closures egg .
I also recently added support for compiled macros so it loads an order of magnitude faster than any of the above systems .
Which should you use ?
If you 're defining your own local macros for compile - time it 's not really a big deal - use whatever is most convenient .
If you 're _exporting_ macros , then this becomes an important decision .
Exporting unhygienic macros is a bad idea .
If at all possible , exported macros should be written with SYNTAX - RULES because that 's universally supported by the alternatives .
If you really need to use low - level macros , then you have to choose between the syntax - case API and the syntactic - closures API .
Obviously I prefer the latter :)
You * do n't* need to specify an implementation in either case - the user can choose whichever s/he prefers .
For example , if our made a swap egg that exported our swap macro as an explicit renaming macro , then someone who wanted to use it would write ( use syntactic - closures swap ) or ( use riaxpander swap )
If you want to be very friendly , you can actually support all of the systems with judicious use of COND - EXPAND .
If you look at the source to the matchable egg , it 's 95 % SYNTAX - RULES with a couple of COND - EXPANDed definitions for either syntax - case , syntactic - closures , or pure syntax - rules ( the alexpander case ) .
If you look at the test egg , it just provides a few macros which are fully COND - EXPANDed to support any system - including Chicken 's core define - macro . --

It 's not uncommon for Christians to pine for the " end of the world " as prophesied in the book of Revelation .
Since the beginning of Christianity , followers have insisted " end times " are upon us .
The bible itself says that the prophesies were to happen during the lives of the writers ( Matthew 24:34 , Luke 21:32 ) so the notion that any day now , Jesus will return has always been a recurring theme throughout history among Christians .
However , some have grown quite impatient , to the point of doing what they feel needs to be done in order to make prophesy come true .
John
Hagee is one of those men .
Normally , people like these are relegated to trailers and pulpits in some back woods county with more dirt than paved roads , but Pastor Hagee is a multimillionaire political lobbyist / peacher who has ties to the highest level of government including George W. Bush , John McCain and others .
He 's a driving force behind gathering the religious right behind support of Israel 's independence , but his motives are a lot more bizarre and dubious than mere concern for the Jews autonomy .
Beyond being the guy that said God created Hurricane Katrina to punish New Orleans for its homosexual " sins " , John Hagee :
An evangelical pastor , is literally trying to bring about the end of the world , Hagee is the leader of the peculiar movement of Christian Zionism , whose basic plan is to get Israel full control of Jerusalem , setting the stage for world war and Armageddon , so Hagee and his flock can ascend to heaven while the Jews , Muslims ( especially the Muslims ) and everyone else can suffer and die in the wreckage .
But lest you get the idea
Hagee is an earnestly insane man of the cloth , it turns out he 's also paid himself in the millions , first from his non-profit TV station , which he cleverly turned into a tax - exempt church .
So maybe Hagee is just another charlatan , but his message is still the most dangerous he could possibly preach .
Pastor Strangelove
Texan John
Hagee may not have his “ perfect red heifer ” yet .
But he does have a huge following , the ear of the White House -- and a theory that an invasion of Iran was foretold in the Book of Esther . [ 1 ]
On Purim , the Jewish holiday that celebrates the day Queen Esther saved the Jews from annihilation , Trinity Broadcasting Network ’s flagship talk show , Praise the Lord , featured an appearance by Rabbi Daniel Lapin .
A politically conservative Orthodox rabbi , Lapin is best known for crusading with the Christian right against “ anti-religion bigotry ” and , more recently , for his close association with the convicted super - lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
But he was not invited to a nationwide telecast to discuss such topics as the trumped - up war against religion or the better nature of his fallen friend .
He had been asked to explain the significance of Purim to Christians , and particularly how the Old Testament ’s Book of Esther “ serves as a roadmap to reality , ” which pinpoints where the next world “ hot spot ” will be .
That soon - to - be - flaming location is where the Book of Esther was set : namely Persia , or in modern parlance , Iran .
Hagee says Hitler did the same thing the Catholic church did - just more efficiently .
Seated beside Lapin in the ornately gilded Trinity Broadcasting Network ( TBN ) studio was Pastor John Hagee , the author of an incendiary new book purporting to show that the Bible predicts a military confrontation with Iran .
By then , Hagee ’s book , Jerusalem Countdown , had sold nearly 500,000 copies .
It had occupied the No. 1 position on the Wal - Mart inspirational best - seller list , showed up on Wal - Mart ’s list of top 10 best sellers for seven weeks , and made the USA Today top 50 best - seller list for six weeks .
Hagee , who serves as head pastor of the 18,000 - member Cornerstone Church in San Antonio , Texas , hosts his own television program that is seen twice a day on TBN .
He argues that the United States must join Israel in a pre-emptive military strike against Iran to fulfill God ’s plan for both Israel and the West .
Shortly after the release of his book last January , he launched Christians United for Israel ( CUFI ) , a lobbying organization intended , he says , to be a Christian version of the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
With CUFI , which Hagee has said will cause a “ political earthquake , ” the televangelist aims to put the political organizing muscle of the conservative evangelical movement behind his grand plan for a biblically prophesied end - time confrontation with Iran , which will lead to the Rapture , Tribulation , and Second Coming of Christ .
While Washington insiders wonder and worry whether President Bush really is bent on a military strike against Iran , Hagee already has spent months mobilizing the shock troops in support of another war .
As diplomats , experts , and pundits debate how many years Iran will need to develop a viable nuclear weapon , Hagee says the mullahs already possess the means to destroy Israel and America .
And although Bush insists that diplomatic options are still on the table , Hagee has dismissed pussyfooting diplomacy and primed his followers for a conflagration .
Indeed ,
Hagee wields “ a very large megaphone ” that reaches “ a very large group of people , ” said Rabbi James Rudin of the American Jewish Committee , who has studied the Christian right for 30 years .
With CUFI , the Texas pastor has exponentially expanded the reach of his megaphone beyond his television audience .
Thanks to the viral marketing made possible by the hundreds of evangelical leaders who have signed on to his new organization , his warmongering has rippled through mega-churches across America for months .
John Hagee says Hitler performed God 's will .
Hagee calls pastors “ the spiritual generals of America , ” an appropriate phrase given his reliance on them to rally their troops behind his message .
The CUFI board of directors includes the Reverend Jerry Falwell , former Republican presidential candidate and religious right activist Gary Bauer , and George Morrison , pastor to the 8,000 - member Faith Bible Chapel in Arvada , Colorado , and chairman of the board of Promise Keepers .
Rod Parsley , the Ohio televangelist who is rapidly becoming a major political figure in the Christian right , signed on as a regional director .
Among CUFI ’s other supporters are nationally syndicated Christian right talk show host Janet Parshall , who serves on its board of advisers , and Ron Wexler , an Orthodox Jew and president of the theocratic Ten Commandments Commission , which has the backing of nearly every prominent conservative evangelical in the country .
Many popular TBN televangelists , among them the controversial faith healer Benny Hinn and the best - selling author of self - improvement books , Joyce Meyer , have also offered their support .
Meyer was named one of the country ’s 25 most influential evangelicals in an oft - cited 2005 Time magazine article -- as was Stephen Strang , CEO of Strang Communications , which published Jerusalem Countdown .
Long before his launch of CUFI , Hagee had sought to influence American policy toward the Middle East .
For 25 years , he has hosted a “ Night to Honor Israel ” at his church , an event that showcased Tom DeLay as the keynote speaker in 2002 , and that has attracted leaders of the Israeli government as well as American politicians .
Now 66 years old , the ambitious preacher divorced his first wife 30 years ago when their children were ages 3 and 6 , and less than six months later married his second wife , who happened to be 12 years his junior .
Despite this apparent moral lapse , other evangelicals have long looked to him for guidance .
The Christian pollster George Barna recently reported that Hagee is ranked in the top 10 spokesmen for Christianity among other Pentecostals .
Morrison , who has been friends with Hagee for more than 20 years and whose ministry has likewise “ always seen Israel in God ’s plan for the future , ” says that Hagee “ has proven himself as a spiritual leader in the country .
And he has the platform , his TV ministry … he has the great respect of a lot of other leaders , so certainly , he ’s in that position … [ of ] spiritual leadership and authority to lead the evangelical churches and help unite them . ”
( Hagee himself , as well as Falwell and Bauer , declined to be interviewed for this article . )
Real Christians do n't support welfare
David Brog , a former chief of staff to Senator Arlen Specter , the Pennsylvania Republican , serves on CUFI ’s board of advisers .
Standing With Israel , his book urging Jews to embrace the support of evangelical Christians , has just been published by Strang Communications .
Brog believes that CUFI “ can have an enormous influence .
It can really create a player where there is n’t currently one . ”
As to whether Hagee has the organizational skills to pull off such a project , Brog added that the pastor is a “ great administrator ” and a “ great leader , ” and was able to build his church and TV ministry because “ he ’s a good businessman , he ’s a good organizer . ”
But Hagee the businessman -- along with friends like Hinn , Meyer , Parsley , and other TBN televangelists , including the network ’s top executives , Paul and Jan Crouch -- has come under fire for excessive compensation derived from his nonprofit ministries .
According to his organization ’s tax returns , Hagee has earned more than $ 1 million annually since 1999 in salary and deferred compensation from his nonprofit Global Evangelism Television and Cornerstone Church .
In 2004 , the San Antonio News Express reported that he was the highest - paid nonprofit executive in that city ; his pay was nearly twice that of the next best - paid executive .
TBN is the largest Christian television network in the world , claiming to reach more than 92 million households in the United States alone , and since 9 - 11 has expanded its worldwide reach into Muslim countries , including Iran .
Despite TBN ’s claim to represent the whole of Christianity , however , many Christians might not recognize their religion in TBN ’s “ Word of Faith ” programming .
Word of Faith is a nondenominational Pentecostal movement , based on the power of the spoken word to claim one ’s spiritual and material desires and to purge devils from one ’s life .
The movement ’s other central tenet , which critics say leads to the excessive compensation of its leaders , is the notion that “ sowing a seed ” -- contributing to the ministry -- will result in the donor ’s “ harvest ” of personal prosperity .
Like the televangelists ’ individual ministries , TBN is operated by a nonprofit entity , so contributions are tax - deductible to the donor and tax free to the ministry .
While TBN reaps more than $ 100 million of revenue per year , mostly from viewer donations , Hagee ’s organization reports annual revenues of about $ 15 million .
Olé Anthony is president of the Trinity Foundation , an independent watchdog of TBN and its televangelists .
He says that the ministries increase donations through “ sophisticated direct - mail campaigns , ” using mailing lists compiled as a result of viewers calling the “ prayer lines ” advertised on television programs .
He regards the abuse of the prayer lines to get callers ’ names and addresses as “ one of the many scandals of the religious world of television . ”
Although many Christians consider the money - centered word of faith theology to be a form of heresy , the Republican Party has embraced TBN ’s audience as a valuable constituency .
Rabbi Lapin , who himself has met personally with President Bush , told the Prospect that Hagee “ without question , yes , absolutely ” has the ear of the White House .
But he declined to identify any officials by name , claiming “ there ’s a lot of sensitivity in government circles about the so - called religious right . ”
TBN has made much of its own Republican connections , touting network founder Paul Crouch ’s relationship with John Ashcroft ( they attended the same church as children ) -- and the Republicans have returned the compliment .
In his 1999 campaign memoir , Bush recalls feeling “ spellbound ” by the preaching of Dallas - based TBN televangelist T.D. Jakes , whom he has since invited to participate in official White House events .
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist has lauded TBN ’s efforts to expand its broadcasting into China .
TBN ’s lawyer is Colby May , who also serves as counsel to the American Center for Law and Justice , a group founded by Pat Robertson , whose president Jay Sekulow , a converted Jew , advised Bush on his Supreme Court nominees .
May also represents certain members of Congress on legislative initiatives and helped draft the Houses of Worship Free Speech Restoration Act , which , if passed , would lift the ban on electioneering from the pulpit .
Its chief sponsor , Congressman Walter Jones , a North Carolina Republican , has appeared on Praise the Lord to promote the bill .
Other guests on TBN programming have included Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina ; Congressman Dana Rohrabacher , a California Republican ; Texas gop co-chairman David Barton ; and Oliver North , the radio host and Iran - Contra scandal celebrity .
Several years ago , after Crouch interviewed California Congressman Duke Cunningham , he wrote in TBN ’s newsletter : “ What a soul - winner he is !
Every time he shares his powerful testimony , lives are touched , and our SOULS TOTAL soars ! ”
That was long before Cunningham pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy , and fell under suspicion of providing favors to a defense contractor who sent him prostitutes via limousine .

For Hagee ’s new project , his influence in washington is probably less important than his influence over his audience .
With the clout of his listeners , he can serve Bush administration hawks by firing up grass - roots support for a military strike against Iran .
TBN has provided several opportunities for Hagee to promote his book on Praise the Lord , several installments of his own program , and a two - day appearance on Benny Hinn ’s show .
Through the marketing efforts of Strang Communications , which placed national radio advertising spots for Jerusalem Countdown on The Sean Hannity Show , The O’Reilly Factor , and Janet Parshall ’s America , Hagee brought his Armageddon message to a wider conservative audience .
His end - times theology is nothing new ; countless numbers of self - proclaimed prophets of the end of the world have demanded attention since the beginning of time .
The difference now is that TBN ’s relentless fund raising -- along with advances in digital and satellite broadcasting technology -- has permitted worldwide dissemination of his ominous predictions .
Through TBN , other religious and conservative media , and the growing mega- churches , Hagee has turned his Bible - thumping not only into a multi-million dollar business , but into a pro-war movement as well .
While pundits and politicians in Washington debate the merits of confrontation with Tehran , Hagee and other evangelical leaders plan to activate hundreds of congregations across the country -- many of which boast tens of thousands of members -- to flood congressional inboxes with e-mails at the touch of a button .
The message from the heartland , beyond the ken of elites who cannot quite imagine such a decision , will be to strike Iran before it is too late .
The pages of Jerusalem Countdown provide a peculiar mix of biblical prophecy , purported inside information from Israeli government officials , and a mixed - up , pared - down lesson in nuclear physics .
“ I wrote this book in April 2005 , and when people read it , they will think I wrote it late last night after the FOX News report , ” says the author without a trace of irony .
“ It ’s that close to where we are and beyond . ”
Oddly enough he predicted , allegedly relying on information from a “ reliable ” Israeli source , that Iran would have a nuclear weapon ready by April 2006 -- the month during which Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced that Iran had enriched uranium , although apparently not nearly enough to make a bomb .
The particulars of Iran ’s nuclear program , however , do not seem to interest Hagee .
In many of his appearances last winter , before the Iranian president ’s announcement , he glossed over the obstacles faced by Tehran in creating a viable nuclear weapon , arguing that “ once you have enriched uranium , the genie is out of the bottle . ”
( His command of politics in Islamic countries is similarly flawed ; he repeatedly has called Iranian religious fundamentalists “ Wahabbists , ” even though Wahabbism is a form of Sunni Islam , and the overwhelming majority of Iranians are Shiites . )
Last March , he claimed that within a month , “ Iran will have the nuclear -- the enriched uranium to make the -- have the nuclear capability to make a bomb , a suitcase bomb , a missile head , or anything they want to do with it . ”
That statement is blatantly false , even according to the most pessimistic assessments of Iran ’s nuclear prowess , but Hagee ’s purpose is to frighten his listeners , not to inform them .
He speaks simultaneously to two audiences about Iran ’s nuclear capabilities : one that fears a terrorist attack by Iran and another that embraces a biblically mandated apocalypse .
To impress the fearful , he mimics Bush ’s deceptions about Iraq ’s capacity to attack the United States with weapons of mass destruction , Condoleezza Rice ’s warnings of mushroom clouds , and Dick Cheney ’s dissembling about an alliance between Saddam Hussein and al - Qaeda .
Comparing Ahmadinejad to Hitler , Hagee argues that Iran ’s development of nuclear weapons must be stopped to protect America and Israel from a nuclear attack .
Preying on legitimate worries about terrorism , and invoking 9 - 11 , he vividly describes a supposed Iranian - led plan to simultaneously explode nuclear suitcase bombs in seven American cities , or to use an electromagnetic pulse device to create “ an American Hiroshima . ”
When addressing audiences receptive to Scriptural prophecy , however , Hagee welcomes the coming confrontation .
He argues that a strike against Iran will cause Arab nations to unite under Russia ’s leadership , as outlined in chapters 38 and 39 of the Book of Ezekiel , leading to an “ inferno [ that ] will explode across the Middle East , plunging the world toward Armageddon . ”
During his appearance on Hinn ’s program at the end of last March , for example , the host enthused , “ We are living in the last days .
These are the most exciting days in church history , ” but then went on to add , “ We are facing now [ the ] most dangerous moment for America . ”
At one point , Hinn clapped his hands in delight and shouted , “ Yes ! Glory ! ” and then urged his viewers to donate money faster because he is running out of time to preach the gospel .
The rhetoric in Hagee ’s book , and his discussion of it in Christian media outlets , is absolutist .
He speaks not only of good against evil , believer against nonbeliever , Judeo - Christian civilization against Islamic civilization , but of an American - Israeli alliance against the rest of the world .
He plays on conservative disdain for anything European , while promoting the Bush unilateralist mentality that has had catastrophic results in Iraq .
Naturally , he expresses contempt for the possibilities offered by diplomacy , calling the U.N. Security Council “ a joke . ”
Lapin says , “ Pastor Hagee has a very realistic understanding of the United Nations … and recognizes it as unlikely to be any more helpful in this looming tension than it has been in any other in the past . ”
He paints Russia and China -- two members of the Security Council resisting sanctions on Iran -- as America ’s enemies , adding that Russia has helped Iran build long - range missiles that could reach New York City .
( Those do n’t exist , either . )
In Hagee ’s telling , Israel has no choice but to strike at Iran ’s nuclear facilities , with or without America ’s help .
The strike will provoke Russia -- which wants Persian Gulf oil -- to lead an army of Arab nations against Israel .
Then God will wipe out all but one - sixth of the Russian - led army , as the world watches “ with shock and awe , ” he says , lending either a divine quality to the Bush administration phrase or a Bush - like quality to God ’s wrath .
But Hagee does n’t stop there .
He adds that Ezekiel predicts fire “ ‘ upon those who live in security in the coastlands . ’”
From this sentence he concludes that there will be judgment upon all who stood by while the Russian - led force invaded Israel , and issues a stark warning to the United States to intervene : “ Could it be that America , who refuses to defend Israel from the Russian invasion , will experience nuclear warfare on our east and west coasts ? ”
He says yes , citing Genesis 12:3 , in which God said to Israel : “ I will bless those who bless you , and I will curse him who curses you . ”
To fill the power vacuum left by God ’s decimation of the Russian army , the Antichrist -- identified by Hagee as the head of the European Union -- will rule “ a one - world government , a one - world currency and a one - world religion ” for three and a half years .
( He adds that “ one need only be a casual observer of current events to see that all three of these things are coming into reality . ” )
The “ demonic world leader ” will then be confronted by a false prophet , identified by Hagee as China , at Armageddon , the Mount of Megiddo in Israel .
As they prepare for the final battle , Jesus will return on a white horse and cast both villains -- and presumably any nonbelievers -- into a “ lake of fire burning with brimstone , ” thus marking the beginning of his millennial reign .
Now that ’s entertainment .

Notwithstanding
Hagee ’s bizarre narrative of the future , certain Jewish leaders value what they call his support for Israel , and appreciate his pledge not to actively proselytize Jews -- a promise that sets him apart from other evangelicals .
Rudin says that while he welcomes
Hagee ’s support for Israel , he is uneasy “ with what I feel is placing Jews and Judaism and the state of Israel into somebody else ’s divine play . ”
Hagee ’s divine play is based , in part , on Genesis 12:3 .
The same verse he uses to argue that America should unconditionally back Israel ( “ I will curse him who curses you . ” ) , he also cites to explain why Christians should love the Jewish people ( “ I will bless those who bless you . ” ) .
During TBN ’s April “ Praise - a - Thon , ” he invoked that verse for yet a third reason : to urge viewers to give their money to the network .
Hagee told his viewers that “ [ g ] iving is the only proof you have that the cancer of greed has not consumed your soul . ”
Besides his million - dollar compensation package , Hagee has a portfolio of other ventures , including a cattle ranch in south Texas that may have religious significance .
Many evangelicals believe that the arrival of a “ perfect red heifer ” will signal the end times .
In the Old Testament , burning a red heifer and sprinkling its ashes is described as a purification ritual for priests entering the temple .
Ultra-orthodox
Jews believe that the birth of a modern perfect red heifer will herald the arrival of the messiah , leading to a confrontation with Muslims over the Temple Mount , where Jews believe the Temple will be rebuilt .
Some evangelicals likewise regard the red heifer as a harbinger of the ultimate showdown at the Temple Mount , which they believe will be the site of the Second Coming .
And they believe that time is near .
To many other observers , the advent of the red heifer threatens to provoke a violent struggle for control of the Temple Mount , with worldwide repercussions .
In the late 1990s , a group of unidentified Texas ranchers reportedly bred a perfect red heifer , which generated excitement in evangelical circles until the animal sprouted some black hairs .
Six years ago , the John C. Hagee Royalty Trust paid more than $ 5.5 million for a 7,600 - acre ranch in Brackettville , Texas , where cattle are raised in a venture with the Texas Israel Agricultural Research Foundation , a nonprofit outfit operated by the pastor .
( Another part of the property is a resort hunting facility , where guests paying up to $ 250 for a night ’s stay can also land their planes at the ranch ’s private airstrip . )
Last year ,
Hagee hired one of the top lobbyists in San Antonio , David Earl , to urge the state Legislature to exempt Hagee ’s foundation from water - use regulations .
A spokeswoman for the bill ’s sponsor , Representative Frank Corte , whose district includes Hagee ’s church , said that he introduced it on behalf of a constituent , but added that she was not authorized to divulge the identity of that constituent .
( The bill stalled in committee . )
Earl said that Hagee wants to “ share information ” to “ improve ” the “ production of livestock , ” particularly cattle , with an Israeli research project , but otherwise claimed to be unsure of the particulars .
Dr. Scott Farhart , an obstetrician and trustee of the John C. Hagee Royalty Trust ( and an elder at Hagee ’s church ) , did not respond to a request for comment , nor did the director of the ranch .
Esther is a favorite Old Testament figure of many evangelicals , a heroine who saved her people from a genocidal plot masterminded by the evil vizier Haman through her influence as the wife of the King of Persia .
When she and her cousin Mordecai discussed whether she should risk death by intervening with the king , he encouraged her by suggesting that she had a divine role ; perhaps she had come to the kingdom , he said , “ for such a time as this . ”
Evangelicals often invoke that phrase to elevate the relevance of modern - day figures .
In 2004 , Laura Bush repeated a story about a woman she met on the campaign trail who told her that the President “ was born for such a time as this . ”
In a recent message sent by e-mail to CUFI supporters , Hagee wrote that his organization “ is exactly in the position of Esther .
Israel is in a time of crisis .
A 21st - century Hitler ( the president of Iran ) has put in place a plan to exterminate the Jews with nuclear warfare .
If we remain completely silent at this time , God ’s punishment will come to us also . ”
Hagee does n’t fear a nuclear conflagration , but rather God ’s wrath for standing by as Iran executes its supposed plot to destroy Israel .
A nuclear confrontation between America and Iran , which he says is foretold in the Book of Jeremiah , will not lead to the end of the world , but rather to God ’s renewal of the Garden of Eden .
But he also reveals that he is ultimately less concerned with the fate of Israel or the Jews than with a theocratic Christian right agenda .
When Jesus returns for his millennial reign , “ the righteous are going to rule the nations of the earth … When Jesus Christ comes back , he ’s not going to ask the ACLU if it ’s alright to pray , he ’s not going to ask the churches if they can ordain pedophile bishops and priests , he ’s not going to ask if it ’s all right to put the Ten Commandments in the statehouses , he ’s not going to endorse abortion , he ’s going to run the world by the word of God …
The world will never end .
It ’s going to become a Garden of Eden , and Christ is going to rule it . ”

During the STS - 123 mission to the International Space Station in March 2008 Japanese astronaut Takeo Doi tested a special boomerang in space to see how it worked in the microgravity environment of the ISS .
The boomerang used in the experiment was a â€œRoomerang , â€ a small , tri-blade boomerang intended for use indoors in a small area or outdoors in light winds .
IT was designed by boomerang expert Gary Broadbent , and it travels 5 to 8 feet before returning to the thrower .
The Japanese Space Agency has now released the video of the event :
As you can see , it worked very well , even in the small space of the ISS module .
Broadbent told Universe Today that in the pressurized environment of the ISS , â€œmicrogravity has very little effect on the boomerang flight .
The boomerang is so versatile , it can be tuned to fly in a perfect path back to the thrower , with gyroscopic precession and angular momentum over - compensating the lack of gravity .â€ 
But Broadbent also said that a boomerang would not work in the vacuum of space .
â€ œYou need air molecules to generate the lift to make the boomerang turn , â€  he said .

Supreme Court to Hear Gun Control Case This Week
This week offers the first real test of what I believe will be President Bush ’s most important legacy .
Long after President Bush has left office , and long after the Iraq war , his lasting impression will be that of his supreme court nominations of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Sam Alito .
This week the supreme court will hear it ’s first case on the second amendment in many years .
The supreme court is going to hear the case about whether Washington D.C. ’s handgun ban violates the second amendment .
But this case is even more important than just whether D.C. residents can carry handguns .
This is the first case that the supreme court will hear in many years where there is no precedent set to draw upon .
This case , according to this Washington Post article , will actually delve into whether the second amendment applies to individuals or just state militias .
“ This may be one of the only cases in our lifetime when the Supreme Court is going to be interpreting the meaning of an important provision of the Constitution unencumbered by precedent , ” said Randy E. Barnett , a constitutional scholar at the Georgetown University Law Center .
“ And that ’s why there ’s so much discussion on the original meaning of the Second Amendment . ”
The outcome could roil the 2008 political campaigns , send a national message about what kinds of gun control are constitutional and finally settle the question of whether the 27 - word amendment , with its odd structure and antiquated punctuation , provides an individual right to gun ownership or simply pertains to militia service .
“ The case has been structured so that they have to confront the threshold question , ” said Robert A. Levy , the wealthy libertarian lawyer from Family Lawyers Brisbane who has spent five years and his own money to bring District of Columbia v. Heller to the Supreme Court .
“ I think they have to come to grips with that . ”
This case looks to have wide ranging implications and it is the first real test in my opinion of the reformed supreme court under President Bush .
I have been of the belief , and I have written about it , that President Bush ’s lasting , and very under- rated , legacy would be the two men that he was able to get appointed to the supreme court .
This is their first test .
lets hope they pass .
While this Homeland Security map shows California as complying with Real ID , changes may come as a result of a DMV letter sent Tuesday .
Map : DHSFor a short moment Thursday , millions of Californians were in danger of facing pat - downs at the airport and being blocked from federal buildings come May 11 .
In a Tuesday letter ( .pdf ) to Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff , the head of California 's DMV said that while California had already applied for and gotten an extension on the Real ID deadline , it was n't actually committing to complying with Real ID rules by 2010 .
That 's when states who ask for extension have to begin issuing driver 's licenses and state IDs that comply with the federal rules .
" California 's request for an extension is not a commitment to implement Real ID , rather it will allow us to fully evaluate the impact of the final regulations and precede with necessary policy deliberations prior to a final decision on compliance , " DMV director George Valverde wrote .
States have until March 31 to request a two - year extension , and DHS had said before Thursday it wo n't grant Real ID extensions to states who do n't commit to implementing the rules in the future .
That meant Tuesday 's letter looked like enough to join California to the small rebellion against the Real ID rules .
For Californians that would mean enduring the same fate facing citizens of South Carolina , Maine , Montana and New Hampshire .
They would have needed to dig out their passport , if they had one , every time they boarded a plane , or go through an extra level of TSA screening at airport metal detectors .
Los Angeles and San Francisco airports could have had security lines stretching to the Sierras .
Californians would also have been barred from buying certain medicine , entering federal court buildings or getting help at the Social Security Administration , unless they have a passport .
But after Threat Level provided Homeland Security spokesman Laura Keehner with the letter , Keehner said California 's commitment to thinking about commitment is good enough .
" For right now , there is nothing that says they will not comply with Real ID , " Keehner said .
Even though California just said it might not comply with Real ID , Keehner said that 's fine since there was an ongoing process that might lead to compliance .
" It is different than saying we are not complying with Real ID , " Keehner said .
" If they were saying that , they would not get an extension . "
At issue are long - delayed rules that require states to collect , verify and store birth and marriage certificates for nearly all citizens who have state - issued licenses or identification cards .
That means almost every driver 's license holder will have to get certified documents and go into the DMV to get a new license – and many will likely have to go in more than once .
The rules also require the nation 's DMVs to interconnect their systems to prevent duplicate licenses and conform to federal standards for the physical cards themselves .
DHS estimates the changes will cost from $ 4 to $ 20 billion , but is only offering some $ 80 million in direct funds .
In early January when DHS unveiled the final rules , Secretary Michael Chertoff said Real ID would make the country safer .
" For about $ 8 per license , Real ID will give law enforcement and security officials a powerful advantage against falsified documents , and it will bring some peace of mind to citizens wanting to protect their identity from theft by a criminal or illegal alien , " Chertoff said .
Maine , Montana , South Carolina and New Hampshire are fighting the mandate , saying the rules violate state rights , will cost them billions and intrude on citizens ' privacy rights .
The states are n't alone .
Interest groups ranging from the AARP , the right wing Eagle Forum and the ACLU oppose the rules , and Homeland Security 's own outside privacy advisers explicitly refused to endorse Real ID as " workable or appropriate " in 2007 .
In February , New Hampshire asked for the extension , but also said that the request is " not an indication of our state 's intent to comply with the Real ID final rule . "
In 2007 , New Hampshire lawmakers passed , and Democratic governor John Lynch signed , a law banning New Hampshire from complying with Real ID .
So far , DHS has not accepted New Hampshire 's request for an extension .
DHS says that it is committed to rejecting the rebel states ' driver 's licenses as acceptable proof of identification come May 11 .
DHS spokesman Russ Knocke told Threat Level two weeks ago that citizens need to lay the blame for any inconveniences on their state officials and suggested the residents apply for passports now .
Keehner reiterated that that there " will be real consequences for states whose leadership chooses not to comply . "
For instance , showing up with a driver 's license at the airport " will be the same as showing up with no license currently , " Keehner said .
She added that Secretary Chertoff held a conference call today with a number of governors to talk about Real ID , and that included Governor Mark Sanford of the rogue state of South Carolina .
The group is " working together on going forward , " Keehner said .
Bill Scannell , a spokesman for the Identity Project which is fighting Real ID , questioned whether DHS can keep its hard line if California joins the mix .
" California has stated quite clearly they do not intend to comply with Real ID , " Scannell said .
" It begs the the question : Will DHS be playing hardball with the big 40 - ton gorilla California in the same way it has been slapping around little tiny New Hampshire ?
Their issues are the same . "
The letter from California comes a little more than a week after Assembly member Pedro Nava , the head of the Transportation committee in the California legislature , introduced a resolution calling on California 's congressional crew to rewrite the rules because they were too expensive and privacy invasive .
Update :
This story was changed substantially after DHS spokeswoman Laura Keehner said that the letter would not lose California 's extension .
The original version relied on the presumption that it could .
